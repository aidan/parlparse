Any proposals that the Government bring forward will be fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

With 3 billion e-mails&#151;that is, 35,000 every second&#151;18 million internet connections and 57 billion text messages a year, does he think that this is really likely to prove the most effective way of fighting terrorism, given that the estimated cost will be up to &#163;12 billion?

Communications data are the data of when someone uses their phone, whom they phone, the number that they phone and, probably, where they are. This is all stuff that all the companies keep. It is there today. It is actually sitting there on all their files on every one of us. Whenever we use a mobile phone, the data are there, and this has helped us on a number of occasions. In fact, it has helped on more than a number of occasions; 95 per cent of serious crime cases use these sorts of data to help to pin people down. In the murder of Holly Wells, for example, exactly such data enabled us to get hold of the person involved. They helped to get the murderer of Amelie Delagrange, and the Suffolk strangler. All these things come about because these data are held and we have access to them. We are not proposing that data that have never been collected are held; the question is how in the future, with all the changes that are coming, we can still have access to something that we regularly use today for serious crime and for counterterrorism.</p>

The changes are being made because we are ahead of probably everywhere in the world in terms of moving to these new protocols. Organisations such as BT are doing this because it will save them a huge amount of money. They will be charging and transferring data on a totally different system. Exactly how quickly that will come in is difficult to predict, but it will be complete by about 2011-12. That is the sort of timescale we are looking at. There will be a progressive degradation if no one keeps these data. The whole point of our consultation is to look at the options. We have made no decisions as yet on which way to go and we are aware of all the complexities. But it would be a terrible mistake to lose all these data that we have had the use of for years and not be able to prosecute some very nasty and unpleasant people.</p>

I am very happy to do more in terms of presenting what the problems are. Part of our consultation is exactly that; namely, pointing out the emerging problem, the difficulty, the data that we are beginning to lose, the capability gaps we want to address, how we should move forward and the possible solutions. I am sure all noble Lords would agree that it would be a terrible mistake for us to lose these data which are used with regard to 95 per cent of crimes and help to pin down some very unpleasant people. They are already there. Clearly, we have to look after data. We have to look after exactly what is collected and how it is held. Should it be held in a central database? How will it be done?

I did not make that clear enough, although I tried. Communications data are not about the content. They are purely to do with the billing information, which is crucial when someone is lying about when or where they have used their phone. They enable the police to pin people down when they say, &#147;I was never in this region. I never did this&#148; and we know jolly well that they did. More information is needed, but this does not apply to the content. The content is covered by intercept, which is and always will be dealt with in a very different way.</p>

We are trying very hard. We would like to go ahead with that and ensure that we can use intercept as evidence, but we have to be absolutely sure that we protect our ability to gain certain types of data. Those are the tests as recognised by Chilcot. We are moving through a sequence of checking these out. If we cannot protect that, having used the abilities we have had for 43 years in war and peace, to give those abilities away to people who would cause damage to us would be a terrible mistake. I hope that we will be able to do it, but we have to be absolutely certain. We cannot lose that ability which gives us an edge on people who would do harm to us.</p>

There is an issue of local councils using legislation incorrectly, and we have now given them guidance to stop that happening. It is true that we need to look carefully at how it is used. To lose something that we are used to using for serious crime and terrorism, which has been crucial, would be a very silly mistake, and we should not do it.</p>

Perhaps I can help him by saying that the original announcement on behalf of Shell that it had withdrawn was countermanded later the same day by a statement that was very ambiguous. It said not that it was withdrawing, but that it had not yet completed negotiations for the sale of arrays in this country that would have meant it had withdrawn. It also said that it was dissatisfied by its array in Blackpool lying in the flight path of the airport. Have the Government done anything to address that problem on its behalf? A similar set of complaints arises from BP, which even more unfortunately withdrew a few days later&#151;a far bigger calamity&#151;because it does not have the same fiscal advantages here as in the USA.

There are only 60 days in the North Sea when the weather makes that possible, and we have only one barge that can put up these wind generators. Would it not be better if the Government looked to some other renewable sources of energy and ceased to place so much emphasis on offshore wind?</p>

The third competitive round of bids for development rights to build offshore is under way. I understand the question of barges, and the Government are working with industry on that, but we have just overtaken Denmark as the world leader in offshore; surely it is good to invest in that area.</p>

Is he aware that, since the violence, 50,000 people have had to flee to camps? I visited those camps recently and witnessed appalling conditions of overcrowding with a lack of medical care, food and adequate sanitation. The people there told us that they dare not go back to their homes because those who perpetrated the violence have still not been apprehended. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government urge the Government of India, a country which is widely respected as a democratic nation and a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to put pressure on the Government of the state of Orissa to ensure that the security of all their citizens is adequate to enable them to return to their homes as soon as possible?</p>

The noble Lord will know that they came in under the Freedom of Religion Act, 1967, and Orissa was the first state in India to enact it, although it was not implemented for 22 years. It bars conversion by means of inducement, allurement or the use of force. It is considered by many to be at the root of some of what has recently happened in Orissa, but this is a matter for the Indian Government. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, said, India is at heart a great democratic country. We should be very proud of it.</p>

While a house remains unsold, the inheritance tax due on it can be paid in instalments for up to 10 years.

I am asking for more help given the present circumstances. Does he agree that it is a vicious cycle that you cannot sell your asset until you have the grant of probate, but you cannot get the probate until the inheritance tax is paid, so you may well need to borrow in order to pay the inheritance tax and to get the probate? Then, when you are heavily in debt, you may be unable to sell but are paying heavy interest on a valuation which, according to all the top accountants, is being assessed at a price which reflects those at the top of the market and does not allow for the current drop in values. In some cases, people who lived in homes with their parents are being forced to sell those homes, or be badly in debt. What happens if it reaches the point where you have paid out so much in interest and borrowing that even if you get that money back after the four-year period, it does not cover all the interest you have had to pay to whoever lends you the money, if you can borrow it?</p>

The individuals concerned can delay the payment of inheritance tax. I appreciate the point that the noble Baroness makes about falling house values, but the Inland Revenue is not in the business of dispossessing people of the houses they have inherited in which they are still living. The Inland Revenue, of course, adjusts its values to the level at which houses are sold. It is for the personal representative to make the case that the price the house has achieved is below the valuation price on which inheritance tax was charged, and to claim a refund.</p>

This year the Valuation Office Agency has a key performance indicator of increasing its inheritance tax yield of 5 per cent&#151;5 per cent per unit of cost, 5 per cent per person. Does the Minister agree that that KPI is making it more difficult for executors to agree realistic values with the Valuation Office and that the KPI should be suspended for the rest of this year?</p>

However, it works within very clear rules as regards charging inheritance tax: first, as I indicated, the Inland Revenue is not in the business of dispossessing householders of the houses that they have inherited; secondly, inheritance tax can be deferred; and, thirdly, the current rate at which inheritance tax is paid, if deferred, is 3 per cent.

This shortened version spells out the substance of the amendment as I see it, and I had hoped that it might have been agreed in time for Third Reading. That has not proved possible. The noble Lord needs more time, and of course I accept and understand that. I will not divide the House on the amendment. At least this amendment at Third Reading gives the noble Lord the opportunity to say again what the Government intend to do about this proposal. I live in hope that he will be able to find a slot for it, perhaps in some forthcoming criminal justice Bill but, at any rate, during the next Session. I beg to move.</p>

The safeguard that the noble and learned Lord proposes in the substance of his proposal must be right. I very much hope that my noble friend will be able to respond in a constructive spirit.</p>

We accept that there is a need for an independent commissioner for terrorist suspects. It is a lot more difficult actually to achieve these things than when one is an admiral achieving something in the Navy. Trying to get all the people together, and trying to get them to agree to all the various bits and pieces, whether it is the Crown Prosecution Service, what exactly happens in Scotland and Northern Ireland, whether we need something in the regions, aspects of the judiciary; there are a whole raft of things to be debated. Although initially, being a slightly hasty naval type, I thought we should be able to get something down, I accept that it is important that we do not legislate in haste and do not get this wrong.</p>

It is an important measure, and it is an issue that the Government believe is of value. Certainly, even if some people do not think it is, the perception is very important, and it is of value. I give a commitment that we will do something. I cannot promise exactly which bit of legislation we will fit it into. If I did so, I would probably get it wrong. We are absolutely committed to doing something, and on that basis I ask for the amendment to be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0811175000127"></a>My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 5. I will speak also to government Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 10,  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_933"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 933</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>15, 16, 17, 18 and 19. Last week, we had a good discussion on the provisions to which these amendments relate. I thank your Lordships for the constructive and helpful manner of that debate which was particularly useful given the importance of these measures and the unfortunately brief time your Lordships have had to consider these provisions. As these amendments mainly concern issues outlined in our previous discussion, many of which were first raised by noble Lords on the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Benches, I will attempt to be brief.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0811175000128"></a>Amendment No. 5 seeks to remove from the application of Clause 65 the order-making power in paragraph 8 of the schedule which enables the Treasury to alter the definition of persons operating in the financial sector, and to whom it could therefore give directions, and the order-making power in paragraph 28(6) of the schedule which provides for appeals to be made to the VAT, Financial Services and Markets, or Consumer Credit Appeals Tribunals rather than to the first-tier or upper tribunals to manage the transitional process here. The effect of this amendment is that challenges to orders made under paragraph 8 and paragraph 28(6) will be subject to the normal judicial review procedure rather than to the procedure in Part 6 of the Bill. I hope your Lordships will agree that this is a more appropriate procedure given the nature of such orders.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0811175000129"></a>Amendment No. 8 seeks to address a point that was raised in the 15th report of this Session of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in relation to these provisions. Specifically, the committee recommended that the order-making power provided for in paragraph 8 of the schedule should be more explicit in its intention to allow for purely technical adjustments of the definition or be made subject to the affirmative rather than the negative resolution procedure. I said on Report that I would give careful consideration to the committee&#146;s recommendations. I appreciate the efforts of the committee to scrutinise our provisions at short notice as well as the useful part its members and ex-members played in our previous debate. This amendment seeks to address the committee&#146;s recommendations by now providing for an affirmative order in this case. I thank my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey for raising this matter.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0811175000130"></a>Amendment No. 9 provides for an explicit requirement on the Treasury to apply these powers proportionately, according to the risks that they are seeking to address. This requirement was discussed on Report and the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, was keen to see it addressed in the Bill. As I have previously assured noble Lords, proportionality is an important requirement for the operation of any administrative order of this type and I am happy to recognise this explicitly in the legislation.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0811175000131"></a>I will briefly take Amendment No. 18 out of order as it similarly addresses another matter that I consider essential to the proper and effective use of these powers&#151; the production of guidance for industry on their implementation. Such guidance by industry bodies and supervisors plays a valuable role in our current anti-money-laundering regime. As with the previous amendment, the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, was rightly concerned that the Treasury should assist  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_934"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 934</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relevant bodies to produce this guidance. I have assured the noble Baroness that this would be the case&#151;it is, after all, in our interests to ensure that it is as simple as possible for business to implement our directions&#151;but I am happy to accommodate such a requirement directly in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0811175000132"></a>Amendment No. 10 substitutes &#147;undertake&#148; for &#147;take&#148; in line 18, thereby ensuring consistent terminology throughout the provisions. This reflects the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, on Report. I thank him for his observation.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0811175000133"></a>Amendment No. 15 simply leaves out lines 27 and 28 on page 101 of the Bill, thereby removing a typographical error which had made its way into the provisions.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0811175000134"></a>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are moved in response to the issues which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, helpfully raised on Report on behalf of the Liberal Democrats and in relation to provisions in paragraph 34(1) of the schedule which replicated those of Clause 29 of the Bill concerning jurisdiction over offences. As I undertook on Report, these amendments alter those provisions so that they now apply only to offences committed outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0811175000135"></a>The final amendment I am concerned with today, Amendment No. 19, is merely intended to clarify the situation regarding the use of any penalties received by the FSA in its supervisory role. As is standard, and as is the case for the FSA&#146;s other supervisory actions under the money-laundering regime, this amendment provides for any penalties received to be applied against expenses incurred in connection with its functions. This provision also reflects the position in respect of penalties imposed by the FSA under its powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which must be applied for the benefit of authorised persons.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0811175000136"></a>I hope I have sufficiently explained all the amendments. I believe that, save the odd minor adjustment, they all reflect issues and concerns that were recognised on Report. I hope noble Lords agree that they will all usefully improve the provisions and that they can support them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0811175000141"></a>The noble Baroness expressed concern about whether the definition of premises in the clause was sufficiently tightly worded and in particular whether the wording, at least in theory, gave the police powers to search premises that were no longer connected with the controlled individual in any way. Although the noble Baroness acknowledged that it did not seem likely that the police would undertake an inappropriate search, we agreed to see whether the drafting of the relevant powers could be improved to ensure the desirable clarity in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0811175000142"></a>We believe that Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 will deliver that clarity by amending the definition of premises in new Sections 7A and 7C of the 2005 Act. The new definitions will allow entry to three categories of property: the controlled person&#146;s place of residence; other premises that the controlled person is required to grant access to as part of the control order obligations; and any premises to which the controlled individual was required to grant access to in the past and with which there is reason to believe that the controlled person is or was recently connected.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0811175000143"></a>The key difference between this formulation and the one currently in the Bill is the addition of the explicit requirement that, for past premises, there must be reason to believe that there is or was a recent connection between the controlled person and the premises. That formulation will cover any premises which, for example, are still occupied or owned by a relative, friend or other associate of the individual or property that the controlled individual left only recently. However, it will not cover premises that were occupied by the controlled individual but which are now occupied by a member of the public with no connection whatever with the controlled individual. We think that this is a good amendment and we thank the noble Baroness for her intervention on that point. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0811175000152"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am disappointed that the Government should treat Parliament in the way that they did last week when they added a massive amendment on Report. New Schedule 7, which my amendment relates to, consists of 23 pages of fresh legislation that is only tangentially related to the Bill. It is extremely technical and needs detailed discussion in Committee. That would have given the House a proper opportunity to hear representations from interested parties on the amendment. There was a mere one and a half hours of debate with six speakers, including the Minister and the two noble Lords from the Opposition Front Benches. This is no way to legislate. It is an insult to the democratic process. I personally regret that those on the Opposition Front Benches seem to have yielded to government pressure on the method that was used. I totally acquit the noble Lord, Lord West, on this action. The schedule was grafted on to his Bill and we all support his Bill, especially after the improvements which have already been made in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0811175000153"></a>This sort of thing will not happen in the United States under President-elect Obama. Among his other great qualities, he is a brilliant constitutional lawyer and has a huge respect for constitutional proprieties. Indeed, I was told last night by one of his Democrat colleagues that he places the maintenance of the American constitution second only to his wife and children in his priorities.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0811175000154"></a>Playing fast and loose with the constitution has been one of the major failings of the Bush Administration; it is also one of the major failings of this Government. What could and should the Government have done? To delay this Bill would not have been sensible. The obvious alternative would have been to introduce a separate Bill. Twenty-three pages of complicated legislation is quite enough for a separate Bill. It could then have been given whatever priority the Government&#146;s business managers thought appropriate.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0811175000155"></a>What was the great rush? The Minister did not give a convincing explanation last week. He referred to a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, a body which most people have never heard of. Those of us who serve on Sub-Committee F of the EU Select Committee, however, will learn a lot because we are about to embark on a detailed study of the problems of money laundering in relation to EU directives.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0811175000156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Myners, wanted the 34 members of FATF to take further preventive action on money laundering, terrorist financing and what the Minister described as proliferation financing. He never actually

It actually means finance which could be used to develop chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. It shows the attitude of the Treasury to your Lordships&#146; House that it did not think it necessary to put a clear explanation of it in the Minister&#146;s speech last week.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0811175000157"></a>I have now read the FATF statement on the 16 October meeting, which was put forward as the need for this hurry. It refers only to potential problems with Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Northern Cyprus. It is perfectly clear that there is no such urgency as to justify this treatment of Parliament. The real clue was when the noble Lord, Lord Myners, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="0811175000364"></a>&#147;The UK has been and will continue to be at the forefront of the international call for action and efforts to protect the international system from these threats&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/11/08; col. 579.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000337"></a>For a cosmetic advantage, the Government are prepared to steamroller this schedule through Parliament. I wish they would adopt that old Latin tag, esse quam vidire&#151;to be rather than to seem to be. There are probably many imperfections in this hastily drafted schedule, and indeed the Minister has been seeking to correct some of them this afternoon. The one I am putting forward is on the powers of entry.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0811175000158"></a>Earlier this year my noble friend Lord Selsdon took through his excellent Bill to limit the greatly extended use of powers of entry without warrant. It received its Third Reading in your Lordships&#146; House on 17 July. The Government gave the impression that they were sympathetic to my noble friend&#146;s Bill. Indeed, we were told that the Prime Minister himself was keen to correct the overuse of entry without warrant and that they would consider their own Bill for this purpose. Perhaps the Prime Minister is even considering including it in the gracious Speech. Well, in this schedule they have produced a prime example&#151;perhaps I should say a sub-prime example&#151;of the need for such a Bill. The power in paragraph 20 to enter without a warrant, which I seek to remove, demonstrates how this whole schedule has been hastily cobbled together from other bits of legislation. I shall give one example. Paragraph 18 lists those who have powers of entry into any business premises without a warrant&#151;we should bear in mind what the object of the schedule is&#151;including at sub-paragraph (2)(e), &#147;a local enforcement officer&#148;. For the avoidance of doubt, sub-paragraph (3)(a) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="0811175000365"></a>&#147;A &#145;local enforcement officer&#146; means ... an officer of a local weights and measures authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000338"></a>I can imagine Mr Entry, a Suffolk County Council local enforcement officer, calling on my local butcher in Wickham Market and saying to him, &#147;Mr Revett, I have not come to check the weight or shape of your excellent sausages this morning, but you have never revealed the secret formula which makes them so delicious and sought-after throughout East Anglia and beyond. Well, Mr Revett, some powerful people in Whitehall&#151;I am not at liberty to mention their names, of course&#151;have suggested that they might contain proliferation finance. I don&#146;t rightly know what that

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0811175000159"></a>Let us improve the schedule in a small way by sweeping away paragraph 20 and leaving the Government with paragraph 21 which contains all the powers of entry they could possibly need, and probably many more. But at least they would have to use a magistrate to determine whether their desire for entry makes any sense under this law. I beg to move.</p>

I did not wish to do so in this Bill, but by some strange act of cunning, new powers of entry have suddenly appeared to go with the 1,137 powers of entry that have so far been identified. I thought that I had reached an agreement with the noble Lord, Lord West, that this Bill, which is passing through the House with great support, would not push this matter to the limit, but that jointly with the Home Office we would sit down and identify all the Bills that give powers of entry for an official to go into a person&#146;s premises and search, seize and effectively spy without a warrant.</p>

<a name="81117-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0811175000161"></a>I have a problem in that I do not want to oppose the Bill, but the moral feeling within me says that I cannot possibly support yet another power of entry without warrant without going through the process that I thought we had agreed with the noble Lord, Lord West. I ought to declare an interest because with the help of the Home Office, we have set up a mixed public and private Bill team that is gradually identifying more and more powers of entry from different ministries. Responses to the questions I have asked over time reveal that the problem is that government departments do not know what their powers of entry are. The Home Office team, a good one, is trying to find them out. I spoke to a member of the team the day before yesterday to say that I was going to be almost forced to intervene in this matter, and he said that the team was getting on but was still failing to get responses from various government departments about what those powers of entry are. I shall not repeat the concept of the Bill or its details, but I refer noble Lords to the enormous schedule that was produced jointly with the Government. All we said was that there should be a code of conduct when people seek to go into people&#146;s premises, and that they should not go in without a warrant or a court order, except by agreement and during certain periods of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0811175000162"></a>It pleases me much that the President of the Board of Trade is in his place because he will be well aware that the original council of trade became the Board of Trade. In 1918, when there were certain rules for co-operation and regulation, these matters were discussed. In 1702, the Bishop of London became a member of the council of trade; he was later replaced by the Archbishop of Canterbury. I am proposing to introduce a new Bill to reintroduce the Board of Trade because it had within it all His&#151;or Her&#151;Majesty&#146;s Secretaries of State, members of the Privy Council and others.

I feel much more relaxed knowing that the President of the Board of Trade is in this House. He is the supreme arbiter and has the right to call upon those people to deliver the information we require.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="0811175000366"></a>&#147;An officer may exercise powers ... only if the information or document sought to be obtained as a result is reasonably required in connection with the exercise by the enforcement authority for whom the officer acts of its functions under this Schedule&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000339"></a>For which enforcement authority does the officer of a local weights and measures authority act? Is it, under Clause 18(1), the Financial Services Authority? I would not have thought so. Is it the Commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs? I would not have thought the local weights and measures authority would have anything to do with them. Is it the Office of Fair Trading? Possibly, but in what circumstances is it envisaged that it would be involved in terrorist financing and money laundering? Is this not just a wide spread of powers without any thought about the circumstances those powers can be used in? I look forward to hearing an explanation from the Minister about exactly what the Government have in mind.</p>

I drew attention to the minutes of the meeting of that task force in October and anticipated likely developments at its next meeting early next year. I pointed out that we felt that the change in the constitution and character of the group meant that, at times, we would not necessarily wish to await a decision by the FATF, but would want certain powers to move unilaterally.</p>

First, it is consistent with our attempt to replicate the compliance and enforcement procedures that currently exist in regard to our anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist financing regime. We have been eager to achieve as much consistency with this regime as possible, which would help firms and supervisors in management of compliance. Secondly&#151;and importantly&#151;the ability of enforcement officers to enter without a warrant could be useful in the successful investigation and enforcement of breaches of directions. We checked that supervisors wish to retain their existing range of enforcement powers for these new provisions, and have acted on this basis. It was considered necessary to have a full range of powers, given the risks involved in terrorist financing, money laundering and proliferation.</p>

<a name="81117-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0811175000168"></a>I have no desire to take unnecessary powers, but entry without a warrant may be necessary&#151;for instance, in circumstances where giving notice might result in the destruction of relevant documents or important evidence. It is also worth highlighting that this enforcement power cannot be used as a supervisor sees fit, but is subject to the important safeguard that it may be employed only if the information sought is reasonably required in connection with the exercise by the enforcement authority of its functions. I believe that that should provide protection for the butchers of East Anglia.</p>

<a name="81117-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0811175000169"></a>In addition, I note that the power to enter premises without a warrant is not unusual in legislation, as the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, advises us. Similar examples can be found, to list a few, in Section 162 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, Section 118C of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and Section 14 of the Food Standards Act 1999.</p>

I think that the only one that he has so far given is if the person in question was on the point of destroying a document. Is that the only reason that the noble Lord has?</p>

I believe that that right would be necessary in many circumstances which it is difficult to be precise about. It is in the nature of acting in an enforcement relating to terrorism, proliferation or money-laundering that one may have to move very swiftly. As was explained on Report, that is why we propose the powers. We would not wish them to be used lightly, but there are circumstances where we feel that the threat is such that it is appropriate to have them.</p>

Unfortunately, this is Third Reading, so that would be absolutely useless. Perhaps he could tell the House how one can appeal against a right of entry when the entry is actually being effected, because that will often be the first time that the householder knows about it. There is no time for an appeal.</p>

The 16 October minute, which I read and he has read, but most people will not have read, absolutely does not suggest that this legislation need be attached to this Bill. It could perfectly well have been attached to another Bill, which the business managers could have made as fast as they wished. It could then have been subject to proper scrutiny by Parliament. That is point 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0811175000187"></a>Point 2&#151;there is no way in which I am seeking to deny the Government powers of entry. They have got it all under paragraph 21 of the schedule. The Minister makes no sense at all saying that having powers of entry without a warrant would make it less likely that someone could destroy the evidence, unless you are suggesting that the magistrate tips off somebody, &#147;I have just signed a warrant for someone to enter your premises&#148;, which would be absurd. The Government say that they already have all these powers in other legislation to do with money-laundering, but the whole point of the Bill of my noble friend Lord Selsdon was that there were far too many powers of entry without warrant. We understood that the Prime Minister himself had said that he wanted to reduce them. Here the Government slip in another one, in a shoddy manner, because it is cobbled together. There is no defence for the weights and measures chap. I wish the Minister would be honest about that&#151;sorry, I did not mean to use that word. The Treasury Box obviously has been unable to produce any conceivable case where Mr Revett would be an appropriate target. I must test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;First, Mr Speaker, I am sure that the whole House will join me in sending our profound condolences to the family and friends of the three servicemen killed in Afghanistan in the past week. They were Marines Neil Dunstan and Robert McKibben from the UK Landing Force Command Support Group, and Colour Sergeant Dura of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles. We owe them and all those who have lost their lives in conflict a huge debt of gratitude.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;With permission, I should like to make a Statement on the Washington Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy&#151;the first ever G20 leaders summit&#151;which I attended this weekend with my right honourable friend the Chancellor.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In just over six months, the world has seen a 40 per cent collapse in global share values; global financial institutions write off losses approaching $1,000 billion; world oil prices peaking at nearly $150 dollars a barrel and then sinking 60 per cent; and a fall in global expectations for growth in the world&#146;s industrialised countries from 2.5 per cent in 2007 to below zero, with all the impact on families and businesses with worries about mortgages, jobs and family security in Britain and around the world. What has made this a fully worldwide crisis is that in recent weeks a problem that started in America has extended to emerging markets and developing countries, some of which are facing bankruptcy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;These unprecedented global events call for unprecedented global action. While the economic problems of the 1970s created the G5 and then the G7, it is right that for the first time leaders from developed, emerging and developing economies, which are responsible for 85 per cent of global GDP, met and agreed on the urgency of common and concerted, and, where appropriate, co-ordinated actions to address the financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;To put the long-term challenge in context in the next 20 years it is expected the world economy will double in size, which will mean a doubling of opportunities for British business and new opportunities for British workers and families. But  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_946"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 946</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to make the transition to, and secure the benefits of, an open and inclusive globalisation, we have to deal with three other consequences that it brings: the need for restructuring of industries and services to reflect the new global division of labour, not least resulting from the rise of Asia; increased competition for resources as long-term demand for oil, food and commodities from the newly emerging economies threatens to outstrip supply; and, now that we have global flows of capital, the need to ensure a global framework for financial services as a precondition of prosperity and security, as epitomised by the sub-prime crisis that started in America. At the root of the banking crisis was a failure by banks to manage risk, understand increasingly complex and opaque financial products and to make transparent a developing shadow banking system.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In Washington we agreed, first, on fundamental reform of how the financial system is supervised around the principles that Britain has been promoting&#151;of transparency and accountability, responsibility, better banking practice, integrity and international co-operation, including establishing international colleges of regulators; bringing transparency to tax havens by including them within the scope of the financial system;  convergence of accounting standards; reviewing executive compensation schemes that encourage excessive and irresponsible risk-taking; disclosure of toxic assets; and reform of credit-rating agencies.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We set a clear timetable, tasking our finance Ministers to prepare immediate measures for implementation by 31 March and to report back on progress with the full action plan at the next meeting. The summit also agreed that recapitalising the banks was the right course of action. The action taken in the UK to buy shares in banks has now been followed on every continent, and guarantees have been introduced to allow banks to raise the money needed to continue to support the real economy, as they must, through lending to businesses and families.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Secondly, we agreed that, against a background of deteriorating economic conditions worldwide, a broader policy response was needed immediately, based on closer macroeconomic co-operation. Importantly, we made clear that within our commitment to fiscal sustainability this broad and international policy response needed to encompass both monetary and fiscal policy action.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;While it is for independent central banks to make their own decisions, we recognised the importance of monetary policy to the restoration of growth. While some have contended that it was impossible to cut interest rates in Britain because of the fiscal position, in fact the Bank has now, in two successive months, made two cuts worth 2 per cent in total, and the governor has stated clearly that there is scope for further action. A measure of the level of international co-operation that has already resulted is the extensive currency swaps put in place between central banks and the co-ordinated cut in interest rates across Europe, Asia and America a few weeks ago.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This imperative is international. In recent days, China, South Korea, Australia and Germany have joined other European countries, including Spain and France, in considering new fiscal stimulus packages. The European Union has already said that flexibility in the stability and growth pact to recognise exceptional and temporary conditions will be used, and President-elect Obama has already stated that a new fiscal stimulus package in the US is both necessary and urgent. Most previously published forecasts assumed the absence of co-ordinated fiscal action, but the downturn can be shorter and less deep if Britain takes action and if that action is matched elsewhere.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;It is of course for individual countries to make their own announcements, as we will in due course. The more co-ordinated the action, the greater the benefit to each country will be. However, I believe that the emerging consensus across the world, from the IMF itself, from Governments of left and right and in developed and developing countries, is that we should take rapid, co-ordinated and concerted action through the use of budgetary measures.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Over the past year, the central problem facing the global and the UK economies was inflation, driven by a sharp rise in international commodity prices, allied to a credit crunch, which left fewer options for Governments. This year, the reality is sharp falls in commodity prices while the credit crunch is leading to contractions in bank lending and in consumer demand. The risk in this new environment is not now stagflation but rather the impact of close-to-zero inflation. It makes sense for the Government to support interest rate cuts with fiscal action. I believe that, in addition to the announcements already made, in the next few weeks we will see many countries following with expansionary measures founded on this agreed international position.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The third central message of the summit is that in taking action we must resist all forms of protectionism. These threaten to slow down and eventually stall world trade and thus deny us the benefits of one of the great engines of new growth. So, uniquely, all nations signed an agreement that over the next 12 months they will resist pressure and refrain from raising new barriers to investment or trade.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The key to confidence in open trade is of course the signing of the Doha world trade agreement, on which talks have stalled since the summer. We cannot allow this impasse to continue. I welcome today&#146;s new agreement, following Saturday&#146;s summit, to work towards a ministerial meeting in December. To ensure that the trade round truly is a development round that benefits the poorest countries, it will be

In discussing issues facing poorer countries, the summit reaffirmed the importance of meeting the millennium development goals and, even amid the necessity of dealing with the financial crisis, the importance of applying the same common purpose to the challenge of meeting these goals. Some have argued that as long as the trade talks remain deadlocked on specific issues no deal can be agreed, but the G20 was explicit about the action that we have to take. For the first time, we have instructed our trade Ministers to agree, by the end of the year, the outlines needed for a successful conclusion to the Doha round.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Finally, the G20 leaders have also agreed that the next summit will allow us to review and to make decisions on the wholesale reform of the international economic architecture, built in 1945 but no longer adequate for the challenges of 2008. In agreeing the need to reform our international financial institutions to meet the challenges of the global age, we also set down agreed changes that we believe are essential to effective reform, including a greater voice and representation for the emerging and developing countries; an urgent expansion, with a broader membership, of the financial stability forum; and better identification of vulnerabilities and anticipation of potential stresses, with swifter action in crisis response&#151;all to be delivered by the expanded financial stability forum in collaboration with the IMF.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The IMF's ability to assist countries facing problems as a result of the current liquidity shock and the contraction of international capital flows depends on its reserves of &#163;250 billion. We welcomed the announcement from Japan to lend up to $100 billion dollars from its reserves as an interim measure, but that may not be enough. We agreed to review the IMF&#146;s facilities to ensure that it has the flexibility to give countries the help they need. The World Bank agreed that it will make new commitments of up to $100 billion over the next three years to protect the poorest and most vulnerable countries, as well as $30 billion of new facilities with contributions from other donors, specifically to help address problems faced by the private sector as a result of the crisis, including recapitalising banks and providing trade finance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;At this unique moment in our economic history, we are seeing the world come together to find global solutions for the global problems we face. Over the next few weeks, following consultation, Britain, as the incoming chair of the G20 finance Ministers, will lead the preparations for the next summit working alongside the past and future chairs. We will set out the schedule of events, meetings and papers that will take us to the next conference, the date and venue of which will be announced next week.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the run-up to the conference, we will monitor, following the recapitalisation of the banking system, barriers to the resumption of funding, for this summit and the meetings that will follow are about the real challenges of everyday life: the need for

I join her in the Prime Minister&#146;s tribute to the family and friends of those servicemen killed in Afghanistan in the past week.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0811175000199"></a>All too frequently, we now seem to gather to hear Statements about the disastrous consequences of the most imprudent Government-stoked boom this country has ever seen. Since the previous Statement made by the noble Baroness on 20 October, sterling has fallen by 11.4 per cent against the euro and, in the past three months, by 30 per cent against the dollar. More families have had their homes repossessed. Savers have seen their incomes slashed and another 36,000 proud people were forced to sign on for the dole. Only this morning, the CBI forecast a deeper recession and warned that another 1 million people may lose their jobs over the next year. Will the noble Baroness therefore begin her response by apologising to those workers who are now being caught up in the bust that has followed the boom that the Prime Minister engineered?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0811178000001"></a>We hear a lot about the Prime Minister as the saviour of the world. We have had the boasts; is it not now time for the apology to the jobless and the homeless who are suffering as a result of these policies? The IMF says that the British economy will shrink faster than any major economy in the world. Even the European Commission puts our economic prospects in the fourth division with Latvia and Estonia. Can the noble Baroness tell the House&#151;I ask for an explicit answer&#151;whether any responsibility for this recession lies with the Government? Is that a significant amount or nothing at all, or was this recession pit dug entirely abroad?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0811178000002"></a>Before the G20 summit, the spinners in the Government were saying that countries with budget surpluses, such as Saudi Arabia, would put more funds into the IMF. Those in this House with a long memory will know that Labour Governments with deficits know a lot about the IMF. Therefore, can the noble Baroness tell the House what commitments were given by other G20 nations in Washington to provide additional funding to the IMF and other international financial institutions? What is the Government&#146;s latest estimate for the deficit in trade in goods in 2008? Can she confirm that in 2007 it was &#163;89 billion in what was once a proud manufacturing nation? Against this background, does she think that the unprecedented devaluation in sterling we have seen is a benefit or a problem?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0811178000003"></a>At the G20 meeting, there was talk of better regulation of financial services. Judging by what has happened in Britain, they could scarcely be worse regulated than in the system put in place by the Prime Minister in 1997. Will there be another apology for that? Will the noble  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_950"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 950</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness acknowledge the immense importance of financial services to our country? Surpluses and services have offset half the UK&#146;s deficit in goods. While collegiate co-operation is welcome, will she give a clearer assurance that the UK Government will not accept the imposition of external regulation that may strangle the success of the City of London, which is so vital to our national well-being?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0811178000004"></a>I greatly welcome the renewed commitment to the completion of the Doha round. Nothing would do more damage than renewed protectionism. Can the noble Baroness give the House the Government&#146;s latest assessment of the intentions of President-elect Obama on this? Is it not essential that we impress on him how damaging US-first protectionism would be at this juncture? How is this message being transmitted?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0811178000005"></a>We will no doubt discuss a fiscal stimulus at length in the debate on the Pre-Budget Statement that we have been promised. This Prime Minister has taken more money from the British people in taxation than any Chancellor in history. There is general agreement that tax cuts are necessary: the issue is how they should be paid for. We have put forward some carefully funded proposals. We submit that there is waste and space enough in the public sector to provide room for greater efficiencies. The public sector cannot ignore the need to tighten its belt when families and businesses face these pressures day by day. Is it not clear, therefore, that more borrowing now, without knowing where the money is coming from, will inevitably lead to higher taxes later? That is what the Business Secretary admitted this morning when he talked about a medium-term adjustment some years ahead and a structural adjustment later on. Translated from the original Greek, that means tax cuts now, tax rises later. There is not a single family in the country that does not understand that what you borrow now you have to repay. Borrowing has its place, but it is like a drug; if you take too much for too long, it can kill you. So far this year, we have borrowed &#163;100 each month for every man, woman and child in the country. In the Government&#146;s view, is there any ceiling to the current growth in borrowing, including commitments to the nationalised banks, PFI and public sector pensions?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0811178000006"></a>The Business Secretary spoke of a &#147;medium-term adjustment&#148;. What can this mean&#151;higher taxes, spending cuts, printing money and higher inflation? What, my Lords, and when? The Government led us into this, not with the G20 but on their own. They now have a duty to chart the course that will lead us out. I hope that when the noble Baroness responds, she will give us an assurance that she will ask her right honourable friend the Chancellor to set out a clear strategy for repayment of the debt now being undertaken in the Pre-Budget Report next week.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0811178000007"></a>In his Statement, the Prime Minister calls this a,</p>
<ul><a name="0811178000027"></a>&#147;unique moment in our economic history&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811178000024"></a>I call it the mother of all economic crises. Let its father now accept some share of blame for the mess that he has made.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0811178000009"></a>We all recognise that we are in a severe and serious economic crisis that has its roots in the global economy, starting in the United States and spreading across many other countries. In these circumstances, it behoves us to be hesitant about being over-partisan. I followed the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, with puzzlement. He implied that the Conservatives would have been far less committed to free markets and financial capitalism than the Labour Government have been; that they would have wanted to regulate the City more tightly; but that they are resistant to any idea that foreigners should regulate the City more tightly. On the contrary, we on these Benches recognise that, in an international crisis, we need the stronger international co-operation that goes with an open global economy. It has always been a core Liberal principle. We believe in free trade, open markets, and the international institutions and international co-operation that go with them. However, some of us are hesitant about the ambition of our current Prime Minister to undertake, as he said in his Statement,</p>
<ul><a name="0811178000028"></a>&#147;the wholesale reform of the international economic architecture built in 1945&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811178000025"></a>That is a very ambitious and long-term goal. We on these Benches encourage the Government not to raise too high expectations of what is achievable in any group, whether it be eight, 20, 150 or, even worse, 192 or more.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0811178000010"></a>How do the British Government see the adjustment to the rise of these new economies? Is the G8 now dead? Do we expect the G8 to continue meeting under the Italian presidency next year, welcoming the &#147;deeply tanned&#148; new President of the United States? Or do we expect the G8 now to go into a state of suspension? There is reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="0811178000029"></a>&#147;a greater voice and representation for the emerging and developing countries&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811178000026"></a>The <I>Financial Times</I> today notes that this means that we have to recognise the over-representation of European states. It comments that the United Kingdom could give a lead in suggesting that we reduce the representation of European states. Do the Government have a view on the sort of lead that the United Kingdom might take?</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0811178000011"></a>I follow the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, in asking about the contributions that the rising economies are willing to make. The Saudis appear not to have agreed to contribute to the IMF; nor have the Gulf states with their substantial sovereign wealth funds; nor has China with its massive reserves. It would be more useful if they now recognised that with growing representation come growing responsibilities.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0811178000012"></a>There is surprisingly little in the Statement about the contribution that the promotion of global development could make to getting us out of the recession. Kofi Annan had a very good article in the <I>New York Times</I> yesterday on maintaining the commitment to global development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0811178000013"></a>As to immediate measures, we welcome concerted fiscal and monetary measures. It seems to Liberal Democrats correct that Britain should focus on short-term tax cuts and longer term investment in infrastructure. I note with interest that the Conservative Front Bench appears to be against countercyclical fiscal policy&#151;a sort of pre-Keynesian approach to the way in which we should manage things.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0811178000014"></a>We note the European framework for better regulation, in which the United Kingdom has led, and for greater transparency, but we are still a little puzzled about how global supervisory colleges of regulators will work. We note with interest stronger measures on tax havens, on which I shall be brief, since I have a Question on this tomorrow. Half of the world&#146;s major offshore financial centres are under UK sovereignty. We are puzzled to know exactly how we will tackle excessive executive compensation schemes, or within what domestic or international framework the Government anticipate that some change in domestic law will be needed. We welcome the Government&#146;s statement on the importance of finishing the Doha round, and we encourage the Government, with their European partners, to push ahead as far as they can on that.</p>

<a name="81117-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0811178000015"></a>Lastly, we welcome that the United Kingdom will be the chair of the G20 next year, and we hope that they will manage to strike the right balance between constructive leadership and an assertion that we were right and that we are leading the world. We need co-operative leadership for the present moment and not a hint of self-righteousness.</p>

That is absolutely clear from the meeting that took place at the weekend in Washington. Of course, these are most difficult times for those individuals who have lost their jobs. This makes it unbearable for some families, and it makes it very difficult for the economy. That is why we as a government are doing absolutely everything that we possibly can to retain jobs by boosting the economy and to assist those who become unemployed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0811178000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, asked about the recession and asked whether I would apologise for the recession.

No, the UK will not accept external regulation that will strangle the City of London because, like the noble Lord, we recognise the importance of this jewel in our crown.

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0811178000019"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the carefully funded proposals of his party. One could interpret that as meaning no new money, at a time when the people of this country, the economy and the businesses of this country need more money so that we can kick-start the economy. Of course, the borrowing that we must do has to be sustainable, which is exactly what my right honourable friend the Chancellor will make clear in his Pre-Budget Report; he will say how he is going to make that borrowing sustainable. I reflect on the point that, at this time, the noble Lord and his party are not looking at finding any new spending, new tax cuts or at pouring money into the economy; whereas the leadership of the world at the G20 agreed that what was wanted now was precisely a fiscal stimulus.</p>

<a name="81117-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0811178000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, briefly mentioned partisanship. I, too, believe that this is no time for partisan politics and I am delighted that there is not a bipartisan approach in the world. As mentioned in the Statement, Governments throughout the world&#151;left, right, north and south&#151;all agree on the way forward. That is important. The noble Lord also asked about the wholesale reform of institutions. The Prime Minister is trying to keep up the pressure so that the necessary reforms take place. Without that impetus, we may not see the necessary reforms.</p>

<a name="81117-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0811178000021"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the G8 is dead. I do not think so, but at the moment we need the G20 more. That is why the meeting took place at the weekend and why there will be another very welcome meeting in April. Will there be a reduction in EU states in the G20? I do not think so; we will have to wait and see. The important thing is to have the right people around the table. The G20 has the right people around the table with five representatives from the Americas and five from the European Union, so it could be said to be balanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0811178000022"></a>Development issues were covered by the communiqu&#233; and all leaders were conscious of the need not to forget such issues at this difficult time. On better regulation, greater transparency and how the colleges will work, we will have to wait to see how they work in practice. As I understand it, for every financial institution a college of regulators will be drawn from all the regulators in the most important economies in which those institutions work to ensure that there is proper regulation. On excessive bonuses, we do not want beggar-my-neighbour remuneration. We want to ensure that it is agreed around the world that excessive bonuses are anathema and that people are paid the proper rate for the job.</p>

In the absence of the new Administration, it was like inviting us to watch &#147;Hamlet&#148; without the Prince. Is the Minister aware that the biggest problem facing our country is the rise in unemployment, and as fiscal stimulus is now the fashion, could she ask the Chancellor to set out how many jobs are likely to be created by a tax cut of &#163;5 billion, &#163;10 billion or &#163;15 billion? If that sort of money does not create jobs, it is perhaps not the right policy. That issue has to be addressed by the Government.</p>

That is their loss, not ours. The important thing to remember about this summit, notwithstanding the fact that President-elect Obama was understandably not present, is that if we had not started the G20 talks until the end of January with the new Administration, we would be two or three months behind where we are now. Twenty leaders, heads of state and Government, have agreed on 50 action points. They have a route map so they know where they want to get to. As soon as President-elect Obama becomes President, they know where to begin their discussions with him rather that just his transition team.</p>

<a name="81117-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0811175000202"></a>Is the biggest problem unemployment? It clearly is one of the biggest problems. It is interesting to note that while in this country we are losing jobs, which is regrettable, other jobs are being created. I believe that there are just fewer than 600,000 job vacancies on the books at the moment. I may have to reflect on that figure and come back to the noble Lord, but there are many vacancies although, regrettably, people are still losing their jobs. We shall do everything that we can to ensure that more jobs are created.</p>

It was equally instructive to hear the noble Lord, Lord Baker&#151;a veteran of Conservative Cabinets which included a Chancellor who said that higher unemployment was a price worth paying&#151;give us the benefit of his concerns, rightly placed, at the prospect, indeed the reality, of rising unemployment.</p>

Is it not fortunate that the declaration that fast, stimulative fiscal action would bring the collapse of the pound was widely seen to be the desperate, irresponsible exhibitionism which, in truth, it was, derided by mature business and market opinion? Finally, is it not commendable that the energetic and intelligent leadership given by the British Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer is resulting in combined global efforts which have both the realism and the radicalism that current crisis conditions make vital?</p>

It is immensely important for that process to begin now. Does she also accept that we welcome bringing tax havens into more public scrutiny? That is also long overdue. Finally, I suggest, in passing, that she does not worry too much about the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. Throughout the past 50 years, the Conservative Party has been remarkably consistent in talking Britain down when in Opposition and in taking Britain down when in Government.</p>

Given the fact that any Prime Ministers and leaders of Governments have only a limited time, should we not now gently put the G8 to rest? To most of us, it is clear that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor took a lead in that, as on the recapitalisation. A brief, cursory glance of the international press shows the esteem in which the leadership of the Prime Minister is held. By contrast, the utterances of the Shadow Chancellor have the gravitas of a rather young and immature student leader. In the crisis, Denmark has had to rethink its attitude towards entering the euro. Is it my noble friend&#146;s judgment and that of the Government that the current crisis leads to some rethinking, some retilting of the balance of argument in respect of the United Kingdom and the euro?</p>

In the past, the Governor of the Bank of England, who has the responsibility here, has been a little  cautious, to put it mildly, in coming forward with interest-rate cuts when he should have done. Is my noble friend really saying that, if the governor were to revert to his previous cautious position and not cut interest rates further, the Government would not use the powers available to them&#151;the reserve powers in the Bill&#151;that set up the responsibility of the Bank of England? It would be a terrible situation if we left the Bank of England to act without any government responsibility.</p>

<a name="81117-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0811175000235"></a>Amendment No. 1 removes Clause 1, the purpose clause, because we do not think it works in practical terms. Having any measure based on global temperatures means that what we have to do is dependent on what happens elsewhere in the world. While we are fully committed to taking action at home, emission reductions in the UK alone cannot deliver this objective. It is only though global action that we can maximise the chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade. In future, there may be a different way of framing the level of global ambition. To place an explicit reference to the 2 degrees centigrade goal in the Bill would be inflexible and might become irrelevant, especially when one considers the long-term framework that the Bill&#146;s targets and budget establishes.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81117-0007.htm"/>


<a name="81117-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0811175000236"></a>Moreover, the early advice from the shadow Committee on Climate Change made a specific link between 2 degrees centigrade and the level of the 2050 target, which underpins every other action required of us by this Bill. The committee&#146;s advice stated that the target to reduce the UK&#146;s emissions by at least 80 per cent is a reasonable contribution to a global strategy of cutting global emissions by around 50 per cent by mid-century. Reductions on this scale are required to limit the expected global temperature increases to around 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. In proposing to accept the committee&#146;s advice on the level of the 2050 target, we therefore already intend to set our 2050 target in a way that would be consistent with the 2 degrees centigrade goal. We do not, therefore, consider a specific purpose clause to this effect to be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0811175000237"></a>Amendment No. 2 would increase the level of the 2050 target to a reduction of at least 80 per cent. This follows the early advice of the Committee on Climate Change, which I announced we would accept in my Statement to the House on 16 October. By ensuring that the UK&#146;s long-term target is based on the most up-to-date science and on independent expert analysis, we will continue to provide leadership within the international debate. This is particularly important in the context of negotiations for a global and comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen in 2009.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0811175000238"></a>Clause 3 provides a power for the Secretary of State to amend the 2050 target, based either on significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change, or significant developments in European or international law or policy. Currently the developments in scientific knowledge are those since the 2000 report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. We consider that it is no longer appropriate to refer to the royal commission&#146;s 2000 report as our starting point, because the committee has provided advice on the basis of the latest scientific thinking, which we have accepted. Instead, we consider that the passing of this Act should be the reference point, and we propose Amendment No. 4 to effect this change.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0811175000239"></a>Amendments Nos. 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 21 are also in response to the committee&#146;s advice, and have the effect of including the other Kyoto greenhouse gases in the Bill&#146;s targets and budgets. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 concern the level of the target for 2020. As noble Lords will know, on 1 December the committee will provide its formal advice on the implications for the 2020 target of their advice on the 2050 target. We do not think that a change should be made to the 2020 target before we receive this advice, especially as we closely linked the committee&#146;s advice to the first three carbon budgets. We want to ensure that we get the 2020 target right. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would therefore provide for the 2020 target to remain as it currently is; that is, a 26 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions. This recognises that a 26 per cent reduction target that which includes all greenhouse gases, is not as demanding as a target of 26 per cent that includes only CO2. We accept that we will have to amend the target soon to account for the inclusion of the other greenhouse gases. As I have said, we simply do not consider it appropriate to make a change to the 2020 target until we have received the committee&#146;s advice on this issue.</p>

I understand that the House has been through this matter in some detail at earlier stages of the Bill, so the arguments may be familiar. The Government remain of the view that placing duties on the Prime Minister is unnecessary and inappropriate.</p>

The doctrine of collective responsibility means that this is the established mechanism to place a duty on the Government as a whole. Thus, the responsibilities in the Bill&#151;including those for meeting the targets and budgets and for producing reports&#151;are not limited to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0811175000242"></a>We therefore think that it is better to revert to the wording in our amendment. There is no question of our collective commitment to tackle climate change. The fact that we have a new department, which has been set up precisely to create a new focus on tackling climate change, is an indication of that. I assure noble Lords that my colleagues and I, working with the Prime Minister and the rest of Government, are committed to finding sustainable, cost-effective solutions to the twin challenges of reducing emissions and ensuring secure supplies of safe and affordable energy.</p>

Let me say just two things. The first is that, as many noble Lords may know, I have taken an interest in this issue for some time. Indeed, I have even written a book on the subject which, I am glad to say, has already been translated into two European languages and three more foreign editions are on the way. It is possible that I have had slightly more influence in that way on affairs than by speaking in this House. That is not the only reason why I have not spoken previously in this House on the Bill. The other reason is that I felt that it was unbecoming for an unbeliever to take part in a religious service, which is what all this is really about.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0811175000245"></a>Nevertheless, we have the amendments that come back from the Commons to us today. The Bill will go down in history, and future generations will see it, as the most absurd Bill that this House and Parliament as a whole as ever had to examine, and it has now become more absurd with the increase from 60 per cent to 80 per cent. I should like to address as briefly as I can&#151;because I do not propose to speak on any subsequent occasion on this subject&#151; why I think that the Bill is so absurd.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0811175000246"></a>Let us pretend that the planet is warming. We know, of course, that it is not. The figures published each year and, indeed, monthly, by the Met Office or the Hadley Centre, which is a department of the Met Office in association with the climate research unit of the University of East Anglia, show without any doubt that there has been no warming so far this century at all. Some people say that there has been a cooling but, although that has been the slight trend, I think that the margin for error is so great that I would not press that, but there has certainly been no warming. The majority of climate scientists do not think that if there were a warming, it would be a disaster.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0811175000247"></a>Nevertheless, it is possible that warming will resume. The majority of climate scientists believe that warming will resume. I am completely agnostic on that; I do not

Maybe it will, maybe it will not. The complete standstill this century so far was certainly totally unpredicted by all the elaborate computer models that the scientists use. That is not surprising. The climate is an extremely complex system.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0811175000248"></a>What lies behind this? It was implicit in what the Minister said, although he did not spell it out on this occasion, that by taking this massive step of virtually complete decarbonisation of our economy by 2050 in a mandatory way&#151;something that no other country has done for good reason, because no other country has been so foolish, nor do other countries have the slightest intention of going in this way, but I will come to that in a moment&#151;we in the United Kingdom are giving a global lead that other countries will follow.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0811175000249"></a>To understand that, we have to go back briefly to the G8 meeting last year. At that meeting, Europe, led by Germany and the United Kingdom, sought to isolate the United States in its opposition to binding commitments to cut back carbon dioxide emissions by proposing that the whole of the G8 should agree to a 50 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. I can understand why people are not dying to support anything that President George W Bush supports, but the plan to isolate the United States backfired horribly. Europe was isolated when we got to the G8 summit. The other member countries, Japan, Canada and Russia, all accepted the United States&#146; position and therefore there was no agreement on a 50 per cent binding commitment to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Fast forward from that, what has happened? Far from making any headway in persuading the rest of the world, even Europe is now backing off.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0811175000250"></a>I remind the Minister of the original plan, the unilateral European cut. We are committing ourselves to a unilateral cut really, irrespective of what any other country does. After all, we account for less than 2 per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions and that is falling. Therefore, it makes sense only if we can persuade the rest of the world to go along with this.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0811175000251"></a>Even our supporters in Europe are busy backing off. The unilateral cut of 20 per cent by 2020, agreed to by the European Union&#151;with a little teaser that, if the rest of the world joined in, we would go up to 30 per cent&#151;has been completely abandoned. It was never a binding commitment because you can bind only individual member countries and the individual countries of the union had not agreed&#151;we had but the others had not&#151;to go along with their share in the 20 per cent cut. The seven accession states of central and eastern Europe, plus Italy, have now said that there is definitely no way that they are going to go along with this. The European Union has agreed that this should be looked at again. Nothing will happen. It can only be agreed unanimously and will be looked at again in December this year, after the Poznan meeting, which I hope the Minister will grace with his presence. It will be an educational event for him.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0811175000252"></a>Not only have those countries said that they will not go along with it, but Germany has always had a slightly equivocal position, because, in addition to ostensibly being very keen on this policy, it subsidises its coal industry more than the rest of the European Union put together. Indeed that is contrary to European Union law and it has to secure a waiver from European law  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_963"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 963</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to enable it do that, for which it fights to the death, and successfully so far. However, the German Government, have said that energy-intensive sectors must be exempted from the European emissions trading system. Indeed, an official government spokesman said only the other day that we have got to prevent companies being threatened by climate protection requirements. That makes nonsense of the whole policy. If Germany is saying that, the others will go the same way. Therefore, we are in the position of being completely on our own. The point is to get an agreement at Copenhagen, as the Minister said, a successor to the Kyoto agreement which will be about to expire.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0811175000253"></a>The Kyoto agreement called for only a 5 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. So far, there has been at least a 5 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the signatories to the Kyoto agreement, and it is rising all the time. This country&#146;s emissions have been rising steadily ever since this Government took office in 1997. The disparity between the words and the facts is astonishing. We got as close as we did to the Kyoto agreement&#151;which was not very close&#151;only because we in effect outsourced our emissions very substantially to the developing world, in particular India and China. This is because manufacturing industry relies on carbon-based energy to a very high degree, and the industry has migrated to a considerable extent to China and India. This is why China is now the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world&#151;bigger even than the United States.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0811175000254"></a>Given that we could not get close to 5 per cent even while it was possible to outsource emissions, it beggars belief that we think we can get to a 50 per cent reduction by 2050, of which our share will be an 80 per cent reduction, at least&#151;the agreement is meant to include China, India and everyone. There is no way in which we can outsource emissions to Mars, so this must be a real reduction. China and India have said that in no way will they accept this kind of curb on their emissions, and quite rightly so. These countries have a real problem that is very serious for them; they suffer from poverty, malnutrition, disease and premature death on a massive scale. They can get out of that only by the fastest possible rate of economic development, which requires using the cheapest energy that they can find. It might not be for ever, but for now and for the foreseeable future that energy is carbon-based energy. They will not take part in this.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0811175000255"></a>Interestingly, the Indian Government recently received a report from a whole lot of experts who said that climate change presented no threat to India. One of the signatories to that report was Mr Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who is Indian himself. No one who has looked at this seriously and dispassionately thinks that this is a sensible policy. Professor Gwyn Prins of the London School of Economics has written very eloquently on the subject&#151;I am sure that the Minister has read what he has written. He is not a scientist, but he entirely accepts the conventional view of the science. He says simply that this policy is madness and cannot possibly work. He has written two well-argued papers, <I>Time to Ditch Kyoto</I>&#151;which means the whole Kyoto

The United Kingdom is completely isolated in this. What we are seeking to do is absolutely crazy; it will be immensely damaging to the economy as a whole, and to the poorest people in this country in particular, if we carry it through.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0811175000256"></a>Some people may say that I have forgotten the business opportunities from going along the route of non-carbon-based energy. I confess that there are business opportunities. Noble Lords may or may not be aware that there was a conference in London perhaps 10 days ago called &#147;Cashing in on Carbon&#148;. The promoters said of the conference:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="0811175000374"></a>&#147;It is aimed squarely at investment banks, investors and major compliance buyers and is focused on how they can profit today from an increasingly diverse range of carbon-related investment opportunities. The programme features some of the most experienced and respected practitioners in the market and should have very strong appeal to anyone with a stake in this burgeoning market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000340"></a>I am glad to say that among those prominently represented was the group of which the noble Lord, Lord Stern, is deputy chairman. I am sorry that he is not in his place on a Bill of this importance. So the people who gave you the glories and the joys of mortgage-backed securities are now offering the great business opportunity of carbon-backed securities.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0811175000257"></a>I always like to look on the bright side: it is possible that this Bill is not as bad as it might seem on paper. Under the Bill, there is no reason why we need to cut our carbon emissions. We can do it entirely by purchasing emission reduction certificates under the clean development mechanism from China, India or wherever. Although that would be a quite unnecessary transfer of resources to other countries&#151;perhaps they deserve it, I do not know&#151;it would be less costly than trying to cut back carbon dioxide emissions ourselves, which would be immensely more damaging.</p>

<a name="81117-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0811175000258"></a>A number of journalists and other academics have demonstrated the clean development mechanism to be a complete scam. What now happens is elementary economics: if a price is put on carbon dioxide, people will produce it. Various countries are busy producing emission reduction certificates so that they can be sold. The Chinese have done a very good business in this. They are very sharp and very much on the ball. They are now getting huge revenue from the certificates, which have no bearing on the carbon dioxide concentrated in the atmosphere. They are making so much money that the Chinese Government are taxing them in order to help their government revenues, which gives them more money to spend on their massive coal-fired power station programme. That is not only madness, but also highly unpopular.</p>

I say to my own party, in particular, that it should watch and take note of the fact that in both countries this issue was prominent in the debate. There was a rather weak, very shaky minority Conservative Government in Canada. The Liberal Opposition thought that it could come to power with what it called the &#147;green shift&#148;, which really tackled this issue. It was so

Again, they said, &#147;This is the big issue&#148;. Although we may think that it is ridiculous for New Zealand to say that it is giving a global lead, it is no more ridiculous than us saying that. Having an elaborate system to cut back on emissions and having an emissions trading system was so unpopular that the Labour Party lost office. The Conservative Opposition, to their great astonishment, found that they won the election.</p>

The main thing in the Australian election was that the people were sick and tired of John Howard, whom they felt had been there for far too long. It is true that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party said that he would sign the Kyoto agreement. People thought that that was a good idea. I happened to be in Australia at the time of the election and watched people being interviewed on television. The interviewer rather shrewdly asked a lot of people, &#147;Are you in favour of signing the Kyoto agreement?&#148;. A great majority said, &#147;Yes, we are&#148;. The next question was: &#147;Do you know what the Kyoto agreement is?&#148;. They said, &#147;No, we don&#146;t&#148;.

The Government are shrewd in turning the tables on the Conservative Party on the tax issue, deftly jettisoning any idea of prudence and saying, &#147;We are now the party of tax cuts&#148;. As we move closer to the next general election, if it should happen that the Labour Party feels there is a possibility that it might lose it, the Prime Minister will have no hesitation at all in putting this issue on the back burner, saying grave things about other countries not having agreed to it, or the need to look after the economy in these difficult and stressful economic times, thereby leaving the Conservative Party high and dry.</p>

I hope that not merely for our party&#146;s sake but, above all, for the sake of our country, we recognise that this is complete madness.

I was concerned that we would still have 60 per cent while saying that we were going to have something else and so would have the wrong number in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, needs congratulating on the work that he and his committee have done within the timescale, and I welcome the fact that we have the right number in the Bill.</p>

I refer the noble Lord to the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, which, as he will know, reported a few weeks ago. It said that we know more about how rising temperatures will reduce the effectiveness of carbon sinks. It says that, unlike the authors of the report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, we have the benefit of models that include the warming effect of gases other than CO2. It says that the reduction in summer Arctic Sea ice in recent years has been greater than predicted by any of the models, and that the summer melt of the Greenland ice sheet has accelerated. It says that it is now realised that atmospheric pollution has probably masked some of the greenhouse gas warming that would have occurred, so that as air quality improvements continue to be achieved even more warming can be expected. It says that there is now a greater understanding of the range of potential climate change impacts. Finally, the latest global emission trends are higher than anticipated in most IPCC scenarios, largely because of higher economic growth and a shift towards more carbon-intensive sources of energy. It is not unreasonable for the Government to have taken that seriously.</p>

I accept that the challenge we have set ourselves is massive, but I would not underestimate the potential of this country to influence international debate and considerations. I am not pessimistic about the current negotiations, despite the way that he has described them; I am confident that we will move from the EU into discussions towards Copenhagen. This country&#146;s lead will have a powerful impact on our ability to come to international agreement.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="0811175000284"></a>These amendments deal with emissions from international aviation and international shipping, perhaps the most technically complex issue we have had to discuss during the passage of the Bill. Throughout the discussions, the Government&#146;s position has been that it is vital to put in place strong mechanisms for dealing with emissions from international aviation and shipping, but that finding the right way of deciding which of those emissions should be allocated as being the UK&#146;s responsibility is not possible at the moment. The set of amendments on which I seek your Lordships&#146; agreement reflects that position. The amendments would take us as near as is currently possible to including these emissions in the Bill&#146;s targets and budgets, and would also ensure maximum transparency about how we deal with them in the meantime.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="0811175000285"></a>Many contributors have provided valuable views and support in taking forward our thinking on this difficult matter. In particular, the Joint Committee  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_971"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 971</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which scrutinised the draft Bill considered it in great detail, and Members of this House and in the other place put forward proposals. More recently, the views of the shadow Committee on Climate Change have helped to shape the amendments which are being considered today.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="0811175000286"></a>In its interim advice the committee advised that international aviation and shipping emissions should be included in the UK&#146;s efforts to reduce overall emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050, but that they should not be included in the Bill&#146;s targets at this time because of the lack of an appropriate methodology. The committee also recommended that emissions from these sectors should be reflected in its annual reports of progress and should be taken into account in the setting of budgets. This is a comprehensive set of recommendations, and I believe that all of them are provided for in the amendments that I bring before the House tonight, which would do three main things.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="0811175000287"></a>First, Amendments Nos. 12 and 18 would require that emissions from international aviation and shipping must be included in the Bill by 31 December 2012, or that the Government must lay a report before Parliament explaining why that is not the case. That approach is closely aligned with the view previously agreed by this House: the differences are in how we define the emissions and in providing an earlier deadline for inclusion or explanation that aligns with the budget-setting process.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="0811175000288"></a>On defining these emissions, the House recognised that one possible method would be by reference to the transport of goods and passengers. However, there are other potential options for definition, and we do not want inadvertently to rule them out. This is why we are seeking to revert back to the broader language of &#147;international aviation and shipping emissions&#148;, which is established terminology within the UN and EU.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="0811175000289"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 25 would require that the Committee on Climate Change must, when providing its advice on carbon budgets, give its view on the consequences of including emissions from international aviation and shipping within the targets and budgets. Amendments Nos. 28, 31 and 74 are consequential to Amendment No. 25.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="0811175000290"></a>Thirdly, Amendment No. 7 reflects the view, as put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, in his letter to the Secretary of State, that although the right methodology does not yet exist for including these emissions in the carbon budgets, decisions made by the committee or the Government in relation to the budgets must take into account projected emissions from international aviation and shipping.</p>

<a name="81117-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="0811175000291"></a>At Commons Report stage, the Government accepted an amendment which reflected the committee&#146;s view, but on the basis that we would need to discuss the specific drafting with parliamentary counsel. Amendments Nos. 7B and C provide the new, revised version. These amendments would require both the Government and the committee to have regard to projected emissions from international aviation and international shipping in setting, and advising on, carbon budgets, respectively. They also provide that these projections may be estimated using such reasonable methods as the Secretary of State or the committee considers appropriate. I beg to move.</p>

I do not know whether you can table probing amendments at this late stage of the Bill, but I am sure that the Minister will tolerate it. What concerns me, particularly in the case of international shipping, is that a number of studies over the past two years have made clear that the current measurement of emissions, both globally and relating to the UK in particular, underestimate the carbon emissions of the sector. I am not being negative about the shipping sector, because it is a very efficient form of transport in terms of carbon consumption. Indeed, if we could increase shipping at the expense of other forms of transport, we would strongly welcome that. What I seek do in these amendments, rather than leaving the term &#147;reportable&#148; that is vague and suggests adherence to the existing way of calculating these emissions, is to make sure that they are the emissions properly attributable to the United Kingdom. That is clearly what everybody means, but at the moment they are not the current reportable emissions. I would welcome assurance from the Minister on this matter. I beg to move.</p>

We have argued at every stage of this legislation that transparency, and government accountability to the expert opinion of the Committee on Climate Change, are of paramount importance.

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="0811175000298"></a>I understand the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, to government Amendment No. 7, and his reasons for proposing them. I hope that we all agree on the necessity for more fully drafted amendments in lieu, as the Government have put forward this evening. However, it is important to note an area of weakness that is addressed by the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. The government amendment requires &#147;expected reportable emissions&#148; to be taken into account, rather than &#147;expected emissions&#148;. This might sound like pedantry, but I have been made aware that the difference is significant. It is widely accepted that, particularly in the case of shipping emissions, there are weaknesses in the current reporting methodology that lead to the UK figures being significantly underestimated. We are all aware, thanks in part to the many debates in both Houses, that the Government are not in a position to legislate for a specific methodology to be used for the counting of emissions from international aviation and shipping. However, it is not sensible to limit the legislation to a method that is widely accepted to be flawed. We should make the remit flexible enough to include a better projection methodology, if or when one is developed in the future. I thank Friends of the Earth for bringing this issue to my attention and call on the Minister to give the assurances that I have sought from the Government. I beg to move.</p>

They provide an opportunity for the Government to respond to a number of points that are entirely reasonable given the changes that were made in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="0811175000300"></a>The issue of emissions from international aviation and shipping is very important. However, the fact that there is as yet no agreement on how to allocate those emissions means that we have to deal with this matter in a particularly sensitive way. That is the intent behind the government amendments. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that calculating emissions that are properly attributable to the UK is a very important aim. The government amendments would require the committee and the Government to take account of the aggregate of the amounts of emissions of targeted greenhouse gases from international aviation and international shipping that the UK will be required to report for that period, in accordance with international carbon reporting practice.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="0811175000301"></a>The problem that we have with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is the link to the UK. Currently there is no agreement on what proportion of these emissions  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_974"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 974</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is attributable to the UK. This amendment puts us back in the position that we tried to avoid, of the Government deciding unilaterally on an allocation methodology. Our contention is that, while the UK is undoubtedly influential in international discussions relating to these sectors, we are not in a position to dictate how these matters are dealt with. It is important that whatever we do is consistent with international agreements. For that reason, the government amendments use the only internationally agreed way of establishing a link between the UK and emissions from aviation and shipping&#151;the agreed reporting methodology. If the UN reporting requirements change over time, the government amendment is linked automatically to the up-to-date accepted practice. By making the link, we ensure maximum transparency about the approach taken, and consistency with whatever international negotiations provide for.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="0811175000302"></a>It is difficult to envisage a situation in which the UK would not have to report on emissions from international aviation and shipping to the UN or some other international organisation. In the unlikely event that the UK duty to report to the UN on those emissions was discontinued, the Bill has a mechanism to deal with this. We can specify an alternative approach, by making an order under Clause 86, linking the report to any different reporting protocol at European or international level.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="0811175000303"></a>The second paragraph in government Amendment No. 7C would provide that projections might be carried out using,</p>
<ul><a name="0811175000388"></a>&#147;such reasonable ... methods as the Secretary of State or ... the Committee considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000341"></a>That also gives us flexibility. Clause 11(3) already states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="0811175000386"></a>&#147;Nothing in this section is to be read as restricting the matters that the Secretary of State or the Committee may take into account&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000342"></a>For instance, the committee might choose to take a different approach, or international reporting requirements may change. However, that would not preclude consideration of international aviation and shipping emissions in whatever way was considered appropriate.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="0811175000304"></a>I accept that the question of the methodology is very important. In his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, invites the Government to publish the methodology. I hope that I can reassure him on this point. The UK Government already publish projections of future CO2 emissions for international flights from UK airports, and we intend to continue to do so. The previous reports were published in 2004 and 2007, and it is intended that further forecasts will be published on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="0811175000305"></a>In the other place, the Government made a commitment that we will publish at least one forecast of international aviation emissions for each budgetary period sufficient to inform decisions on setting carbon budgets, so the basis of our projections will be perfectly clear. As I have already indicated, the Committee on Climate Change will provide advice in relation to each carbon budget, and that advice is required to take into account all the factors listed in Clause 11 including, if Amendments Nos. 7B and 7C are agreed to, emissions from international aviation and shipping. The committee

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="0811175000306"></a>In setting out proposals and policies for meeting the carbon budget, the Government must explain how those proposals and policies affect different sectors of the economy. In conclusion, the Government have sought to ensure that this is a robust process, within the current uncertainties about developing a methodology, but ensuring that their approach is as transparent as possible. As I have already indicated, if the Government took a different decision to that recommended by the committee, they would have to publish the committee&#146;s advice and they would have to explain why they would take a different decision.</p>

In speaking to this group, I shall also address Amendments Nos. 11, 17, 17A to 17C, 49 and 50.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="0811175000315"></a>There has been substantial discussion during the passage of the Bill about the importance of driving emissions reductions in the UK. The Government agree with this principle, and we have designed the Bill to provide a clear framework for action. Under the Kyoto protocol, developed countries have each been given a maximum allowance, or target, for greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2008-12.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="0811175000316"></a>As noble Lords know, the UK is one of the few countries that is on course to substantially beat its target, but we are keen to make reductions beyond  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those required under Kyoto, and over a longer timescale. That is why we have brought forward the Bill. In trying to achieve deeper cuts, we are also strong supporters of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which sets a cap, separate from the Kyoto limit, for emissions from energy-intensive industry. That cap covers about 50 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in the EU and in the UK.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="0811175000317"></a>Both Kyoto and the EU ETS allow countries and participating companies, respectively, to buy credits from projects to reduce emissions in developing countries that are not subject to a cap. The use of these credits is itself limited in both cases. The idea is that emissions reductions can be made where it is most economically efficient to do so, but that reductions are still very much driven in participating countries too. By supporting projects in developing countries, we are also helping those countries, so that their growing economies are low-carbon from the start. Project credits are subject to close scrutiny by a UN board to provide maximum certainty that they represent genuine emissions reductions.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="0811175000318"></a>Our aim is that the Bill should drive emissions reductions in a way that is consistent with our participation in both Kyoto and the EU ETS. The Bill, with amendments made in the Commons, contains specific provisions that enshrine in law our intention to reduce domestic emissions and provide transparency about what actually happens.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="0811175000319"></a>Clause 34 requires the Committee on Climate Change to advise on the extent to which the carbon budget should be met by action in the UK and by the use of overseas credits. In addition, having set carbon budgets, the Government must develop and publish proposals and policies for meeting them. Amendment No. 9 proposes adding further transparency. It would require that the Government&#146;s report on proposals and policies for meeting budgets, under Clause 14, must set out the implications of those policies for the relative balance between action to reduce UK emissions and the use of overseas credits.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="0811175000320"></a>In addition, Amendment No. 11 would introduce a new clause requiring that, in considering how to meet the long-term target and the carbon budgets, the Secretary of State must have regard to the need for UK domestic action on climate change. That is a clear legal requirement and statement of intent, which for the first time puts into domestic law the need for action here in the UK to reduce emissions.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="0811175000321"></a>Clause 25 would set in the Bill a minimum level of domestic effort in meeting budgets; in other words, a flat maximum for the use of carbon credits. Noble Lords will be aware that the Government do not support this approach. That is why we have proposed Amendment No. 17, which would delete Clause 25. Our view is that setting a binding limit in the Bill would send the wrong signal to our international partners about our support for a truly global carbon market. This is particularly important given the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive, global, long-term framework for action, which we hope to agree at Copenhagen in December next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="0811175000322"></a>The Stern review showed that international emissions trading under binding caps plays a vital role in the global response to climate change. The noble Lord, Lord Stern, reaffirmed this during debates on the Bill earlier this year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="0811175000387"></a>&#147;Carbon trading has a very powerful role not only through cost but in that much broader and deeper context of putting a global deal together&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/3/08; col. 1416.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811175000323"></a>We consider that a more appropriate method for tackling this key issue would be the requirement to set a flexible, less rigid limit on the use of credits. Amendments Nos. 17A, 17B and 17C have been proposed to achieve this.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="0811175000324"></a>Amendment No. 17B would require the Secretary of State to set a binding limit on the use of carbon units for each budgetary period in secondary legislation, taking into account the views of the Committee on Climate Change on the appropriate balance between domestic and overseas effort. This limit would also have to be set in the context of the requirement, which Amendment No. 11 would introduce, to have regard to the need for UK domestic action on climate change. In proposing a limit, the Secretary of State would also have to consider each of the matters in Clause 11 which must be taken into account in coming to,</p>
<ul><a name="0811175000389"></a>&#147;any decision ... relating to carbon budgets&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81117-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="0811177000001"></a>With the exception of the first budgetary period, where the limit is to be set at the same time as the level of the budget, the amendment would require that the limit be set 18 months before the start of the budgetary period in question. This would ensure that an appropriate limit could be set once the level of the budget is known and the wider policy context, including the international situation, is clear. If a limit was set in the Bill, as in Clause 25 and Amendment No. 17D, further primary legislation would be required to adjust this if it was considered necessary. This might be in order to comply with or maintain consistency with the requirements of a future international agreement.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="0811177000002"></a>Clause 25 also creates difficulties with timing. Due to the way the limit is calculated under Clause 25, the limit could be confirmed as an absolute amount of carbon units only once net UK emissions for the previous budgetary period are known. The final level of net UK emissions for the previous budgetary period, and thus the level of the limit on carbon units, would not be known until 17 months into the budgetary period to which the limit applies. This would considerably reduce the transparency about the amount of credits that may be counted towards the net UK carbon account and would undermine the certainty for business, stakeholders and parliamentarians. By contrast, under the process we are proposing, the limit would be known before the relevant budgetary period begins. This will allow policies to be put in place to ensure that the limit is not exceeded.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="0811177000003"></a>Amendment No. 17B would also provide an important flexibility, which Clause 25 and Amendment No. 17D do not provide, that particular units may be excluded from counting towards the limit. This would allow, for example, the exclusion of carbon units arising as a result of UK companies&#146; participation in the EU ETS counting towards the limit. A limit on credits which  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_978"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 978</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>affected the EU ETS sector by including emissions allowances sourced from participants in the scheme elsewhere in the EU would conflict with the UK&#146;s commitment to this key policy measure. This approach would also undermine the economic efficiency of the trading scheme by placing further requirements on UK-based participants which were not imposed elsewhere in the EU. Such a limit would also cause a real likelihood that we would find ourselves with inconsistencies or a lack of transparency, which would go against everything we are trying to do in this legislation. In addition, given the clear links between this issue and carbon budgets more generally, I consider that the devolved Administrations should have a similar clearly defined role regarding setting limits on the use of carbon credits. Amendment No. 17B provides for that.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="0811177000004"></a>Amendment No. 17C would supplement the new clause proposed by Amendment No. 17B by specifying in Clause 27 that any carbon units in excess of the limit set may not be counted towards the net UK carbon account. This amendment effectively puts in place the binding nature of the limit for the purposes of carbon accounting. The final amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 49 and 50, are minor and technical and relate to the purchase of carbon units by Her Majesty&#146;s Government.</p>

Much has been achieved during the passage of the Bill, not least in this House. It is now a considerably stronger and better Bill than when it first arrived here one year and three days ago today. The time taken to see the Bill through reflects the consideration given to the issues raised by it. In the pre-legislative process, the Joint Committee of both Houses chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, provided a great platform for improving the Bill, but the area of domestic effort and the use of carbon units remain its Achilles&#146; heel. We in this House made a clear and positive decision to quantify the domestic effort but the Government reversed that decision in another place. If we want the Climate Change Bill to be a world-class act, we need clarity on this issue.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="0811177000007"></a>We on these Benches have long argued that this Bill represents a crucial opportunity for the United Kingdom to lead the world, not only in legislation but also in the jump to a low-carbon economy and all the benefits that this will bring to the first movers in a new era. The whole point of this Bill is to provide the market with the long-term clarity and certainty it needs to compete and be the best in the world in this new economy. Business is up for the challenge and it is encouraging to see that one of the most enthusiastic advocates of this issue is one of Britain&#146;s largest energy companies, Scottish and Southern Energy. Why does it support it? It knows that the investment decisions it makes today will lock in the carbon footprint of its business for the next 40 years. It needs to know now what the rules of  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_979"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 979</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the game are before it spends billions investing in new infrastructure that will bring heat and power to millions of people in Britain.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="0811177000008"></a>Another reason why we consider this to be a vital issue is that relying significantly on emissions reductions overseas is frankly a bad habit for our economy to get into. We cannot allow low-carbon economies to develop elsewhere in the world while we are left behind in an indulgence-buying, carbon-emitting, old style economy. It may be cheap to do so now when the carbon price is still relatively low, but this will become an extremely expensive habit if and when the carbon market does what it should and a tonne of CO2 becomes far more expensive. All the more reason not to lock in a carbon-intensive infrastructure now when we know it will become more expensive in the future. We would literally be asking our children to pay expensively tomorrow for our cheap and gluttonous extravagance today. Such a course would do little to show the rest of the world that the UK is serious about moving to a low-carbon economy with all the benefits for innovation, employment and new business opportunities that this will bring.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="0811177000009"></a>We also recognise that it is not necessarily possible to find an ideal or correct balancing percentage between domestic and non-domestic effort. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has tabled an amendment suggesting that the division between the two should be 50:50, whereas the original Clause 25, as agreed in this House, was for 70 per cent domestic and 30 per cent non-domestic effort. For this reason we have considered it important for the Committee on Climate Change to be consulted on this issue, as detailed in Commons Amendment No. 11. We all know that the committee as defined in the Bill will have expertise in far more than climate science. According to Schedule 1, the committee will also have expertise in, among other areas, business competitiveness, economic analysis and forecasting, and emissions trading. It would then seem only sensible that we consult this esteemed group on this vital question, just as we considered and will continue to consider its advice on the 2050 target and the setting of carbon budgets.</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="0811177000010"></a>I am pleased to see that the Government have now decided to put a requirement on the Secretary of State to take the views of the independent committee into account, as clarified in the government amendments, and I thank the Minister for the way in which he explained that in moving the amendment. We greatly welcome the Government&#146;s amendment to Amendment No.17, which shows that they have reconsidered their actions in the Public Bill Committee in the other place in removing what was then Clause 25. The Government&#146;s new additions after Clause 11 will clearly go a long way to address our concerns over the limit set on the use of carbon units, but we think it is worth while to press the Minister on his definition of &#147;carbon credits&#148;. The Government&#146;s amendment would allow limits to be set on the use of all carbon units, meaning the clean development mechanism (CDM), the joint implementation (JI) credits, and the EU allowances (EUAs). The subject matter is awash with acronyms but we shall try to keep our heads above water. To be effective in ensuring that the UK moves to a low-carbon economy, any limit needs to apply to all carbon units.  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, the latest signals from the Government suggest that EU allowances are going to be exempt from this list, which will be limited to CDM and JI credits. Can the Minister tell the House whether that is the case, and if so, why?</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="0811177000011"></a>The Minister will know that if that were to happen, the UK could simply buy more EU allowances from other EU countries. Those countries would simply import more CDM to compensate. It would be a form of carbon unit laundering, purchasing EUA credits from other EU states which replace the EUA credits that we have bought with more CDM credits, which they can then purchase from outside the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Can noble Lords be assured that the amendments which the Government propose will drive the de-carbonisation of our economy, particularly our power sector, which the noble Lord, Lord Turner, who unfortunately is not in his place, recently recommended was so vital?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="0811177000012"></a>Finally, I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify how the Government intend to account for the emissions from sectors under the EU ETS, which is a complex but critical issue. A recent consultation on carbon accounting from the Department of Energy and Climate Change&#151;we on this side of the House welcome the creation of the new department&#151;makes it clear that the Government intend to use the UK&#146;s Emissions Trading Scheme cap for the first carbon budget period, which runs from 2008 to 2012. However, beyond 2012, the whole structure of the EU ETS will be radically transformed. Quite simply, Europe is moving away from an ETS cap, set at national level, and is moving towards setting a single, Europe-wide cap. While that has many merits it creates a very significant problem for accounting for the ETS traded sectors under the Climate Change Bill, as there will no longer be such a thing as a UK cap. DECC&#146;s consultation acknowledges that there is an issue, but offers no solution to the problem. Can the Minister explain how emissions from the EU ETS sectors will be accounted for in carbon budgets after 2012?</p>

<a name="81117-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="0811177000013"></a>There is also a risk that under the Bill sectors outside the ETS&#151;for example, transport, building stock, and non-energy intensive industry&#151;may be expected to take on more ambitious measures to compensate for a weak EU-wide cap on the ETS sectors. Can the Minister clarify what options the Government are considering which would allow the UK to set a tighter carbon budget for the ETS sectors, particularly in the power sector, than would be implied by the cap set at EU level? I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s assurances on these critical issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08111723000009"></a>Before this debate, I would not have thought that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, would be my major  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>witness on how the targets for the Bill could be avoided. The minor ways are the banking and borrowing provisions which allow carbon output and accounting to be pushed from one period to another&#151;all those fudge factors are in there at the moment&#151;and the major one is offshoring. I am sure that, in the summer, the Minister saw a Defra and Stockholm Environment Institute report called <I>Development of </I><I>an</I><I></I><I>E</I><I>mbedded </I><I>Carbon E</I><I>missions </I><I>I</I><I>ndicator</I>. It is an excellent document. It asks what the carbon content of our exports and imports is. Effectively, it is asking what the carbon consumption of the United Kingdom is over time, as opposed to our carbon production. Of course, carbon consumption in many ways is a better economic indicator of carbon than production&#151;what the UK consumes rather than just produces and perhaps exports.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08111723000010"></a>That report highlighted the fact that currently we consume something like 37 per cent more carbon than we produce and that gap is getting broader. Why? It has everything to do with the global economics of trade, in that many of our carbon-intensive industries are going to the developing world, while we concentrate on and expand our economy in terms of services and low-carbon technologies. That is not good news. It says that as a country we are responsible for far more carbon emissions than we report, but we are able to offshore them. Ironically, we tut-tut at China for its increasing emissions, but a large proportion of those emissions are ones which we have exported.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08111723000011"></a>I have tried to get to the bottom of this and to put in more normal language what we mean by trying to look at the domestic production of carbon in this Bill rather than the broader carbon budget. One could illustrate that by saying that perhaps, later this evening, I will invite the Minister to the pub next door and in there we will see two fat guys discussing how to lose weight. We might listen in to their conversation and they might challenge each other to lose weight. They might say, &#147;We are both overweight, which is bad for us and it is not government policy either, so let's commit to losing five stone each within a year with the prize of a bottle of champagne&#148;. Having listened to that, we think we will go back, in a year&#146;s time, to see whether the task has been achieved. In a year&#146;s time, we go to the pub again and one of the guys is substantially thinner but the other one is exactly the same. The thin one says, &#147;I have achieved my target; I have lost five stone so I can have my bottle of champagne&#148;, but the other guy says, &#147;I have won as well and I claim my bottle of champagne because I have lost five stone&#148;. The thin guy will say, &#147;I am sorry; you look exactly the same weight as before&#148;, to which the fat guy will say, &#147;No, it is quite all right, I paid my brother to lose five stone and I have a certificate from his doctor to tell you that he lost five stone, so I win a prize as well&#148;.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08111723000012"></a>The Minister would say that that is absolutely all right because in terms of the nation's health, one person losing five stone is as good as anyone else losing five stone, but everyone in the pub will know that that individual is a fraud and I believe he would be treated with derision for having delegated his healthcare. That is exactly the same as how we look at the UK economy in regard to carbon. It is no good saying that we will delegate this task. Not only have we delegated

Somehow that is not right; there is a strange logic there.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08111723000013"></a>That is why we on these Benches are still unhappy that there is no commitment in the Bill to domestic carbon reduction in the economy. I accept that the methodology used to move forward and the Conservative amendments are much better than the Bill was when it left the Commons, but there is an important issue about leadership here. Whatever we say as a nation, whatever the Government say and whatever is said about leadership, the gaping hole on the face of the Bill regarding finding someone else to do our cleaning up potentially wrecks that leadership and that moral authority.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08111723000014"></a>I tabled an amendment which suggests that we move from 70:30, as the ratio was, to 50:50. I will not move that amendment because 50:50 is still derisory. I am glad, however, that the Government have understood that there is a big issue here and it is one that they have tackled to a degree. I have faith in the climate change committee and I hope it will come forward with good logic and tight targets. This is one area of the Bill, however, where I believe the Government have a major problem in their authority and global leadership.</p>

This evening marks the final phase of a legislative journey that for me started 18 months ago when I was asked to chair the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising this Bill. In another sense, it also represents the starting point in the far longer and more difficult slog of implementing the Bill&#146;s best intentions.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08111723000016"></a>This Bill will only be the first piece in the legislative puzzle that is likely to be required if we are to achieve our aim of a sustainable society and a sustainable planet. I have little doubt that by 2020 this House will be debating the pros and cons of what for the present I will describe as personal carbon allowances. After a great deal of argument, the House will pass some tentative legislation to this effect. I hope that it will not be so tentative that it will fail to achieve the result that by then will be badly needed.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08111723000017"></a>If today I am able to give this Bill eight and a half out of 10, it is more to do with the ambitions it sets for itself than the rather limited means it has chosen to achieve them. On more than one occasion, I have warned of the possibility of this Bill morphing into a carbon trading Act. I am sorry to say that, despite the best possible intentions, this is largely what has happened.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08111723000018"></a>Although a great deal could be said on this subject, I will restrict myself to addressing the broad thrust of this group of amendments. Why do I remain intransigent on the subject of a cap on the purchase of overseas carbon credits in compensation for domestic emissions? There are two principal reasons. First, I reject the simplistic economics that insist that a unit of carbon saved is the same wherever in the world that saving comes from. On a purely like-for-like basis, that may be true but the situation is far more complicated and  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_983"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 983</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rather more interesting than that. A unit of carbon purchased from a developing country has a tangible benefit both in its own terms and as a means of transferring capital from what for convenience I will call the rich north to the impoverished south. It is, however, solely a one-for-one transaction, having little or no afterlife or long-term value. A domestic carbon saving, on the other hand, can well be a precursor, as we have seen with recycling, to permanent behaviour change, leading to the saving of many carbon units. So, instead of one for one, or like for like, it becomes one for many. This should not be allowed to become a zero-sum game.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08111723000019"></a>I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, because in one respect, and only one respect, he is absolutely right. The notion of this Bill as a carbon trading Act is a real danger. The same fertile imaginations that brought us our present credit crunch are without doubt sharpening their swords to take a slice of the secondary trade in carbon emissions. It will only be a matter of time before one of our national newspapers blazons a headline, &#147;Carbon trade scam revealed&#148;. I urge the Government to look carefully at what they are setting in train. The conditions exist for something frightening to occur.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08111723000020"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who is not in his place, said he believes people will look back on this Act&#151;as it will be then&#151;and think we were a bunch of &#147;arses&#148;; I think that was his word. I have made a promise to myself that I intend to bind all contributions to this Bill in a leather book, give it to my great-grandchildren and ask them to read it, say every five years, and decide for themselves who were the greater arses during the passage of this Bill.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08111723000021"></a>The second reason for my intransigence is well rehearsed. The Kyoto Protocol, of which we were an early signatory, is absolutely clear that purchased carbon credits will be supplemental to domestic savings. No amount of ministerial tautology&#151;</p>

For that reason alone, it must start its legislative life by being unblinkingly honest. Despite the many problems this amendment causes&#151;over the past few months, officials have tortuously tutored me in all of them&#151;it will be a great mistake to allow this piece of legislation to pass, leaning as it does on what to the man or woman in the street would appear to be a rather convenient piece of legal juggling, no matter how justified.</p>

Until the forthcoming Copenhagen summit decides to remove that injunction, or at least find another way of describing it, no honeyed words from my noble friend on the Front Bench are likely to change my view that this  is a disproportionately important matter. It is disproportionately important because this is all about trust. If Governments have learned nothing else in these past few months, it should have been that trust is not just one factor in their relationship to the electorate; it is the whole ball of wax.</p>

May I say to my noble friend Lord Puttnam, who is agonizingly close to missing his aeroplane, that it was a privilege to hear him speak. It is interesting to hear what he will say to his grandchildren about this Bill. I was trying to decide with the excellent team of officials who have formed the Bill team over a long time what comparative piece of legislation one could compare this Bill to. The best I can come up with is the 1948 NHS Act&#151;a Bill of immense importance which, 60 years later, is still relevant.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08111723000030"></a>I accept that the Bill has been improved enormously during the passage through your Lordships&#146; House and another place. I agree with my noble friend that this is a question of trust because this is partly about legislative requirements and partly about leadership. It is about leadership in this country&#151;Government and Parliament showing how important it is to deal with climate change&#151;but also about giving the UK a solid basis from which to negotiate internationally.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08111723000031"></a>I disagree with the general sentiments of my noble friend and the noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord Teverson, on this matter. Before I come to the amendment, it is important to reflect that the critical requirement is on the UK Government that net emissions must be reduced by at least 80 per cent by 2050. The Government must set and meet five-year carbon budgets starting from this year. It also requires that the Secretary of State, in carrying out his duties, must have regard to the need for UK domestic emissions reductions. Government Amendment No. 17B would require a limit to be set for each budgetary period on the number of overseas credits that can be purchased to meet the budget, and the Committee on Climate Change will be advising on the appropriate balance between domestic effort and the use of overseas credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08111723000032"></a>We think that we have listened carefully to the principal points made in the debate, but as I have explained, the government amendments will provide the flexibility to exclude credits of a certain description that we believe to be essential to preserve the integrity of the EU ETS.</p>

Our fear is that that might be an unintended consequence&#151;I put it that way&#151;or certainly in relation to how it might be seen internationally. We are worried about the impact in terms of UK support for the EU ETS. We might disagree, but I would not want to suggest that the noble Lord himself in his amendments is seeking to undermine the EU ETS, and indeed I have taken on board his comments about ways in which the scheme should be regulated more rigorously. I hope that I have clarified the issue up to a point.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08111723000035"></a>We do not want to penalise companies which decide that it is more cost-effective to generate energy in the UK than in other EU countries, resulting in UK emissions going up, but EU-wide emissions coming down. I want also to address a very important point made by noble Lords. The use of uncapped credits by the EU ETS needs to be carefully controlled. We are in the middle of negotiations on phase 3, but my understanding is that the Commission is proposing that there should be no new access to the clean development mechanism credits in this phase. Although we do not want to legislate in an area that we fear might be seen to undermine our support for the EU ETS, we recognise that additional measures are needed in the traded sector.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08111723000036"></a>I understand the points made by noble Lords about the probity, if you like, of the trading scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked how EU ETS credits will be accounted for after 2012, and reflected that we have already acknowledged that the accounting process will become more complex in phase 3; that is, post-2012. The way to consider how best to link the Bill to phase 3 is once the EU negotiations have concluded, but it is a matter to which we will need to pay close attention. Having expressed his support for the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has not stayed to develop the theme he introduced in his speech at the beginning of our debate. However, it is clear that we need to do all we can to ensure the integrity of the credits used. We want to do all we can to ensure that the process is transparent and robust. To that end, we will need to keep on monitoring and working internationally to ensure that that is so.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08111723000037"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, on what the carbon units will be, in the consultation we are currently undertaking on carbon accounting regulations, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08111723000093"></a>&#147;We propose to count the following as carbon units: assigned amount units, certified emission reductions for the clean development mechanism, removal units, emission reduction units and the European unit allowances for the EU ETS&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111723000092"></a>I am happy to provide further information on this if the noble Lord requires it.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08111723000038"></a>We then come to the substance of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, tempted me down to the  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_986"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 986</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pub to witness two thinnish men observing two fat men drinking. He thought that it simply is not acceptable that even though the fat of the nation had reduced by the relevant amount, one of the fat chaps had said he was going to reduce his weight, but in the end did not do so. The noble Lord found that to be a problem. He knew that my response would be that collectively it is all right because the overall fat of the nation was coming down, and he knows that I will answer by saying that ultimately what counts is reducing emissions generally worldwide. We believe that through the enactment of this Bill and through the hugely challenging 80 per cent target, we are demonstrating the kind of leadership that both he and my noble friend Lord Puttnam require.</p>

<a name="81117-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08111723000039"></a>It is also fair to point out, and it has been acknowledged, that the last thing the Government want to do is say, &#147;It&#146;ll be all right because we can simply trade away the issues we need to tackle in this country&#148;. I think that the Government have clearly signalled that they have done and will continue to do all they can to reduce emissions in this country. The amendments I have tabled articulate that aim and make it clear that the Committee on Climate Change will ensure that these matters are brought to the attention of the public and Parliament. However, in the end we worry about the impact of the amendments tabled by noble Lords on the EU ETS, and that is why we think, after a great deal of consideration and debate in the other place, along with the amendments being brought forward, that we have achieved the right balance that allows the necessary flexibility within the context of an utter determination for us overall to meet the 80 per cent target.</p>

I am most grateful to the Deputy Speaker for his professional guidance through the intricacies of this stage of the Bill. In moving these amendments, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 26, 27, 29, 30, 32 to 39, 53, 55, 60, 65, 69, 70, 72, 73 and 75. The key amendments in this group form a comprehensive package of government amendments introduced in the other place to clarify the role of the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change. These amendments also concern the formal vesting date of the Committee on Climate Change, the date by which it is to provide formal advice on the 2050 target and the level of the first three carbon budgets.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08111723000065"></a>We listened carefully to the arguments put forward in this House about adaptation. We fully agree that expert advice and scrutiny of how the Government assess the risks and implement their adaptation work programme are important and useful, and we believe an adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change could have a potentially useful role in this regard. However, we believe that the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s role on adaptation should be consistent with its work on mitigation; that is, giving technical advice and analysing and scrutinising progress. We think it should have a slightly different role from that originally proposed by this House. Our amendments propose that it should provide technical advice to the Government and the devolved Administrations on the UK risk assessment and progress reports to Parliament about the UK Government&#146;s adaptation programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08111723000066"></a>As we propose new adaptation functions to the work of the Committee on Climate Change, we have made small amendments around the provision of information, guidance and directions relating specifically to the committee&#146;s new adaptation functions. We also propose to change the date by which the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s advice is required and the commencement date for Part 2 in order for the committee to be brought to life and formally give its advice on 1 December. There are also a small number of minor and consequential drafting amendments in this group. I hope noble Lords will accept that this has been a positive response to debate in your Lordships' House.</p>

I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group and address Amendments Nos. 43A and 43B, which have been tabled in response to the clear views expressed by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its 15th report of the 2007-08 Session.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08111723000071"></a>The purpose of the first group of amendments is to achieve a significant reduction in the number of single-use carrier bags distributed in the UK. More than 11 billion single-use carrier bags are distributed each year. They have a direct environmental effect as a particularly visible form of litter when discarded irresponsibly, through the risk they present to marine life and the emissions that they generate from transport and waste management. However, their disposable, easily-substituted nature also makes them an iconic symbol of our throwaway society. By taking action on single-use carrier bags, we hope to catalyse other beneficial behaviour changes, including an increase in public waste awareness and greater participation in recycling by consumers.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08111723000072"></a>As announced in the Budget, we wish to take enabling powers to require retailers to charge for single-use carrier bags. However, before these powers are exercised, we want to give retailers the opportunity to pursue, on a voluntary basis, a significant reduction in the number of bags they distribute. We believe that we could achieve at least a 70 per cent reduction in the number of single-use bags distributed if a charge were introduced. The Government would be prepared to impose a charge if a similar reduction could not be achieved through voluntary action.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08111723000073"></a>The effect of the new clause introduced by Amendment No. 43 is to introduce a new schedule conferring powers on the relevant national authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland, as requested by the respective devolved Administrations, to make regulations about charges for single-use bags. The specific powers are contained in the new schedule, which Amendment No. 78 introduces. It is split into three parts covering powers to require a charge for bags, powers to create civil sanctions in respect of sellers who breach such regulations and procedural matters.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08111723000074"></a>Part 1 of the new schedule provides powers to make regulations about charging for the supply of single-use carrier bags. It provides for regulations to: require sellers of goods to charge for single-use carrier bags supplied at the place where they are sold or for the purpose of delivering goods; define sellers of goods; define a single-use carrier bag; specify the minimum amount that sellers must charge for each single-use bag; appoint an administrator to administer the provisions  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_990"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 990</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made by regulations and confer appropriate powers and duties on him, including enforcement powers and duties; and require that records are kept of the amounts raised by the charge and the uses to which the proceeds are put. We will consult formally on these points of detail, prior to the introduction of secondary legislation. The first set of regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08111723000075"></a>Part 2 of the new schedule contains provisions about civil sanctions. The provisions in Part 2 follow the model used in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. Of the possible sanctions in that Act, we are proposing fixed monetary penalties, variable monetary penalties and compliance notices only. Administrators will be able to choose which sanction is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. We will not be creating any criminal offences and have proposed that any fixed penalty fines in respect of breaches of the proposed bags regulations be kept to a minimum of &#163;5,000. There is, however, provision to require retailers to publicise the fact that they have breached the regulations.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08111723000076"></a>At this stage, I should like to bring to the attention of the House the government amendment to Commons Amendment No. 43, Amendment No. 43B, which ensures that any future regulations concerning the levels at which variable and non-compliance penalties are set will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That was recommended by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The Government are grateful for its advice and are seeking to comply with it.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08111723000077"></a>Part 3 of the new schedule provides for the regulations to be made by a single national authority or by two or more national authorities as joint regulations. There could therefore be a single set of regulations covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland if the three authorities agree. It also disapplies the hybrid procedures to any draft regulations made under the powers contained in the new schedule as<I></I>we are providing for the power to name specific retailers who will be subject to the charge. The same approach is taken in relation to the waste reduction scheme provisions in Clause 70(5). Amendments Nos. 52, 54, 56 to 59, 61 to 64 and 67 are consequential on the new clause and schedule.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08111723000078"></a>By tabling these amendments, the Government are responding to clear, strong public demands for action on single-use carrier bags. These enabling powers provide a powerful lever in our continuing efforts to phase out single-use carrier bags in favour of longer-lasting, more sustainable alternatives.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08111723000079"></a>The other amendments in this group&#151;Amendments Nos. 40, 41, 42, 66, 77 and 80&#151;relate to powers to allow for up to five pilot waste incentive schemes in England, as set out in Part 5. Amendment No. 41 ensures that the Secretary of State may exercise powers to make subordinate legislation or issue guidance under the waste reduction provisions separately to the designation of a specific pilot area. This ensures that the Government can provide a clear framework for pilot authorities wishing to pilot a scheme before they submit proposals. Amendment No. 40 is a technical amendment consequential on Amendment No. 41.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08111723000080"></a>When the House previously discussed the Bill, my noble friend Lord Rooker, who was the Minister in charge at that point, mentioned our intention to bring forward an amendment to clarify that a local authority&#146;s duty to arrange for collection of household waste in England is discharged by collecting waste that is presented for collection in the way specified in a Section 46 notice to residents; for example, in a specified receptacle. Any waste left in contravention of a Section 46 notice need not be collected. Once a local authority has informed residents of how they should present their waste for collection&#151;for example, by putting it in a bin&#151;the authority need not collect any waste left lying outside that bin, the so-called side waste. Amendment No. 42, which would apply to all waste collection authorities in England and Wales, seeks to achieve this. As explained, such policies have been successfully operated by a significant number of authorities, with the support of their communities, using powers conferred by the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As part of a good overall service, they have helped householders to understand how much waste they produce and encouraged them to increase the amount that they recycle. In line with good practice, the Government expect that authorities will use all the powers available to them proportionately and sensibly, hand in hand with effective communications and support for residents.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08111723000081"></a>We do not believe that the sensible use of these powers should lead to uncollected rubbish building up in local communities. It is important to note that all authorities will continue to have to meet existing requirements to collect household waste. In addition, local authorities have a duty, under Section 89 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to keep land under their control clear of litter and waste. This approach is not a new one; Defra set out its position in a letter to local authorities in August 2005, but it has not always been clearly shared by all authorities, which is why it will be helpful for local authorities to have a single, clear point of reference in legislation.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08111723000082"></a>Amendment No. 66 is consequential on Amendment No. 42. Amendment No. 77 would ensure that the power to allow waste collection authorities to require an occupier to place waste for collection in receptacles identified by specified means&#151;for example, by tags or stickers&#151;is available only to those authorities in England which are operating a waste reduction scheme in their area. Finally, Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 would amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the addition of the subject matter introduced by Amendment No. 42. I clarify one point that I made earlier about fixed penalties for breaches of proposed bags regulations. I stated that the penalties would be kept to a minimum of &#163;5,000. This was a slip of the tongue; I meant a maximum of &#163;5,000 and apologise for that error. I commend the amendments to the House and beg to move.</p>

I am happy to support this amendment and I thank the Minister for introducing this and the other amendments within this group. My party supported the inclusion of Schedule 6 in Committee in the other place. Energy costs and climate change notwithstanding, we consider it vital to act on the scourge of plastic bag litter in our country. The single-use carrier bag is an icon of our throwaway society. On a journey through the countryside, there are few things more infuriating than seeing plastic bags stuck in trees and hedgerows. They cause environmental damage, endanger our wildlife and pollute our seas and waterways. This country currently uses more than 13 billion single-use carrier bags each year; that is more than 500 bags a year for every household in Britain. We agree with the Government that something must be done to reduce this figure. I am happy to support Commons Amendment No. 43 and emphasise a new imperative to see waste as a strategic resource.</p>

I shall speak to the other amendments in the group. I will also discuss Amendment No. 48A, which is an amendment to Amendment No. 48. The amendments in this group give effect to the Government&#146;s proposals for a new community energy-saving scheme. Amendments Nos. 44, 68, 79 and 82, if agreed to, will make the changes necessary to enable the Secretary of State to bring forward secondary legislation setting out the detail of the new scheme. The community energy-saving programme was announced by the Prime Minister in September as part of the home energy-saving package. It forms a central plank of the Government&#146;s new proposals to help households save energy and money, which is more essential than ever at this time of high energy prices. The precise arrangements will be subject to extensive consultation and we do not yet have fixed ideas on all aspects of the programme. It might help if I mention some of the key features that would be included in the subsequent secondary legislation, as we envisage them.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08111723000090"></a>The programme will be based on the model of the existing carbon emission reduction target, under which we set the energy companies&#146; targets for promoting energy efficiency in households. In this case, we will be looking specifically for a community-focused approach. We want to see the programme delivered, as far as possible, through the partnership of energy companies, local authorities, community groups, third-sector organisations and other bodies. Experience suggests that it is when all the key local players work together and deliver action on a street-by-street and house-by-house basis that communities and individuals respond best to the help available. The new scheme will be funded and delivered both by the energy suppliers and the electricity generators. The generators are not, at present, covered by the carbon emission reduction target, but we believe that all companies in the energy market now have a responsibility to help those in need of support. We will set out more precise detail as we move towards the stage of public consultation. I hope I have been able at least to give an outline of an important and imaginative scheme to deliver assistance to households at a local level, involving the co-ordination of partners.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08111723000091"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 45, 46, 47 and 51, which concern corporate reporting on greenhouse gas emissions. We agree with those who have spoken earlier in this House and with opinion expressed in the other place on the need to find the right way to ensure that businesses play their part in the nationwide effort to reduce emissions. We propose our amendments in that context.</p>

The noble Lord has raised an extremely important point but, if I may, I shall describe how we envisage the whole structure working. I may be able to answer him more precisely within that framework.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08111728000009"></a>We want to provide as much certainty as possible for the business community&#151;the noble Duke/Earl is reflecting uncertainty&#151;about the levels. I understand the point that he is making. That is why we are concerned to resolve that and a number of other points he will recognise that we want to show leadership internationally in this area for the business community. The amendments are therefore designed to reinforce the Government&#146;s commitment to the importance of corporate transparency, and to taking forward the process as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08111728000010"></a>Amendment No. 45 would require the Secretary of State to introduce guidance on corporate reporting by October 2009. That will provide a structure to help companies and others to report their emissions where they choose to do so. We will consult on the guidance next year, working closely with key stakeholder groups, including the CBI, to ensure that it fully reflects current best practice and is practicable for businesses to work with.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08111728000011"></a>Since we last considered the issue of corporate reporting in this House, we have looked a little further at the evidence of costs and benefits of requiring all large and medium-sized companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions. Our initial analysis shows that, although companies which voluntarily measure and monitor their greenhouse gas emissions may be more likely to manage them effectively, there is no settled evidence that being required to report on emissions would drive emissions reductions.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08111728000012"></a>More work clearly needs to be done to clarify the situation. Amendment No. 46 would commit the Secretary of State to review the contribution of mandatory corporate reporting to achieving the UK&#146;s climate change objectives, and report back to Parliament by December 2010 at the latest. The review will allow us to assess the current legislative and voluntary requirements and design a targeted reporting requirement that addresses those gaps proportionately.</p>

<a name="81117-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08111728000013"></a>Of course, I am strongly mindful of the view originally taken by this House on the role of mandatory corporate reporting. Amendment No. 47 would require the Government to introduce mandatory reporting by April 2012, or to lay an explanation before Parliament as to why they have not done so. That would make clear in the Bill our intention to move towards mandatory reporting of emissions, provided that we can be sure that it is environmentally beneficial and cost-effective.</p>

I believe that the proposals are both ambitious and proportionate, while containing important flexibilities. For that reason, I consider that Clause 80, which was proposed in this House, is no longer necessary. Amendment No. 51 would remove it from the Bill.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08111728000015"></a>I now turn to Amendments Nos. 48 and 48A and 48B. Amendment No. 48B is a re-drafted version of Amendment 48. I propose that Amendment No. 48 should be disagreed to, and that the new clause in Amendment No. 48B should be added to the Bill in lieu.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08111728000016"></a>Amendment No. 48B would require the Treasury, acting through the Office of Government Commerce, to produce an annual report on progress made towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the government estate. The report will specifically cover the steps taken to reduce the size of the civil estate; to achieve further efficiencies from the Government&#146;s existing buildings; to improve the sustainability of those buildings; and to ensure that new buildings procured are in the top quartile of energy performance.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08111728000017"></a>It is right that the Government lead by example. We must get our own house in order if we expect others to take the necessary action to tackle climate change. That is why we are committed to taking action in this area, which builds on other commitments we have made on improved sustainability. For example, government departments will be included in the carbon reduction commitment, which will incentivise the introduction of energy efficiency measures and the occupation of more energy-efficient office space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08111728000020"></a>The question of whether there may be an aspect of trading is a good try, but I will not be called on that question at the moment. If the noble Lord is saying that it would not look very good if the Government purported to set an example of direct action and then found other ways to solve the problem, it is quite clear from our amendments that we want to rest responsibility on government departments to shape up to those challenging objectives, because of the crucial issue of leading by example. The plastic bag issue is the same. We all recognise that plastic bags are not the only form of waste over which we need to get control, but they are one on which we can demonstrate that we set an example that we expect others to follow.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08111728000021"></a>We have put in place robust mechanisms to provide a strong role for the Office of Government Commerce, as the government office which leads on improving the efficiency and sustainability of the government estate and operations.

I am that sure noble Lords will recognise the seriousness of our intent. To allow the provision to be kept relevant and up-to-date, we have also provided an order-making power, so that descriptions of buildings covered by the report can be changed over time. Any order would be subject to debate in both Houses.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08111728000022"></a>The final amendment in this group, Amendment No. 75, makes a small change to the trading scheme powers in Schedule 2, by ensuring that trading scheme regulations may make provision to levy charges from third parties, as well as participants, for the cost of operating the trading scheme. We want third parties to have access to trading schemes, as that will ensure that a deeper and more liquid market may develop than would be the case if only participants were allowed to trade. In the absence of the amendment, third parties would be able to take part in a scheme&#146;s trading element but there would be no express power to levy charges from them towards the cost of operating a scheme. We do not think that desirable. There is a clear, practical need behind this adjustment, which is to ensure equitable treatment of both trading scheme participants and third parties.</p>

Anyone who has heard my colleagues&#146; contributions on this Front Bench&#151;in the daisy chain of Bills: Planning, Energy and Housing and Regeneration, the latter now an Act I believe&#151;and my contributions on climate change will know that we have long recognised that the benefits of going low carbon extend far beyond stabilising our climate. Going low carbon will also mean saving people money by making their homes and businesses more energy efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08111728000029"></a>The amendment will improve the sustainability of existing public buildings and ensure that new buildings procured by the civil estate are in the upper quartile of energy performance. We believe that energy efficiency improvements are one of the keys to short term domestic emissions reduction, as well as having positive carbon abatement costs, which will create new jobs and generate new wealth for our economy. We are also mindful of the fact that home energy prices are at record highs and that many of Britain&#146;s poorest families will be facing a tough winter ahead. While we cannot expect the measures detailed in these amendments to help people this coming winter, in the longer term, we can acknowledge the difference that they will make in helping those suffering fuel poverty. I am happy to support these important amendments.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08111728000030"></a>I return to my Amendment No. 47B on the issue of carbon reporting for businesses. While we on the opposition Benches acknowledge the distance moved by the Government on this issue, we feel that still more could be done. If any noble Lords saw the opinion piece in the <I>Financial Times</I> on Friday 16 November 2008, from James Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation Europe and Asia, they will have seen that many leading businesses clearly agree with the Conservative Party that the Government are not leading sufficiently strongly on this issue.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08111728000031"></a>This House will recall that it was here that the original mandatory carbon reporting requirements were put into this Bill, only to be removed in a Public Bill Committee in another place. After some considerable pressure, the Government clearly saw the error of their ways and settled on the stipulation that the Secretary of State must make regulations for certain companies by 6 April 2012. This certainly is an improvement, but the message coming to us from many large and progressive businesses is that they are already accounting for their carbon emissions and do not see why they should have to wait another four years before they should report.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08111728000032"></a>To quote James Murdoch's <I>Financial Time</I><I>s </I>article: </p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="08111728000070"></a>&#147;The UK government is afraid this will be a burden, but many of the best companies already do it. They are finding cost savings and opportunities&#148;.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08111728000033"></a>Mr Murdoch further notes that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="08111728000071"></a>&#147;Saying we can tackle climate change without public company disclosure is akin to thinking obesity&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08111728000034"></a>For this reason we have tabled an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 47, which would give the Secretary of State powers to choose not only the classification of companies which are to be included but the date from which such inclusion would commence,  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_998"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column 998</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in advance of 6 April 2012. We accept that there must be discretion for the Secretary of State to choose which category of company should be included and when. However this means that, for example, all FTSE 350 companies could be regulated to report by January 2010.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08111728000035"></a>We think it wise that the largest of businesses, which already have significant environmental reporting responsibilities, should not have to move like some sort of Second World War Atlantic convoy, at the pace of the slowest ship. Instead, the biggest companies should be regulated to break ahead of the pack and allow the smaller and less regulated companies to enter the process at a later date. In today's economic environment it is imprudent for any business with responsibilities to its shareholders to continue to ignore the commercial risk of not accounting for the low cost of its carbon pollution, a cost which we now agree is here to stay.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08111728000036"></a>I finish by again quoting the chief executive of News Corp Ltd, who last Friday said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="08111728000072"></a>&#147;The government should go further in the vital area of company emissions measurement and reporting. The Climate Change Bill, which is now in the final stages of its passage through Parliament, is an opportunity to commit to making reporting of carbon emissions mandatory by 2010 at the very latest. There is no time to lose&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111728000067"></a>These Benches entirely agree with those sentiments. There is a lot of pressure out there and that is why we call upon the Government to consider Amendment No. 47B as a valuable and necessary enhancement to the Bill.</p>

<a name="08111728000037"></a><a name="81117-0012.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81117-0012.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08111728000102"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I speak to my Amendment No. 47A as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 47. This is one of the areas where the pace of understanding of climate change is getting quicker and quicker. A number of us were at a launch of <I>One Vision: Consistency in Corporate Carbon R</I><I>eporting</I> by the CBI in a room in your Lordships&#146; House. The CBI is very much&#151;I was going to say a convert, but that probably does not do it credit&#151;a strong advocate of agreeing a sensible and appropriate carbon reporting system and getting it into place, but how long does it take to get the right system to which everybody applies in a consistent way? That is the question I have about the timescale, but very much agree with the view of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that we need to do this quickly.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08111728000038"></a>Indeed, regarding slightly smaller or medium-sized businesses, the director of the corporate leaders&#146; group at the Institute of Directors said that once you realise that it is inevitably going to happen and that the only future is a low carbon future, you want to get on with it sooner rather than later. This is an area where business wants to move ahead, sees that it is right to do so and that there is competitive advantage and cost savings in moving in this direction. Therefore there is an urgent need to get these reporting standards right and implemented.</p>

<ul><a name="08111728000092"></a>&#147;lay before Parliament a report explaining why no such regulations have been made&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08111728000069"></a>and the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham rides off. Come on, the Government talk all the time about giving certainty to business. I have spent most of my life in business and that is what you want from Government. Some things you may want them to get on with quicker. Some things you may not like particularly, but you want to know where you are. I cannot see any captain of industry, whether of a small business or one of the world&#146;s largest companies, understanding why the Government make such a strong statement but then say, &#147;By the way, if we do not get around to doing it, we will put a report before Parliament. Why not?&#148;. It gives absolutely the wrong signal. It says, &#147;Yes, we want to do this: we are committed, but we might not do it, and this is what we have to do when we fail&#148;. It is a plan for failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08111728000040"></a>What business ever says, &#147;This is what we will do when we fail to deliver our corporate mission&#148;? No one does so. One may have contingency plans for failure, but this is not a contingency plan; this is an alternative route&#151;A or B. I do not understand why there is a plan B&#151;a get-out clause in the Bill to broadcast to our corporate nation that, although it wants to get on with it, the Government have no conviction that they will able to make it. That is a great shame. Once again, the rug is pulled out from under the Government&#146;s good intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08111728000041"></a>I do, however, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Davies, on his excellent explanation of why there should not be a trading scheme for government buildings. I wish that I had had that speech to put into one of my other speeches earlier on in the debate.</p>

I very much support what the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said. I cannot believe that we are still discussing this issue at this stage in the climate change debate. Given the acknowledgement that climate change is one of the most severe threats facing the globe and that businesses, individuals and organisations in this country need to rally round and reduce carbon emissions, the fact that the Environment Agency has produced a valuable series of reports on environmental reporting by British industry, as well as the fact that a disparate variety of companies, large and small, are reporting sporadically on carbon but in a way that is singularly unuseful in tracking progress over time or making comparisons between businesses, it staggers me that we are still talking about some sort of discussion and consultation, with a timescale within which to reach a view about whether there will be mandatory reporting by 2012. All the arguments made by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, are absolutely the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08111728000043"></a>We not only have the sheriff with his noises off; the noble Lord, Lord Davies, seemed to come clean when he remarked that reporting does not necessarily serve as a good indicator for managing emissions. That gave the game away completely. We need not bother to go out to report, so far as I can tell, because the Government seem to have made up their mind. Those graphs in the Stern report on the early reduction in carbon emissions were the most telling; it is not what we do by 2050, but what we do in the next five years, that counts. However, we are going to faff about for four of those five years trying to make up our minds whether some of the biggest companies in this country&#151;which, by reducing their carbon emissions, will benefit by cost-reduction and developing technologies that will serve them well in the global market&#151;should simply write down in some reasonably standard way the product of the work that they inevitably will have to do if we are to hit the carbon-reduction targets. I cannot believe how pusillanimous the Government are being on this issue.</p>

After all, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is upbraiding the Government because they seem to have made up their mind, and the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is upbraiding the Government because they have not made up their mind. It is difficult for me to respond to that duality, except to say that it will not do to argue that Governments are only about good ideas and good intentions. Governments are certainly about good ideas and goods intentions&#151;this Government in particular are full of both&#151;but we are responsible in Parliament for good legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08111728000045"></a>We are discussing not some generalised formula for the nation this evening but what we put into law. I hope, indeed beg, the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Taylor, not to press their amendments because they both have this element in common&#151;they would put into legislation and make certain something about which the Government are not definitive at present and that would require considerable consultation. It is easy for noble Lords to pluck out of the air one article in a newspaper from however esteemed the source might prove to be, but it will not do for idle reference to be made to the top three FTSE 250 companies, or whatever. The Government cannot work on the basis of surmising these terms; they must have some precision about who is to be involved in this.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08111728000046"></a>I think the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, would certainly accept that his noble friend the Duke of Montrose was concerned about this issue and challenged me first&#151;probably, if I read his interjection accurately, on where the line would be drawn. Corporate reporting certainly involves a burden, and I am quite sure that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, was concerned that the burdens on companies of a certain size might be excessive and might not provide sufficient benefit, consequent upon reporting, which the Government seek. We are not being definitive about that at this stage. We are saying that we must have provision for reporting and the opportunity to ensure that we can take this argument a stage further and make it definitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08111728000047"></a>I am grateful to both noble Lords for tabling amendments that are constructively expressed, but the Government are not being definitive at this stage. We need to carry out extensive consultation before we can be definitive, which is why it should be recognised that the Government have amendments in place to create the capacity to act effectively. We are not in a position to be definitive in primary legislation about just where that categorisation takes place or how the reporting should be conducted.</p>

Indeed, it very much reflects the sentiment that the Minister has been trying to express; namely, that there is no need to hold back on getting something going simply because there are difficulties with smaller companies. Perhaps one would never include smaller companies in such a scheme.</p>

That interpretation of his Amendment No. 47B does not detract from the Government&#146;s case, which I have been putting. In fact, it largely follows the line of thinking that I have sought to express. However, we already have this framework in the Bill. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would not give us any additional flexibility. In fact, we have a slightly greater definition than we are prepared to accept at this point, but I do not think that the positions of the Government and the noble Lord are that far apart. He properly recognises that a considerable amount of additional work needs to be done in consultation. I hear the pleas on all sides. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, would not be in her place if she was not concerned to speed the Government&#146;s processes and I accept the point that she made.</p>

<a name="81117-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08111728000050"></a>I am merely indicating that the Government need flexibility with regard to this issue. We know that we have to legislate with precision. The whole point of secondary legislation is to fulfil that role. In such an important Bill as this, it would be wrong to insert precision which is not accurate and which we cannot defend. At the same time, it is essential that we have a framework on which we can make considerable progress. I do not think that the Government&#146;s proposals are vastly different from that of the noble Lord. Having heard how close we are to his thinking, I hope that he will not feel it necessary to divide the House on such a limited disagreement.</p>

Eight years&#146; worth of data and pressure for mandatory reporting seem to indicate that the Government are taking rather a long time to reach a view.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000016"></a>The ITTO was established at a time when there was increasing concern about the fate of tropical forests and when it was recognised that, unless tropical forests could provide a significant income to the countries in which they were found, they would be cut down and replaced by agriculture.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000017"></a>The ITTO pioneered ways of measuring the sustainability of the management of forests, and this led to the development of certification schemes. Some 320 million hectares of the world&#146;s forests have now been certified as sustainably managed. Most of these forests are in Europe and North America, where the governance of forests is strong, not least because the institutions, like our own Forestry Commission, are strong.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000018"></a>In Africa and Asia, only 0.1 per cent of forests have been certified as sustainably managed. Problems of poor governance and underinvestment in the capacity to manage and regulate forests have held back many

The ITTO can help to build that capacity with the information, technical guidance and training that it provides, as well as with project funding.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000019"></a>Since it became operational in 1987, the ITTO has funded more than 800 projects at a cost of $300 million. Project funding has not always been well focused and had become out of step with the approaches to funding favoured by development agencies.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000020"></a>The 2006 ITTA recognises this and provides for new thematic programmes which will focus efforts on a small number of priorities, such as forest law enforcement and governance, forests and climate change, and community forest management and enterprises. In making available to its members up-to-date information about prices from around the world, ITTO&#146;s market information service helps reduce the transfer pricing that used to plague the tropical timber trade.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000021"></a>ITTO has been responsive to the suggestions of civil society and private sector advisory groups by, for example, championing the development of community-based forest enterprises. It has been active in promoting the restoration of degraded forests as part of the Global Partnership for Forest Landscape Restoration, to which the UK Forestry Commission lends its support.</p>

There have in the past been certification schemes for timber coming into this country which have failed many of the tests, but we now have new schemes&#151;the Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification&#151;that have been much more successful. I was struck particularly by the Minister&#146;s statistic that although the agreement has had a major impact in Europe and North America, only a pathetic 0.1 per cent of forests had been certified as sustainably managed in Asia, where the real challenges lie. We know that Indonesia&#146;s deforestation accounts for something like 3 per cent to 5 per cent of total carbon emissions per annum. I am not sure about the situation in South America. Does the agreement have anything other than a cosmetic effect on what we are trying to achieve, and how can it be made better? It is a

<p><a name="0811173000026"></a><a name="81117-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0811173000169"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, for his points. This is an important issue. Deforestation accounts for 17 per cent of world CO2, which is more than that from all the world&#146;s transport emissions. It is crucial that we tackle it. Recent work has suggested that, by 2020, we could halve it with the right investment, and that, by 2030, we could probably go to a carbon-neutral forestry environment. Those are worthwhile objectives.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000027"></a>The agreement sustains and redirects the ITTO. That is important because the ITTO has achieved a number of things during the past 20 years. It is about creating standards to describe what sustainability is about and an information system that makes the world markets much more transparent. We need those as essential building blocks in the sort of very big initiatives that will be needed by the world as a whole to tackle this problem&#151;and it is a problem that we must solve. For instance, the UK Government are working with the European Commission on a diligence regulation that will require traders in timbers to adopt certain standards in certificating reports, and so on. That can happen only on the basis of the ITTO&#146;s work in the past. The basis of the ITTO&#146;s work in future will be to maintain those facilities and to move to much more directed and thematic operations. So it is right to approve the order.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000028"></a>Although we should not underrate the value of the ITTO, bigger initiatives will be needed to tackle this large problem. Of the various carbon challenges, however, this is the most obviously solvable, provided that we get the right international momentum.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000031"></a>The noble Lord said: The draft order will confer the legal capacities of a body corporate and privileges and immunities upon the International Organisation for Migration&#151;the IOM. The draft order also confers privileges and immunities on representatives of the states parties, the director-general and officials of the organisation. These privileges and immunities are conferred in accordance with the co-operation agreement with the IOM which was signed on behalf of the United Kingdom on 6 July 2006.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000032"></a>The co-operation agreement between the UK and the IOM is similar to other agreements entered into by the UK with other international organisations having their headquarters or other offices in the UK&#151;for example the International Maritime Organisation, the Commonwealth Secretariat or the North East Atlantic  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Fisheries Commission. By conferring on the IOM the legal capacity of a body corporate, the order allows the IOM to have the legal capacity of a body corporate to assist with its day-to-day dealings in the UK&#151;for example, to contract, acquire and dispose of immovable and moveable property and to institute legal proceedings.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000033"></a>The privileges and immunities to be accorded to the IOM and specified categories of individuals connected with the organisation are similar to those routinely granted to this type of international organisation with offices in the UK. The provisions in the order have been closely scrutinised by the relevant departments, such as Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and have been considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Merits Committee of this House. The privileges and immunities to be accorded to the IOM are the minimum necessary to enable the organisation to function effectively in the UK.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000034"></a>Noble Lords may have an interest in the extension of immunity from being sued and legal process to staff working for the IOM. I draw their attention to Article 10(1)(a) of the order, which limits the immunity for all IMO staff, except the Head of Office, to,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000149"></a>&#147;acts done or omitted to be done in the course of the performance of official duties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000035"></a>Article 11(1) of the co-operation agreement also states that the privileges and immunities provided for individuals,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000150"></a>&#147;are granted solely to ensure the unimpeded functioning of the Organisation and the complete independence of the persons to whom they are accorded. They are not granted for the personal benefit of the individuals concerned&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000036"></a>Noble Lords will wish to be aware that the total number of IOM staff in the UK is currently 82. The order being considered today therefore does not provide a large increase in the number of individuals enjoying privileges and immunities in the UK, which is currently around 24,000.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000037"></a>The order also exempts the IOM and its staff from certain taxes; for example, income tax. Again, this is a normal provision with such orders, as exemption from taxation is based on the principle that no member state of such an international organisation should derive undue fiscal benefit from the funds subscribed to the organisation by all its members. Taxation of the IOM, or its staff salaries, would run counter to that general principle.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000038"></a>Managed migration remains a key priority for the Government at home and overseas. The global environment is challenging: there are 200 million migrants worldwide, and the number is increasing. Our task is to make migration work for Britain, creating borders that are open to those who bring skills, talent, business and creativity, yet closed to those who might cause us harm or seek to enter illegally.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000039"></a>The IOM is headquartered in Geneva. It was founded in 1951 as an intergovernmental organisation to resettle European displaced persons, refugees and migrants. Its mission now is no less important than it was then&#151;to ensure that those forced from their countries by the horror of war can be provided with immediate practical solutions, humanitarian assistance and resettlement or return.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000040"></a>The IOM currently has 125 member states, with a further 16 states and 74 international and non-governmental organisations holding observer status. It has offices and operations on every continent, with 5,600 staff members serving in more than 400 field locations in more than 100 countries. It is dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration in partnership with Governments and migrants. As a key partner for Governments and non-governmental organisations it helps support and facilitate return and reintegration arrangements, running suitably structured projects in priority countries.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000041"></a>What does the IOM do for us? In close partnership with the FCO, the Department for International Development and the UK Border Agency, it makes a significant contribution to government objectives in supporting managed migration for the UK and in the wider international context. For example, it has been essential in developing and delivering the Government&#146;s assisted voluntary return programmes. Since 1999, these programmes have enabled the return to their countries of origin of over 18,000 failed asylum seekers, and of over 2,600 illegal migrants since 2004. It has supported capacity-building in migration and border management for Ethiopian immigration authorities and recently assisted stranded migrants in Libya to return home to Ethiopia.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000042"></a>The IOM delivers reintegration assistance in countries of origin for foreign national prisoners returning under the facilitated returns scheme. This UK Border Agency programme has returned over 2,000 foreign national prisoners since it was introduced in October 2006.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000043"></a>The IOM is also a key partner in the delivery of the Gateway Protection Programme under which, working with the UNHCR, the UK Government accept and resettle refugees from camps abroad. It delivers the logistics of the programme, including medical screening, documentation and transportation. The organisation has also provided emergency assistance to vulnerable populations in Zimbabwe; information campaigns to prevent irregular migration in Afghanistan; enhanced border-control capacity in Cambodia; and emergency shelter and non-food item projects&#151;such as clothing, bedding and household items and medical kit&#151;in Burma in the wake of Cyclone Nargis.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000044"></a>The IOM is funded through contributions from member states. We contributed around $55 million in 2007 for operational programmes and approximately &#163;1.35 million as our assessed contribution to IOM&#146;s core budget, which is its administrative budget.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000045"></a>The order will allow the UK to comply with its international obligations in giving full effect to the privileges and immunities agreed in the co-operation agreement of which I spoke. This will enable the IOM to continue to develop its strong partnership with the UK. We are satisfied that the order is compatible with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, and I beg to move.</p>

In his introduction he made it clear that the order is intended to offer immunities and privileges only to IOM members based here in the United Kingdom for acts that are done, as he put it, in accordance with their proper duties, and that it is not intended for the personal benefit of individuals. The order does not offer the same sort of cover in terms of immunities as that enjoyed by full-scale diplomats based in the United Kingdom. I therefore take it that the order extends only to the 82 individuals working for the organisation here and not to members of their families or any others.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000048"></a>The Minister said that some 125 countries are members of the IOM, but he thought that more might join in due course. Is it likely that the number of people employed by the IOM in the United Kingdom will increase over the years, or will it remain at a relatively small figure for the foreseeable future?</p>

In my experience, however, they are not routine. As employees of such organisations are often exempt from UK legislation, their working rights are severely diminished because they work for international bodies. Their rights and entitlements are different from those of their neighbours, the people they come to work with and live alongside. I find it extraordinary. Employees of these organisations cannot understand why the laws of the country in which they live do not apply to them and why they have lesser entitlements than others. The Minister commented on the rather generous contributions that we give to this organisation to cover operational and

Can he give a mild assurance that the Government will at least seek, through their membership of the board and their financial contributions, assurances that employment standards at the organisation will be maintained, or that there will be an attempt to try to bring employment standards into line with those to which we as citizens of the United Kingdom are entitled?</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000055"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, queried whether all 82 individuals will be entitled to these privileges, in particular an entitlement not to pay tax&#151;I would argue that probably not all 82 will be entitled to it because it would apply to diplomatic status at a senior level&#151;but can the Minister say whether only high officials of the organisation will be entitled to full diplomatic status and privileges, or all 82? If all 82 are entitled, that will have, if nothing else, a deleterious effect on the Exchequer.</p>

There is nothing unusual about what we are doing as far as the IOM is concerned. The representatives who would come from another country to work at the IOM and the head of mission here are given status comparable with what could be described as that of a diplomatic agent. They enjoy most personal immunity and diplomatic privileges, but other members of the organisation have immunity only in respect of their official acts, so there is a distinction. That limited immunity includes exemption from UK tax for all 82. On the principle that I outlined when introducing the order, a member country such as ours should not have the advantage of gaining membership money&#151;which is what, if they had to pay tax, it would be&#151;from those employed by it.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000057"></a>There is no immunity from criminal offences. In answer to a question that has not been asked, people would have to pay the congestion charge and would be liable for parking offences if they ever breached parking regulations, which I am sure they would not.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000058"></a>I hope that that answers the questions. I take the noble Baroness&#146;s point; she has great experience in this field. But the good news is that this organisation does an excellent job. We are proud to be members of it, and the order simply confirms what the agreement of 2006 suggested.</p>

Research repeatedly shows that employment is key to reducing reoffending, and for this reason the Government are entirely committed to encouraging the rehabilitation of ex-offenders into employment. The Act also makes it unlawful to make an unauthorised disclosure of the details of such convictions.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000062"></a>However, hand in hand with this goes the need to protect the vulnerable and to assess a person&#146;s suitability for work of a sensitive nature. The Act therefore grants power to the Secretary of State to exclude application of these general rules in relation to particular employers, bodies and proceedings. The rationale behind this is to ensure that employers and bodies offering positions, professions and licences of a more sensitive nature are able to assess an applicant&#146;s full criminal history before making a decision. This power was exercised in 1975, when the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order came into effect. That order has been amended periodically to ensure that the criminal disclosure regime keeps pace with changes in employment and public risk.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000064"></a>This amendment order serves three substantive purposes, each of which is important and necessary. First, it updates definitions relating to childcare; secondly, it extends the scope of the exceptions order to cover cautions, reprimands and final warnings; and, thirdly, it adds a new category to the exceptions order, that of non-lawyer managers. I should like to address each of these in turn.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000065"></a>First, this instrument updates definitions related to childcare to bring them into line with recent legislation and to ensure that legislation from across Whitehall is consistent in this very important area; namely, the order changes the definitions of childminding and day care to make them consistent with the Childcare Act 2006. From 1 September 2008, childcare provision in England is regulated under Part 3 of the Act, and regulations made under it require enhanced CRB disclosures of those caring for children and others who may have contact with children on childcare premises. The exceptions order already enables those working with children to be subject to CRB disclosures, so there is no change to the scope of those covered; rather, it enables an existing scheme to be continued. In essence, this provision does little more than update a reference to an old piece of legislation and insert a reference to its successor. As such, I hope that it is an uncontroversial, if crucial, technical amendment.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000066"></a>The second feature of this amendment is that it extends the definition of conviction to include cautions, reprimands and final warnings. This will enable us to implement the corresponding provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which some of us had the pleasure of seeing through the House. I should  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clarify from the start that the order has no impact whatever on the legal status of a caution, reprimand or warning, and that reclassifying them as convictions for the purpose of this order in no way escalates the seriousness of this disposal. Actually, it works in favour of those who have been issued with a caution, reprimand or final warning. Until now, the group of people issued with a minor disposal of this kind could never benefit from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act because, as these disposals were not convictions, they were never spent. This was an obvious and serious inconsistency, and we hope that the provisions to amend the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which we now seek to implement, have the support of the Committee. However, before these provisions are implemented, it is essential that the exceptions order is updated in tandem. The reason, which I am sure is clear, is to ensure that, where there is good cause, cautions, reprimands and final warnings can still be disclosed under a full criminal records check.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000067"></a>Thirdly, the provision expands the list of sensitive positions which qualify for disclosure of spent conviction information to include the newly created position of non-lawyer &#147;approved legal services body manager&#148;. The Legal Services Act 2007 introduces reforms that will bring great benefits to consumers and the legal profession. However, it is essential that we do not allow the level of probity and integrity of the legal profession and the protection of consumers to be undermined. I remind the Committee that the Act will enable alternative business structures, allowing lawyers and non-lawyers to work together in new forms of business structures to provide a range of services. Full alternative business structures cannot come into force until the Legal Services Board, the new oversight regulator, is operational, which is expected in 2010. In the mean time, the Act enables a limited form of alternative business structure to emerge. These legal disciplinary practices will, for the first time, allow the collaboration of lawyers and non-lawyers in the ownership and control of law firms. Traditionally, a partner in a law firm was required to be either a solicitor or his equivalent, such as a registered foreign lawyer. The Solicitors Regulation Authority, the regulatory arm of the Law Society, plans to regulate these new forms of practice from March next year. This will of course be subject to the approval of rule changes necessary to regulate legal disciplinary practices.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000068"></a>Permitting non-lawyers to manage legal services bodies will place them in a sensitive position. They will potentially have access to sensitive client information and assets and will manage others with such access. They may also have access to the vulnerable individuals whom legal practices frequently represent. For these reasons, they must be assessed as suitable for such a position by the SRA, which will carry out the same vetting procedures for non-lawyer managers as they currently do for their lawyer counterparts.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000069"></a>This provision serves a simple purpose: to protect consumers of legal services and ensure that the recent reforms leave no loophole through which to escape the high standards or erode the public trust which characterises the legal profession. I hope the Committee will accept that there is nothing in the order that has not already

However, it is essential that public protection keeps pace with other legislation, and for that reason the instrument serves an important purpose. I beg to move.</p>

However, as a former member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, I should ask the Minister to address the point in the Explanatory Memorandum about the vires of the orders. They are dealt with in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.7, where the department confesses that it got wrong the drafting of the original 1974 Act&#151;I presume that it was a Labour Government who passed it, but it has been around for a long time. The Ministry of Justice suggests in paragraph 3.7 that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000151"></a>&#147;it regrets the error, and will seek to correct the primary legislation at an early opportunity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000140"></a>Well, 1974 to 2008 is quite a long time. Will the Minister explain to the Committee&#151;it is important that it is on the record&#151;exactly what went wrong with the original drafting of the Act, why it was not spotted earlier, whether the department thinks that it has the powers to make the order and whether there is any doubt about the technical validity of any of the previous exception orders, of which there have been a number? The Minister said that the first order was made in 1975. As I said, I am perfectly happy about the merits of the order, but it is important that the Ministry of Justice gets the drafting of the legislation right. Back in 1974, of course, it was done by the Home Office. We hope that the department will seek, as it states, to correct that error in primary legislation at an early opportunity.</p>

The amendments in Article 3, which bring cautions, reprimands and final warnings into the scope of the exceptions order, are consequential to Section 49 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, which brought cautions within the scope of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. We supported that, saw it coming down the road and welcomed it when the Act was going through. I broadly welcome what is being done here, because we on these Benches have always argued for allowing these disposals to be spent in the spirit of rehabilitation&#151;you cannot carry them with you for the rest of your life.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000073"></a>While I have the Minister trapped in the Room, perhaps I may move him on a little and ask him whether the Government are likely to implement the recommendations of the report of the review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, <I>Breaking the Circle</I>, which was published in 2002. This report recommended a new disclosure scheme, including&#151;and this is why I

Can the Minister indicate whether that document is still alive and is being given consideration or whether it has gone by the wayside? We would wish to see many of its recommendations implemented.</p>

As to government plans for the north-west and Wales, where will the new prison or prisons be located? Will they be Titans or not, and how many will there be? How soon will Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s decisions be announced&#151;perhaps as part of an imminent capital building programme, perhaps next Monday? Can my noble friend deal with the queries I have raised?</p>

<p><a name="0811173000075"></a><a name="81117-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0811173000180"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the three noble Lords who have spoken. First, in answer to my noble friend Lord Jones, I cannot give a date when announcements will be made about the prisons. I pay tribute to his interest in this topic over many years and, when a decision is made, he will be the first to know. I am grateful for his interest in this order.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000076"></a>As to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, about the Act, we committed to reforming it following the recommendations set out in the document that she mentioned. We have since had to review the position in the light of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which was based on the Bichard report recommendations. As she knows, that made significant changes to the disclosure landscape. We remain committed to reform but no time has been allocated to it in this Parliament and no timescale has yet been set. We agree that this legislation now needs to be brought up to date but I cannot give her any clue as to when that might be. The issue is alive, but whether or not it is kicking I am not sure.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000077"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, used his lawyer&#146;s skill to put me on the spot about the misuse of the words &#147;paragraph 3(3)&#148; instead of &#147;paragraph 3(2)&#148;&#151;or was it &#147;paragraph 3(2)&#148; instead of &#147;paragraph 3(3)&#148;?&#151;but he makes an important point. However, let me put him right about one thing which I am sure will comfort him: this paragraph had nothing whatever to do with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. It was first introduced in the 2008 Act and deals with the exception of cautions which, as the noble Lord knows, was not part of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act until this year. This is the first order made in relation to cautions and so there is no danger of any other amendment orders being ultra vires.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000078"></a>The JCSI, to its credit, found a drafting error in the primary legislative provision. The reference in the second line of paragraph 4(a) to &#147;paragraph 3(2)&#148; should be to &#147;paragraph 3(3)&#148;. The erroneous cross-reference has arisen because paragraph 3(2) was inserted after the original draft clauses were drafted and the cross-reference has not been updated to reflect that.

The reference can be properly read as referring to paragraph 3(3) and thus provides the proper vires for this order. The noble Lord will be glad to hear that when the opportunity arises we will correct the drafting error. Parliamentary counsel are, as we speak, making inquiries as to whether the House authorities might be willing to issue a correction slip, given that the error is clearly a mere typographical error. I hope that it will not be necessary to debate the issue.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="0811173000006"></a>Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (Amendment) Order 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="0811173000161"></a>4.25 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0811173000080"></a><a name="81117-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0811173000181"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (Amendment) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000081"></a>The noble Lord said: The last decade has seen a complete reform of the way in which the justice system deals with young people who offend. At every stage of the process, the Government have introduced measures aimed at steering the young person away from offending behaviour and into more worthwhile and positive activities. At the pre-court stage there are now, depending on the seriousness of the offence, a range of alternatives to prosecution in the criminal courts for those under 18, which involve principally reprimands and warnings. When the young person does go to court, we have introduced the referral order and a new range of community interventions, which will be replaced with and, I believe, improved by, the youth rehabilitation order under the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. When custody is unavoidable, we have brought in the new two-part custodial/community order, the detention and training order; and we have transformed custodial provision for under-18s, setting up discrete custodial estates for boys, in 2000, and girls, in 2006.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000082"></a>At the heart of all these changes has been the Youth Justice Board; it was established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 with a wide remit to advise the Secretary of State on matters relating to youth justice. Its role was expanded in April 2000, when it assumed responsibility for purchasing and commissioning custodial places and general oversight of the secure estate for children and young people. Section 41(6)(b) of the Crime and Disorder Act provides that the Secretary of State may by order provide that any function of his which is exercisable in relation to the youth justice system shall be exercisable concurrently with the board. To enable the board to exercise effectively its new functions in relation to the secure estate, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales Order 2000 designated a wide range of concurrent functions. These included, for example, power to contract for the provision and running of secure training centres and a number of the powers in the Secure Training Centre Rules relating to the day-to-day running of centres.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000083"></a>Secure training centres are not the only form of contracted-out secure accommodation in the under-18 estate. There are also two contracted-out young offender  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>institutions&#151;Ashfield, near Bristol, and Parc, near Bridgend. The contracts for these establishments have been managed by the Office for National Commissioning on behalf of the Secretary of State. In the case of Parc, we intend to continue that arrangement, as the establishment also accommodates young adults, by which I mean those aged 18 to 20, as well as adult offenders, although the Committee should be aware these offenders are kept separately from the under-18s. It makes sense for the ONC to retain the lead, with input from the Youth Justice Board on the management of the under-18 accommodation.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000084"></a>Ashfield is a different case, because it accommodates only those serving juvenile sentences and remanded young people under 18. We believe that the Youth Justice Board is better placed to oversee management of the contract of a purely under-18 establishment and the main immediate purpose of the order is to give the board the necessary powers to do that effectively. Article 2(3)(c) fulfils that purpose, among other things. In that article, the concurrent powers given to the board in respect of contracted-out young offender institutions mirror the powers which the board can exercise in relation to contracted-out secure training centres. It will of course enable the board to let and manage contracts for contracted-out young offender institutions.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000085"></a>The draft order also makes small additions to the concurrent powers that the board can exercise in relation to secure training centres. For instance, each centre is required to establish systems of privileges, incentives and sanctions appropriate to the classes of trainees and their ages, characters and circumstances. Each centre must also have a library and every trainee is allowed to have library books appropriate to his or her age and to exchange them. The systems of privileges, incentives and sanctions must be approved by the Secretary of State and the right to receive and exchange library books is subject to any directions he may give. These are operational functions for which the board is generally responsible and in relation to which it is well placed to exercise judgment.</p>
<h5><a name="0811173000162"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000086"></a>The draft order also makes two changes to the board&#146;s responsibilities for placing young people in custody. It already decides placements for the great majority of under-18s sentenced to custody&#151;those who receive detention and training orders. The order will permit the board, additionally, to make placements of offenders sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty&#146;s pleasure under Section 90 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and to long-term detention under Section 91 of that Act.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000087"></a>In addition, under subsection (7A) of Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, young people whom the courts remand to the care of a local authority with a requirement that they be placed in secure accommodation may be placed in a secure training centre. Such placements at present require the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. As the expertise on placements lies with the Youth Justice Board, it makes sense for the board to be able to give the necessary consent, so the order does this.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000088"></a>Article 3 of the draft order is very similar in effect to Article 2. It expands references to &#147;the Secretary of State&#148; in Rule 13 of the Young Offender Institution Rules, which specifies to whom the governor of a young offender institution may disclose certain information relating to trainees, so as also to refer to,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000152"></a>&#147;an officer of the Youth Justice Board&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000141"></a>We were advised that, as Rule 13 concerns the functions of the governor rather than of the Secretary of State, it was not a potentially concurrent function under Section 41(6) of the Crime and Disorder Act. It is therefore a consequential change. The effect of the change, however, is the same in that the information may be disclosed to the board in place of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000089"></a>Finally, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales Order 2000 contains a number of references to provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. These have subsequently been consolidated into the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3)(a) and parts of paragraph (3)(c) of Article 2 update those references. Article 2(3)(b) makes a similar updating in relation to Section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, where the provisions have been consolidated into the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000090"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (Amendment) Order 2008. <I>29th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Patel of Bradford.</I>)</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000092"></a>I have only one question for the noble Lord. He drew a distinction between Her Majesty&#146;s Ashfield young offender institution, which the Youth Justice Board will be able to take on and in respect of which it will be able to do the job of the Secretary of State in due course, and Parc young offender institution. Parc is also contracted out but, because it also deals with over-18s, he stated that it would not be suitable to be looked after by the Youth Justice Board. If other young offender institutions were created in the future that were similar to Ashfield and not conducted on the same lines as Parc&#151;that is, as part of an over-18 institution&#151;would the Youth Justice Board also be able to take them on, would we need a further order at that point or would this order deal with that? I can see why the noble Lord draws a distinction between the two contracted-out institutions, Ashfield and Parc, but I want to know what the position would be for a second Ashfield, rather than a second Parc.</p>

I do not have any great concerns with the order, but there are two or three things which I wonder whether I might be able to flesh out.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000094"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum to the order, as well as the Minister in his remarks, refers to Ashfield and explains how it is currently contracted out, but says that the Youth Justice Board wishes to take it under its remit. It says that it will be,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000153"></a>&#147;more appropriate for management of the contract to transfer to the Board&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000142"></a>That is vague terminology. For those of us familiar with the history of Ashfield&#151;and it was only 2003 when the Youth Justice Board in shock and horror walked away from it, given its extremely alarming track record at that point in time&#151;this seems to be rather cryptic. What does &#147;more appropriate&#148; for the management now mean? Why is it more appropriate now when it was not appropriate then?</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000095"></a>Since we had a little bit of additional time, I took the trouble to look up the Ministry of Justice&#146;s NOMS, <I>Nationally Commissioned Services</I> annual report. The key performance targets for Ashfield show that of the targets missed, serious assaults cause most concern and continue to be actively monitored at the establishment. So there are still issues. We are not all there with Ashfield. Given the vagueness of how this provision is worded, and with the knowledge of Ashfield&#146;s history, one wonders what is appropriate about doing this now.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000096"></a>Moreover, to be specific, in reading the literature around this, I cannot see the obvious benefit of this transfer. I say that with some reason. Previously, when we have had problems in Ashfield the accountability and the responsibility&#151;particularly in terms of answering here, but generally the accountability&#151;seems to have fallen between the cracks. Each body would say that that particular area concerned was not their responsibility and that it was the other body&#146;s responsibility, whether it was the Probation Service, NOMS, the private contractors running it, or so on. Can the Minister tell us who will now be responsible and accountable the next time something goes wrong?</p>

<p><a name="0811173000097"></a>That was my broad point, and then I have one or two specific smaller queries. They concern Article 3, which makes a consequential change to the Young Offender Institution Rules. Where the board has entered into a contract for running young offender institutions for people under 18, it allows for the director of that establishment to make a disclosure of certain information to an officer of the board. That is a pretty wide purview. What is the relevant interest? Why do they need to be able to disclose this information to an officer of the board? It seems rather macro, individual level information. Why do the people whom the information concerns have to be identifiable? That is the way I read it&#151;they are identifiable. What I am trying to say is, since you are identifying the individual, would this information be for statistical monitoring purposes? In that case, should it not be anonymised so that it is not evident who the particular individual was? Who is an officer of the Secretary of State?  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Again, there are concerns about data and privacy information here. Would it be any civil servant? If so, why would they need to have access to this information? What evades me in general is why somebody so far removed from the running of the estate should need to have that kind of information. Why would an officer of a young offender institution, rather than that particular youth offender institution, be involved in requiring and possibly storing this information, and how long would that information be kept?</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000098"></a>We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. We have some sympathy with the broad outlines of what he is trying to do.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000099"></a></p>

<p><a name="0811173000100"></a><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0811173000184"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, for their kind remarks in welcoming me to the Dispatch Box. After I finish answering their questions, I will probably be a bit calmer.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000101"></a>The noble Lord and noble Baroness both raised helpful points. Before I answer the noble Lord&#146;s specific question about whether we need another order, it is probably worth putting it on record that despite the fact that Parc is not entirely run by the Youth Justice Board, the board will work closely with the ONC in respect of the under-18s estate. So while it does not have the power completely to manage Parc it still has a key role to play for the under-18s. We do not have to lay another order: this would do for any institution similar to Ashfield, should one come on board.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000102"></a>On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, up to now Ashfield has been managed by the Home Office and NOMS. Until 2005, as I mentioned earlier, it accommodated over-18s, but now it has only under-18s. We feel that given all the Youth Justice Board&#146;s expertise and work over the past number of years, it is the right organisation to oversee that contract. The noble Baroness rightly referred to accountability. The Youth Justice Board will be accountable to Ministers for Ashfield&#146;s performance.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000103"></a>It is probably worth underlining some of the key issues at Ashfield. It re-roled in July 2005 to accommodate only under-18s; it has its own healthcare facilities and education department and a learning resource centre as well as good recreational facilities. It is seen to be performing well in providing education, with good weekend and evening programmes, and I was heartened to see that it provides 24-hour nursing care. There are good links to the local CAMHS provision, which is particularly important. Few around the country are really good enough.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000104"></a>Ashfield has developed restorative justice programmes and adopted therapeutic crisis intervention as a behaviour management technique. It has also closed its segregation facilities and now runs resettlement programmes from the unit. So we can see that there are some positive issues there.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000105"></a>As to why such information should be disclosed to the Youth Justice Board, it is important to realise that Rule 13 permits disclosure by a governor or director; it does not require it. We do not envisage frequent disclosure of such material, just as there is not at present frequent disclosure to the Secretary of State, but there may be instances in which it is appropriate. If the Secretary of State were managing the contract,  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this information could be disclosed. For example, the Youth Justice Board will have an obligation to ensure proper performance of the contract and value for money for the public purse, just as the Secretary of State has. That might be a useful area for advice. I hope that that answers the noble Baroness&#146;s question.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000106"></a>It is useful, in considering the board&#146;s role in relation to the under-18 secure estate, to think back to the position before the board was given responsibility for this oversight. The mixing of young people and adults was common, the amount of education provided in young offender institutions was very limited and the standards of the facilities were generally much lower.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000107"></a>It is generally accepted that standards have risen markedly during the past 10 years, and the Youth Justice Board deserves much of the credit for that. Of course, a great deal remains to be done, and the noble Baroness has a lot of expertise in this area. I am sure that there always will be a lot left to be done. But we should ask ourselves whether provision for young people under 18 would be better or worse Youth Justice Board had not been overseeing its management. The answer to that is clear.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000108"></a>The draft order represents a very limited addition to the wide powers given to the board in 2008. The order is needed to enable the board to oversee the management of Ashfield Young Offenders&#146; Institution effectively and other young offender institutions, should they be established. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000109"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="0811173000007"></a>Legal Services Act 2007 (Functions of a Designated Regulator) Order 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="0811173000163"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0811173000110"></a><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0811173000185"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Legal Services Act 2007 (Functions of a Designated Regulator) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000111"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is presented under Schedule 22 to the Legal Services Act 2007. It will amend the new Section 9A of the Administration of Justice Act 1985, as inserted by Schedule 16 to the 2007 Act, to remove a restriction on the types of bodies which would satisfy the definition of legal services bodies, and which may therefore qualify to be recognised by the Law Society as suitable to carry on certain legal services.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000112"></a>When commenced, new Sections 9 and 9A of the 1985 Act will allow bodies satisfying a management and control condition and relevant lawyer condition to become legal services bodies. The management and control condition is that at least 75 per cent of the managers, shareholders or holders of voting rights in the body must be legally qualified. The term &#147;legally qualified&#148; is defined to include bodies as well as individuals, but 75 per cent of the bodies&#146; owners and managers must be legally qualified individuals.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000113"></a>Legally qualified bodies are therefore limited to two levels of ownership&#151;the corporate body and its individual owners. It would not be possible for law firms to have  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>multiple tiers of ownership, where law firms may own other firms, trust or service bodies which, in turn, own other organisations. Following discussions with the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Law Society, it became clear that Section 9 of the 1985 Act, as currently drafted, does not restrict recognised bodies in this way and that some of the law firms they regulate currently have multiple tiers of ownership. Should Section 9A be commenced as drafted, bodies with more than two levels of ownership would be in breach of the Section 9A ownership requirements and would be forced to restructure in order to qualify as legal services bodies and thereby fall within the recognised body regime. This restructuring would be of great expense to those firms and would have caused an unnecessary restriction that does not currently exist.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000114"></a>Firms are currently able to structure themselves in a way which is most effective and efficient for their operation, such as allowing easier transfer of ownership in the event of a partner leaving or retiring. Section 9A as currently drafted would have limited firms&#146; ability to structure themselves to meet their business needs. The proposed amendment to Section 9A will remove this restriction, allowing firms to realise the benefits of outside investment while maintaining the flexibility of the old regime.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000115"></a>This order seeks to ensure that bodies with multiple tiers can continue to operate in their current structures and be recognised as legally qualified for the purposes of Section 9A. If those bodies then meet the management and control condition, and the relevant lawyer condition, they will satisfy the legal services body definition and may be recognised by the Solicitors Regulation Authority under Section 9 as suitable to carry on certain legal services.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000116"></a>The order achieves this by removing the requirement in Section 9A(5) for qualifying bodies to be owned by legally qualified individuals in order to satisfy the relevant lawyer condition; by recognising partnerships which already exist and which continue to satisfy the Law Society&#146;s relevant pre-commencement conduct rules as legally qualified for the purpose of satisfying the management and control condition; by recognising bodies corporate which already exist and which continue to satisfy the Law Society&#146;s relevant pre-commencement conduct rules as legally qualified for the purpose of satisfying the management and control condition; and by giving the Law Society power to make rules expanding the category of what is to be legally qualified for the purpose of satisfying the management and control condition.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000117"></a>These bodies must satisfy all the conditions in Section 9A in order to be &#147;legal services bodies&#148;. These conditions are important as they make up some of the safeguards to ensure that legal services bodies do not go beyond what was envisaged under the legal services body provisions. They are, after all, bodies that provide legal services, are majority-owned by lawyers and therefore pose a lower regulatory risk.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000118"></a>It is vital, therefore, that in removing the two-tier limitation on corporate ownership we do not allow full alternative business structures to emerge before the licensing regime set out in Part 5 of the Act is implemented. The 25 per cent limit on non-lawyer  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>management and the requirement for those managers to be individuals will remain regardless of the number of tiers of ownership of a body. The bodies corporate defined as legally qualified in new subsection (6)(g)&#151;that is, those recognised by the Law Society under Section 9 of the 1985 Act&#151;have already undergone stringent Law Society regulation and recognition and satisfied the Law Society that they are suitable for carrying on solicitor services under current legislation. These bodies are also subject to the Law Society&#146;s pre-commencement rules.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000119"></a>The Law Society&#146;s rules that may also permit recognition of other bodies as legally qualified are subject to consultation and a statutory approval process under paragraph 16 of Schedule 22 to the 2007 Act, which includes approval by the Lord Chancellor. The Solicitors Regulation Authority also published changes to its code of conduct on 17 October to take account of the proposed new provisions relating to legal services bodies. The consultation period for those rules closed on Monday, 10 November. Subject to Parliament agreeing this order, those rules will be subject to a robust approval process under Schedule 4 to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which requires approval by the Lord Chancellor following consultation with the designated judges. Finally, all bodies must still satisfy the management and control and relevant lawyer conditions in order to be legal services bodies which may then be recognised as suitable to provide legal services by the Law Society.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000120"></a>The procedure for achieving these changes is set out under paragraphs 1 to 4 of Schedule 22 to the 2007 Act, which enables the Lord Chancellor to make an order to modify the functions of a designated regulator or other body. Under paragraph 2 of that schedule, an order may be made by the Lord Chancellor providing that a recommendation has been made by the body to which it relates, and that the body has given its consent. In this case, the Law Society and Solicitors Regulation Authority both recommended on 1 October 2008 that an order be made and gave consent under paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 22.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000121"></a>Before the formal recommendation was made, Ministry of Justice officials had been working with the Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority to determine the content of the order. Other relevant stakeholders were also notified in advance of the formal recommendation being made, including the Lord Chief Justice, the Office of Fair Trading, representatives of consumer organisations and other approved regulators.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000122"></a>The Ministry of Justice published the draft order on 6 October, seeking views from legal regulators, the profession and consumer groups by 17 October. Schedule 22 also provides that advice must be invited from the Office of Fair Trading and the Lord Chief Justice. On completion of the consultation period, a total of nine responses were received, all of which supported the order. During the consultation period, some small changes were made to highlight relevant amendments to legislation to indicate that a copy of the relevant pre-commencement conduct rules will be available on the Solicitors Regulation Authority website, and to remove the word &#147;qualified&#148; in the definition of  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;legal partnership&#148; to avoid confusion. Under paragraph 3(7) of Schedule 22, if the order the Lord Chancellor intends to make differs from that which was published, he must publish a revised draft alongside a statement detailing the changes. This was done on the Ministry of Justice website on 24 October, and the Law Society and Solicitors Regulation Authority gave their consent under paragraph 2(4) of that schedule.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000123"></a>This order is necessary to realise the benefits of legal disciplinary practices as early as possible by allowing recognised bodies to take on non-lawyer managers if they so wish. Those bodies must, of course, still satisfy the management and control condition and relevant lawyer condition that place appropriate conditions on ownership. The order ensures that existing bodies are not forced to restructure simply to carry on with their business; a position which would have been unfair and anti-competitive. I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

After his clear explanation, I wish to make only one comment about the Explanatory Memorandum. I have on a number of occasions expressed concern about Explanatory Memoranda not being as clear as they might be and not assisting the House or the Committee much in understanding what is in an order. On this occasion the reverse is true. I am grateful for a very good Explanatory Memorandum which, in paragraph 7, goes as far as to say what is being done and why. I commend that paragraph heading to future Explanatory Memoranda and suggest that the Ministry of Justice and other departments should always bear it in mind; it would achieve a great deal. To have a paragraph such as paragraph 7, which makes quite clear what is being done and, more important, why, is of great benefit to those who have to scrutinise these orders. I thank the noble Lord and his department for doing that.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000126"></a><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0811173000187"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> I join in congratulating the noble Lord on his appointment and I look forward to dealing with him frequently on Ministry of Justice matters. At the same time, I commiserate with him for having to take on board the Legal Services Act 2007, which is a highly contentious Act, particularly in the area in which he is now putting forward this order.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000127"></a>I do not suppose that when the noble Lord joined the Labour Party he ever thought that he would be supporting fat cat, international and City lawyers against the high street practitioner, who is no doubt familiar to him from where he comes from, as it is familiar to me having been a high street solicitor in my day. The Law Society&#146;s briefing on this gives the game away. It states:</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="0811173000143"></a>note that it is the City&#151;</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="0811173000154"></a>&#147;consider that this restriction&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000144"></a>the one outlined by the noble Lord&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000155"></a>&#147;will have a specific impact on large and international law firms. Furthermore, with the advent of Legal Disciplinary Practices and in turn Alternative Business Structures, it is likely that firms will wish to innovate with more complex corporate structures. It would be a lost opportunity if law firms were unable to compete as effectively both nationally and globally by virtue of an inadvertent technical error&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000145"></a>So the proposal supported by the Law Society is not supported in the interests of the consumer in the rural areas, the people who may be put out of business by the introduction of alternative business schemes and the legal disciplinary practices envisaged.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000128"></a>I share the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, in the Explanatory Memorandum and how full it is. It is full because it contains all kinds of verbiage in order to conceal the precise reason why the order is being brought forward. It includes a revealing extract from Chapter 5 of the <I>Legal Services Bill Full R</I><I>egulatory </I><I>I</I><I>mpact </I><I>A</I><I>ssessment</I>, first published in November 2006, with a supplementary memorandum in 2007. When that was considered in the regulatory impact assessment it was stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0811173000148"></a>&#147;There is a risk that the anticipated increase in the level of competition in the legal services market could lead to the withdrawal of some inefficient suppliers of legal services from certain areas of the market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811173000146"></a>That is, your high street family solicitor. It goes on,</p>
<ul><a name="0811173000156"></a>&#147;In particular, inefficient suppliers on local high streets and in rural areas may be forced to close down under the pressure of greater competition from lower cost providers. This raises the potential risk of reducing consumer choices and could have an adverse effect on access to justice&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="0811173000164"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000129"></a>That was the argument that the Liberal Democrats put forward during the passage of the Bill. It is all very well permitting large firms to come into the market and provide capital when they are not lawyers so as to put out of business the lawyers who currently provide services. I know that north Wales in particular is an area served by the high street. The local supermarket, the AA or organisations of that sort, which have absolutely nothing to do with the provision of legal services or with law, may come forward and provide capital that the partners in large firms will eagerly grasp. The large firms of 200 or 300 partners will happily sell out a share and take the money from large organisations, but you cannot do that if you are a small local solicitors' office.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000130"></a>To say that these are innovations in the legal services market driven by greater competition, leading to new ways of legal services being delivered to consumers in rural areas, is just marketing speak; it has nothing to do with how the legal profession should organise itself. There was an attempt in that regulatory assessment to say that if you bring in outside firms, such as supermarkets or insurance companies, to provide legal services on the side, you will widen the opportunities for more women and people from lower income groups and different ethnic groups. I do not believe that; that is just being&#151;to use a phrase that is over-used&#151;politically correct, by going to these areas and saying that we will do a great deal more for these people.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>17 Nov 2008 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000131"></a>So what is the order all about? It amends an Act of Parliament. Let us realise its significance; it is not just the ordinary type of order, but one that actually changes the Act of Parliament that was passed, despite Liberal Democrat opposition, in 2007. That is its purpose. Why does it want to do that? Because it got it wrong. As the Explanatory Memorandum says, there are too many legally qualified persons required under Section 9A of the amended 1985 Act, which, in dealing with the legal disciplinary practices, still required that outside influences be limited to 25 per cent of the firm. That meant that the existing arrangements under the 1985 Act were being superseded in a way that did not appeal to the large corporate solicitors&#146; firms to which I have referred. Let us make no mistake about it, this changes an Act of Parliament in favour of the big guns and against the interests of the local solicitor who provides services to people on the ground.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000132"></a>I am putting down a marker to see how legal services operate in the next five or 10 years. It may be that the Law Society and the City of London are onside, but I want to see whether the services provided to ordinary people throughout this country, outside the conurbation of London and outside commercial lawyers, will be affected. I believe that they will and that there will ultimately be a reaction against the changes introduced by the 2007 Act and these additional changes to that Act made by this side wind.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000133"></a>Of course, today we are considering only the draft order&#151;and we, the Liberal Democrats, will have to consider how we approach the full order when it comes before the House. Again, let me welcome the noble Lord, Lord Patel, into this hornets&#146; nest, and I hope the buzzing is not too loud to drown out what I am saying.</p>

<p><a name="0811173000134"></a><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81117-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0811173000188"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I am not sure how to thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for his warm welcome. I shall begin by looking at some of the issues. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for his comments about the Explanatory Memorandum. As someone new to this area, I found it helpful and commend his points about paragraph 7, which explains what we are doing and why we are doing it. It provides an important lesson for us all and should be contained in future briefing notes.</p>

<a name="81117-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0811173000135"></a>This is a complicated but important issue. The order ensures that we do not restrict unnecessarily the organisational structures of bodies. Some bodies have already demonstrated that they are fit to provide legal services through the current recognised regime, and it would be improper to restrict them even further simply to allow them to be regarded as legally qualified. If such bodies wish to become legal services bodies under new Section 9 of the 1985 Act, they still have to satisfy the conditions set out in Section 9A.

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0811179000006"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (David Miliband), my honourable friend the Minister of State for International Development (Gareth Thomas), my noble friend the Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor) and I represented the UK.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0811179000007"></a>The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0811179000010"></a>The presidency presented its draft agenda, covering the economic and financial situation, climate change, the common agricultural policy, the Lisbon treaty and external relations (ESDP and Eastern Partnership).</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0811179000011"></a>The Government broadly welcome the presidency&#146;s agenda. In response to a question from my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, the presidency explained that there would not be a substantive discussion of the common agricultural policy (CAP); the European Council would be invited to take note of the Agriculture Council&#146;s decisions on the CAP health check. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary also noted that the EU's leadership in the global financial crisis now needed to be followed up by leadership on the real economy. On that basis, it was important to note the need for appropriate regulation, and transparency, of economic issues; that the EU should continue to promote the millennium development goals and international development; and that there was no contradiction between a strong economy and strong action to combat climate change.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0811179000014"></a>The council adopted conclusions and a declaration without discussion. The conclusions endorse the progress report on the implementation of the civilian headline goal 2010&#151;which aims to improve the quality and quantity of civilians deployed on ESDP missions&#151;and approve guidelines for lessons learned and best practice in civilian missions. The declaration sets out future workstreams under the civilian headline goal 2010. The Government welcome these positive steps towards further improving the EU's ability to stabilise countries emerging from conflict.</p>

The council agreed conclusions that expressed concern at the intensified fighting in North Kivu; welcomed increased humanitarian aid from the Commission and member states to those affected and called upon all parties to allow access for aid; condemned human rights violations in eastern DRC; supported the UN mission in the DRC (MONUC) and stressed the importance of forthcoming discussions of its mandate and capabilities; emphasised the urgency of finding a political solution, as the only way to restore long-term stability to the region; and reaffirmed the EU&#146;s role in contributing to international diplomatic efforts to consolidate the ceasefire and ease tensions in the long term.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0811179000017"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary welcomed African engagement and called for efforts to be directed towards redeploying or strengthening MONUC. The EU&#146;s role should be to support international efforts to implement political agreements.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0811179000019"></a>Foreign Ministers approved without discussion conclusions deploring the lack of progress on a transition to democratic government in the past year, pointing out that the 2010 elections will lack credibility unless the Burmese regime unconditionally releases all political prisoners and enters into a political process based upon dialogue with opposition groups, and recalling that the EU is prepared to reconsider its existing measures if there is no progress on these issues.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0811179000021"></a>The presidency said that the EU should enlarge its presence and intensify political contacts. The Commission highlighted existing work and said that the EU/Iraq trade and co-operation agreement could be concluded in early 2009. The Government welcome the council conclusions, which welcomed recent progress on security and national reconciliation; committed to further technical assistance to the neighbours process; extended the mandate of the ESDP rule of law mission, EUJUST LEX, including potentially to carry out activities within Iraq; and encouraged early finalisation of the draft EU/Iraq energy MOU.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0811179000023"></a>Foreign Ministers discussed the text of a presidency declaration in relation to the negotiations with Russia on a successor to the partnership and co-operation agreement. The declaration:</p>
makes clear that the Georgia conflict has affected the trust necessary for a partnership between the EU and Russia and calls upon Russia to implement its commitments and engage constructively in the Geneva talks, while reiterating EU support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia;states that the in-depth examination of EU-Russia relations will continue and, along with Russian behaviour, will inform both the negotiations and other aspects of the relationship; and explains that the negotiations are the best way for the EU to promote its values and defend its interests, and that they do not legitimise the status quo in Georgia or Russian behaviour which runs counter to EU values and principles.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0811179000024"></a>The Government support the wording of the presidency declaration. In addition, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary released a joint statement with the Swedish Foreign Minister prior to the council. The statement expressed deep concern about Russia&#146;s actions and failure to withdraw to pre-7 August conflict positions and expressed support for Georgia&#146;s territorial integrity. It makes clear that a resumption of negotiations will not be a return to business as usual, nor will the EU be turning the page on the conflict in Georgia. The EU would stick to the tough mandate that had been agreed for the negotiations.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0811179000026"></a>The presidency described the situation in Zimbabwe as extremely discouraging, and said that the GAERC might need to return to the issue. The Government would support a discussion at the council if no progress is made soon in talks on the power-sharing agreement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0811179000029"></a>The presidency gave a presentation on the capability initiatives that it had launched. Foreign and Defence Ministers adopted conclusions without discussion that gave an account of all current ESDP missions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0811179000031"></a>On Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Solana and Commissioner Rehn briefed the council on the future of the Office of the High Representative (OHR). The council adopted conclusions reaffirming its full support for the HR/EUSR, Mr Miroslav Lajcák; expressing deep concern at recent developments, particularly Bosnian leaders&#146; use of nationalist rhetoric and actions challenging state competences; and calling upon the Bosnian authorities to renew their efforts on reforms. The conclusions reiterate the EU&#146;s willingness for the transition from the OHR to a stronger European Union presence, but they also call on Bosnian authorities to intensify efforts to fulfil the five objectives and two conditions agreed by the Peace Implementation Council for closure of the OHR.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0811179000032"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the UK&#146;s concern over the current situation in BiH and that OHR closure should only take place once the conditions had been met. In terms of a strengthened EU presence, we needed to think about arrangements which increased the incentives for Bosnian politicians to engage with Brussels, while discouraging them from reneging on the Dayton/Paris agreements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0811179000033"></a>Over lunch, the presidency briefed on the talks taking place with Serbia and Kosovo (the UN has been taking forward a dialogue with both states on transitional arrangements&#151;&#147;the 6 points&#148;&#151;as UNMIK draws down; the EU Secretariat has been engaging with both states on EULEX deployment).</p>

Ministers also felt that the success of the forthcoming elections was vital. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said the Commission was prepared to monitor them.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0811179000036"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary noted that the EUPOL police mission needed to be the EU&#146;s first priority, given that the pace of reform within the police force had not matched that of the Afghan army.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0811179000039"></a>The EDA chief executive presented a report on the agency's activities. Ministers launched initiatives that they had discussed at their informal meeting in Deauville for co-operation by different groups of member states including on the upgrading of European helicopters and training of pilots to be deployed to the most challenging theatres; the creation of a European air transport fleet; satellite co-operation; officer training exchanges; interoperability of European aircraft carriers and support vessels; and maritime demining projects. They also addressed the issue of restructuring European security and defence industries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0811179000041"></a>Ministers approved the establishment of Operation Atalanta, an EU-led military naval mission to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia, to be launched in December and commanded from the UK&#146;s multinational headquarters at Northwood.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0811179000042"></a>They also took stock of two EU-led military operations: EUFOR Chad/Central African Republic, and Althea in BiH, including plans for the latter to transition to a military mentoring and training mission when the political and security situation allows.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0811179000045"></a>Ministers recognised the importance of an even more effective international development effort to, for example, develop the counternarcotics effort, build the capacity of the Afghan Government, tackle corruption and improve the justice sector. In addition, the importance of forthcoming elections and further efforts to help strengthen the position of women were also discussed. My honourable friend the Minister of State for International Development gave his support for increased efforts in these areas, and highlighted the need for the EU to engage with the new US Administration on their approach to development in Afghanistan.</p>

At the UK&#146;s suggestion, the presidency circulated a statement which drew a link between the 7 November European Council on the financial crisis and the Doha conference, and stated that the latter

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="0811179000054"></a>On 20 September 2007, I announced that I had asked the Organ Donation Taskforce to look at the complex issue of an opt-out or presumed consent system of organ donation. The task force&#146;s terms of reference were:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0811179000063"></a>&#147;To examine the potential impact on organ donation of introducing an &#145;opt out&#146; or presumed consent system in the UK, having regard to the views of the public and stakeholders on the clinical, ethical, legal and societal issues, and publish its findings&#148;.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0811179000056"></a>I am grateful to the chair of the task force, Mrs Elisabeth Buggins, and all the members for their careful and thorough examination of this subject and for producing such an authoritative piece of work. The task force has presented a cogent and well balanced analysis of a substantial body of evidence drawn from a wide range of stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, organ recipients, donor families, representatives of faith and belief groups, and members of the public.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="0811179000057"></a>The task force has concluded that introducing an opt-out system in the UK at present, while having the potential to deliver benefits, would present significant challenges on a number of fronts, and may not be necessary to deliver the improvement in donation rates we all want. The task force has therefore recommended not changing to an opt-out system at this time, but monitoring progress of implementing the recommendations of the task force&#146;s first report.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="0811179000058"></a>The task force has given a clear indication that donation rates can be optimised successfully without a change in the legal framework. I therefore accept their recommendation that we should aim to raise donation rates without the added complications associated with a change in legislation, only revisiting the question of a change to opt out if the implementation of those recommendations does not deliver the projected increase in donations.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="0811179000059"></a>However, I want to see more progress more quickly to ensure that UK patients have the best possible chance of getting the treatment they need. I have therefore set a further challenge as part of the implementation of the task force&#146;s second report. I would like to see 20 million people registered on the organ donor register by 2010, working towards 25 million on the register by 2013.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="0811179000060"></a>I also want to see our donor rates match those in many parts of Europe and rise to 1,400 donors per year by March 2013, nearly twice current levels. On average each donor can help three people in need, so this could mean an extra 1,800 people get the chance of the transplant they so desperately need.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="0811179000061"></a>To support this, in addition to the extra &#163;11 million made available this year to implement the task force&#146;s first report, we have made &#163;4.5 million extra funding available over the two years 2008-10 for a major multimedia campaign from March 2009 to make people aware of the importance of organ donation, with further funding agreed for future years.</p>

<a name="81117-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="0811179000062"></a>However, it is not all about money or setting government targets. Achieving these ambitious aims will require not only the support of the Government and the NHS, but also widespread public support. We as a society need to change the way we view organ donation. Professionals can play their part by ensuring that all potential donors are identified and donation is discussed at the right time with families. Most importantly, we all need to talk about donation with our family and friends, make our wishes known and register on the organ donor register. We may then all give someone the opportunity to benefit from a transplant after our death.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="08111719000059"></a>On 4 November, the Secretary of State announced a range of measures to widen access to drugs on the NHS, which will, in fact, reduce the demand from patients for additional private care (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 131). For those few patients who may still wish to buy additional private care, the draft revised guidance makes it clear that no patient should lose his or her entitlement to NHS care as a result of choosing to purchase private care separately. The draft revised guidance emphasises that the NHS should never subsidise private care with public money, as this would breach core NHS principles. It also says that patients' agreement to the likely costs should be sought in advance of any private care being provided.</p>
