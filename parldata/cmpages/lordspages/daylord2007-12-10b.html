<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What action they propose to take to encourage shops, offices and other workplaces to save energy by switching off unnecessary electrical equipment such as lights, computers and fax machines especially at night and during weekends and holidays.</p>

The forthcoming carbon reduction commitment&#151;a mandatory emissions trading scheme for large non-energy-intensive organisations&#151;and increased use of smart metering will also encourage businesses to become more energy efficient.</p>

Does he agree that smart meters both for businesses and for domestic households would be a good discipline and a step forward, in that people would know how much they were using? Although this is not my noble friend&#146;s responsibility, for the first time ever since becoming a Member of this House, on going into my office this morning I found that the lights were not on.</p>

At present, they are mainly available only for electricity, but apparently displays for gas and water are being developed. They are small, portable, hand-held devices, which can be used in the business or at home, allowing one to read the meter. More important, they can transmit to the energy company the amount of energy used, so estimated bills are not required.</p>

Why did the all-party drafting committee exclude daylight saving from the Climate Change Bill, which we will discuss tomorrow, in favour of untried offset carbon trading and socially divisive taxes? Is it because the party managers cannot work out how to tax the difference between night and day or is there scientific evidence that daylight saving will not reduce electricity demand and rising emissions in this country when it clearly does in 108 other, more enlightened countries?</p>

Can the Government, in their occasional meetings with Bill Gates, persuade him that, rather than having to go through a complex menu system in Windows to save your data, you could just turn the machine off or have it turn itself off after 20 minutes?</p>

We really need to put the maximum pressure on business. If the cost of energy is not a sufficient deterrent, can the Government use its powerful position to initiate a debate with business so that it switches the darn things off?</p>

Those are the ones targeted by the Carbon Trust. I am told that sometimes&#151;I am not up to date on this&#151;the lighting system is part of the heating system, so the lights being on is not simply a pure waste of energy.</p>

I admire his tenacity in raising this issue on numerous occasions in this House. He is right to say that, in the example that he gave of Terry Walker, no apology can make amends for what happened. Great distress was caused to the family. I think that my ministerial colleagues have acknowledged that, as I certainly do. I believe that some progress has been made: I understand that arrangements have now been made to pay Terry Walker&#146;s funeral expenses. I hope that that helps the family to understand that there is genuine concern about what happened and that the apology that was given was very sincere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0712104000037"></a>On the overall situation, the Government have tried to come to grips with the problem but, as my noble friend knows, research in this area is extremely complex and there is still a great deal of divided opinion. I am sure that many of the people involved, and their families, think that there is a simple causal link, but for those charged with responsibility for pensions and other payments certain issues have to be dealt with and that is what has proved so difficult.

Why did he tell a different story to a newspaper reporter of the <I>Mail on Sunday</I> on 23 November? Secondly, could the Minister confirm that Mr Browne is a lawyer? Can she say whether he found difficulty as a lawyer in apportioning the time that he spent on the affairs of his various clients, and that therefore he never billed them at all?</p>

<p><a name="0712104000172"></a>The Secretary of State went on to say that he would be happy to meet the noble Lord to explain that. Perhaps I should point out that whether my right honourable friend is meeting the noble Lord or working on other matters, he is the Secretary of State 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year.</p>

We are at war, and this is about leadership. Does the Minister accept that the perception of our soldiers, sailors and airmen&#151;I meet many of our servicemen and servicewomen&#151;is that their commitment, which sadly sometimes involves the ultimate sacrifice, is not matched by this Government in a number of ways, not least by their extraordinary unwillingness to have a full-time Secretary of State at these times of high levels of war fighting?</p>

There is never a day, an hour or any time when the Secretary of State is not fully conscious of his very significant responsibilities. At the moment, my right honourable friend is in Afghanistan visiting the troops there yet again. I think that this is his fifth visit to Afghanistan. He has made seven visits to Iraq, which makes his visits at least once every two months into theatre. That commitment is extremely high and shows how seriously he takes his responsibilities. I also reject the idea that he has not delivered in other ways through welfare packages and compensation for those with multiple injuries, and in tackling some of the legacy problems that have been around for many years involving such issues as housing and accommodation generally. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has a record of which he can be proud, which shows his full commitment to the responsibilities that he holds.</p>

The child typically dies within the first two years of life. The ability to create disease models for such diseases from tissues obtained from a child is necessary to further our understanding, and our ability to treat and prevent such diseases. To develop these diseases, scientists need to be able to take somatic cells from these children through an embryo phase in order to generate embryonic stem cells or embryonic-like stem cells, which, in turn, would allow the disease models to be studied.</p>

Research using this material from children is therefore important. It should not be undertaken lightly. It needs to be subject to the strictest safeguards of the 1990 Act, but also to the further conditions set out as part of these amendments.</p>

<a name="71210-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0712104000092"></a>These conditions borrow from other sources, including some of the protections in the research provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The amendment will allow embryos or stem cells to be created using gametes or cells from children, to be used in research into serious childhood diseases or conditions, with the consent of a person with parental responsibility and subject to the fulfilment of certain additional conditions. These include, most importantly, the necessity test, which will ensure that such work is only carried out where it could not be carried using the cells of gametes from adults or children with capacity. I hope that, with these conditions, this amendment can go ahead. I beg to move.</p>

He has also said that we should not proceed to incorporate these amendments as a light undertaking. He has recognised the seriousness of what is proposed in these amendments. Like him, we all want to see cures for the sorts of diseases that he has just enumerated. However, the Committee also needs to consider whether this is the right way to do it.</p>

<a name="71210-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0712104000094"></a>These amendments in the name of my noble friend would overturn most of the current prohibitions and would enable gametes and cells of non-consenting children to be removed from their bodies and used to make interspecies embryos or human embryos for research. Proposed new paragraph 12A(1) would permit all types of hybrids specified in new Section 4A of the 1990 Act to be made from these children&#146;s gametes, including true hybrids at new Section 4A(5)(a), interspecies cloned embryos at new Section 4A(5)(b), human animal transgenic embryos at new Section 4A(5)(c), animal human chimeric embryos at new Section 4A(5)(d), and such other things as may be specified in regulations at new Section 4A(5)(e). It would also permit human embryos, including cloned human embryos, to be made from their gametes and cells. These could be made from the gametes and cells of non-consenting children for research, using them in combination with human or animal eggs. These interspecies or human embryos could also be stored and used without consent. That is the issue on which my noble friend and I will part company. It raises a number of objections on which the Committee will want to reflect.</p>

<a name="71210-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0712104000095"></a>For instance, later in life, a non-consenting child might feel considerable antagonism that their gametes and cells were taken and used to create interspecies embryos without consent. Whatever the benefits that may be cited, where is the principle of autonomy that is so frequently cited in other debates in your Lordships' House? I can imagine the anger of a young adult who felt that their very personhood had been violated and sacrificed to a supposed greater scientific good. For example, how would a teenage girl feel if a true hybrid had been made between her eggs and animal sperm? Alluring scientific possibilities should never be allowed to corrode our sensibilities.</p>

My noble friend referred to that. Therefore, one must assume that Amendments Nos. 50 and 54 are intended to exploit the potential inability of young children under 16 years of age to provide informed consent. The same document provided by the GMC also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0712104000193"></a>&#147;Where a child under 16 years old is not competent to give or withhold their informed consent, a person with parental responsibility may authorise investigations or treatments which are in the child&#146;s best interests&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71210-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0712104000097"></a>On the basis of existing empirical evidence, how can the creation of an interspecies embryo necessarily be stated to be in the best interests of a non-consenting child? Let us not forget that the purpose of these amendments is restricted solely to research rather than to clinical treatments that have already proven their worth and might be used in the interests of the child. My noble friend Lord Patel stated in our debate on 3 December how producing satisfactory results was too high a hurdle. He made those comments on Amendments Nos. 7, 44 and 46. My amendment said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712104000204"></a>&#147;the research method proposed is most likely to produce satisfactory results&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000173"></a>My noble friend said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0712104000194"></a>&#147;That is too high a standard for any research project&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/12/07; col. 1544.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000174"></a>Again, that opens a clear difference between my noble friend and I on those previous amendments, as well as this one.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0712104000098"></a>This amendment would allow human embryos to be made using gametes or cells from a child without their consent. How would the non-consenting child feel in later life once they realised that they were made a mother or father at an age too young to give consent, even if the embryo was destroyed by 14 days? Not many of us would want to know that our gametes had been taken, without our having any understanding of it, to make interspecies embryos or human embryos on our behalf and without our consent. No one has the right to take that decision on behalf of others. I feel that this is going too far.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0712104000099"></a>There are echoes here also of an application made more than a decade ago by an Edinburgh scientist, Roger Gosden, who sought permission from the HFEA to use the eggs of aborted baby girls for fertility treatments. The HFEA did not demur. It embarked on a public consultation on whether a little girl would be aborted and then robbed of her eggs from her ovaries. A woman is at her most fertile at 20 weeks&#146; gestation, when she has 5 million eggs in her womb, 4 million of which are shed naturally before birth. An aborted girl could be seen as a rich source of organs and tissues.</p>

However, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority had a public consultation over that issue. These amendments do not seek to create life beyond 14 days and, in that sense, are obviously different from the proposal that had been placed before the HFEA by Roger Gosden&#151;but we should not seek to create life in that manner at all.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0712104000102"></a>Obtaining gametes, especially from a girl, is not like giving blood. The procedure needs to be spelt out in full and any attendant risk, present or future, should be made clear to your Lordships while we debate the matter. I hope that the Minister, when he comes to reply, will tell the Committee very clearly how exactly one would get the gametes from these infants and children, especially how one would obtain eggs or ovarian tissue from a teenage girl of reproductive age. That should be described in ordinary, everyday language so all of us can understand what the procedure would be. Furthermore, would the procedure involve a general anaesthetic, and would that involve a risk? Would there be any risk to the girl during any of the surgical procedures? My noble friend said on Amendment No. 62:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0712104000195"></a>&#147;I should like to see a greater degree of patient safety being promoted in all aspects of medicine&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/12/07; col. 1592.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000175"></a>and I entirely agree with him. We need clarification on that point. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, will speak next, I think, and help to illuminate our proceedings. I want to know whether we can guarantee that there will be no possible risk of future damage to the child&#146;s own reproductive system.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0712104000103"></a>On a related subject, I ask the Minister whether there is an error in new paragraph 9 in Schedule 3, in line 12 of page 63 and line 2 of page 64. Can he explain the relevance of &#147;donor&#148; with reference to &#147;child donor&#148; in that paragraph? Is that paragraph specifically related to the storage of gametes of children who may be ill or undergoing some medical procedure, such as chemotherapy, that may render them infertile, with the intention of storing their gametes to enable them to have their own genetic children later in life? That would seem perfectly reasonable. Is the purpose broader, to include donation as implied by &#147;child donor&#148;, and if so can these other purposes be explained? Is &#147;donor&#148; intended to mean &#147;patient&#148;, in which case could that be rectified, otherwise the meaning of the term could be considerably expanded in practice? If the word is intended to mean &#147;donor&#148;, does that mean that the child is intended to be an egg or sperm donor for somebody else&#146;s fertility treatment, or to provide eggs or sperm for research without their consent?</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0712104000104"></a>Finally, let me return to an issue raised earlier in our Committee. Why exactly do we need to do these things? We create embryos under any number of guises when alternatives exist. Yet, even if there were no alternatives, to create interspecies embryos from non-consenting children is going too far.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0712104000105"></a>Only last week, Bob Edwards of Louise Brown fame commented at the end of the HFEA annual review about the need for welfare of the child to be the priority. In passing, he questioned the wisdom of the HFEA being involved in sanctioning the creation of hybrids.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0712104000106"></a>Doubt was cast earlier on the figure I cited of 2 million human embryos destroyed or experimented on since the passage of the 1990 Act. A lesser figure of 82,955 was mentioned, but that is in connection with the number of embryos donated for research. The figures are in a parliamentary reply given to me on 28 June by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, at col. <I>WA</I><I> 159</I>. The number of embryos created involving fresh, non-frozen embryos is 1,940,576, with just 3.4 per cent resulting in live births from a total of 66,715 treatment cycles. Since 1991, 76,462 embryos have been created in treatments involving frozen embryos, with 13 per cent resulting in live births from 10,040 treatment cycles. Therefore, more than 2 million embryos have been destroyed or experimented on since 1990.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0712104000107"></a>I also asked why no data were held on embryos created using cell nuclear replacement or therapeutic cloning. The Minister replied that the HFEA,</p>
<ul><a name="0712104000205"></a>&#147;does not routinely collect data on the number of embryos created using cell nuclear replacement&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/6/07; col. <I>WA 159</I>.]</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000176"></a>technology. Such data are kept by the local research project. Surely they should be made available to the HFEA and Parliament.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0712104000108"></a>If Amendments Nos. 50 and 54 were agreed to, would we collect data on the gametes and cells taken from non-consenting children or would that, too, become so routine that we would not feel the need to do it? I hope that the Committee will not incorporate these amendments into the Bill.</p>

I say, in all seriousness and absolutely sincerely, that it is extremely helpful that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, continues to make objections; it helps us to focus our minds on what is ethical and what is useful. I thank him for his points, but I do disagree with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0712104000110"></a>Pretty well all of us in this House who have at some time or other had unprotected intercourse will have made embryos that did not become babies; it seems that most human embryos do not. Let us not forget that most embryos do not implant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0712104000111"></a>I return to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Patel. We must understand that genetic disease is a very serious issue indeed. There are about 6,000 single gene defects&#151;that is what we are talking about&#151;and most of them are so-called recessive defects, which means that if the parents both carry the gene, usually unwittingly, their children have a chance of having the defect. Such diseases are, frankly, untreatable. A few of them&#151;a handful&#151;do not cause very serious problems but, mostly, if you have a genetic disease, you live with it, you suffer from it and you die from it; and you die from it, normally, while you are still a child. Most  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_17"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children with genetic diseases do not survive into adulthood or even into teenage years, the exceptions perhaps being muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis and a few others. Most of them are so serious that children die after appalling suffering.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0712104000112"></a>The only effective treatment that we think is on the horizon for genetic disease is gene therapy. Basically, gene therapy involves getting the correct gene construct&#151;the correct DNA&#151;into the person so that their tissues start to express, or make, the proteins that are necessary for normal health. With cystic fibrosis, a protein is made without which breathing, digestion and other things would become impaired, and the children would die, usually in an emaciated state, with very severe breathlessness. One of my friends, sadly, is in that situation at the moment, and it is pretty unpleasant to watch her, as a young adult&#151;she survived that long; she was lucky.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0712104000113"></a>Gene therapy normally involves piggybacking a gene into the cell so that you can modify the genetics with which the person has been born. That is normally done with a virus; various viruses have been tried. In my own laboratory, we use what are called retroviruses for such experiments, and we do so only on animals. They are similar viruses to those that infect people during infection with HIV. You can see the potential risks that such therapy has.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0712104000114"></a>Other viruses have been tried, particularly, for example, adenoviruses but, to date, gene therapy, in nearly all cases, has been an extremely serious undertaking. In America, there have been deaths after gene therapy and, so far, it has not been satisfactory. It currently carries&#151;because we do not understand how to get the genes into the nucleus&#151;a risk of cancer, a risk of an immune reaction and, in some cases, death within a few days of treatment. There is a real need&#151;let us not underestimate this&#151;to get genes into tissues that are damaged. At present, most gene therapy, quite understandably and probably quite ethically properly, is reserved only for people who are already so seriously sick that there is no alternative&#151;by which time, in the case of cystic fibrosis, their organs are really badly damaged; they can hardly breathe and are virtually at life&#146;s end. If we could get the genes in earlier, we could prevent both that scarring and that terminal disease. Therefore, the need to try and treat children young&#151;early on, while the disease is still making its way and not with its full ravages&#151;is extremely important.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0712104000115"></a>With all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, there are many examples in medicine where parents or guardians quite properly take it upon themselves to make consent for medical research on children that involves the potential to improve the health of their children or of others. That is firmly established within paediatrics, and while that area is at the moment under considerable scrutiny there is no doubt that that aspect of paediatric research is considered completely proper. There is no question among most medical opinion&#151;and, I suspect, most public opinion&#151;that it is appropriate to do that.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0712104000116"></a>Consent given by someone legally entitled to do so on behalf of the child must be an appropriate way to conduct such research, particularly where there seems to be a real therapeutic possibility. The great advantage

For example, when using the modern techniques that we hope to be able to implement in this country, if an embryo had cystic fibrosis then pancreatic or lung tissue would specifically be grown. If we could do that, we could start to have a clear understanding of the ravages of these diseases and how they might be stopped.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0712104000117"></a>We can never prevent genetic disease. Each of us in this Chamber&#151;each of your Lordships&#151;has a defective gene somewhere in our genome. In most cases, however, your Lordships are fortunate not to have married or have had sex with someone who has a similar defect in their genome and, therefore, your children are not at risk. That is a matter of random chance, and, if we can prevent these diseases or improve our understanding of them, it is a moral imperative to do so.</p>

That seems a perfectly proper question to ask in the context of this issue and to raise again the issue of consent and what precisely is meant by &#147;donor&#148;. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, is right to ask about that; the point was raised in our debate last week about so-called saviour siblings and will be raised in other contexts as the Bill proceeds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0712104000126"></a>All of us need to think very carefully about what we do on behalf of others, even when parents give consent. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Winston. I was in the position 18 years ago when my own daughter had a congenital hip displacement, of having to gave consent for general anaesthetics and for operations to be carried out, which were very painful and difficult. I am glad to say that, thanks to the skills of the doctors involved, my daughter came through that experience and her problems were rectified. These are decisions that parents have to make, but we as parents have to know what information can inform our decisions. If there are dangers to our daughters or sons as a result of any of these procedures being carried out, we have a right to know that before we incorporate such proposals into law.</p>

<a name="0712104000128"></a><b><a name="71210-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0712104000294"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> This has been another fascinating debate. Amendments Nos. 50 and 54, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, seek to permit the use of gametes or cells for creation of human and interspecies embryos for research from a child not able to give consent. Consent instead would be obtained from the parents of the child. This proposes that such cells or gametes could be used if there were reasonable grounds for believing that the research would be less effective if taken from a person who could consent, such as an adult with capacity. Consent to the use of sperm and eggs in the creation of embryos, and consent to the keeping and use of those embryos for treatment or research, is one of the cornerstones of the 1990 Act. The provisions relating to when consent will be required and the form of such consent are set out in Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0712104000129"></a>The Bill allows the use of gametes and cells to create human and interspecies embryos for research only where the adult who provided the cells or gametes gives consent. This reflects the special status of an embryo created using a person&#146;s genetic material. No one can give consent on behalf of an adult who lacks capacity, and for the same reasons, I do not believe that a child&#146;s cells or gametes should be used to create embryos or interspecies embryos without that child&#146;s own consent.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0712104000130"></a>I listened with interest to the views expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and my noble friend Lord Winston, and better understand the benefits which such an amendment could bring. However, if a child is incapable of giving consent to the creation of a human or interspecies embryo themselves, then it would be wrong for any person, including the parents, to make that decision for them.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0712104000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked whether there was an error in Schedule 3 and about the meaning of &#147;donor&#148; in that context. New paragraph 9 refers to &#147;child donor&#148; and has a meaning specific to this paragraph. Where a child is about to undergo treatment that will affect their fertility and cannot consent to storage of their gametes, this paragraph allows storage only for their treatment if it is in their best interests. Gametes cannot be used for any other purpose.</p>

<a name="71210-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0712104000132"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans asked what rights the child would lose. Under the Bill, consent is required to create an embryo. A child able to give consent could do so; otherwise, no one may give consent on the child&#146;s behalf. Amendment No. 50 would provide an alternative mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0712104000133"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked many questions on the amendment. I shall not answer them this afternoon but the noble Lord, Lord Patel, may

However, the Government are not convinced that the need to create embryos from a child&#146;s gametes or cells outweighs the need for that child&#146;s effective consent. Any such change would need very careful consideration of the very significant ethical issues involved. Therefore, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0712104000196"></a>&#147;12A (1) The gametes or human cells of a person (&#147;the child&#148;) may be used to bring about the creation of an embryo or an inter-species embryo in vitro&#148;.</p>

As I said, my amendment is about children who suffer from very serious diseases, which kill the majority of them by the age of two. They relate to the development of the brain and kidneys. Some of them are congenital diseases caused by genetic defects in the mitochondrion. The reason for suggesting that cells should be used from these children, using cell nuclear transfer technology and therefore creating an embryo, is to obtain stem cells and cultures of cells that carry the defective gene in order to study how these diseases develop and to find ways and means of treating them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0712104000137"></a>This also applies to creating interspecies embryos using skin cells from children, with parental consent, to create stem cells using animal eggs from which the nucleus is removed. The stem cells that result are nearly a 100 per cent match to the child from whom the skin cells were taken. This allows us to understand the development of lethal diseases so we can find the kind of therapies that my friend&#151;in the professional sense&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Winston, has talked about that use gene therapies and develop architecture to modify these genes so that children can survive longer and in due course we can treat these genetic defects.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0712104000138"></a>Interspecies embryos and the human embryonic material obtained&#151;human stem cells&#151;both use the same technology. These cells are obtained to study further the behaviour of these diseases. My amendment is about obtaining consent. Most of these children die at an early age and are not able to consent so consent is needed from the parents to obtain these cells so we can learn how to treat these diseases. That is the simple reason for this amendment; there is no other reason. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0712104000144"></a>The noble Baroness said: Your Lordships will know that the pre-legislative scrutiny committee that examined the Bill wanted to ensure that there were ethical principles in the law, preferably fixed by Parliament. There appeared to be very few ethical principles that the committee and its witnesses could agree on, but the one that I shall argue for is so basic that it is a litmus test of the ability of this nation to agree on ethical principles. It is the one that was crafted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, in the 1990 Act, which has held firm and worked well for the last 17 years. It is the section that says that the welfare of the child includes the child&#146;s need for a father. Clause 14(2)(b) of the Bill calls for the wisdom and natural practice of the centuries to be disregarded.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0712104000145"></a>Why should I care about this? It is because I learnt from my chairmanship of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that the public need reassurance that science is not leaping ahead to the detriment of future generations. That theme has implicitly underlain all our discussion over the past few days. The other thing that I learnt during my chairmanship was that there are pressures on vulnerable women, and sometimes reluctant men, to spend a lot of money in pursuit of a baby, sometimes egged on, as it were, by very wealthy doctors, who urged them to keep going. One was aware of husbands who demanded a baby or threatened divorce if one was not forthcoming. I hold to the principle that every woman is a worthwhile woman in her own right, whether or not she has, wants or cannot have a baby. She is not just a mother. Likewise every man has to be free to be not just a career man, not just a genetic contributor or a pair, but a responsible father.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0712104000146"></a>There is no right to a baby. I think that your Lordships would agree on that. The provision that we are debating is a demarcation between, on the one hand, the goal that we all seek of a healthy baby brought up in a family to which some thought has been given and, on the other hand, experimentation. One of the main arguments against cloning is that the child would be the product of only one parent with no input at all from another. That has caused revulsion around the world.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0712104000147"></a>In other words, what I learnt from my chairmanship was that the science is great but that there is a risk in all that we do of dehumanisation, commercialisation and loss of identity. It has, rightly, been the policy of this Government and other Governments that there should be paternity leave in order that a father can bond with his child. It is the policy of this Government that single women should be more than encouraged to name the father on the birth certificate. It is the policy of the judges and the Government that there should be contact between father and child after divorce. It is the policy of this Government and previous Governments to make sure that fathers pay maintenance for their children. It has been the policy of this Government to end the anonymity of sperm donors in order that they can be known if necessary at some time in the future.

Why should that be if there is no point in having a father?</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0712104000148"></a>As a former chair, I welcome all the excellent proposals in Part 1 that simultaneously liberalise and regulate the advance of science in lifesaving and reproductive techniques. I have no quarrel with any of it, but the results of science should adapt to the needs of society and not vice versa. The pre-legislative scrutiny committee decided inter alia that donor-conceived children ought to be given every opportunity to discover the truth about their origins, short of forcing social parents to tell them that they were donor conceived, which is too great an invasion of privacy and unenforceable. The pre-legislative scrutiny committee concluded that children need two parents. The need for a mother is implicit in the direction to consider the welfare of the child, because it is the would-be mother who presents herself for treatment. Your Lordships could usefully imagine the reaction of the public were the Bill to say that the need for a mother was to be deleted from the law.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0712104000149"></a>The Bill remains full of inconsistencies. It promotes truth about origins, but it will provide for birth certificates to name two parents of the same sex. It ensures non-discrimination between family units and persons at the expense, it could be argued, of the welfare of the child. After all, British law does not treat all families the same. It still rightly discriminates against underage marriage, which is not possible, and polygamous and incestuous unions, which are not legalised, so why should a child not have its family welfare considered before the mother undergoes IVF? </p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0712104000150"></a>Current government and judicial policy is unanimous that fathers have a vital role to play, and research, which I am coming to, shows that children need fathers as role models. We should not be afraid of being labelled discriminatory or politically incorrect in standing up for the welfare of the child and for its right to have two parents of different sexes, even though that requirement has not been and will continue not to be a barrier to treatment. Indeed, the number of single women and lesbian women being treated by IVF has gradually risen, and I have no quarrel with that.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0712104000151"></a>It has been alleged that this factor&#151;that a child needs a father&#151;is discriminatory. It is not discriminatory, because it applies to all patients regardless of sex and marital status. If it is discriminatory, it is justified by the welfare of the child, and it is proportionate; it is not an absolute bar. In that, I am supported by the rest of Europe, which I shall come to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0712104000152"></a>The HFEA figures show that treatment is regularly provided to single and lesbian women; indeed, the number is rising. Clinics look for stability and a male role model and they consider the risk of harm. I have a list of about 80 research papers listing the unique contribution made by fathers to the upbringing of girls and boys in terms of social and academic success and psychological and physical health. The father&#146;s input to the upbringing of girls is as vital as it is to the upbringing of boys. A household of two parents of different sexes is a microcosm of society. It gives children the chance to see the complementariness of

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0712104000153"></a>In a poll of approximately 1,000 people taken in early November, 84 per cent of 18 to 24 year-olds believed that the father is important and that 82 per cent of all those questioned thought that his absence is adverse. In keeping the law as it is, we will be in line with the rest of Europe; our law is already more liberal than the laws in the rest of Europe. Single people cannot be treated by IVF in France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Portugal and Germany. That limitation is not therefore confined to the more deeply religious societies. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that the child has,</p>
<ul><a name="0712104000206"></a>&#147;the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000178"></a>in the plural. If we say that there is no need for a father in any circumstances, we will be in a group of countries that includes Romania, Bulgaria, Venezuela, Mexico, Belgium and Finland. I would argue that it is the hallmark of a civilised society that for the welfare of the child some restraints are put on who may reproduce when the matter is in the hands of clinics and the law.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0712104000154"></a>The studies that exist on same-sex parenting are largely directed towards the existence of two parents of the same sex when the children are very young, but in Norway and Sweden, where same-sex partnerships have been legal for very much longer, the risks of breakdown are considerably higher. Female partnerships have a divorce risk that is double that for males. The median length of male relationships in the UK is only 25 months. Thirty per cent of Swedish female unions and 20 per cent of male unions end within five years.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0712104000155"></a>In other words, it is right to consider the child&#146;s need for a father. I have the studies indicating that; I do not have time to list them now, but they certainly exist. We need to signal to men that we are all partners in the health of the next generation and that none of us is worthless or to be written out of reproduction or valued only for the money that we can contribute&#151;that is, if we are men. If we maintain the existing law on the child&#146;s need for a father, that will do more to reassure the public about the advances in science than anything else we can do. I suggest that, in its way, it is the bedrock for confidence in going forward in the in vitro fertilisation and stem cell field.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0712104000156"></a>I therefore suggest that we restore the current law. It is not a prohibition; as I said, many single women and lesbian couples are treated. But it will cause patients and clinicians to reflect on the situation that has presented itself and ask whether all will be well&#151;or as well as can be predicted&#151;in this situation. This also applies to Clause 23(2). I beg to move.</p>

Part 2 has the effect of redefining what it means to be a mother or a father. It is intended to create a separate category of parent for those who do not fit the description of either mother or father,  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_25"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thereby creating in law a family that could never exist in nature. Part 2 also allows a dead woman to be treated as a parent&#151;even though she neither has nor had any biological relationship to the child&#151;while preventing the child from having a father. The proposals are far reaching.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0712104000158"></a>The current law may not be perfect, but it is better than the Bill before us today. I propose deleting Part 2 in the interests of keeping the law as it is. Trying to unpack this complicated and convoluted mess would lead to more problems than it would solve. I contend that the Government should take Part 2 back to the drawing board. If there is anything there worth preserving in the interests of upholding or enhancing the status quo, I hope that the Government will reintroduce provisions in a new Part 2 in the near future.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0712104000159"></a>The relationship between children and their parents is, once again, at the heart of the redefinition of a family taken forward by Part 2. Clause 45 states that where two women wish to access IVF treatment as a partnership,</p>
<ul><a name="0712104000207"></a>&#147;no man is to be treated as the father of the child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000179"></a>I invite your Lordships to step back for a moment and consider the full ramifications of that statement. It effectively means that, from before the child is born until he or she ceases to be a child at the age of 18, the state, through this Bill, effectively makes it impossible for that child to have a father at any time during their childhood. Indeed, even when the child turns 18, they will not actually have a father but will only be able to find out who their father is. Whatever you think of the children&#146;s rights movement, surely every child has the right, at least, to have had the chance of having a father. Do we really want to enact a piece of legislation that will make this impossible? What would this say about our attitude to children?</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0712104000160"></a>To put this question in context, it is important to recognise that one of the main developments since the HFE Act has been the publication of a significant amount of research on fatherhood, the balance of which demonstrates that fathers bring something distinctive and important to the parenting process. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has referred to 80 pieces of research; what I have looked up gives me over 100. I commend to your Lordships the recently published CARE <I>Fatherhood Bibliography</I>, which is available on the website www.care.org.uk/fathers. It highlights more than 100 pieces of research.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="0712104000198"></a>&#147;This article explores the cultural construction of fatherhood in America, as well as the consequences of this construction as a motivator for understudying fathers, especially father love for nearly a century in developmental and family research. It then reviews evidence from 6 categories of empirical studies showing the powerful influence of fathers&#146; love on children&#146;s and young adults&#146; social, emotional, and cognitive development and functioning. Much of this evidence suggests that the influence of father love on offspring&#146;s development is as great as and occasionally greater than the influence of mother love. Some studies conclude that father love is the sole significant predictor of specific outcomes

Overall, father love appears to be as heavily implicated as mother love in offsprings&#146; psychological well-being and health, as well as in an array of psychological and behavioral problems&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0712104000162"></a>The second quotation is from <I>Life without Father: Compelling New Evidence that Fatherhood and Marriage Are Indispensable for the Good of Children and Society</I>, by Mr Popenoe, published in New York by the Free Press in 1996. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="0712104000199"></a>&#147;Recent research has given us much deeper ... insights into the father&#146;s role in childrearing. It shows that in almost all of their interactions with children, fathers do things a little differently from mothers. What fathers do ... is not only highly complementary to what mothers do but is by all indications important in its own right for optimum childrearing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000180"></a>That is on page 144. It goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="0712104000200"></a>&#147;Fathers are far more than just &#145;second adults&#146; in the home. Involved fathers&#151;especially biological fathers&#151;bring positive benefits to their children that no other person is as likely to bring ... They provide protection and economic support and male role models ... According to the evidence, fathers make important contributions to their children&#146;s intellectual competence, prosocial and companionate behaviour and psychological well-being&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71210-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0712104000163"></a>Finally, I quote from a work entitled <I>Fathers&#146; Involvement in their Children&#146;s Schools</I>, issued by the US Department of Education&#146;s National Center for Education Statistics. It was written in 1987, by Mr Nord, Mr Brimhall and Mr West. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="0712104000201"></a>&#147;In two-parent families, the involvement of fathers exerts a distinct and independent influence on whether children have ever repeated a grade, get mostly A&#146;s, enjoy school, and participate in extracurricular activities, even after controlling for mothers involvement in school and other potentially confounding factors&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71210-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0712104000164"></a>Given that the balance of recent research demonstrates the importance of fathers and the fact that they bring something distinctive to the parenting process, I submit that changes in the law suggesting anything to the contrary would be foolish. The proposed change would make it impossible for children to have fathers from before their birth until they cease to be children, when all that they can do is find out the identity of that father. That would be grossly irresponsible of Parliament and exhibit a total disregard for the rights and well-being of the child.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0712104000165"></a>Some may respond by saying that the redefinitions of Part 2 simply extend principles established in the same-sex adoption situation. That debate has been and gone. The context of adoption and IVF are entirely different. Let us consider adoption from the perspective of the child. When a child who at some point goes on to be adopted is conceived, they have a chance of having a father&#151;indeed, they may well enjoy access to their father for a period. At some point, however, they have to be taken into care and foster or adoptive families must be sought. Thus, adopted children are not purposefully conceived on the basis that they should never have a father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0712104000181"></a>What the Bill seeks to achieve is entirely different. In a context where recent research overwhelmingly demonstrates the importance of fathers and the fact that they bring something distinct to the parenting process, the decision of the state to facilitate the deliberate creation of children who would be prevented from having a father is morally wrong. That is a clear  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_27"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example of the Government prioritising the interests and desires of adults&#151;in this case, would-be same-sex parents&#151;above the welfare and rights of the children. It also goes against the many-times-stated intention that children are at the heart of the Bill and, as we were reminded by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, that the welfare of the child includes the child&#146;s need for a father, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern said during the work leading up to the Bill.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0712104000166"></a>Not only do I believe that Part 2 is fraught with difficulties, because it affirms policy that is negligent of the balance of recent research, but I think that it is profoundly confused about public attitudes. A stated rationale for the Bill&#151;one of many&#151;was to take account of changing public views since 1990. Public views may or may not be changing, but one thing is certain: they do not agree with the redefinitions of the family in Part 2 of the Bill and, indeed, in relevant aspects of Part 1, such as Clause 14. In the Government&#146;s 2005 consultation preceding the Bill, <I>Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990: A Public Consultation</I>, question 17 asks:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="0712104000202"></a>&#147;Do you think that the requirement to take account of &#145;the need of the child for a father&#146;, as part of considering the welfare of the child, should be removed from the Act?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712104000182"></a>Only 103 of the 505 responses published on the Department of Health website backed removing the obligation to have regard to the child&#146;s need for a father. Given that there is clearly no public appetite for doing away with the 1990 provision that the child&#146;s welfare includes the need for a father, by implication there is no appetite for making it impossible for some children to have fathers from before birth for the duration of their childhood. To be blunt, it is difficult to see how one could have regard to the child&#146;s need for a father and yet, at the same time, prevent some children from ever having fathers.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0712104000183"></a>More recently, a ComRes telephone poll demonstrated that 77 per cent of people think that the obligation on IVF clinics to have regard to the child&#146;s need for a father is either important or very important. Most interestingly, this figure rose to 84 per cent for the youngest category polled, namely the 18 to 24 year-olds. The same poll asked people directly whether they felt that Part 2&#146;s provision&#151;that no man is to be treated as the father of the child&#151;was fair on the child. Only 10 per cent of people thought that it was fair on the child. This figure fell to just 7 per cent in the responses from those with children in the household.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0712104000167"></a>Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, made clear at Second Reading on 19 November, the redefinition of family relationships has the effect of denying some children a legal father, from conception and for the whole of their childhood. In the context of same-sex male partnerships, Clauses 54 and 55 make provision for bringing children into the world who will be denied a legal mother for the duration of their childhood. On this point, it is interesting to note that the option favoured in the responses to the government consultation about the 1990 fathers provision was that it should stay and have added to it a new reference to the child&#146;s need for a mother.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0712104000168"></a>Some may say that, despite the implications of both recent research that I have mentioned and public opinion, Part 2 must become law because the impact of the current law discriminates against some adults. I submit that that is not the case at all. Whatever you think about current arrangements, the truth is that single women can and do access IVF and that, where the woman is in a same-sex female partnership, her partner can subsequently adopt the child. The same is true of a man in a same-sex male partnership who, according to the new HFEA code, can now use surrogacy arrangements to produce a child who can effectively be brought up by two fathers. My amendments would not change that.</p>

<a name="71210-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0712104000169"></a>It is not entirely clear to me why same-sex female partnerships should effectively be able to access IVF, given the current obligation to have regard for the child&#146;s need for a father. I suppose that it is a function of the fact that a woman seeking IVF presents herself as a single woman and is treated by the obligation to have regard for the child&#146;s need for a father in the same way as any other single woman is treated. That that takes place at all is, in my view, wrong, given the balance of recent research and what it shows about the distinctive roles of parents and how the child&#146;s interests are best served by access to both a father and mother.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0712104000170"></a>Part 2 further streamlines, automates, authenticates and thereby encourages what can currently take place as a result of the combined effect of the HFEA code and adoption law. We can only endorse Part 2&#151;and Clause 14(2) of Part 1&#151;if we are prepared to institutionalise the compromising of the rights of the child to a mother and a father. That would involve adopting a total disregard for the best interests of children. Remember, once more, that the best interest is not just the absence of harm but putting the child&#146;s welfare first and recognising that part of that includes the child&#146;s need for a father. I am not prepared to do so and I encourage your Lordships to join me in asking the Government fundamentally to rethink Part 2, bearing in mind both the balance of recent research and public opinion.</p>

As far as I could follow it, it went something along the lines that children derive great benefit from having a father. The examples were products of the social relationship of the parenting role between the child and a male parent, which led to great benefits in psychological, intellectual and social development. I do not necessarily disagree. But then the argument proceeds with an enormous jump. The jump then is that because of those benefits derived from a social relationship, the child has a right to a father. That is an enormous jump. It creates a right that is unenforceable.</p>

I am concerned only with the best interests of the children. As the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said, Section 13 of the 1990 Act was the response of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then Lord Chancellor, to my amendment which would have made illegal the provision of in vitro fertilisation services to unmarried women and which was disagreed by this House by one vote on a free vote. The point about Section 13 is that it puts the interest of any children resulting from those services first and above the interests of the woman who wants a baby, where those interests conflict.</p>

It is widely acknowledged, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Deech and Lady O&#146;Cathain, have said, that it is the best interests of a child to have two parents, one of each sex. Many unfortunate children do not, but they have been born without the use of artificial processes, often paid for by the taxpayer. I therefore support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech.</p>

Sometimes conversations off-stage, out of your Lordship&#146;s Chamber, can be very instructive. I have heard a couple of conversations outside this Chamber that have pulled me up short. The first was the suggestion that the Bill is concerned with something so tiny&#151;the end of a little finger was pointed to&#151;that it could not be very interesting or important. I expect that others may have thought that in the middle of the last century when the word atom was first entering discourse in this country.</p>

We have every reason to be grateful to experts. However, on debate of a public Bill in the High Court of Parliament, we owe it to the public to be understandable, and a danger lies the other way. At least this debate on fatherhood is one in which we can all become involved and join in, whether we are experts or not. Everyone has had a mother and father, even, if alas, so many people have not known one or the other.</p>

The Government and the globally renowned experts to whom they had referred for help could not agree a

Yet flip over to page 36 and off we go into a magical mystery tour about what an earth the word &#147;father&#147; might mean in different times and places, as a sign. This leads me to the conclusion that the Government, either by design or, as I suspect, by a muddled series of accidents, have ended up attempting to deconstruct the meaning of fatherhood in the Bill, divorcing male parenthood from biological reality as well as from practical and moral responsibilities. I hope that noble Lords do not find this language too strong, but I find that wrong&#151;not right&#151;if I can use such a tough word in polite discourse in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

However, if faced with a choice between the hope of adults to become parents or the welfare and best interests of a child, which all the research that I have seen indicates is helped by a father or a long-term male role model, I would pick the best interests of the child every time. That is why it is so very odd to provide that some children can be legally barred at conception from having one of these &#147;fathers&#148;. It seems as though the Government now see fathers as rather curious creatures. Rather, the Bill should emphasise, here as elsewhere, that the best interests of the child, if that child is created through fertility treatment, should be considered paramount.</p>

The Prime Minister seems to me, as an outsider, to be an exemplary father. Yet if his Government&#146;s legislation gets through as it is now drafted, it is likely to lead, whether intentionally or not, to the deconstruction over time of fatherhood in this country, and to the incipient devaluation, by the signs that the Government

I am in no way homophobic; I have&#151;if I may put it this way&#151;supported the Stonewall ticket on quite a few issues in this House. I disagree with the Government&#146;s amendment for one very simple reason: I consider it to be inconsistent with the Government&#146;s own family policy.

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0712108000017"></a>My position on the wording of the 1990 Act is very similar to that set out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, on Second Reading. It is worth remembering, as he clearly explained then, that the provision on the child&#146;s need for a father,</p>
<ul><a name="0712108000054"></a>&#147;was negotiated here within this House with considerable care and it was accepted unanimously here and I think also in the House of Commons&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; col. 669.]</ul>
<p><a name="0712108000051"></a>The Government have not made the case for changing that position. I was reinforced in that view by the number of people across the House who spoke in support of that approach. If I may remind the House, even the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, after what I might call a rather racy tilt at the 1990 wording, concluded that she,</p>

I am not going to wade through the research evidence, but the Joint Committee on the draft Bill did. It also took oral evidence from a large number of experts in this field. It concluded that the balance of view on the committee was that,</p>

<p><a name="0712108000019"></a>The Joint Committee made two other concluding remarks of some significance. The first was that it had,</p>
<ul><a name="0712108000058"></a>&#147;little evidence that the existing provisions have caused harm&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712108000020"></a>Secondly, it recognised that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="0712108000055"></a>&#147;In an area such as this, the law has symbolic value&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0712108000022"></a>I shall address the three main arguments that I have heard levelled against the wording of the 1990 Act. First, it is difficult to administer. Secondly, it brings fertility treatment into line with adoption policy. Thirdly, the wording discriminates against single women and gay couples. I am well aware that some doctors involved in fertility treatment are uncomfortable applying the &#147;father test&#148;, if I may call it that.

<ul><a name="0712108000059"></a>&#147;doctors deciding which families are desirable and which are undesirable&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; col. 857].</ul>
<p><a name="0712108000052"></a>However, the legislation, even after the Government&#146;s amendment on fathers, still requires those providing treatment to pick and choose.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0712108000023"></a>Fertility treatment is not an NHS service on demand, which is why some people go elsewhere and probably will continue to do so. The legislation now requires those providing NHS fertility treatment to satisfy themselves on the likely welfare of an unborn child and will continue to do so even after the Government&#146;s wording. Some people will be rejected and probably should be. That is the requirement that Parliament is making of doctors as part of the licensing system. It is inescapable that that requirement remains in place. In making those judgments, the grounds for excluding the father provisions as part of the criteria have not been well established. If doctors need more help in making that judgment, let us provide it. We will get on to that in later amendments. That is no ground for ditching the wording in the 1990 Act.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0712108000024"></a>The consistency with adoption policy issue is a poor argument, as the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, said. In the first case, the adoption agency is confronted with a child who already exists. Too often it has found it difficult to place them because of difficulties or disabilities. It has to be able to choose the best home it can in the circumstances it faces or leave the child in local authority care. That is not the situation faced by a person who is licensed to offer fertility treatment. He or she has to decide whether the person seeking help is in a set of social circumstances in which the unborn child&#146;s welfare is likely to be protected. For 17 years, the law has rightly asked them to have regard to the need for a father. The most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York made those distinctions very well at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0712108000025"></a>Finally, I turn to the contentious issue of whether the &#147;need for a father&#148; wording discriminates against single women or gay couples. As has already been mentioned, the 1990 Act wording has not debarred single or gay couples from accessing IVF on the NHS if they can convince a licence-holder with regard to the welfare of a child. So, already in practice, there is no absolute discrimination against them. Perhaps I

That seems to be the nub of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee&#146;s report against the existing wording. Given the research evidence that has been quoted, I consider it highly questionable whether we should do so, but more particularly because of the Government&#146;s policy on the family and the importance of parenting and fathers.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0712108000026"></a>In any case, if a single woman or a gay couple&#146;s circumstances call into question their capacity to protect the welfare of the prospective child, a licence holder, as I said earlier, would still be required to reject that because of the welfare of the child requirements. By deleting the wording in the 1990 Act, I believe that we are giving an ambiguous signal to licence holders that they do not have to take as seriously the welfare of the child requirements in the 1990 Act. It is a diluted version of the 1990 Act wording.</p>

I make no comment on any of the other amendments, but the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, made the case extremely well. I wanted to supplement that case. I hope that the Minister will take this away, although I realise that this is not much to do with him. He is playing the hand that he was dealt before he arrived on the scene, for which he has my great sympathy. But I hope that he will remind some of his colleagues, some of whom were still in government when the family policy was being developed earlier on in our time, that this is an important issue and that the symbolism should not be ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0712108000032"></a>As we sit here today, 24 per cent of the nation&#146;s children are growing up in families without a live-in father. Some of these single-parent families arise from the death of the father, others from family breakdown, but in many cases the father has simply not accepted

He has often moved on to set up another family. If the Government carelessly give the impression in this Bill that they are downgrading the importance of a committed father in the family, there will certainly be more single-parent families in the future than there are today. If the Minister does not believe that the general public will notice the Government&#146;s apparent change of heart, I suggest he looks at the Sunday papers of three or four weekends ago. The press are watching this space, and so are the public.</p>

I think it is important that this House remember that there are single-sex couples and single parents. When in another life I was a judge, I made numerous orders which had the effect of children living with two fathers, two mothers or a single mother. As the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, said, that is a wholly different situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0712108000035"></a>For the Government to remove the requirement in the 1990 Act is to send a message to the public. It is a very important message, and one only the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has referred to so far: that fathers are not all that important&#151;that they do not matter. There are a large number of fathers&#146; organisations out there, and I suffered Fathers 4 Justice over a number of years. However, there are some moderate fathers&#146; organisations who will feel demoted by the removal of this part of the 1990 Act. The Government may say that they do not intend that that should be the effect. Intentionally or unintentionally, the message will go out to fathers, and the Government cannot ignore that. It is also contrary to the ethos of the child legislation and the ethos of this Government, as has already been said, concerning the importance of fathers in the life of children.</p>

<a name="71210-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0712108000036"></a>If the amendment is successful and Clause 14(2)(b) is removed, it would not do any harm to single-sex parents or to single parents. It would recognise the vital contribution of fathers, not to every family&#151;and we must acknowledge that single-sex couples and single parents bring up many children successfully&#151;but to many families. We are looking at what message is being sent out. In my respectful view, the Government must not allow some groups to prevail over the welfare of children.</p>

Patients come because they might need hormonal therapy or tubal surgery to improve their fertility. Their parenting skills may be looked at but that is not a legal obligation at that stage. Only when they come, finally&#151;having gone through many of these procedures&#151;to IVF are they suddenly faced with having to answer questions about whether they are suitable parents and whether a father should be involved. That puts an illogicality into a system. Of course fatherhood is important but should it be part of the Bill? For example, a patient who has gone through the various treatments may come to IVF and suddenly say, &#147;I am unsure whether this person is someone I wish to be the father of my unborn child&#148;, casting doubt on the need for the father in that instance. What would if happen if they were turned down? That would create enormous problems for the doctor and the patient. That is an intolerable situation to put future parents in, so I oppose the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0712108000053"></a>That may very well be so; I listened with great respect and attention to what she said. However, the symbolic effect of this clause bears most directly, year after year, on people seeking IVF. That is where the symbolic effect will come home with startling clarity. We must ask about the effect of agreeing to this amendment on people who are seeking IVF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0712108000040"></a>We are all agreed that fatherhood brings a huge amount to a family; that is not in doubt. As has been said time and again, the studies continually reinforce that. But we all know&#151;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will say something about this&#151;about the studies that show the even more important effect of a stable and loving environment and of supportive relationships, whatever the sex. In weighing the symbolic effect of what we do today, I ask the Committee to take into account the symbolic effect not only upon the wider public, however this is reported, but on people who, year after year, seek in vitro fertilisation treatment.</p>

Therefore, most of the speeches were in defence of the values and virtues of fatherhood. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, rightly said, that is not what we should be arguing today. That is perfectly proper for general debate or possibly even at Second Reading, but we are looking at which words should be in the Bill&#151;neither more nor less.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_36"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0712108000042"></a>I doubt that anyone in the Committee would dispute the value of fatherhood and the need for fathers or for good male role models&#151;grandparents, uncles, or whoever&#151;in the absence of fathers. I cannot believe that anyone would dissent from that view, so what are we arguing about? It is not about fatherhood, or about 80, 100 or 150 pieces of research. It is not about that at all. As for my noble friend Lord Warner saying that the joint scrutiny committee wished to keep the original words in, I recall that it was a straw vote of 7:7 and the chairman voted a second time to reinsert it, so, in all fairness, it was evenly balanced. That was the result, although it could have been different on a different day, as obviously some of that committee&#146;s members were missing.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0712108000043"></a>The question is whether these words are workable if they are in the Bill, and if they are&#151;and I believe that they probably are not&#151;whether they are also fair. If they are workable, they are not fair. If the words are meaningless then they should not be in the Bill; some people might think them a message, but frankly these are vacuous words. We should not be using legislation to carry personal views in that way. We are operating by the law of the land, which has to be administered by clinicians in their day-to-day dealings. However much we may value fatherhood&#151;as I certainly do and have done&#151;empty rhetoric is not part and process of what those clinicians should be engaged in dispensing when dealing with their patients.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0712108000044"></a>Let us say that the amendment is to be voted for and that this is not just about rhetoric but meant to have practical effects. Therefore, when a single woman presents without an obliging male in tow she is, presumably, to be refused treatment while a heterosexual woman presenting with an obliging male in tow is permitted treatment. Now, I know from eight years work on child policy that the best predictor of good outcomes for the girl child of a lone parent is if that parent goes into work, while the best predictor for the boy child of a lone parent is if that boy is in active contact with his natural father. I know and believe those things, so I am being consistent with government policy. Yet I also know that the average time that a woman spends as a lone parent is not a lifetime sentence, but two and a half years. She is likely to re-partner&#151;for good or bad, but I hope for good.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0712108000045"></a>We also know that when a heterosexual woman comes with an obliging partner in tow, if that is the husband then 50 per cent of those marriages will end in divorce, and if they are cohabiting then two-thirds will break up. In other words, what happens at the point of presentation for IVF treatment bears little connection or correlation to whether a man or a male partner will, as a result, play a long-term role in the life of the child. If the woman is single, a male partner may come on to the scene and be with her. If that woman is partnered, it is unfortunately more than likely that their relationship will break up before that child even reaches their teens. Those are the facts; we do not know, and neither do they.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0712108000046"></a>I do not doubt that they will seek to make it work. My point is about using IVF treatment as the litmus test of whether that woman will or will not have a child, without her knowing whether the man who is  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there at that point will continue to be an active, engaged father in that child&#146;s life. Much as we would wish it, the facts are that the odds against that are more than even.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0712108000047"></a>That is why we should not be engaged in high-flown rhetoric about the need for a father, which I share. We should not seek to put that in the Bill when in practice whatever we say in the Bill will not affect human behaviour. What it will do, to pick up the point made by the noble and right reverend Lord, is send out a different message. It will not say that fathers are necessary or desirable&#151;it will not change that behaviour at all. It will send out a message that all families without fathers, whether the children were conceived through IVF or, even more widely, naturally, are second-class and second-rate. Those children face the reality of stigma.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0712108000048"></a>More than one message would come out of the Bill if this amendment were accepted. Although I recognise, along with all of us, that fatherhood is important and that the welfare of the child is paramount, those words do not belong in the Bill.</p>

The phrase is incorporated within the provision about consideration of the welfare of the child, nothing else. Those who have spoken about this matter admit that an important aspect of the welfare of a child is the need for a father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0712109000002"></a>The House of Lords and the House of Commons in 1990 were not ignorant of the fact that fathers die and that there is no right to a father. Although that was 17 years ago and we are all getting a bit older, that was well understood in the Parliament of 1990 and I am sure that it is understood by everyone today. This amendment talks about an element of the welfare of the child. Parliament in 1990 and this Government wish to continue the requirement that, in IVF where a doctor is responsible for supervising the procedure, if I can call it that, in a way that he is not in other modes of conception, he should have regard for the welfare of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0712109000003"></a>The statement occurs twice in the 1990 Act and once in particular in reference to guidance. The HFEA has published guidance since 1990 and continues to do so. It has modified that guidance over the years and, since 1997, Secretaries of State have continued to allow that guidance to go out. The evidence before the Joint Committee was absolutely clear that the inclusion of that phrase, when it is interpreted in the light of the guidance, has done no harm to anyone. What the doctor looks for, as the evidence shows, is some person who can be a role model&#151;a model of male thought as distinct from female thought&#151;in the life of the child.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0712109000004"></a>As the noble Baroness said, we do not know what will happen tomorrow. That person might not be alive when the child is born. But even women who bear children by IVF may not necessarily live all that long. Nobody can tell. I thought that this was a very reasonable thing to include in 1990. It is not prescriptive in any sense. It does not debar people from getting IVF when no father is in the offing but it requires the child&#146;s need for a father to be considered as a factor in the welfare of the child.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0712109000005"></a>I make it absolutely clear that I well understand that often because of circumstances there is no father in a family. The father may have died. I have no doubt that in the vast majority of cases where that happens, but not all, and a mother is left on her own, she would dearly like to have had the support of the father, her husband, for longer. We know many examples&#151;some in this House&#151;of people who have been brought up by a widowed mother with outstanding success. I do not want anyone to think that this provision has any bearing on that matter. However, those who support the relevant provision in the Act accept the noble Baroness&#146;s argument that a father is an important factor in the welfare of the child. That is what the 1990 Act stipulates and asks should be considered, without imposing any sanction if, for some good reason, that aspect of the welfare of the child cannot be provided.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0712109000006"></a>My noble friend Lord Tebbit said that this matter arises at the preconception stage, but preconception must necessarily precede birth, so the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is perfectly in order. It is after birth that the welfare provision really takes effect, but you have to judge it before conception in this requirement. Thus an element of future judgment with very variable factors is involved, but the doctor makes the best judgment that he or she can and then acts on it.</p>

My two younger siblings did not know their father. As I grow older, there is hardly a single day when I do not think more about my father than I did as a child.

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0712109000010"></a>Of all the people who have spoken this afternoon, I am the one person who in the last 30 years or so has sat in front of infertile patients who want to have treatment. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, that it is not appropriate for doctors to police these things in our society. It is dangerous for us to do so and leads to all sorts of problems. It is one of the reasons why doctors recently have sometimes got into trouble, because they have tried to interpret what is in the interests of society rather than understanding above all the autonomy of the patient sitting in front of them. I know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but it is interesting to consider the position of the Nazi doctor. Nazi doctors no doubt were working with altruism in their hearts. They believed that what they were doing was in the interest of society. What they forgot was what was in the interest of their patient and the interest of the autonomy of the person seeking help at a time of great pain. That is a very important thing for us to remember.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0712109000011"></a>There are unforetold consequences that have to be spelt out if we are to continue with this. I do not know whether or not this has happened before with in vitro fertilisation, but I must say to my noble friend Lord Warner that it is no good ignoring the evidence. You cannot simply say that you are not interested in the research. The research is fundamentally important to the argument. As the right reverend Prelate has pointed out, there is good research evidence to suggest that, for example, in the case of lesbian couples&#151;</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0712109000014"></a>Let me come back to the argument. In Britain we have only one good study of lesbian couples bringing up children in a controlled fashion; the study compares those children with children born naturally, by in vitro fertilisation and by artificial insemination. The work of Professor Susan Golombok of Cambridge University shows that after nine or 10 years the children brought up by these couples are showing signs of being better parented, are better adjusted to their peers at school and have better relationships with other children than many others in her study.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0712109000015"></a>It is not sufficient to look at studies of single women in our society, because single women in our society, even those such as my mother, have a whole range of other issues. Most women in our society are single because they are poor, because they have been abandoned or because they have been threatened, and they are in an environment that is very much below the standards that we would desire for ourselves. That is something that doctors cannot take into account either, but I suppose that we might be expected to do so if this kind of thing went through British legislation.</p>

As he rightly pointed out, there is not that much research; there is only one longitudinal study in this country. Would he agree that the sample for that research was quite small? At the age of roughly only 16 or 17, the young people going through this are still quite young, so we cannot really say yet what the results of the experience of having same-sex parents are. One thing that we can say is that, of the sample of 25 children growing up in lesbian families, six have had a same-sex relationship while growing up, whereas in the heterosexual sample none has had such a relationship. That may not mean very much, but it suggests that the research that he refers to is slightly more controversial than one might think on first looking at it.</p>

I would have thought that we would accept that information published by peer review after a proper study would be preferable. As far as I am aware&#151;perhaps I am wrong&#151;the Golombok studies in this country are the only ones that have been published on that basis.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0712109000022"></a>I think that we should get on, so let me consider briefly two issues that follow if we do not accept the concept behind this. There are two potential consequences. First, there is a risk of a racist attitude in certain clinics. If I am a doctor in south London and I am dealing with a black patient who has a different social and cultural background where it is regular for fathers to leave mothers pregnant after these kinds of treatments, I could easily find justification for refusing that treatment. That is not just an airy-fairy idea; that is a practical proposition that really can and does happen.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0712109000023"></a>Secondly, we should really think much more seriously about this major problem that is growing in our society. As women get educated, gain skills, increasingly pay taxes and contribute to our society, they grow older, getting more and more infertile, without finding a regular partner. That is not anecdotal; it is well known and published. Older women increasingly often seek help for their infertility without a male partner. They say, &#147;I do not want a male partner yet; I hope that I might find one in time&#148;. As my noble friend Lady Hollis said, that is a real problem that we frequently see in infertility clinics. From a practical point of view, it is not desirable to refuse treatment to those women. It cannot be desirable. We need to consider that when we are producing the legislation.</p>

<a name="71210-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0712109000024"></a>I congratulate the Government on removing the sentence from the legislation. I do not think that it in any way undermines our collective recognition that there is a desire to look after, nurture and, above all, love children. Love is the key issue here, but it is something that we as practitioners and we as members of society who are looking on cannot measure.</p>

In the case of the 40 year-old woman who has put off having a child until quite a late age and finds that she is infertile, does my noble friend believe that it is still the responsibility of the doctor before he gives that treatment under this legislation to establish whether giving that woman the treatment will be in the interests of the welfare of the unconceived, unborn child?</p>

Fifty years ago when a lot of anti-social conduct was stigmatised, I think that we had rather less of such conduct. A stigma should be attached to all sorts of anti-social conduct.

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0712109000030"></a>I am also disturbed by the number of occasions in the debate when we have drifted away from the most important thing, which is not the skill of the technologists&#151;the doctors who provide IVF in this case. We always have to be careful about making policy on the basis of the views of the technologists. I happen to be a flying machine technologist, but no one in your Lordships&#146; House should take any more notice of my views on policy on aviation and commercial flying than the views of anybody else.

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0712109000033"></a>We also seem to have drifted away from the concept of the intervention of the technologist in creating life. The status quo if a patient goes for IVF is that there is no child. When the technologist intervenes to change that, he has to take responsibility. The legislation on these matters is the guidance that society is saying to the technologist that he should use. That is what is important. I had hoped that we had all agreed in our hearts as well as in our mouths that it is of absolute importance that we are talking about the creation of a life that does not exist. Therefore, legislators and doctors&#151;as the technologists&#151;have that responsibility on their shoulders. It is exactly the same responsibility that we ask a man and woman to bear when they create a child naturally. Should they not consider whether they have the means to sustain the child? Should they not consider their own health and the possibility of the child inheriting ill health? Should they not consider whether one of the partners is very old and therefore likely to die when the child is young? These matters must be considered when a life that does not exist is going to be created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0712109000034"></a>Of course we can slip easily into the idea that there is a right to a child. There is no right to a child. A child has a right to a parent; in fact, a child has a right to two parents, preferably one of each sex. I hope that I am not stigmatised for that remark.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0712109000035"></a>There is a responsibility here: the responsibility to ensure that, on balance&#151;for there are no certainties in these matters&#151;we give the child whose life we create the best possible chance. A child is not a consumer accessory, nor, as I say, does any of us have the right to have a child. A child is a great gift and a great responsibility; those who create that life carry the responsibility for ever. When the technician creates that life, he has on his shoulders the responsibility for what he has done as well as possibly feeling that he would have a responsibility if he did not do it.</p>

In many of the overspill estates and in the inner-city areas, vast numbers of families have no men involved in the upbringing of the children. To add deliberately to that number would be ludicrous. For the law to send a signal&#151;not to stigmatise others&#151;that we do not think men are very important in this equation plays into the arguments of male redundancy on which Dr Desmond Morris touched rather well this morning in the <I>Times </I>newspaper. Men are not redundant. They have a unique role to play in the upbringing of children. It is estimated that some 800,000 children in Britain do not have access to their fathers at present.

However, if there are examples of the kind to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has just referred&#151;I accept that he is not a hostile witness&#151;we need to know about those cases before we start to change the law on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07121019000010"></a>I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to two newspaper articles that appeared last week. One was in the &#147;Law Report&#148; on Wednesday 5 December. It was a judgment by Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Lawrence Collins from 23 November 2007, stating that adoption agencies have no duty to consult fathers:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07121019000039"></a>&#147;There was no duty on a local authority to make inquiries of a child&#146;s extended family or father about the possibility of their providing long-term care where mother wished to place the child for adoption&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121019000035"></a>Interestingly, on the same day, in the same newspaper, the Child Support Agency&#151;another government agency&#151;was reported as pursuing a Mr Andy Bathie, who is not recognised as the legal parent of a child who was conceived by IVF by a same-sex couple. He is now being pursued to pay thousands of pounds and he is required to accept responsibility as the father of that child. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, shakes his head, but &#163;400, as a result of a paternity test, was docked from his pay.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07121019000011"></a>Without going into the details of the case, I use it to argue that we are getting into quite a muddle on the duties and responsibilities of a father. I think it would suit a lot of men to be told that they had no duty or responsibility. Is that not at the heart of the problem? The noble Lord, Lord Winston, was right to remind us that we all cherish the memory of our fathers, however long we have known them. If we were to remove the biological identity of a father from a birth certificate, that would be the state colluding in a deception, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and others on the Joint Committee. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, reminded us at Second Reading, even Acts of Parliament cannot remove the biological necessity of the father to be present. Do not let us reduce the role of men to the provision of gametes in fertility tests. It is important that we recognise the social role that men have to play as fathers as well. I am very pleased to be able to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend Lady Deech.</p>

My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay referred to Members of the House who may have been brought up in fatherless households. I was one of them. My mother was widowed with four boys under 12. My youngest brother never knew his father at all. Of course, we are not typical. We had other relations; we had uncles and grandparents and we were extremely well looked after, but I would not for one moment argue that perhaps we would not have been better off if my father had survived. It is important to recognise that.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07121019000013"></a>The other point is that people, such as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, have spoken of the Joint Committee as wishing to retain the words,</p>
<ul><a name="07121019000040"></a>&#147;including the need of that child for a father&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121019000036"></a>But we very firmly went on to say that we would not wish to exclude the possibility of women seeking in vitro fertilisation help where there is no father because a woman is single or because she is in a lesbian relationship. We did not want to exclude them. We recognise the case, but at the same time we said, as so many noble Lords have said today, that retaining the words of the 1990 Act is important and excluding them would send the wrong message. That is what the Joint Committee decided and put in its recommendation. It is important. It was not either/or; it was the desirability of retaining the words in the 1990 Act while making it perfectly clear that those who did not fit that pattern of a family should not automatically be excluded. Some things that have been said today have suggested that they would automatically have been turned away. That is not true.</p>

I stand to neither oppose nor support my noble friend Lady Deech, but to raise some questions about the way in which the arguments have been presented. I think that is the nature of the difficulty we are in. I would like interrogation of every family who has a child to ensure that that child has a stable family. I do not much mind how that stable family is constituted. There is more research in America showing that same-sex couples are able to give a sustained relationship to children, but that some break down, just as many families with fathers break down. I suppose that, along with my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss, having seen the difficult end of fatherhood adds to some of my prejudice about recognising that families with fathers are not as ideal as some of us would wish to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07121019000015"></a>As a rider, I should say that I had the most terrific and wonderful father, who loved me to bits and gave me a great deal of what I am, so I do not come from the position of having had a father whom I did not adore. However, I know that there are many men who do not make good fathers. But who do we ask to interrogate anyone&#151;of any sex or orientation&#151;who turns up at a clinic? As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said, what kind of questions do you ask to  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_47"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensure that a family is going to be stable? I put it to your Lordships that we would not know the answer, even if on the day it looked as though there was a stable family. My experience is that families often break down when children become difficult or when there is economic stress or sickness&#151;things that often cannot be predicted when facing that moment in the clinic.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07121019000016"></a>Many of the families that I would rather not have children are the ones that will have the children anyway. I do not have the statistics before me, because I did not know that I was going to speak, but I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, would have exactly the same sense that I have from them&#151;&#147;If only we had not got X number of single, young parents&#148;. We have, because intercourse and the birth of children are matters of chance. I hope that that chance can be planned. I hope that that plan can bring security to our children, because without a doubt the only thing that matters is the welfare of the child. However, many adults will not have that in mind when looking to have a child.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07121019000017"></a>Why, when a person goes to a clinic, should we interrogate them about their family when we are not going to do that in a million other families across the nation? I have asked myself that, without conclusion. The answer may be that we do it because we have the opportunity. In that case, we should ask not only whether there is a father on the scene, but a whole range of other questions about whether people going for IVF have the capacity to be good families. I think that then we would end up saying middle-class families; some of the criteria being put would be middle class. Those would be moral judgments from a particular, stereotyped set of moral views.</p>

There may be something about messages, and there may be something about the support of fatherhood that we need to look at&#151;which is why I am still looking at the issue, because I would not want to do anything that undermined men and fathers. They are important. They are one bit of the stability in families. However, our nation is extraordinarily complex. The family trees that I see are sometimes totally unbelievable. We live in that environment and that is the one in which we have to make those decisions.</p>

One is the right to know who the father is. The second is the right to have the prospect of a relationship with that father&#151;if possible, as there are practical difficulties. Both rights have to be considered at a meaningful time in the age of the child.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07121019000024"></a>As far as the right to know the father is concerned, I am sure that there would be no dissent in the Committee with the proposition that a person has the inalienable moral right to know where half his genes come from&#151;quite apart from the question of international conventions, where that right is enshrined in the convention on the child. Can there be a more fundamental human right? Put another way, would anyone wish to deny that right, where it can be reasonably exercised, to any person? If I am right, that forms a very impacted background to what we are considering this afternoon and may be the very beginning of wisdom. If you accept that a child has the right to know who has procreated him, who is responsible for a large part of his personality and half his genes, then I think that it has some light to cast and, indeed, some very impacted influence on the second question&#151;whether there should be a chance of a relationship. There are hundreds and thousands of fathers in England and Wales at the moment who have no intention of doing anything at all with their children. I accept that that is not really the issue with this amendment, but it is a huge problem and one that, some day, I would like Parliament to apply its mind to. There is a limit to what can be done but, for all the furore about fathers being denied rights of contact, hundreds of thousands of fathers have no wish to have contact at all and are depriving their children of that second, massive right.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07121019000025"></a>Going back to the first right, if I am correct about the right to know, then the question that should be asked of the mother&#151;as very properly posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;is whether she appreciates that it is an inalienable right of the child to know who his father is. If I am correct about that&#151;there may be the utterly exceptional case, where the welfare of the child might reasonably demand that that should not be known, but that would not be so in 99.9 per cent of cases&#151;then it has some relevance to the amendment.</p>

I am trying to look forward. Would there be a civil or a criminal burden of proof against healthcare professionals called before the General Medical Council? If the law continues as it is and there will be no case against healthcare professionals, it would be very helpful for the version of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay&#151;the current situation&#151;to remain. However, if it becomes an offence for healthcare professionals not to take that as an absolute in assessing women, it becomes very difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<a name="71210-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07121019000027"></a>I understand that that is not the case, but it would be helpful for the Minister to clarify that, because there are problems for healthcare professionals making so-called value judgments. All kinds of different people come before them as parents in all shapes and sizes. It is very easy for healthcare professionals working in a clinic naturally to gravitate towards people who are a little bit more like them and to empathise a little more with them. Providing that they cannot do that&#151;the Bill and the 1990 Act do not encourage that&#151;that may provide reassurance to people who have concerns.</p>

In the debate, a number of very different issues have been conflated in ways that are not altogether helpful. Issues about how and whether children should know their genetic identity have been mixed with attitudes towards existing law, such as civil partnerships. When noble Lords go back to read this debate, they will see that two or three different factors are being mixed together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07121019000029"></a>I want to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, one simple thing. Will she make available to the Committee the 80&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, cited the figure of 100&#151;pieces of research? The noble Lord, Lord Winston, made a very important point. In areas of social policy, it is extremely important to work from an evidence base. One thing that has worried me all afternoon is that people have made extrapolations from different pieces of research and drawn comparisons that are false. Noble Lords have made extrapolations from the UNICEF report. The UNICEF report showed that in terms of children's well-being, this country was in a very bad way, but it also showed conclusively that economic status of a family had a great impact on the well-being of children in a number of different aspects of their life chances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07121019000030"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, made a couple of remarks that I found extraordinary. She talked about studies that showed that same-sex couples&#151;in Sweden, I think&#151;had a median relationship of 25 months. I do not know, because I do not know what the research is, but it is entirely possible that that includes everyone from teenagers through to people who are very old and on to a second relationship. It does not present any kind of data valid to those gay couples who would consider themselves to be the right ones to bring up children and offer stability.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07121019000031"></a>I cite those as two examples; there may be more. The noble Baroness talked about the need for children to see parents of the opposite sex and the importance of their being brought up in relationships in which

I assume from that that she is assuming that in gay relationships, there would be denigration of the opposite sex. I do not know the basis on which she makes that assertion. I simply ask her to make her evidence available to all noble Lords, so that we can come to a conclusion.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07121019000032"></a>I want to make one point that has not been made all afternoon. Bear in mind that we are talking about clinicians carrying out one particular treatment. I trust that clinicians use the same basis to judge any person who presents to them for that treatment. That is what clinicians do across the board. They do not make sweeping judgments about groups within the population; they look at the needs of the person presenting to them. When they do that, one judgment that they make is the consequence of their not providing that treatment. I hope that noble Lords will accept that I think that the welfare of children is paramount in all this. If single women and gay couples are intent on fulfilling what for them is&#151;I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit&#151;not a right but an understandable urge to have children, it is better for them to have access to health treatment that is safe for them and for the children who result. That is all that is being asked for: equality of consideration.</p>

I must begin by repeating some of the important points that were made then. However, before I do so, I should also say that this is a wide-ranging group of amendments and that, if there is a vote on one of them today, we will not necessarily consider that all the later amendments in the group can be taken as being consequential on the decision on the earlier amendment.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07121031000002"></a>I stress that the Government&#146;s decision to propose the removal of the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="07121031000060"></a>&#147;including the need for a father&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121031000056"></a>is not motivated by any attack on fathers or the concept of fatherhood. Nor is it an attempt at political correctness. The Government recognise clearly the extremely important role played by fathers in their children&#146;s lives and the serious consequences that can follow where a relationship breaks down. That is why the Government have taken action to strengthen the role of fathers and to ensure that fathers are aware of their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07121031000003"></a>However, we are dealing here with a very specific context, and other factors come into play. As the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, said at Second Reading, we are all clear that the legislation does not in any way abolish the biological reality of fathers. That is quite correct: the Bill will not sweep away the biological need for men, but nor will it change the social reality of fathers for the overwhelming majority of families in this country, either now or in future. The idea that the Bill in any way sounds the death knell for fathers is very far removed from the truth.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07121031000004"></a>The question that we are dealing with is the duties placed on clinicians by law to examine and judge their patients. As a clinician, I am well aware of the difficulty of making such judgments about people&#146;s circumstances

The Government came to the view that, on balance, the reference in the 1990 Act to,</p>
<ul><a name="07121031000061"></a>&#147;the need for a father&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121031000057"></a>should be removed, but that the general duty to consider the welfare of the child in a broad sense should remain. Clause 14(2)(b) removes the words,</p>
<ul><a name="07121031000062"></a>&#147;including the need of that child for a father&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121031000058"></a>from Section 13(5) of the 1990 Act.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07121031000005"></a>There is no ban on single women or same-sex couples receiving assisted-conception treatment. There is no requirement in law that there must be a father or any man involved in the upbringing of the child. Nor is it a matter of policy that single women or same-sex couples should not be able to access clinics.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07121031000006"></a>The outcome intended to be achieved by the wording of the 1990 Act is therefore unclear. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, has previously remarked, it is ineffective and wishy-washy. To retain the provision would be to perpetuate a confusing and potentially discriminatory situation. I echo the lucid analysis of my noble friend Lady Hollis, at Second Reading, that fathers belong in children&#146;s lives but that the phrase does not belong in the Bill. Either the question is meaningless, or the answer is ignored, or both are meaningful and therefore discriminatory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07121031000007"></a>Amendment No. 55, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, would retain the existing requirement for consideration of a child&#146;s need for a father to be a condition of a treatment licence. Amendment No. 56 adds the requirement to consider the child&#146;s need for a mother.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07121031000008"></a>The Bill retains the provision that requires a clinician to take into account the welfare of any child born as a result of treatment services when providing treatment. By removing the requirement to consider the need for a father, we are recognising the existence of a wider range of family arrangements. It is vital that children are raised in a loving and supportive family environment. The evidence suggests that the quality of parenting is the factor of prime importance and not necessarily the gender, or even the size, of the family. The Government fully recognise the important role that fathers play in their children&#146;s lives. The proposal does not detract from that role but it does recognise the crucial role played by all parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07121031000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to a man being pursued by the Child Support Agency after providing sperm to a lesbian couple. My understanding is that the sperm was donated through a private arrangement&#151;outside the scope of the Bill&#151;and the removal of the provision on the need for a father will seriously encourage that in future. It did not come under the provision of the 1990 Act. Therefore, legally, the sperm provider, or the donor, is the father of that child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07121031000010"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, talked about the responsibility that will be placed on a clinician. It will be interesting to debate that when we discuss&#151;next April, I believe&#151;the Bill on professional regulation.

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07121031000011"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, has signalled her intent to oppose clauses in Part 2 and the associated Schedule 6. She has made clear her views about the importance of parenthood and the foremost interest of the child within the family setting. She has been supported by many noble Lords, who have expressed their concerns most forcefully. I fully understand the points made about the general principle that children should be brought up in a supportive family environment. No one would disagree with that. However, it is essential that we do not become sidetracked by general principles, important as they are, and risk losing sight of precisely what the Bill seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07121031000012"></a>In essence, the Bill seeks to address current anomalies in the law in which parenthood is bestowed following treatment involving donated sperm. Addressing these anomalies is in the best interests of the child. Let me be clear what those anomalies are. At present, if an unmarried man and a woman, who may have known each other only for a short time, have treatment together at a licensed fertility clinic using donated sperm, the man will, as a matter of course, be regarded as the father of any resulting child. He will be recorded on the child&#146;s birth certificate as such. In comparison, where two women in a civil partnership, who have been in a stable relationship for many years, have treatment in a licensed clinic using donated sperm, they are treated very differently. First, although the civil partner who gives birth is regarded, quite rightly, as the mother of the child, the other civil partner has no parental recognition or rights in respect of the child at all&#151;this is a child, let us not forget, who is born to her legal partner. Secondly, the child would have only one parent, the mother, recorded on their birth certificate. These anomalies do not serve the best interests of the child. The Bill addresses them by enabling the child in such a situation to have two legal parents instead of one, both of whom could be recorded on the birth certificate as the mother and a parent.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07121031000013"></a>Let me take this opportunity to clarify that it is our intention that the child will have one mother and a parent, not two mothers. The woman who gives birth to the child will be the mother of the child. Clause 33 is absolutely clear about this. I hope that this clarification will put your Lordships&#146; minds at ease, knowing that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to allow for a child to have two mothers.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07121031000014"></a>We must keep in mind that the legal parenthood provisions in the Bill appear only where donated sperm is involved. The 1990 Act ensures that sperm donors are not regarded as the father of any children born from their donation. Recognition of a same-sex couple as the parents of the child born following treatment with donor sperm does not take the parenthood from the father or oust him from the birth certificate, because there is no legal father. On the contrary, it enables the child to have two legal parents. Surely that must be in the best interests of the child.</p>

This provision is in the 1990 Act relating to a woman and a man, but the Bill now includes reference to two women being treated together.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07121031000016"></a>Before providing treatment using donated sperm, clinics are required to offer counselling to a man and woman who are treated together. Further to this, the Bill sets out that any woman shall not be provided with treatment services unless she and an intended second parent have been given a suitable opportunity to receive proper counselling about the implication of signing up to a parenthood agreement in respect of a child who may be born as a result of that treatment. I feel that it is of prime importance for couples to be encouraged to receive counselling in these situations in order to give them an opportunity to consider all the implications and consequences of treatments. The Government believe that it is highly desirable for any person undergoing fertility treatment or undergoing a parenthood agreement to receive counselling, in order to give them this opportunity. It is important that, when two people are signing up to a parenthood agreement, they are both fully aware of what this means at all stages of the process. We do not want to restrict this only to men and women being treated together, as the Bill also makes provision for two women to be the legal parents of a child. It is equally important that the intended second parent also has a chance to receive these services in order to understand the serious and lifelong commitment of the parenthood agreements that they are entering into.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07121031000017"></a>On Amendment No. 59A, the Bill makes provision for unmarried heterosexual couples and two women not in a civil partnership to enter into parenthood agreements and be recognised as the parents of a child born through assisted conception. Currently, an unmarried man and a woman who are treated together can both be considered the legal parents where donor sperm is used. The Bill introduces a provision that clarifies the fatherhood of the man through a fatherhood agreement and allows for two women to enter into a parenthood agreement when undergoing fertility treatment services so that they are both legal parents of any resulting child. The Bill sets out who the intended second parent could be in each situation: a male or a female partner of the mother.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07121031000018"></a>The Bill also makes provision for the person responsible to give notice to the intended mother or intended second parent where one party withdraws their consent to the parenthood agreement. If the provisions were removed by the amendment, unmarried couples and two women undergoing fertility treatment would still be able to undergo parenthood agreements but would fall outside the notification procedure. It is vital to let the other parent know that consent has been withdrawn.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07121031000019"></a>I entirely understand the concerns expressed in this debate, but I believe that the proposals in the Bill recognise society as it exists and value all parents. I hope that noble Lords will feel able not to press their amendments and have further discussions before Report.</p>

I am sure that we are all grateful to all those who have participated in it with their particular knowledge. I will touch on a few points. The Bill tells fathers that they are unnecessary. This has symbolic value. If the Government had not decided to remove this provision, clinics, parents and children would have carried on pretty happily as they are now. The attempt to remove it has stirred up this debate and obviously very deep feelings.</p>

<a name="71210-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07121031000025"></a>There is no such thing as a right to a father, or indeed the right to a baby. The latter may be even more important; I refer to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. As an academic lawyer, I cite the American jurist, Hohfeld, who said that there is no right to a baby and there is no duty to give anyone a baby; it is a privilege. There is a need for a father, not a right to a father or a right to a baby. The law is of course discretionary. We know that the rates of in vitro fertilisation treatment for single women and gay and lesbian couples is going up, probably with no harm done at all, but this is about the symbolism of the law, which is very important. If we were to be totally pragmatic about it, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, argued, we would be leaving birth certificates as they are, but that matter is coming up in a separate amendment. In response to the request by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I will be happy to place in the Library the research that I, and others, have relied on.</p>

In that, I support the noble Lord, Lord Warner. The need for a father goes back millennia. It is a very modern phenomenon indeed, as yet unproven, that there is no need for parents of both sexes. Almost throughout history, the loss of one or the other&#151;not having both&#151;has been regarded as most unfortunate, to put it mildly. We are where we are and the removal of the statement that a child needs a father&#151;the view that a father is a discretionary factor&#151;sends a message. I say that in response to the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07121031000027"></a>I was puzzled by the reference by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, to Nazis, which I thought was uncalled for. Also, I am afraid that love is not all in the upbringing of children. Love is a beginning. We all know that parents need to give their children more than just love.</p>

When doctors forget that the most important person is the person in front of them whom they are treating, they forget their responsibility to that person. There is no suggestion that this is a Nazi amendment. Anyone listening to the debate will understand that I was not saying that. There is a risk in doctors thinking about their responsibility to society; they can forget why they are doing medicine. That is all that I was trying to say. If my remarks were taken in the wrong way, I must apologise, but that was certainly not my intention.</p>

The liberalisation, if it can be called that, of in vitro fertilisation treatment is continuing. It has continued apace since 1990 and it would be best if the law were left untouched. It gives clinicians the discretion to do as they see fit at the time. The compromise drafted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, in 1990 has held fast and held well and we would be well advised to leave it the way it is. It is quite extraordinary to send out the message in this day and age and in the face of research and remaining government policy that men are unnecessary. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, I should say that the research shows that both genders need to have an input into the successful upbringing of a child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07121031000035"></a>The noble Lord said: Expert opinion and modern research tell us&#151;as we have heard many times already this afternoon&#151;that, on average, a child who grows up in a single-parent family is likely to be less successful in school and later life than a child who grows up in a functional two-parent family. Of course, this is not true in every case. In a single-parent family where the mother is healthy, reasonably well off and supported by an extended family or an active and committed community, as my noble friend pointed out, the child may well thrive. Indeed, there are great differences in natural resilience from child to child. The Minister referred to the quality of parenting being of prime importance. Of course it is, but that does not alter the fact that the roles, structures and relationships within the family will affect the quality of parenting. None the less, for the majority of children who grow up in a single-parent family, there are real disadvantages, which can easily last for life&#151;and often do. I admit that remedial help is a possibility for children under those circumstances, but it is expensive, it takes time, it takes commitment and it does not always work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07121031000036"></a>Fathers and mothers both have responsibilities in their families. The contributions made by the mother and father may be different, but both are important. I am reminded of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which, I am delighted to say, has a new logo, which says: &#147;Women. Men. Different. Equal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07121031000037"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 55A is to explore the possibility of a better solution that, rather than saying &#147;Yes, we do&#148; or &#147;No, we do not&#148;, looks for a better way of doing things. I suggest that we do not remove the word &#147;father&#148;, but leave it and add to it other classes of person who can effectively fulfil the role of a father. We all know that that is the situation in real life. There are step-parents, there are grandfathers, there are other surrogate fathers. If we wanted evidence, the success of adoption is the most obvious proof. Adoption, in the vast majority of cases, works extremely well where there is a committed father. I shall emphasise commitment again in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07121031000038"></a>My amendment, therefore, provides for a suitably qualified and committed surrogate father to be acceptable, in lieu of a father, for the purposes of legitimising IVF treatment. Secondly, it would give reasonable assurance that the surrogate father, and all fathers who are put forward to IVF clinics, are prepared and able to make a commitment to give the child the father parenting he will need. Commitment and stability are at the very heart of successful parenting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07121031000039"></a>The conditions I have suggested would require a prospective surrogate father for an IVF child to make a commitment to accept the responsibilities of parenthood in relation to that child. What, then, are the responsibilities of parenthood? This, in a sense, is the question we all danced around in the previous debate. I have taken the liberty of suggesting very simple responsibilities of parenthood; please believe that these are not an invention. I have taken the wording from the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. Many noble Lords will be aware that the Parliament north of the border was bolder on the responsibilities of parenthood in its 1995 Act than we were in our Children Act 1989. We have not made up for the failing in the mean time.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07121031000040"></a>The time may now have come&#151;indeed, I suggest that it is long past&#151;when we in England should define more clearly what we, as a society, expect of our parents. The responsibilities of a mother tend to be widely understood and accepted, but the same is not always true of a father. Many noble Lords who spoke to the previous amendment referred to that large group of fathers who would prefer not to accept that being a father carries with it inalienable responsibilities. To define these responsibilities would, I suggest, be in the best interests of both mothers and children.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07121031000041"></a>Finally, my amendment would sweep natural fathers into the net. This may be objected to, but it seems to me perfectly reasonable that not only a surrogate father, but a natural father, should be expected to commit to being a good parent and should accept some simple terms about what it means to be a good parent. Alas, as we all know, and as some noble Lords have already said, too many families are affected by domestic violence, drug and alcohol addiction and many other failures that are extremely damaging to the children. I can see no reason why an IVF clinic should not be required to satisfy itself that the child it manufactures will not be entrusted to a dysfunctional family of that kind. It seems to me reasonable that, where there is a prospective natural father to the child, he too should be expected to commit to accepting the responsibilities of a parent, as defined in this amendment.</p>

I feel strongly that we have reached a point where we need somewhere in a Bill to state what parents are expected to do.

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07121031000046"></a>The Second Reading debate highlighted three inconvenient truths: first, that boys need fathers or, failing that, a proxy for a father; secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, said, parents are driven to have children and over-prescription may drive prospective parents away from licensed provision into the arms of we know not who, which the noble Lord amplified in Committee; and, thirdly, the concern of my noble friend Lady Warnock that current legislation in respect of the importance of fathers is largely ignored by clinicians.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07121031000047"></a>Many of the boys without an interested father with whom I have worked have yearned for such a parent and I have found myself obliged on occasion to play that role. Lone mothers speak to me about the need of their sons for a father figure. A lone mother&#151;a teacher, who supports the education of children in children&#146;s homes with great success&#151;told me how helpful it would be for her 12 year-old son if his school could find a male physical education teacher, because he is growing up without a father.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07121031000048"></a>The children referred to in the amendment have a very important advantage in that their parents very much want them to be born. Sadly, too many children in this country are not wanted and come about by chance. However, not having an interested male in one&#146;s life is often a contributory factor to failure. Time and again I have heard prison officers in the criminal justice system describing themselves as the first father-figures for their young male inmates. Only last week a 22 year-old man described to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Penal Affairs his long involvement with crime as a drug dealer. He described the lack of a positive male role model when he was growing up on his estate and firmly identified that as the root of his criminal behaviour. Important to his rehabilitation was his relationship with a male drama teacher who inspired him to become an actor and an author.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07121031000049"></a>That was also true for Franois Truffaut, the French director, who made a semi-autobiographical film of his early days, &#147;The 400 Blows&#148;, in which he described his lack of a father. Eventually, he ended up&#151;in the film and in life&#151;in a French reformatory. It is a very sad story. Franois Truffaut admired a male film director very much. He became Truffaut&#146;s mentor, and Truffaut went on to be very successful making his own films.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07121031000050"></a>To ensure that a suitable male is engaged early in the lives of these children is very much to be desired. If the Bill can assist in doing that, it will serve these families extremely well. A constructive and effective framework needs to be set up by the Bill. On the basis that most parents consider the welfare of their children paramount, I hope that we can determine how these prospective parents will receive the right information and advice, which my next amendment will probe. Not to introduce this amendment, or to at least keep the wording of the 1990 Act, would be complicit in the popular fallacy that children do just as well without interested and responsible fathers. That boys need fathers may be an inconvenient truth, but it must not be ignored. I strongly support my noble friend&#146;s helpful and explicit amendment.</p>

He seems to have encapsulated what many of us feel is appropriate and right. The issue on which perhaps we need to reflect is whether these words are a matter for Bill or for statutory guidance. On balance, I tend to feel that the Bill should be confined to general concepts rather than specifics and that the guidance should contain the detail. Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment with care.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07121031000052"></a>In very much the same vein, I have tabled Amendment No. 60. I confess that I find it odd that the 1990 Act should mention a child&#146;s need for a father yet not make any mention at all of something which for me is of even greater importance; namely, the child&#146;s safety. The Bill cannot possibly spell out all the criteria which bear upon the assessment of a child&#146;s welfare. The guidance and the code of practice must surely do that. But if there is one thing that we as legislators are entitled to insist is spelled out in the Bill, it is the requirement that, whenever IVF treatment is sought, an assessment should be made of whether the prospective child, when born, will be at risk of suffering serious harm. That consideration is, I believe, a legitimate concern of the state, and therefore of clinics, in every case. If accepted, my amendment would enshrine that principle.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07121031000053"></a>Another question also should be asked. It is brought into particular focus by this Bill, but in many ways I am surprised that it was not included in the 1990 Act. The issue is stability. When an application for IVF services is made by a married couple or by a couple in a civil partnership, it is perfectly sensible for the welfare assessment to make an assumption&#151;all other things being equal&#151;that the marriage or the civil partnership will provide the basis of a stable upbringing for the child. Of course, no one can  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_60"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>predict the future and the right questions have to be asked. But the fact that two people have committed to live the whole of their lives together is a strong a priori indicator of their long-term intentions.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07121031000054"></a>However, where a man and a woman who are not married apply for treatment, that assumption cannot reasonably be made. The same applies to a same-sex couple who are not in a civil partnership and to a single woman without a partner. Statistically, people who cohabit are at far greater risk of breaking up than those who marry. I am not saying for one second that unmarried couples or single women should be ineligible for IVF. I am saying that for these people there is an additional dimension of the welfare assessment that must be covered and an extra box to be ticked before the test is satisfied. This is not, I believe, an unreasonable suggestion. When assessments are made of prospective adopters of children it is precisely the likely stability of the child&#146;s upbringing which is central to any judgment about the suitability of the person or persons seeking to adopt. Quite rightly, the state sees this assessment as part of its duty of care to the child whose best interests must be protected. Here, the state is instrumental, not in placing a child with adoptive parents, but in bringing a child into existence in the first place. The onus is therefore equally on clinics and clinicians to make an assessment of the stability of the home environment in which that child will find himself</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07121031000055"></a>These two considerations&#151;the safety of the child and the stability of the child&#146;s upbringing&#151;are for me essential elements of the welfare test which cannot be consigned simply to the code of practice. I hope that the Minister will consider my amendment constructively.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07121038000002"></a>When I retired from clinical practice about two years ago, it had been quite common for me to see women who brought a male in tow who was not actually their partner&#151;but they made all sorts of assertions that they were. On one occasion, I was oddly pursued by a journalist who brought a male partner from a newspaper that was trying to discredit lesbian couples. She was not investigating my clinic, she was a lesbian and was very frightened that her editor might find out. It was a very strange event.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07121038000003"></a>All of us in this House agree that there needs to be as much openness as possible in these arrangements. What troubles me about so much of this kind of legislation, and one of the reasons why I am opposed to the need for a father being written into the Bill, is that it encourages a degree of dishonesty among some couples that is surprisingly difficult to detect. It makes no difference whether it is an immediate act or somebody offering long-term support as a male, and that is the problem with this very good and well-meaning set of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07121038000004"></a>The other issue, which we are coming to next and which was touched on by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is that of requiring people to receive counselling. That seems to me a step too far. The offer of counselling is reasonable, but to require it will demand a huge amount of resources for people who will be resistant to it. It is also presumptuous as a requirement on one small group of couples and not applicable to the rest of infertile couples or other people with reproductive disorders.</p>

That is, where many adults are attached or bonded to that child. I would like to see the father in play, or a male figure in play, as well as the mother. There was the point about the village. What worries me&#151;and this is probably a case of &#147;ex-ministerialitis&#148; and the workability of legislation&#151;is how these sorts of propositions will work. I do not disagree with their content, I just do not see how to translate them, if they are in the Bill, into practical policies for clinicians to adopt when investigating the well-being of clients and the appropriateness of fertility treatment.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07121038000007"></a>I share with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, a concern for the safety of the child, the stability of relationship and their long-term well-being as well as the economic viability of the family unit, because we know that the real litmus test of whether a child will flourish is income&#151;at least as much as what type of parent and family structure the child has. I did some research on that because I think it is important.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07121038000008"></a>Perhaps the Minister can tell me, and forgive my ignorance if it exists, whether we produce, with the consent of professionals and the HFEA, appropriate literature for prospective parents? I cannot believe that women would go in for such onerous treatment lightly, but do we ensure that women, and men, where they are active players, have in their hands the literature which indicates what they need to consider for the well-being of the child when going for this treatment? It would embody a lot of the principles of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne; it would not be in the Bill; and it would not necessarily be guidance to the clinician. What is important is that it is internalised and believed in by the parent, otherwise it is manipulation and smoke and mirrors. If we can ensure that the parents believe that this is the best way in which a child conceived in these circumstances will flourish, we would all have the outcome we would like. Therefore, could my noble friend tell me in his winding up whether that literature exists and, if so, whether it could be revised or whether we could make it more appropriate? Perhaps at a very early stage, and with the offer of counselling, it would ensure that any older woman who thinks, wisely or unwisely, she could go it alone was aware of the circumstances that would best secure the child&#146;s most helpful and healthy development. I am sure that is what we all want and what she would want too.</p>

We also hear a lot about not being discriminatory towards women, but we still have in this legislation, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, has reminded us, the welfare of the child. The doctors may not like it, they may find it difficult to do, they may find it uncomfortable to have these conservations with the people in front of them, but it is the will of Parliament to have that provision. If they are struggling with that, if the present guidance is inadequate to help them make those judgments, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, has said, it is probably incumbent on us to amend the legislation about the guidance, and the guidance itself, to make it easier for them to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07121038000014"></a>What I like about the later amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is that, in a sense, they remove some of the doubt. They say that if you go through this process and want the help of the state in providing this treatment, which is regulated, you ought to go for counselling so you fully know what you are getting into. That does not seem to me an unreasonable proposition. The more often he rises to tell me about the difficulties for the doctor actually confronted with the women across the table, the more I say to my noble friend Lord Winston that the doctors need our help here. They are struggling to carry out these responsibilities. If that is the case, we parliamentarians ought to respond to the concerns of my noble friend Lord Hollis&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07121038000021"></a>I say to my noble friend that we spend our time in Parliament making legislation that may, on occasion, be difficult to administer. That is why we often have secondary legislation, guidance, advice and codes of practice: to help the people who must implement parliamentary legislation to do so. This is a similar provision; we take such an approach with adoption and in relation to children who are taken into care. These are difficult and complex issues; no one is denying that. We try to have sound principles underpinning those issues in primary legislation and carry the matter through in more detailed guidance, involving Parliament as necessary. That is what I am suggesting, as is the noble Earl in this amendment and his later amendment. If we care about the issue of fathers and want to put in legislation, at the point of deciding whether to give IVF, a provision to take account of the child&#146;s welfare, it is clearly incumbent on us to ensure that practitioners are able to implement that. That is all I am saying.</p>

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07121038000022"></a>I have a sense that these practical issues are distorting our discussion about the important issue of the unconceived and the unborn child.

<a name="71210-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07121038000023"></a>We should take very seriously the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and I am pretty supportive of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. That amendment is deep in the territory that we got to at the end of our previous debate; that is, whether doctors could be subject to disciplinary proceedings under the new Health and Social Care Bill if we retain the &#147;need for a father&#148; wording in the 1990 Act. That legal advice would clearly affect the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Winston, said that any woman seeking treatment who knew of the provision would bring a man&#151;a friend or anyone&#151;along with her to back up her case. How will a responsible doctor ensure that a genuinely responsible male adult is involved? Are they to interrogate him in the surgery or clinic? How can they ensure that this is not a guy the woman has just met in a bar or at a party who said that he would do this for her?</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07121038000025"></a>The only way in which that amendment could be made to be practical would be to put an economic tag on it and say that if the male adult was the named person when the treatment took place, he had financial responsibility for any child subsequently. In that case, it would be very difficult for a patient seeking treatment to find a man who would, off the top of his head, take on financial responsibility for a child. For those two reasons, I therefore do not see how Amendment No. 55A could possibly work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07121038000026"></a>Amendment No. 60 looks to the general welfare of the child. We have heard many times that the role model for a child&#151;whether it is born by donor sperm or the sperm of its father who later dies or it is born to a couple who subsequently divorce&#151;will eventually be the woman&#146;s social network, family network, the men within the family and her circle of friends. Many males&#151;and, indeed, females&#151;will become role models for the child. Amendment No. 60 encompasses that, is more practical and leaves the situation more open.</p>

We should not immediately cast aside the idea of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge; if a woman wishes to have state aid to help to conceive a child, the state surely has a duty to that child.

In this House, I have learnt from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, to get definitions right. I have been struggling with the definitions here but I will try to address the issues; I am grateful to noble Lords for the amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07121038000033"></a>Amendment No. 55A retains the requirement to take into account the need for a father but adds an alternative to the father by adding,</p>
<ul><a name="07121038000042"></a>&#147;or other suitable male adult who is willing and able to make a long term commitment to safeguard and promote the child's health, development and welfare and to provide, in a manner appropriate to the age and development of the child, direction and guidance to the child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121038000041"></a>I am grateful for the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in which&#151;to come back to the amendment&#151;she said that we could possibly look at other suitable male adults as the other suitable parent. </p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07121038000034"></a>That brings me back to the interesting issue of the definition of parenthood. I have since sought some advice and been told that there is no legal definition of parents but our intention is that someone who is recognised as a parent under this Bill will have the same parental rights and responsibilities as other parents.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07121038000035"></a>Returning to the Bill, the amendments as they stand would signal that treatment services are less accessible where there is not a father or another man fitting the criteria in Amendment No. 55A, or a father and a mother. In considering this, we must be careful not to impose on clinics a duty that represents a sentiment rather than a firm position&#151;there, we are back to definitions. We must also be careful not to drive people away from regulated services and the quality and safety assurances that they provide. I referred to an example earlier in relation to one from the noble Lord, Lord Alton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07121038000036"></a>The Bill as it stands continues the 1990 Act&#146;s provision that the woman who is carrying or has carried a child as a result of an embryo or sperm and eggs being placed in her&#151;and no other woman&#151;is to be treated as the mother of the child. The Bill does, however, extend the range of persons who can apply for a parental order in cases of surrogacy. I am sure that we will discuss those specific provisions in the later amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07121038000037"></a>Amendment No. 60, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, would modify the requirements for the HFEA specifically to include guidance about taking account of the welfare of children who may be born as a result  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_66"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of treatment. The guidance currently provides that, before providing treatment, the centres&#151;including the clinician&#151;should take all reasonable steps to determine both who will have parental responsibility for any child who may be born, and who will be the person or persons responsible for raising the child.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07121038000038"></a>The guidance goes on to say that the centre should take medical and social histories from each patient, and see each couple together and, where appropriate, separately. Where the information gathered suggests that serious harm may be caused to the child, the centre should investigate the matter further. I agree that it does not require centres to undertake onerous and invasive social assessments of their patients, but it does provide for further consideration of the patient&#146;s circumstances if there are indications of a risk to the child. Amendment No. 60 would add further guidance, saying that the centres should also assess the stability of the upbringing that the child would have, where the prospective parents are not married or in civil partnership. Very careful consideration would need to be given to whether these additional requirements are necessary on top of the guidance already in the code of practice, or constitute a feasible task for clinicians to undertake.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07121038000039"></a>I understand and welcome the clear willingness displayed by noble Lords through these amendments to find solutions to the difficult issues that we are discussing today. I will try to address the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, raised about what type of literature is available to patients. There is wide-ranging literature produced by the HFEA, including guidance for patients, but whether they are adequate is another issue. I strongly believe that it is for regulators and professional bodies to try to address that rather than the Government, but I will be more than happy to look into that.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07121038000040"></a>I have no doubt that those discussions should continue. In the mean time, I invite the noble Lords to withdraw their amendment.</p>

One thing about guidance is that it alters clinical behaviour, and over the years doctors have learned to have difficult conversations with patients&#151;partly, because they have had to. We have clear examples from the Mental Capacity Act, with patients now being given information about their diagnosis and being able to discuss their prognosis or potential complications with treatment. That has meant that those conversations have become much more open. Doctors have not found it easier, but more difficult; they have often needed communication skills training to help them.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07121042000008"></a>I am thinking particularly of the sentiment behind Amendment No. 60. Given that many services are outside the NHS and subject to statutory regulation&#151;but not day-to-day administration&#151;it might help all in the private sector to have some gold standard against which they are expected to operate. It may also help the regulator when it comes to inspect services, as it tries to decide which meet the standard and which do not.</p>

It might be helpful if I read out to the Committee the definition of parental responsibility in the Children Act 1989. That English Act says in Section 3(1):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07121042000104"></a>&#147;In this Act &#145;parental responsibility&#146; means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121042000100"></a>I can find no closer definition in English law. However, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 has this definition in Section 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="07121042000105"></a>&#147;(1) Subject to section 3(1)(b) and (3) of this Act, a parent has in relation to his child the responsibility&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07121042000020"></a>The noble Earl said: My amendment is on meeting professionals to discuss child development. Its effect is to ensure that each couple or individual seeking a child through IVF has a meeting with a paediatrician, a psychologist or another expert on child development to consider the developmental needs of the child. This is a probing amendment related to the issues raised in the previous grouping on what happens in practice, and how to support families by doing all that we can to ensure that children born through this process have the best life chances.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07121042000021"></a>The earliest intervention is normally desirable; that is the basis for much of the Government&#146;s policy toward children and families. My noble friend Lady Warnock told us at Second Reading, as we have heard, that clinicians currently pay little attention to the requirement that consideration of a child&#146;s need for a father is given during the assessment for IVF treatment. While counselling is offered, take-up of that is low and can be in the region of 15 per cent. How might support for these families be strengthened at this early stage? I would be interested in the literature of which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke, to see how helpful that is.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07121042000022"></a>Members of the Committee may have seen the excellent documentary about the impact of postnatal depression on the normal development of an infant which was broadcast last Wednesday on Channel 4. &#147;Help Me Love My Baby&#148; showed a child psychotherapist from the Anna Freud Centre working with a young mother. The mother's depression was unexpected. Six months after the birth, the baby Isabel was unable to meet her mother's gaze or take comfort from her mother when distressed. We later learned various things about the maternal grandmother, who was an alcoholic who abandoned her daughter at the age of 12. Isabel&#146;s mother risked repeating the cycle in which she grew up&#151;the cycle of rejection from one generation to another. The presence of another parent with uncomplicated, normal parental feelings towards Isabel would have been an important protective factor.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07121042000023"></a>A discussion with a paediatrician or psychologist might help parents to build strategies to minimise risks to their infants if, for example, they are a lone parent going into this process. A lone parent might be advised about the value of having a co-parent or surrogate from the very beginning, about the need to contact a health visitor as soon as she felt in danger of being troubled by isolation or about the importance of having a godfather or similar figure from the very beginning. We talk about engaging men in the lives of adolescents and the importance of male mentors, but  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_69"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they are very hard to come by. If one were to begin by making a man a part of the child's growth from the very early stages of development, there would be more chance of success. It would still be difficult, but an interested male would be involved in the later development of that person.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07121042000024"></a>As I said, this is a probing amendment. I would be grateful to learn from the Minister what additional support is offered to families in these exceptional circumstances to help them think about the challenges that their children may face. I beg to move.</p>

But I am comforted that he has joined me in a similar sentiment and I hope to convince the Minister that being provocative was not my intention.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07121042000026"></a>Clause 14(3) extends the requirements under the 1990 Act in relation to the provision of counselling by fertility clinics. Whereas the 1990 Act requires all women receiving IVF treatment along with their male partners to be offered relevant counselling information, the Bill extends that to apply to same-sex couples. In addition, where a couple gives notice that they want the intended mother's partner to be treated as the parent of a child who is conceived by donor sperm, the treatment cannot be given to the intended mother until suitable counselling has been offered to both partners.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07121042000027"></a>We should be in no doubt how important counselling is in this context. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke earlier about the need for prospective parents to internalise the practice and principles that are central to the welfare of children, and I fully agree. It is not unreasonable to propose that prospective parents should be required to receive certain information in that vein, but my concern chiefly centres on three types of case. The first case is where a woman and her male partner apply to receive donated gametes or embryos, the second is where two women make such an application, and the third is where an application is made by a single woman. All three cases have one feature in common&#151;the child who is eventually born will not be the genetic offspring of at least one of the parents.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07121042000028"></a>In recent years, the donation of sperm or ova may have become commonplace&#151;we may take it for granted&#151;but we should never let ourselves forget that to bring a child into the world in circumstances where one or more of his genetic parents is kept deliberately secret and anonymous is to saddle that child with a grave psychological handicap from the moment when later in life he becomes aware of his origins. Parents of children conceived by donation need to be made aware of the vital importance of being absolutely honest with those children about the circumstances of their conception, the way in which the breaking of this news is best done and the most propitious timing for doing so. They need to be aware that, for many children, the trauma and hurt of this knowledge never leaves them. Some children spend the rest of their lives recovering from the blow to their sense of identity and agonising over the injustice of their circumstances compared with those of children who grew up with their true parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07121042000029"></a>If the news is conveyed ineptly or too late, children feel deceived and can end up being alienated from their parents. I have read a number of personal accounts by donor-conceived children who found out late or the wrong way about their true origins, and they make harrowing reading. Parents should not suppose for one second that their troubles are over the moment that the woman successfully conceives. They should be made to realise that the responsibility towards the child's future well-being is in one important sense even greater than it is for ordinary parents. By gratifying their own wish to bring up a child, which I do not mean to imply is an ignoble wish, they are storing up at the very least bewilderment and hurt for that child in future years. Counselling matters.</p>

<a name="71210-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07121042000030"></a>If it is agreed that the imparting of this type of information and knowledge is important, if not essential, the question we need to ask is whether it is enough for the law to say merely that women or couples should be offered counselling. In my opinion, they should be made to receive at least a bare minimum of counselling as part of the deal that they have with the clinic, as a matter of course. I suspect that the Minister will tell me that it is not possible to force people to receive counselling, but I disagree. I hope very much that she will undertake to think about the proposal that I have made.</p>

However, how would he ensure that counselling was delivered in the 90 per cent or so of cycles that are handled through private clinics? Would it be rather like cosmetic surgeries where a doctor's receptionist does a 10-minute chat and says, &#147;You can have a tummy tuck but not a facelift&#148;, or vice versa? How would he ensure that it was delivered?

Whether this is in the private or public sector is not the issue; the issue is whether we should seek to provide proper counselling arrangements. There may be problems but they are not insurmountable, as the noble Baroness implied. There are many examples in the law of where we do it elsewhere across the public and private sectors. As the noble Lord just said, this provision would help rather than hinder doctors.</p>

I should point out that &#147;counselling&#148; is a very broad word. It does not necessarily mean that you have to have a prolonged encounter, but it is about helping people to recognise their own thinking and to move on. I also think that the measure may help healthcare professionals who are struggling to make an assessment, because those people who are motivated to do the best for the child will want to know how to inform him or her about these very difficult and sensitive issues. Oddly enough, if the prospective parent does not want to know about it, they tend to screen themselves out because they are declaring that they do not want to learn about what might be in the best interests of the child. There is no obligation for them to follow whatever constructive advice they are given, but simply being prepared to listen to it can be an important way of assessing whether they are prepared to look at the issues ahead of them.</p>

I wish to make a couple of important points. First, perhaps the most valuable experience that any potential parent can have is to speak to actual parents. While I understand and support what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is trying to do, his amendment is slightly overprescriptive. There is nothing like learning from people who have been through exactly the same experiences; that is, the experiences of other parents who have had donor-conceived children, and those of donor-conceived adults.</p>

<ul><a name="07121042000110"></a>&#147;such other person as may be prescribed in regulations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121042000102"></a>That might include an accredited parent group.</p>

<p><a name="st_178"></a>

I seize this opportunity to flag up organisations such as UK DonorLink and the Donor Conception Network. The conversations that I have had with them reveal that they are extremely anxious that their work should be supported. On later amendments we may disagree about such issues as when and how children have the right to be told about their origins, but supporting such voluntary agencies is an important factor. This measure may provide a way to do it.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07121042000042"></a>Secondly, private clinics have come in for some castigation. Usually I am generally in favour of that but in this case it is not fair because some of the best practice around these sorts of issues is found in private clinics. We ought to raise standards across the piece, whether it be in the NHS or in private clinics.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07121042000043"></a>There is a very important factor behind all this, which goes back to the definition of a parent. If this measure applied across the board to all applicants equally, it would be a measure for good. If it does not, and if we have tight definitions of who parents are, that same process becomes a means of screening out people who could be good parents. Therefore, although I am extraordinarily sympathetic to what both noble Earls are trying to do, this is a matter to which I should like to return once we have established some fundamental issues, such as who are allowed to be potential parents under the Bill.</p>

This provision is currently under the 1990 Act, but the Bill now includes reference to two women being treated together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07121042000046"></a>On Amendments Nos. 58 and 59, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the Government recognise that it is highly desirable for any person undergoing fertility treatment to receive counselling, to give them an opportunity to consider all the implications and consequences of receiving such treatment. Indeed, counselling matters. It is important that when two people are signing up to a parenthood agreement they are both fully aware of what this means at all stages of the process. Both parties should have an opportunity to consider the implications of this serious, lifelong commitment.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07121042000047"></a>However, people should be willing to receive counselling for it to be effective. I fear that if counselling were mandatory, resources would be devoted to it, but for some patients it would have no effect because they would not wish to engage with it. Indeed, if it were to be mandatory, it might well produce the opposite effect to that intended, and people might resist it. There are many related problems. For example, what would you do if a woman refused counselling? Would you turn her away?</p>

I did, indeed, take on board the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. If somebody refused counselling, she might rule herself out. However, we need to devote attention to that consideration.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07121042000050"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of the need for parents to be open about the true conception of the children and for information to be provided in a sensitive way. Clearly that must be dealt with in counselling, although there are organisations such as the Donor Conception Network which work with potential parents of donor-conceived children to help and encourage them to tell their children about their origins, and to tell them the best means of going about this. Things are being done. However, the arguments that have been made this evening about the need for counselling have been extremely persuasive, so I am happy to take this back. I give no guarantee that we can make changes but I am certainly happy to look at it because I think it is an extremely important issue. I take on board the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about the need for all parents, irrespective of their sex, to receive counselling. We should also look at that carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07121042000051"></a>Amendment No. 57ZA would require patients to receive information and advice on child development, and to have participated in a discussion with a specialist social worker, paediatrician, psychologist or other person before receiving treatment. The amendment would introduce an additional stage for fertility patients. It would seem unfair to require people who, through no fault of their own, need medical assistance to get  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pregnant to undertake these additional steps and not those who happen to get pregnant unassisted. It is highly unlikely to be welcomed by parents. That is not to say that it would necessarily be a bad thing. There is no evidence to suggest that people who are unable to conceive naturally are more in need of information about raising children or child development than any other parents, or indeed that they would benefit from discussions with a psychologist.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07121042000052"></a>The existing requirements of providing information and offering counselling already provide an opportunity for people to discuss issues that are relevant to them. This amendment imposes a significant extra requirement which we do not consider necessary. If there were genuine concerns about the well-being of any child born through IVF, particularly that the child is likely to come into harm, the HFEA guidance on the welfare of the child says that treatment should be refused. People undergoing assisted conception treatment are fully committed to wanting children. They have often been trying to conceive for many years and any resulting child will be treasured and loved. We do not think that people who undertake treatment require more information or advice on parenting than those people who conceive naturally. The Bill already takes into account the welfare of the child to be born through treatment, and requires that people seeking treatment be given the opportunity to receive counselling. Possibly we will make that stronger, though not mandatory.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07121042000053"></a>Earlier this evening we had a discussion about the literature available to prospective parents. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, pointed out, this literature is provided by the HFEA. I am sure that the Government will be very willing to enter into discussions with the HFEA to see whether the information provided is entirely adequate, and if not, how it could be improved.</p>

<a name="71210-0011.htm_para10"></a>

I genuinely feel that, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, suggested, they could be of real help to doctors. In the light of the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, I am willing to listen to arguments about the practicability of insisting on a measure of mandatory counselling. I am also very willing to look at ways of refining what we mean by counselling in this context. But it is extremely helpful of her to say that she is willing to take my amendments away. I look forward to further discussions with her. Let me just say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that I would not wish to discriminate between different sorts of parents, other than in the obvious respect that a child born from IVF involving the gametes of both his parents is in a different position from a donor-conceived child. The advice given to each category of parent therefore has to reflect that fact.</p>

In some ways we are caught between two extremes because, as the Minister said in reply, if one casts this too universally it seems to discriminate against all women who have IVF and if one seeks to select within that and be more focused, one seems to be discriminating against particular groups.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07121042000075"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, whenever I have been asked during my political career abroad, including my decade as the Wirral&#146;s MEP, &#147;Where do you come from?&#148;, I have replied, &#147;Chester, a Roman town near Liverpool.&#148; Only then, with the mention of Liverpool, do eyes light up with a sense of awe and wonder. For Liverpool is indeed a world city, conjuring up images of the Beatles and modern pop music as well as its fame as a city of football. But Liverpool&#146;s renown is built on more than the two modern cultural icons of football and music. Its history stretches back centuries, but only in the relatively recent past did Liverpool rise to prominence. The River Dee silted up, preventing slave ships from landing at my home town of Chester, and as Chester declined as a port so Liverpool rose, cornering the slave trade. That is a sorry story but one that is told so well in the International Slavery Museum, which opened this year in advance of Liverpool 08. We all hope that Liverpool 08 will be its annus mirabilis as it proudly takes stewardship of its year as European Capital of Culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07121042000076"></a>It would be easy to say that Liverpool&#146;s claim to cultural significance like the emblematic liver birds, comes in twos: two wonderful art galleries in the Walker and Tate Liverpool; two splendid theatres in the Everyman and the Playhouse; two outstanding universities in Liverpool and JMU; two magnificent tunnels in the Wallasey and Birkenhead; two architectural masterpieces in the Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, and two wonderful football teams. Not Liverpool and Liverpool reserves; but Everton and Liverpool, the European Cup champions. How about a debate highlighting Liverpool&#146;s European connections? Liverpool plays Marseille tomorrow night, another port town with which it shares a distinctive trading culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07121042000077"></a>Liverpool&#146;s heritage is deeper than such adventitious pairings of cultural icons. The Mersey poets number well beyond the trio of Henri, Patten and McGough. The buildings of Liverpool in their range, innovation and grandeur put Liverpool first among all other towns outside London in boasting an unsurpassed architectural heritage. I congratulate all those in Liverpool who have worked so hard not only to secure its designation as Capital of Culture but to bring the programme to the boil just weeks before the start.</p>

Those of us who celebrated Glasgow&#146;s outstanding rebirth in 1990, as it rejoiced in the title of European Capital of Culture, are determined that Liverpool should succeed. We have an unexampled opportunity for Britain to get behind Liverpool 08 and show Britain at its best, especially in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics when the eyes of the world, not just Europe, will be upon us.</p>

That is surely appropriate in a city which nurtured the unsung Liverpool architect Peter Ellis, who first showed in the 19th century how modern materials could be used to maximise light in new buildings. There will be classical concerts featuring Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting the superb European Union Youth Orchestra and, fittingly, the Cologne cathedral choir singing Benjamin Britten&#146;s war requiem. Sir Paul McCartney will preside over a pop concert, and Liverpudlian Sir Simon Rattle will conduct the Berlin and Liverpool Philharmonics. Sounds like thirsty work?

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07121042000081"></a>Liverpool 08 is not just about buildings. It is also about building and rebuilding communities. Some &#163;3 billion of investment will produce an estimated 14,000 new jobs. St George&#146;s Hall restored to its former glory and the opening of a state-of-the-art conference centre and concert seating 9,000 people will enhance the already dynamic riverfront. Liverpool&#146;s tourism infrastructure will be strengthened by the development of the Liverpool One shopping centre, helping to propel Liverpool from sixteenth to sixth most visited British city. Some 20 million visitors are expected during the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07121042000082"></a>The involvement of young people will be secured by the imaginative flagship initiative Portrait of a Nation funded by the Urban Cultural network and the Heritage Lottery Fund and co-ordinated by the Liverpool Culture Company, whose leadership in the programme has been pivotal. That will attract young people from across Britain and beyond. I am particularly thrilled that a session of the European Youth Parliament will see 300 young citizens from Europe gather in St George&#146;s Hall to share common concerns. Younger citizens will be catered for in the Little Acorns programme. Others will be encouraged to work with established artists to tackle problems for young people such as looking after health, promoting enterprise and dealing with the unwanted and unwarranted perception of Liverpool as a city of crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07121042000083"></a>Liverpool is now up and ready for the challenge of being Capital of Culture 08. This is a rare opportunity for a British city to host the event and, like Glasgow, Liverpool will harness culture to transform national, European and international perceptions of Liverpool. 2008 heralds the start of the cultural Olympiad that leads to London 2012. In delivering the Capital of Culture, Europe&#146;s eyes will be upon us to succeed not just for Britain but for Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07121042000084"></a>It is a big financial commitment of some &#163;100 million, with welcome contributions from the European Commission and from the Government directly and indirectly. I am impressed with the DCMS and the Arts Council England&#146;s detailed help for Liverpool as listed in its five objectives. Local and regional businesses have been generous, as have the Government, particularly since the arrival of James Purnell as Secretary of State. Nevertheless, the local council, the central funder, still needs support from the Government to ensure that the funding gap is closed to bring a fitting conclusion in a year&#146;s time. I ask my noble friend not to stint on helping to close that funding gap.</p>

<a name="71210-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07121042000085"></a>I also suggest to my noble friend that while DCMS has played an active supporting role, other Whitehall departments should put their shoulders to the wheel to fulfil broader themes of regeneration, health, education, neighbourhoods, crime, diversity and youth policy. Could DCMS also co-ordinate a programme of ministerial visits to Liverpool throughout the year to cement the active interest of the whole of Whitehall?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07121042000086"></a>I am not aware that the European Commission has yet accepted Scouse as a working language of the European Community. I do know that Liverpool hymns an Esperanto of cultural diversity in the football chants on its terraces, in the chants and prayers in its churches, in the frozen music of its architecture, in the drama of its theatres inside and outside on the streets, in the beat of the Mersey sound and in the songs of the men who ferry visitors across the Mersey. For too long, the artistic and cultural variety of Liverpool&#151;the city and its people&#151;has been Britain&#146;s best kept secret. Now is the time for us to celebrate its fascinating past, its pulsating present and, of course, its beckoning bright future.</p>

I have been living in London for well over 50 years but I am proud to be a Liverpudlian. I was born in Liverpool, like my father, grandfather, great-grandfather and beyond. I went to school in Liverpool and when I came to this place I chose my title in recognition of Quarry Bank High school, a local authority grammar school in Liverpool from which I greatly benefited. John Lennon was a much later pupil, hence the skiffle group, the Quarrymen, which was soon transformed into the Beatles. Another pupil at the school was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith.</p>

I also remember the impact on Liverpool of the 1941 May blitz, which took 1,900 lives in a single week. But as the war came to an end, I was able to visit the Walker Art Gallery, which had an important collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings. We still have the Walker and the collection, but we also have Tate Liverpool with the 2008 Turner Prize and, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, mentioned, a major retrospective of Gustav Klimt.</p>

It is a great neo-classical building of which I have a fine 1854 lithograph that hangs on the wall at my home. Another former pupil of Quarry Bank is Stephen Bayley, the design critic of the <I>Observer</I>, who finds Liverpool &#147;utterly fascinating&#148;. I share his view that not all the recent building developments are wonderful but there are now top-quality architects working in the city centre. In any case, Liverpool is already rich in long-standing eclectic buildings, including a vast number of places of worship, reflecting the 19th century life of a cosmopolitan city.</p>

The motto of the city of Liverpool is &#147;Deus nobis haec otia fecit&#148;, which means that God has given us this leisure. It is an extract from a poem by Virgil&#151;a conversation between Tityrus and Meliboeus. I am sure that noble Lords will be interested in this. The former is bragging about his good fortune, explaining that God has given him all this wealth. Miliboeus, presumably wanting something for himself, asks, &#147;But tell me about that God of yours, my friend&#148;. Tityrus replies that the God who has given him so much is none other than a city men call Rome. It shows that the city fathers who chose this motto saw Liverpool as the latter-day Rome, not as second to London but as the centre of a new trading empire. Liverpool is making the journey from a 19th century capital of trade to a 21st century city in which there is huge investment from both the public and private sectors working together in unison with the leadership of the city council, the Liverpool Culture Company and the Regional Development Agency.</p>

Many cities today are threatened with the disease of urban diabetes where the blood pumps around only the heart of the city and its prestigious projects. The secret of good urban regeneration is to open the valves and ensure that the blood and the wealth pumps around the whole body. Otherwise the extremities&#151;the outer estates&#151;atrophy and die, and the limbs drop off.</p>

<a name="71210-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07121042000097"></a>One of the reasons that Liverpool won the city of culture was because it could demonstrate just how the whole city would be involved in the project, and benefit from it. My own cathedral&#151;forgive me for boasting&#151;is the largest Anglican cathedral in the world, with now the largest organ in the country. It will be hosting a number of events: a lecture by my noble friend the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of January on &#147;Europe, Culture and Faith&#148;; a performance of the &#147;War Requiem&#148; to be staged in both Liverpool and Cologne, our twin city; and the northern premiere of Sir Paul McCartney&#146;s, &#147;Ecce Cor Meum&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121042000103"></a>This is the priority of private and public enterprise&#151;that we should build a city of prosperity and pride where people can walk the streets and parks in safety and in peace. We are not complacent. We have known sorrow in the tragic killings of Anthony Walker and Rhys Jones. But we also know the comfort of solidarity and the dignity of forbearance, not least in the extraordinary examples of grace to be found in Anthony&#146;s mother, Gee Walker, and Rhys&#146;s family, Melanie, Stephen and Owen.

He ranged far and wide over the ability of Liverpool. Its magnificent buildings are already there; the cultures already exist. I believe&#151;and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool expressed it very well&#151;that people&#146;s perception of Liverpool will be different following the year of culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07121046000003"></a>Immense benefits to Liverpool follow&#151;not just to Liverpool, but to the region. That is why the Northwest Regional Development Agency has put millions into this venture, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool acknowledged. The agency supported it from the first, because it saw that it was not only about Liverpool&#151;about speaking of the virtues of a city that deserves to be spoken about in that light&#151;but also about the rest of the region. What we will see is not just the major cultural events, many of which have been described, but also street theatre and events in the community. Thousands of Liverpudlians will be directly engaged in the festival, a wonderful event that will not only change people&#146;s ideas about Liverpool and its people, but make Liverpool a European capital city of culture in the future as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07121046000004"></a>I am so pleased to be able to talk about this tonight. It is not just what we are doing now; it is not only that there has been something like &#163;3 billion in investment. There will be the creation of 14,000 jobs, so there are lasting benefits. The lasting benefit of what is happening to Liverpool is that it will be not only the Capital of Culture but a Mecca for tourism in the future. That will go on year after year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07121046000005"></a>We are also seeing that, quite rightly, Liverpool will be the centre of what is occurring in 2008. In addition&#151;and my noble friend Lord Harrison is quite right about this&#151;others in the north-west are joining in. He was right to talk about it being the Cheshire Year of Gardens 08. Nobody knows better than the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about Lancastrian cuisine; it will be the Year of Food and Drink in Lancashire. In Manchester it will be Manchester World Sport 08. In Cumbria it will be the Year of Adventure. While Liverpool will benefit directly, so will the rest of the region.</p>

At one time, Liverpool was regarded at the capital of north and mid-Wales. For many of us, it still is.</p>

<a name="71210-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07121046000008"></a>So many of the builders of Liverpool were Welsh. They came and put Welsh names on the streets. They even took over the shops: Owen Owen&#146;s, TJ Hughes&#146;s and Lewis&#146;s. The largest Welsh-speaking congregations in churches, particularly non-conformist churches, were not in Wales but in Liverpool. There were great cultural events such as the eisteddfodau; the Lewis&#146;s Eisteddfod was a notable event for many years. I could take a long time speaking about this, but I must not, except to say that the links between Wales and Liverpool are historic and valuable and must be protected and expanded.</p>

Now, I admire Cardiff and Swansea, but a journey for a patient from north Wales to either takes something like five hours. From north Wales to Liverpool is just over an hour. A big contention now is whether neurological surgery and treatment should be continued at the Walton Centre in Liverpool. Then there is a problem for children at Alder Hay, Broadgreen and other hospitals losing their Welsh links. How important it is that we preserve these links and that north and mid-Wales keep these health and education links with their capital of Liverpool.</p>

<a name="71210-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07121046000010"></a>There is a new era of opportunity in the building of this link. Mike Storey was an outstanding leader of Liverpool City Council. Just before he retired he organised an apology from the city of Liverpool to the people of Wales for the drowning of the Tryweryn Valley to provide the reservoir. That drowning was a thoughtless gesture; all the MPs for Wales were against it, but it went through. Now, Mike managed to get a unanimous vote from Liverpool City Council, which began to build a bridge. I am only sorry that one effort of mine failed, which was to get the National Eisteddfod of Wales to be held in Liverpool preceding the European year of culture there.</p>

<a name="71210-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07121046000011"></a>There is an opportunity to keep and appreciate these traditional links. So many Welsh people have contributed a great deal to Liverpool, and Liverpool has contributed so much to the people of north Wales. I hope that the year of Liverpool being the Capital of Culture in Europe will also be a year when these links are reinforced, and there will be a great new happiness in our relationship.</p>

In just 22 days, Liverpool will join an impressive clutch of cities that have previously secured this accolade, including capital cities such as Athens, Paris, Berlin and Stockholm. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool said, there were few in the city who did not join the impressive coalition forged to bring the bid forward. That number included some 20,000 schoolchildren.</p>

I also pay tribute to the then leader of the city council, Mike Storey, to whom the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, referred, and the then chief executive, David Henshaw. When they were singing from the same hymn sheet, they were formidable indeed. Their starting point in placing that bid forward was economic and social disadvantage. You do not receive European Objective 1 status, as Merseyside did in the mid-1990s, unless your economy is performing 75 per cent below the average European Union economic activity per head. Since then, more than &#163;2.4 billion has flowed into Merseyside&#151; &#163;463 million from the private sector, with a further &#163;350 million to come via Objective 2 funding.</p>

It has invested over &#163;93 million and has brought in more than &#163;192 million in private sector funds as investment. In addition, the Capital of Culture is expected to create a lasting legacy of some 14,000 jobs. The right reverend Prelate talked about the city&#146;s motto being, &#147;God has given unto us this leisure&#148;. Happily, He is also now giving us jobs and work, which were part of the problem that the city faced in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

It is good to see the noble Lord, Lord Owen, who is chancellor of Liverpool University, in his place this evening. Part of John Moores University&#146;s contribution to Capital of Culture is its prestigious Roscoe lectures, which attract thousands of people. Lecturers have included the Dalai Lama, the President of Ireland, the Chief Rabbi and many other celebrated figures. This year they have included His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the President of Ghana, and next year&#146;s lectures include one by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07121046000016"></a>The greatest lesson that Liverpool should learn from its success in becoming the Capital of Culture is that when it unites, it is invincible. The entire city now needs to show the same intense, united sense of purpose and utter commitment in ensuring that this opportunity bears many long-term fruits. Liverpool&#146;s cultural achievements speak for themselves. Its theatres, museums, galleries, orchestral achievements and literary heritage make it the best cultural centre outside London. A new Museum of Liverpool is under construction; a renovated and expanded World Museum is attracting record numbers of visitors; the new International Slavery Museum is already open; and the spectacular 9,000-seater waterfront stadium, the Liverpool Echo Arena, will open early next year. Europe&#146;s biggest retail development is under way; the cruise liner berth will become a full terminal; and the 2007 Turner Prize has arrived at the Tate of the north&#151;the first time this prestigious event has been held outside London. There will be a rollercoaster of public lectures, public art, street theatre, exhibitions, community festivals and exhibitions. A winter arts festival begins in January. The largest programme of public and community art ever undertaken in the UK is under way and 400,000 Merseysiders will have been involved by the end of 2008. As the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, and others have said, that will play out right across the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07121046000017"></a>Just achieving Capital of Culture status does not, of course, guarantee renaissance. It did not in Patras and it was only of limited value in Cork, but Glasgow&#151;Capital of Culture in 1990&#151;genuinely became miles better. That will happen in Liverpool, too, if the city unites to make it happen. The objective must be a legacy of long-term growth and sustainability.</p>

I declare an interest in that my mother&#146;s family is the Moores family; I refer especially to my late grandfather, Sir John Moores, who was instrumental in developing cultural life on Merseyside over many years. He initiated the John Moores exhibition to encourage young artists and to promote art outside London. That exhibition alternated each year with the Peter Moores exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery; remarkably, 2008 is the 25th John Moores exhibition, celebrating 50 years of encouragement to aspiring artists. The Moores family were also instrumental in bringing the Tate to Liverpool and in helping the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Today, James Moores and his sister Portia have raised the bar in artistic activities on Merseyside, reinvigorating the John Moores exhibition and initiating the biennial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07121046000019"></a>I also pay tribute to other leaders who have tirelessly promoted Liverpool: Loyd Grossman, chairman of Culture Northwest and of National Museums Liverpool, who spearheaded, with Dr David Fleming, a &#163;68 million development programme for the museum; Bryan Gray, chairman of the Northwest Regional Development Agency; Warren Bradley, leader of the council; Phil Redmond, the entrepreneur; and many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07121046000020"></a>Liverpool 08 will use culture to transform national and international perceptions of Merseyside. It is the first opportunity since 1990 for a British city to host the European Capital of Culture. It will happen; it will be fantastic; it will be delivered on time and on budget. Liverpool will be a credit to the nation and to Europe and Liverpool 08 will be a catalyst for the city&#146;s regeneration, both in buildings and in institutions. National Museums Liverpool, which includes the Walker Art Gallery, the Merseyside Maritime Museum, the Lady Lever Art Gallery, the National Conservation Centre, the new International Slavery Museum, among others, and the Liverpool and Merseyside record offices and St George&#146;s Hall have all benefited from over &#163;100 million of spending. Liverpool&#146;s tourism infrastructure will also be enhanced with developments such as the Liverpool One shopping centre. Liverpool has already gone from being 16th to the fifth most visited city since winning the bid. Visitor numbers at the National Museums have already risen from 700,000 in 2001 to almost 1.7 million this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07121046000022"></a>Liverpool is also the centre of the pools industry, whose influence on British culture has helped to make football our national game. Merseyside celebrates two of the greatest football clubs, Everton and Liverpool; it is regrettable that Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, respectively from Liverpool and Everton, were missing extensively throughout England&#146;s failed campaign for Euro 2008. Nevertheless, 2008 celebrates 80 years since Everton&#146;s Dixie Dean&#146;s unsurpassed record of scoring 60 goals in a season, which will be remembered through biographical plays and events. Everton Football Club will celebrate 130 years of success and the Football League will be 120 years old.</p>

I am sure that the Minister will join us tonight in recognising and promoting Liverpool 08 as an event of national significance.

DCMS must also encourage other departments to support Liverpool 08, as the programme touches on many broader themes, such as regeneration, health, education, neighbourhoods, crime, diversity and youth policy. I encourage DCMS, with the Government Office for the North West, to co-ordinate a programme of ministerial visits to Liverpool throughout the year. It will be an experience to savour.</p>

I am also grateful to the vice-chancellor of the university, Drummond Bone, for the work that he has done on the Cultural Company, and to all those people who put a tremendous amount of effort into making the year the success that I am sure it will be. The University of Liverpool&#146;s Victoria Building is going to be renewed and replenished during the year and will be open in part to the public&#151;that building gave the name to &#147;red-brick universities&#148;, which has gone right around the country. Liverpool is a great city and has wonderful things for people to come to see, but I hope that people will go a little bit further and on to Crosby beach to see the Gormley statues in the sea&#151;that is one of the most remarkable sculptural exhibitions that I have ever seen.

It is worth pointing out that the London Olympics will be hugely commercial, will have vast sums spent on it, will have professionally trained sports men and women and will, at the end of the day, be able to offer huge rewards to those who are successful. Liverpool, by contrast, has the story of a

Briefly, looking at the extraordinary renaissance of Liverpool since the early 1980s, the church&#151;at that time led by Bishop Sheppard of the Anglican community and Archbishop Worlock of the Catholic community&#151;played a huge part, setting at rest what previously had been the fierce racial riots in the city, when we reached the very bottom. Since that time, there has been a tremendous outpouring of community inspiration and spirit in Liverpool, the reviving of singing and poetry reading in the pubs, and recognising the tremendous contribution of the universities. In that context, I would particularly congratulate the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Owen, on the fantastic work that the universities have done, making themselves available to the whole city. Those are not the universities of a small elite, those are universities that belong to and feed into the community.</p>

Of course, there is the famous dynasty that the grandfather of the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, represented; that of the Moores, who made huge contributions to the city. This is a wonderful example of a citizens&#146; City of Culture, a citizens&#146; contribution to the renaissance of a great part of this country. I hope strongly that it will be a great success&#151;I am sure that it will be&#151;and that this little debate will have sent it off into the finest waters.</p>

One wondered whether one could take the whole thing further, because the joy of working in Liverpool is that it is multicultural and it has everything going for it. In the wonderful Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts&#151;LIPA&#151;you get a sense of everyone wanting to come together. They are very well funded there, but the city, too, wants to go another notch further. This is a city that will explode if it is given a little bit more encouragement. The architecture is thrilling&#151;those of us who love churches know what is there&#151;but the extraordinary nature of what is going on there has something of a lid on it.

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07121046000032"></a>My parents were born in Oceanic Road, Old Swan, at the turn of the previous century, and I was brought up on stories of Liverpool before the First World War. Liverpool was the first big city that I went to from Blackpool. When I was Member of Parliament for Stockport in the very early 1980s, I went across to a conference about Liverpool sponsored by Granada. It was one of the most depressing conferences that I had ever been to. The bleakness outside of depression and recession and the feeling that the city was going nowhere was very depressing indeed.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07121046000033"></a>That is why the City of Culture and the run-up to it has been so very encouraging in the way that all parts and all sides have come together. Here, in the All-Party 08 Group, Members of both Houses of Parliament, including Michael Howard from the Conservative Party, the noble Lord, Lord Owen, and all the Merseyside MPs, are working hard to give back-up.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07121046000034"></a>It is no secret that when Liverpool won the City of Culture nomination, there were those, certainly in the national press, who sat back and waited to light the blue touch paper, thinking that somehow Liverpool would snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. Liverpool has proved them wrong. It has overcome that. Those in our national press who make a sport of telling the worst of Liverpool should look at what has been achieved in recent years. As many speakers tonight have said, a genuine renaissance is going on in the city.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07121046000035"></a>I remember doing some work there in the late 1980s. In some ways, the press image was justified, because you came out of Lime Street station and on your right was be a hotel that had been derelict since the end of the war and opposite was the shuttered and darkened St George's Hall. Last year, I had the pleasure of going to hear the Prince of Wales give his Roscoe lecture, which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, mentioned, in the magnificent surroundings of the restored St George's Hall. The amazing waterfront has been restored and much else in the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07121046000036"></a>What stuck in my mind about Liverpool winning the City of Culture was that someone from the panel that chose it said to me that one of the most heart-warming things about the presentation was when the selection panel went into an empty room and it then filled with young people from all parts of Liverpool and of every nationality, bringing home the message of a world in one city. The interesting thing about the City of Culture is that Liverpool has promoted not just high culture&#151;important, because it has a world representation&#151;but community culture. The breadth of the project is bringing home all of Liverpool's strengths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07121046000041"></a>Being named as the capital of culture will put Liverpool on the heritage map and alert people to the city&#146;s status as a world heritage city. Liverpool has more museums and art galleries than any other British city aside from London&#151;something which is not as well known as it should be. This will help to widen the knowledge of Liverpool.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07121046000042"></a>There are expected to be considerable financial benefits. As capital of culture, Liverpool is expected to bring in &#163;2 billion of investment to the cultural sector and create 14,000 new jobs&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, pointed out. It is expected that nearly 2 million extra visitors will come to Liverpool for the festivals and events in 2008.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07121046000043"></a>The positive effects have already started. Liverpool&#146;s housing market has soared. Figures from Hometrack show that demand for property in the city rose after the announcement. There was a 10 per cent increase in June alone&#151;a pattern quite different from some other northern cities. The 2008 celebrations should generate extra spending of &#163;50 million.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07121046000044"></a>Without wanting to upset the many Lords that have spoken this evening, I must say that Liverpool&#146;s celebrations will be expensive. Recently Liverpool councillors were so concerned about the increasing cost that they appealed to the Department for Communities and Local Government to avert what one Labour councillor called a serious financial situation. The appeal failed. If Liverpool is unable to pay for the substantial cost of its award, will the Minister tell us whether the Government will pick up the bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0712112000002"></a>I recall when the bid was going forward for Liverpool as the city of culture. Nearly all noble Lords who have spoken this evening spoke on that occasion with great effect. It is sometimes suggested that this House is not listened to outside as much as it might be, but on that occasion we were able to demonstrate a unity of purpose. As the noble Lord, Lord McNally, indicated, we also associated with the other place in that endeavour. I was pleased to reply to a debate in which the enormous enthusiasm of noble Lords for the Liverpool venture&#151;a very large number of whom come from the city&#151;was quite clear.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0712112000003"></a>We are almost at the point of reaching fulfilment but challenges lie ahead. We all recognise that. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, is right to enter a note of caution. This Capital of Culture costs money and, in certain aspects, the city is facing some difficulties. I want to emphasise the significant contribution that the Government have made thus far in support of the city. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, along with other noble Lords, mentioned the refurbishment of St George&#146;s Hall, to which the Heritage Lottery Fund made a substantial contribution. In other areas, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been concerned to give as much support as possible for what promises to be an outstanding year.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0712112000004"></a>There is no doubt already that the city can balance various elements, as the right reverend Prelate indicated that it should. It not only has high culture such as the very impressive classical music events that are being developed and the Gustav Klimt exhibition at Tate Liverpool, but it is bringing forth the energies of people. The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, emphasised the role of young people. One of Liverpool&#146;s great strengths is undoubtedly the extent to which its people can come together when there is a project on which they unite. This is a great opportunity.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0712112000005"></a>I do not have to survey the events that have already been put in place because my noble friend Lord Harrison, who has given us this significant opportunity to discuss the subject and who introduced the debate so superbly, has already covered them. I am concerned, however, that we make this year a creative experience with a lasting legacy. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Howard, we recognise that this investment in the city must have a longer-term legacy. It is very important that we recognise the potential economic benefits to Liverpool, which are already showing, as noble Lords have said, in the increased role of tourism in the city and the number of visits in recent years. Tourism plays an important part in a local economy, and there is no doubt that the richness of Liverpool&#146;s cultural heritage at this time and the refurbishment that has been

I mention the obvious fact that Liverpool is preparing for these tourists. A thousand new hotel rooms will open in 2008, bearing on the 73 per cent increase between 1997 and 2006. No doubt the city is working hard to ensure that a consistently high level of service will be on offer throughout the city.</p>

<a name="71210-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0712112000006"></a>I recognise what everyone who has spoken in the debate this evening has emphasised; this is not only about the economic legacy but about the experience of the year, as well as about people&#146;s ability to come together. We should put a little more emphasis than we have this evening on the work that has been done to bring volunteers together to ensure that tourists enjoy the experience of the city. That is a great way of engaging young people. The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, indicated other areas in which they are responding. The very strength of Liverpool in many ways is the inherent enthusiasm that people once generated. It is also true that they can put their case rather more pessimistically on occasions. We have a great opportunity for them to reap the rewards of enthusiasm. Noble Lords who have contributed to the debate have been enormously optimistic and enthusiastic about the opportunities that are provided. And so we should be. There is no doubt that there will be a great cultural legacy from this year. The accountants will scratch their heads about how the bills will be paid. I cannot tell the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that the Government will pick up the bill. The Government have a clear definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0712113000005"></a>Some argue forcefully that families with donor-conceived children should be free to manage for themselves the whole business of whether and how to tell a child of his genetic origins, and that the state should not take action to, effectively, force the hand of such parents to convey this information to children. Many feel that it is for the parents to judge if and when it is in the interests of a child to be told at all. I completely see the force of this argument. As a rule, I am very much against the idea of the state stepping in and interfering in family life more than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0712113000006"></a>However, I believe very firmly that birth certificates should carry this information, and I will explain why. My starting point is that I believe it to be in the best interests of every donor-conceived child to be told of their donor conception, preferably at an early age. The weight of evidence presented to the Joint Committee demonstrated that clearly. The fundamental issue underlying it concerns human rights. One of the main reasons why, some three years ago, we decided to lift donor anonymity in this country was the recognition, at European level, that every child has the right to know or to find out who his or her parents are. The rights of donor-conceived children were, for many years, being breached by their having no opportunity,  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_92"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when adult, to discover their natural parentage. Although we have seen a marked drop in the number of sperm donors since those regulations came into force, we cannot credibly argue that the regulations were wrong in principle.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0712113000007"></a>The regulations and this Bill give children a right to inquire, and the right to be told certain information in response to such an inquiry. Nowhere is it laid down that parents should have a legal duty to tell the child in the first place that they are donor conceived. It is therefore possible&#151;and, I am sorry to say, all too common&#151;for donor-conceived children never to be given that information. If they somehow find out by accident, the emotional impact of such a discovery can be devastating. I read a number of personal accounts written by individuals who found out, sometimes quite late in life, that they were donor conceived, and whose anger and resentment at having been kept in ignorance are of life-changing magnitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0712113000008"></a>One woman said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="0712113000052"></a>&#147;I was angry. I had been cheated, and discriminated against, and lumbered with a fake identity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712113000042"></a>She went on to describe the almost frantic process of searching for her true father, and her burning need to find out who and what sort of a man he was. But what comes out from people&#146;s testimonials even more forcefully than their anger is a feeling of injustice at the withholding of a basic truth. For the birth certificate of a donor-conceived person to omit any mention of the donor conception is equivalent to the state being complicit in a lie. For me, that simply is not on.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0712113000009"></a>The truth may be difficult to confront and may cause pain, but we should not withhold it. A person&#146;s sense of identity is bound up in very large measure with their personal history and a knowledge of where they came from. A birth certificate that omits any mention of donor conception falsifies that history in a profound way. If it is true, as I understand it is, that many donor-conceived children are kept in ignorance of their true origins, something needs to be done. I do not believe that it would be acceptable or right to place a legal duty on parents to tell children about the circumstances of their birth. However, we can give parents the strongest possible motivation for finding an appropriate way of letting a child know before he finds out for himself. We should also see to it that in situations where the parents die before they have an opportunity to tell the child, there is a back-up mechanism that is reasonably failsafe.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0712113000010"></a>Although I believe that we need to confront the issues of principle, there is a practical issue which equally cannot be dodged. It may be argued that where a donor-conceived person is aware of his or her birth status, he or she may not wish to declare that fact to the outside world and, for that reason, may be embarrassed at having to reveal through their birth certificate the fact that they are donor conceived; for example, when opening a bank account or having to prove their identity in other contexts. The answer to that should not be beyond the wit of man to provide. </p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0712113000011"></a>One answer may be suggested by the fact that when a child is born the parents are given not one but two birth certificates. One certificate could be in a shortened  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_93"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>form, and the other could contain much fuller details. One idea is that the fuller form of the birth certificate of a donor-conceived child should contain a note indicating the fact of the donor conception. The shortened form would not. We will hear a refinement of that idea from the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, when she speaks to the other amendment in this group. In that way, it would be open to the individual to supply the shortened form of certificate if ever he wished to keep that aspect of his identity private.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0712113000012"></a>In the amendment, I propose that the precise details of how this should work should be left to regulations. It seems important that the detail is right and that the Government should consult with interested parties before finalising them. I very much hope that the Minister will agree to take this issue away with her and consider it constructively. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0712113000013"></a><b><a name="71210-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0712113000061"></a>Baroness Warnock:</b> I strongly agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I shall speak briefly on the amendment to which I have added my name. As a matter of principle, it seems to me profoundly immoral to bring a child up without his knowing something fundamental to his well-being. It is a sign of a kind of pettiness on the part of the parents to share a secret that they are not prepared to share with their child. In fact, it is almost impossible that a child should not learn, even if he does not know quite what he has learnt, that something is being concealed from him. That is no way to bring up a child&#151;among hidden secrets, about which he is not allowed to know.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0712113000014"></a>I know a father who is not the biological father of his son and who agreed with his wife that they would not tell the son until he was 14 years old. When the day came that they decided that they would tell him about his real, biological origins, the son was quite relaxed about it and said, &#147;Oh well, I always knew there was something funny going on, but I thought it was Mum&#148;. The father then said to me what an enormous weight off his mind that was. He had hated those 14 years in which knew that he was deceiving his child, with whom he got on extremely well. He hated the fact that there was something he could not talk about.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0712113000015"></a>From that point of view, it simply should not go on. I agree that it should be impossible to compel parents by law to reveal the truth to their child, but now it is much easier to do so than it used to be, when the thought of male infertility was a kind of insult&#151;something to be tremendously ashamed of&#151;that nobody was allowed or liked to admit. Now the notion of infertility is not thought to be essentially female and is recognised as a dysfunction that could happen to anybody, so there is no point in concealment</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0712113000016"></a>There are other factors of genetic inheritance that the child may have to know one day, such as if his biological father develops a genetic condition that may be passed on. There is every reason to make it desirable, natural and normal that the child should know. How that should be done we could discuss later, but I express my profound agreement with the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="0712113000017"></a><b><a name="71210-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0712113000062"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> Before I turn to the details of Amendment No. 68B, which stands in my name, I want to make an observation that has been with me all  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_94"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>afternoon. In the discussion so far we have conflated issues as disparate as whether same-sex couples can be parents and whether and how people should learn of their genetic identity. I hope that, as we go through all the amendments, we will begin to disentangle these very different issues.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0712113000018"></a>To do that, I wish to give some information to the Committee that it may find helpful. The HFEA&#146;s code of practice sets out guidance for clinics where it becomes known that a gamete donor has subsequently developed a genetic condition or is the carrier of a recessively inherited condition. When a centre knows that, it is told that it should supply that information to the HFEA immediately. Similarly, where a child born of donor conception develops a genetic condition, the centre is under the same obligation to send that information to the HFEA. Noble Lords will ask whether there is a process by which that information is passed on to the other part of the chain. To my understanding, the answer is no. That may be unsatisfactory, but it is a parallel to the situation that exists with adoption. Noble Lords might recall, from when we debated what is now the Adoption and Children Act 2002, the case of a birth mother who had relinquished a baby prior to 1974 and wished to pass that information on to an adult and could not because, in adoption law, children become part of a different family. While the possibility of voluntary transmission of information exists and could be encouraged, it is not possible to do it by an official process.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0712113000019"></a>I turn to the question of birth certificates. I have been struck, in conversations I have had over the past three or four weeks with all sorts of people, by the enormous sensitivity around these issues. On the one hand, it is understandable that one would wish to record truth and to pass it on between generations. Equally, it must be admitted that doing so via the birth certificate is clumsy. Birth certificates are public documents&#151;they are matters of public record&#151;and the proposal would pass on what can be intensely private and personal information.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0712113000020"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to short birth certificates. Standard practice is that people can have a short birth certificate, which contains a few details, but everyone also has a long birth certificate, from which more detailed information can be obtained. For example, people who are adopted usually have the fact of their adoption registered on their long birth certificate but, until recently, most people have used short birth certificates on the various occasions when one must produce a certificate. The problem is that these days, when times are changing&#151;for example, we live under threats of terrorism, and questions about identity are becoming more and more important&#151;short birth certificates are not being used as much; or, rather, officials increasingly ask for long birth certificates, which creates a problem.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0712113000021"></a>This is a difficult matter. The Joint Committee struggled with it. On page 73 of its report, it sets out that we have the right to know versus the right to privacy. It is not possible to balance those two conflicting things. The Joint Committee asked that there should be further debate on the matter. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was right when he said that this should not be  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>beyond the wit of man, but it is extremely difficult to address it satisfactorily. In my effort to promote that further debate, I have come up with the amendment that the Committee is considering.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0712113000022"></a>I want to make clear exactly what I intend. The amendment is only for discussion at this point. I am not wedded to it; I simply seek further views on this matter. The proposal is that on a birth certificate, there should be a symbol&#151;I have not specified what that should be; armies of civil servants will no doubt have endless fun determining that&#151;that means that there has been no donor conception. I should make it clear&#151;this is not in my amendment&#151;that my intention is that the legend should not be on the birth certificate; it should be held elsewhere. By that, I mean that it would be generally known&#151;for example, GRO publications might say what the symbol means. That is one more attempt to try to build in a degree of protection and privacy. One would have a birth certificate on which it was noted that a person&#146;s birth was registered and that, at the time when it was registered, it was noted that it was as a result of donor conception.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0712113000023"></a>Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I was greatly influenced by the many discussions we had during the passage of the Adoption and Children Bill about how and when parents should tell children the truth about their origins. Noble Lords might be interested to know that Professor Golombok, whose work was referred to earlier, is a strong advocate of telling children as soon as possible that they have been donor conceived. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is right that attitudes are changing greatly toward gay parents and different types of families. Yet the decision about how and when to tell a child remains an intensely personal one, which each family has to manage individually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0712113000024"></a>I do not wish our deliberations to end up with a system that meets all the public-policy aspirations that can be thought of yet simply does not work for families. I caution against us becoming too fixated on registering a birth, at the expense of making those parents who have chosen to go down that route feel in some way compromised about their ability to build a family with their child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0712113000025"></a>If any Member of the Committee could find a way in which this intensely personal and private information could be communicated directly, and only, to the person to whom it had most meaning, I would be delighted to consider it. I have not been able to think of anything so Amendment No. 68A, which is before the Committee, is a compromise. I accept that it is, therefore, highly likely to satisfy nobody. It is simply an effort to move us that one step forward, away from theory and into something practical with which families can live.</p>

However, if I might say so, I believe that it gets the balance right on this very sensitive and difficult issue. I am sure that we are all conscious of the sensitivity here. When I first became a member of the HFEA, I certainly found it difficult to take on board the strongly

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0712113000027"></a>However, over the years I have come to realise the importance of truthfulness and transparency. Amendment No. 68A in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Warnock, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, gets the balance about right between the importance of truthfulness and transparency, on the one hand, and, on the other, a proper and very important respect for family privacy and the parents&#146; roles and responsibilities in revealing to children the circumstances of their birth in their own proper way.</p>

I was impressed by some of the evidence that we had from donor-conceived people, in particular the long paper by David Gollancz that appears at No. 44 in the evidence book. When I spoke to Mr Gollancz afterwards, he spelt out in some detail what it feels like to discover that you have been donor conceived. At Second Reading, I mentioned the evidence of Mr Gollancz, who said on the first occasion he spoke publicly about his experience of being donor conceived that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712113000054"></a>&#147;it was as though someone had taken my autobiography and torn it up&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712113000043"></a>He was worried that those were overly strong words, but that was exactly how he felt and one can understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0712113000029"></a>We firmly took the view, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, that it is highly desirable that the donor-conceived person should be told about their genetic origin as soon as they are able to understand. That would happen at different ages for different people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0712113000030"></a>I remember an occasion involving my little brother. My mother was a widow and my brother had a friend at school who had a baby sister. My brother asked our mother, &#147;When will we have a baby sister?&#148;, and she had to explain to him, &#147;Well I&#146;m afraid without a father that is not possible&#148;. He asked, &#147;Do you mean you have to mate every time?&#148;. He was a child of seven and he was probably at an age when he could have understood if necessary&#151;he certainly knew enough about the facts of life to be able to take it on board. I get the impression that the earlier a child is capable of understanding, the less likely they are to be seriously disturbed, because they are unaware of what other noble Lords have referred to as the deception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0712113000031"></a>Mr Gollancz also mentioned the European Convention on Human Rights. He said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0712113000032"></a>I took the view, which was reflected in the Joint Committee&#146;s report&#151;my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, have made the same point&#151;that it is highly undesirable that the authorities should appear to connive at deception. There are a number of reasons for that, quite apart from the moral one. There are some practical reasons. How does a person know that they can go to the HFEA and find out their parentage unless they know that they have been donor conceived? When young people begin to engage in relationships or even contemplate marriage, there is a risk that the relationship might be consanguineous or even worse. There are all sorts of reasons why it is highly desirable for people to know. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, was absolutely right when she said that public attitudes to this are moving on and there is not the same sense of shame or secrecy that used to surround it.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0712113000033"></a>However, Mr Gollancz, in discussion after our session, told me firmly that we must not make disclosure compulsory on parents, because all sorts of difficult consequences would follow. There might be a deliberate concealment. If parents are subject to a duty and then conceal the information, they will go on concealing it and people may never know. On the other hand, he was equally adamant, and I agree with him, that the authorities should provide the information that would enable somebody to find out. Ideally, when a child is old enough to be told and reaches an age&#151;we said that it should be 16 rather than 18 for fairly obvious reasons these days&#151;they can go along to the HFEA and find out their origin and, if they wish to, try to trace their genetic parent. That would be the ideal situation. But clearly it does not always happen like that and our system must make provision for the less happy cases.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0712113000034"></a>I thought that either the solution proposed by my noble friend Lord Howe or that proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, were improvements on what the committee said. We simply said that the matter was too difficult for us and that the Government ought to give it more attention. So far we have not inserted anything into the Bill, but both my noble friend and the noble Baroness have provided a solution, using in one case the long birth certificate, which certainly should record the origins, and in another case the short one, if that is what the person would rather have so as not to have to disclose the information to other people.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0712113000035"></a>This is one of the more difficult questions in the Bill that we have been asked to consider. I do not think that the Government have fully thought through what they want to see in the Bill and I hope that they will find this debate of interest. If the Joint Committee had had more time, perhaps we might have come up with a solution, but we were getting near the end of our evidence by that stage and we had a deadline. We had to report by the end of July. Nevertheless, it was for me an intensely interesting part of our investigation and I am full of admiration for those who have come forward with solutions. At this stage I am not prepared to say which I would back, but I believe that the Government could build on one or other of them.</p>

<a name="0712113000036"></a><b><a name="71210-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0712113000065"></a>Lord Winston:</b> My friend the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, argues as if the scrutiny committee was unanimous on this issue but I do not think that that was entirely the case. I believe that there was quite a lot of hidden opinion. One of the issues that we have to consider is whether legislation that we make in respect of donated gametes, whether they be egg or sperm, is put at risk because parents might keep the arrangement secret. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who is not in his place, argues that practical experience is not important when you are making law, but I totally disagree with that view. I think that practical experience is essential if you are going to make good law.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0712113000037"></a>Practical experience at Hammersmith, which is a very large infertility clinic, shows that people undergoing donor arrangements tend to keep the matter secret from the children. That is a very big issue. I can cite many examples of where that has been a disaster later on. One child was informed only when he was a teenager doing very well at school. He was a bright boy attending a high-achieving school. He was completely appalled when his father turned round after the break-up of the marriage and said, &#147;You&#146;re not my son anyway. I shan&#146;t take care of you&#148;. The consequences for that person were dramatically horrific. That is an issue because many of these families may experience strain during the children&#146;s teenage years. Therefore, while practitioners will counsel openness from before the arrangement for donated gametes is commenced, there is a serious risk that the people undergoing these arrangements will take a different view. Certainly, my impression in my own clinic up to two years ago was that, although we counselled the ideal of being open about the arrangement, there was increasing reluctance to be so, which has increased since sperm donation has become very difficult.</p>

<a name="71210-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0712113000038"></a>I have huge respect for the amendments spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe. However, we must also consider the effect on the female when the female gamete is involved. We cannot divorce ourselves from the fact that egg donors are in a particularly difficult situation. We should look at the facts. At the moment in vitro fertilisation is an expensive procedure and a large number of couples simply cannot afford it. Therefore, they elect to go to the private sector on the basis that the woman will trade her eggs. What happens is that they go to a clinic, which says, &#147;We will offer you free treatment provided that you give up half or a proportion of your eggs to another woman who will pay for your treatment and the treatment that she is undergoing as well&#148;. The consequences of this are very clear and should have been clearer to the Government when these decisions were taken a year or so ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0712113000039"></a>The real problem is that a woman who has given eggs in this situation and whose own treatment then fails because her eggs do not fertilise&#151;or for whatever other reason the ones that she was apportioned do not result in a pregnancy&#151;does not know that the woman in the adjoining ward has got pregnant with her eggs. With the law as it now stands, that woman can, in 18 to 20 years, be traced by a child whom she did not know she had. That could be a disaster for that person in the making. It is something that we have not considered,

I suppose that I am taking a judgmental view about whether it is disastrous or not. We are faced here with a woman who has gone through in vitro fertilisation, who has given up her eggs&#151;possibly under some kind of duress because it was the only way in which she could pay for the treatment&#151;who ends up feeling that at least she has tried but is infertile, but who then finds, potentially to her horror, that she had a child all along who she did not know existed and whom, in different circumstances, she would have liked to have nurtured herself.</p>

I repeat that one of the greatest immoralities is to keep up a long-term deception of a child as to his origins. My preferred solution has long been simply to have &#147;by donation&#148; on the birth certificate. I fully understand that people may not want to produce this when they are opening a bank account or whatever, and therefore I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, as a compromise. I think it is a very good compromise on which people can agree, but I also regard it as a temporary compromise because I believe that attitudes are changing. If people learn somehow or other that this information appears, even if it is kept aside from the actual birth certificate by means of a symbol, or a circle, or a picture of a devil, or whatever, that symbol will soon become just like a word. One will know how to interpret it: it will just mean &#147;by donation&#148;. Times will change and it will become recognised that being a child by donation is an honourable thing to be and casts no aspersions on the social father whatever. In fact it shows his generosity, if anything. So if we went down that route or one like it, it probably would not last very long, but for the time being it seems to me essential to adopt the suggestion of the noble Earl or that of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, or something equivalent. I hope the Government will give due thought to that.</p>

That is an important thing to bear in mind if one is considering the integrity of the register of birth certificates. I put that down to the imperfection of human nature. Hence, we have an imperfect register of births. It is important that that is in the background. The amendment proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, refers to making sure that the Government and authorities are not conniving with lies, which is a slightly different thing. A large part of the birth register will not have the integrity that people might think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0712115000005"></a>On an earlier amendment, my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan talked about the right to know as being an essential right. That is fine, subject to the qualification of the imperfection and frailty of human nature.</p>

However, as I understand it, in law that is a rebuttable presumption. If evidence is ever produced to confound that presumption, a court will find accordingly. That is a totally different situation from one in which the state consciously enters into a deception from the outset.</p>

The essential thing that was put to our Joint Committee was that, in that case, the state is accepting the evidence that is available at the time of the birth, of course with the presumption that my noble friend Lord Howe referred to. The distinction between that and the case that we are considering here was put in the committee on the basis that it is the state conniving with the situation, because the state regulates the procedure under which the donor conception takes place. Therefore, the state is, as it were, a party to the false presentation if donor conception is not mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0712115000008"></a>Another way of tackling this has only occurred to me while listening to the discussion. The licensed clinic, or centre, or the HFEA could have an obligation to send a confidential communication to the child at a given age and, before it did so, it should warn the parents that that was going to happen. That is a possible way to preserve confidentiality from the world at large while still telling the child. I was not sure in older times whether the child would necessarily be followed up either by the licensed centre or the HFEA, but in light of the need for research in following up donor-conceived children, the records of those children will be available. It occurs to me as being a possible

The noble and learned Lord has just suggested another way. I admit that I would have some concerns about the approach that he has just outlined. If a letter were to arrive in a family home announcing that information was going to be imparted to a child, it could take no account of the individual circumstances in the family at that time. It might in that sense damage the relationships within that family.</p>

The noble Baroness, in a thoughtful speech, was trying to point to another way by suggesting that something should appear on the birth certificate as a code of some kind that could be interpreted later. Inevitably, as others have pointed out, people would know what that code represented, so one might as well be straightforward about it. The noble Earl&#146;s solution of having the words, &#147;donor conceived&#148; on the longer form of the birth certificate, with the parents then in a position to have a discussion with the child at the moment of their choice, represents for me the most crystal clear way of dealing with this. I certainly agree with what my noble friend Lady Warnock said earlier about the importance of truth being observed. As the noble Earl said, fake identities are not something that we should be promoting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0712115000012"></a>Earlier in our proceedings I mentioned a new book by Lisa Mundy called, <I>Everything Conceivable</I>. She points to the American experience. Inevitably a website has been created in the United States for children who have been donor-conceived to try to find out their true identities. An example of children searching for their unknown genetic parents involves a group of half siblings who have a donor in common. Some donors have more than 30 offspring. When the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, made his point earlier about the possibility of relationships being entered into unknowingly, this was not far-fetched, and we must take that into account as we decide on the information that we will make available to children who have been donor conceived.</p>

They met later in life and felt an inevitable attraction, and the judge had to deal with

I suspect that it will be a matter of litigation in the future if we do not make information of this kind available to children who have been donor conceived. The noble Earl said that the right to know was a human right. I agree, and it is the most straightforward way of dealing with an extraordinarily complex question.</p>

One is about what may be in the public domain and what should remain private, to which both amendments refer and to which I will come back. The second, the point being raised particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is whether the right to know is the right to know which individual was your donor, or the right to know&#151;in the phrase of my noble friend Lord Winston&#151;the genetic inheritance you have acquired which may be crucial for your future medical history.

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0712117000002"></a>On the first, I sympathise with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker.

Equally, on the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about abbreviated and

I therefore wonder whether there is any problem in having a pair of birth certificates, both &#147;long&#148;, one with the information and one without, with the full information being sent to the young person at the age of 18 and parents then being notified that it will be coming. That young person can then choose which of the two birth certificates to deploy in what situation. They would have the information in reserve on a full certificate if they wished and needed to use it. We obviously need to find some way through this dilemma; whether that is the right way, I do not know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0712117000003"></a>Secondly, on the genetic inheritance&#151;and perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will support me on this&#151;we heard at the scrutiny committee of the increasing worry that sperm donors were now limiting themselves in number and not coming forward precisely because of the tracking problem. Without going so far as to be worried about potentially incestuous relationships, this none the less did not seem a wise or prudent path to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0712117000004"></a>Equally, people need to know their medical history. Some of the evidence we got was very emotional and passionate. People wanted a slim hope of tracking back an individual parent in time to come. For the most part, however, the sense from the evidence was that people needed to know the genetic inheritance rather than the named individual so that they would be aware of future medical possibilities, problems and so on, and have that evidence. Surely we could also make that distinction. I hope that the Minister can help us on both these issues.</p>

I doubt whether there is any way that we can get the wording right tonight. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has also attempted a solution. However, listening to the debate, it strikes me that we have two separate things going on. One is about deceiving the infant, child or adolescent&#151;at whatever stage they are&#151;because they are carrying a piece of paper which is not reasonably truthful. I say &#147;reasonably truthful&#148; because we know that between 10 and 40 per cent&#151;I have heard 25 per cent&#151;of children believe that somebody is their dad, and genetically he is not.</p>

The problems relate to a child who has been lied to. I completely concur with my noble friend Lady Warnock on the problems for children who are deliberately lied to, not only about parentage but about all kinds of aspects. When divorce was stigmatised, parents sometimes tried to protect their children from the knowledge that they had been divorced prior to the child coming along. It was devastating for the children to discover that there was a secret to which they had not been party. We see

The child picks up that something is wrong. The problem is that once they have been lied to it is very difficult for them ever to trust that person to the same extent again. That is a fundamental principle, whether the state is complicit with the process of deliberately deceiving or whether the state believes that we should not attempt deliberately to deceive the next generation.</p>

Whether birth certificates should be annotated in some way to indicate donor conception is not a new issue; indeed the Warnock committee concluded in 1984 that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712117000018"></a>&#147;we are of the view that consideration should be given as a matter of urgency to making it possible for the parents in registering the birth to add &#145;by donation&#146; after the man&#146;s name&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="0712117000017"></a>That recommendation was rejected at the time. As far as the Government are aware, no other country in the world puts &#147;by donor&#148; on children&#146;s birth certificates. </p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0712117000008"></a>The Government have long believed that it is of prime importance that donor-conceived children are made aware, from a young age, of their background and are committed to encouraging that. As I briefly mentioned earlier, we are currently having discussions with the Donor Conception Network&#151;an organisation of families of donor-conceived children and donor-conceived adults&#151;about ways in which current and potential parents of donor-conceived children can be encouraged to tell the children about their origins. Workshops and materials are being planned. The aim is to encourage openness, and the Donor Conception Network provides information on telling and talking. It also provides helpful advice on how to tell older children, precisely to ensure that the cases of anger described by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, do not arise.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="0712117000009"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 63 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I feel that there are drawbacks to the proposed approach. As drafted, it would include the annotation on a birth certificate of any birth that was the result of IVF or other licensed infertility treatment. Infertility can be a difficult issue for people to come to terms with and I believe that they would not like it to be made public in this way. Birth certificates are public documents. I believe, however, that the noble Earl&#146;s intention was to make a reference to a donation by sperm, eggs, or an embryo, on birth certificates.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="0712117000010"></a>Amendment No. 68B, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Warnock, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, would bring a provision into the Bill that would mean a symbol would be used to annotate a birth certificate of a child who had been born through donor conception. I understand that a symbol would be a more subtle way of displaying the information and it is a very interesting proposal. However, I have heard the views expressed this evening and the symbol could soon become recognised. It may set apart such children as different and the information would be openly displayed on a public document, available for all to see.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0712117000011"></a>One further issue on both amendments that would need to be considered in detail is how, and if, that would work in practice. For example, when a woman gives birth in hospital, no one there will be aware that she conceived via either IVF or with donor sperm or eggs. Therefore, there would have to be a reliance on the parents to tell the registrar when registering the birth that they underwent certain treatment. Some parents might not be open with the registrar and, if so, the difficulty in telling the child later would be compounded. Indeed, it might make it even more difficult for parents to be honest with their children later on.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0712117000012"></a>If it were noted on a birth certificate that a child was the result of IVF treatment, or yet still that their father or mother was not actually their biological parent, would that not set them apart from other children as different? Is that something that children and parents would want to have openly displayed, even if they were aware of it themselves? I well understand that the situation is changing, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0712117000013"></a>Currently, donor-conceived children can, on reaching 18, get in touch with the HFEA to find out certain non-identifying information about their donor. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, informed us, since the removal of donor anonymity in 2005, donor-conceived people will also be able to obtain identifying information about their donor on reaching 18.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0712117000014"></a>The Bill also brings in new provisions that enable donor-conceived children to contact the HFEA to find out non-identifying information at the lower age of 16, followed by identifying information on reaching 18. The non-identifying information includes information about a range of personal characteristics of the donor, the screening tests carried out on the donor and information on their personal and family medical history. The HFEA issues directions to clinics, which means that this information has to be collected by them at the time of donation and provided to the HFEA.</p>

<a name="71210-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0712117000015"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Winston for drawing attention to the painful situation of the woman who unknowingly donated eggs that gave rise to a child, while she remained infertile. However, the Bill&#151;</p>

However, the HFEA and all the best clinics emphasise the importance of good counselling, and it is government policy. Before a woman enters an egg-sharing arrangement, she has to be made fully aware that she might not conceive and that someone to whom she donated an egg might. She is urged not to enter into the arrangement unless she is prepared to accept the consequences.</p>

Having met a number of these women after treatment, I can vouchsafe for the serious predicament that they find themselves in after egg-sharing arrangements, when they deeply regret having gone through it in spite of the counselling. That is the practicality of what is a very difficult issue.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07121110000005"></a>I am grateful for the clarification given by noble Lords. The Bill provides for sperm and egg donors to ask centres whether a child has been born from their donation. People can find out the number, the year of birth and the sex of the children born. That may help to ameliorate things somewhat. I note the guidance and counselling given by the HFEA&#151;I am grateful for both the counselling and the information.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07121110000006"></a>Some are of the view that annotating donor-conceived children&#146;s birth certificates, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, will mean that those children are better placed to find out about their genetic background. However, the Government believe that encouraging openness by the parents of donor-conceived children is currently the best way forward. Arrangements are in place for donor-conceived people to find out about their genetic background from the HFEA register, if they would like to. However, in response to the Joint Committee, the Government will keep the position on birth registration and donor conception under review. Tonight&#146;s debate is an important contribution to that review.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07121110000007"></a>I note that, in Amendment No. 63, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, proposes regulations. The Government would not want to include in the Bill a provision as proposed in the amendment, because a lot more discussions need to go on with stakeholders. I know that it is thought that discussions can take place rapidly, but, to put something in the Bill, we have to be sure that it is absolutely right, and absolutely right for the families, the children and everyone concerned for an awful long time.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07121110000008"></a>Therefore, as we go into further discussion before Report, maybe we should consider regulation-making procedures with a view to clarifying the situation later, after all those discussions. I do not know. Those are things to be discussed and I look forward to that. In the mean time, I trust that noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07121110000010"></a>I simply want to make a couple of observations. I tabled my amendment, to which I am not especially wedded, because I had talked to different people and tried to put myself in the different shoes of all those who would be affected by the provision. I was very heartened when the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, said that those children are special&#151;that they are extremely wanted. They are. I have a reservation about marking out anyone as being somehow different on their birth certificate. I am profoundly uncomfortable with that on principle.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07121110000011"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I say that I read the evidence and the report of the Joint Committee. I know that the Joint Committee had before it some powerful and persuasive young people who were making some extremely compelling arguments, but they represent only one strand of opinion among people who have been donor conceived. Other people who have been donor conceived take an entirely different view. That is a point that has not been made throughout our discussion today.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07121110000012"></a>None of us wants in any way to promote or assist collusion in an untruth, but I was similarly uncomfortable with the proposal of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. We have never said to people who are adopted that on their 18th birthday a letter would come through the post to advise them of that fact. Why? Because in all the time that our predecessors in this Chamber&#151;we go back hundreds of years&#151;were making laws on adoption, we recognised that what was happening was the creation of new families. It was in part the job of legislators to ensure that the legislation surrounding the creation of that family did not make family life impossible.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07121110000013"></a>We run the risk of doing that. We do it for a very understandable reason. In some ways, we are trying to replicate two systems, neither of which is perfect. One is the law on adoption and the other, as the noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, so strongly argued, is real life as it has happened since time began and before people with the genius of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, were there to facilitate its creation.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07121110000014"></a>I realise that we have not concluded this discussion in any way, but I think that it has been helpful to air the arguments. I would very much welcome the opportunity to consider any or all of the issues with any Members of your Lordships' House. In the mean time, I shall not press my amendment.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07121110000016"></a>As the noble Baroness said, this is an extremely difficult issue. There are no easy ways through the problems that noble Lords have identified. The amendments suggest two possible alternative ways forward; the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, suggested another rather imaginative way to tackle the problem, as did my noble and learned friend, Lord Mackay.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07121110000018"></a>I am just sorry that the noble Baroness did not warm to the amendments a little bit more than she appeared to do. I simply invite her to read the evidence put before the Joint Committee, which convinced me, at any rate, that the rights of parents to privacy&#151;rights that should certainly not be overlooked in this equation&#151;are trumped by the right of the child to expect truth from the state.</p>

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07121110000019"></a>I add that encouraging parents to be open with their children really does not address the issue of human rights about which so many Lords spoke.

<a name="71210-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07121110000024"></a>The question raised by my amendment is whether that right should be extended to the children of a donor-conceived person in certain circumstances. If, for example, a woman with a young family discovers that she was donor-conceived, but dies before she has the chance to make an information request, there would appear to be no means for the authority to provide the relevant information to those members of her family with a direct interest in it. I question whether the Bill may be overly restrictive in that sense and would be glad to hear the Minister&#146;s reaction. I beg to move.</p>

This includes the donor&#146;s last known address. Hence, donor-conceived children, having sought this information from the HFEA, may receive information which enables them to find their donor. As donors are able to donate for up to 10 families&#151;as we discussed earlier&#151;there are possibly more than 10 children born as a result.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000012"></a>As we begin this Committee stage, I should like to set out our broad approach to the scrutiny of the Bill. Our overall view is that the Bill is excessively narrow and needs to be widened in a number of ways, both as to the assets that could be brought within its scope and the purposes to which money could be put. Those will be our main subjects for debate, but we also have a number of detailed amendments designed to tease out the finer points of detail on parts of the Bill, on which we all want to work constructively to improve it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000013"></a>We start today with one of our larger themes&#151;the range of assets within the scope of the Bill. We had hoped to table amendments specifically aimed at bringing in other forms of dormant financial asset to the Bill. The list is potentially very long, including life assurance policies, pension assets, shares not taken up in demutualisations, other shares whose owners cannot be traced, and so on. The values are potentially at least as significant as those involved in the dormant bank and building society accounts covered by this Bill.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000014"></a>I tried very hard to persuade the Public Bill Office to allow me to table an amendment that would have created an order-making power for the Treasury to bring other categories of dormant financial asset into the overall scope of the Bill at a later stage. The broad scheme of transferring funds but preserving the owner&#146;s rights to reclaim those funds provides a good umbrella that could cover many other kinds of asset&#151;and we hoped to be able to amend the Bill to that effect. We recognise that there are many legal and technical complexities involved in the other categories of assets, which is why we wanted to create a fairly extensive order-making power.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000015"></a>The Minister will know that such an amendment would have had support from all sides of the Committee. However, he can breathe a sigh of relief because the Public Bill Office was adamant that the scope could not be extended beyond the financial assets similar in nature to bank and building society accounts. Hence my noble friend Lord Higgins was allowed to table Amendment No. 31 in respect of national savings, to which we shall come later, but I could not table anything broader. I believe that the Liberal Democrats hit a similar Public Bill Office roadblock on this issue. I mean no criticism of the Public Bill Office, which was as usual entirely helpful, but it has its rules to follow and it follows them&#151;and the Opposition have to accept its judgments even though we do not agree with them.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000016"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 15 are second-best amendments. Since we cannot extend the Bill to other forms of asset, we have instead, and with the help of the Public Bill Office, inserted a new clause after Clause 2 which requires the Secretary of State to report on the operation of the scheme set up under Clauses 1 and 2. Importantly, subsection (2) of the proposed new clause says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000354"></a>&#147;The report shall... consider the desirability of establishing similar schemes in respect of other providers of financial services&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000337"></a>That will not of itself create new schemes for gathering in dormant financial assets, but it will ensure that such schemes will not disappear from public view. The amendment calls for the report within 12 months of the coming into force of Part 1 of the Bill. On reflection, however, that period must be too short and I shall reconsider it when we return to the issue on Report.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000017"></a>Amendment No. 16, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, extends the report to &#147;other orphan assets&#148;. I am not clear what the terminology &#147;orphan asset&#148; actually means but I see that the sense of the report should extend to other categories of asset such as shares whose owners cannot be traced rather than simply focusing on those found in financial services businesses. Perhaps the Liberal Democrats and we can work on a better amendment before we return to this matter at Report.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000018"></a>The Government in their consultation on this scheme did not ask for views on whether the scope of assets within the scheme was right. Nevertheless, they got those views. According to the Government&#146;s summary of responses in the document that they issued in November, around 60 per cent of respondents wanted the scheme to cover other assets. That was the response to a question that had not been asked. It is not only organisations in the third sector that wanted this; some financial institutions also wanted it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000019"></a>The Government will have their way, and ignore that strong support for a wider scope to the Bill, because we will not oppose the Bill and thereby delay the scheme for bank and building society accounts. However, we do not believe that the Government should get away with ignoring the issue, which is why the amendment is designed to keep the public focused on those other categories of assets. I beg to move.</p>

We, too, had bother with the Public Bill Office, as did the noble Baroness. It may well have been operating by the rule book. Eventually, we managed to come up with an amendment that was agreeable to it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000021"></a>In a way, the problem was not the Public Bill Office, but the Government losing faith at an earlier stage. The Bill was going to be called the unclaimed assets Bill, but was then renamed the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill. It has been narrowed by the Government, which is why we are in this difficulty. Many Members will have seen the report of the Treasury Select Committee in the other place. It had seen a document from the US state of Vermont, where 110 different forms of orphan asset were listed. We are talking about two: bank and building society.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000022"></a>I approve of the amendment that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has been able to table, but it needs pushing a little further to bring in other things. The reason for that are the words &#147;financial services&#148;. I am not clear about their precise definition, but owning a share, and dividends that follow shares, may not be financial services. Many things are financial services, but there will be other forms of orphan asset; that is, an asset that has been abandoned and should be looked at if a review is to take place.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000023"></a>It is a very gentle approach&#151;I wish it were otherwise. It is interesting that the Republic of Ireland, even though it started reclaiming unclaimed assets only three years ago, is now on to its third Act of Parliament to pursue orphan assets. It takes time, with the conflicting ideas that Governments want to pursue. It would have been far better if this matter could have been dealt with through orders, once the bank and building society side of it had been successfully completed and we could move on to other assets. If this is the only way of doing it, I hope that we can move in this direction.</p>

Those of us who worked for two years on that commission were delighted that the idea of getting in touch with and using unclaimed assets or dormant accounts for the benefit of charities should have received such a fair wind from the Treasury Select Committee. I hope that the &#147;gentle approach&#148; that has been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, will eventually lead to a widening of the scope for these ideas.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000025"></a>We should remember as we consider the Bill how long it has taken to get to this stage and how gentle the persuasion has had to be just to get us to where we are today. Many people have been working on trying to have the assets made available to the charity sector, which was not even called the third sector when we started with these ideas. The ideas go back many years&#151;in fact, decades. I pay tribute to those who have worked so assiduously to get this idea into the public consciousness, particularly Geraldine Peacock, the former chair of the Charity Commission. She has pursued this idea indefatigably.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000026"></a>We should bear in mind that the banks have not rushed enthusiastically to support access to their dormant accounts. Getting to this stage has been a matter of gentle persuasion and of trying to sell the idea. Where we are now is not where we will eventually end up, but I hope that as we consider the Bill we will bear in mind how difficult it is has been to reach here.</p>

It is a bit like the position of Swiss banks. A very large number of victims of the Holocaust deposited enormous sums with them, and it was very convenient for them to sit on that money and to have nobody asking for it back. </p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000028"></a>It must be right that we put into the Bill the capacity to move on and take up other orphan assets&#151;if orphan assets is the right description of what we mean&#151;so that we do not have to come back and legislate all over again to move on to other areas when we have dealt with banks and building societies. </p>

It may be more appropriate for me to speak to Amendment No. 24, but I wish to support Amendments Nos. 16, 24 and 44. These amendments have strong support from the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition, which is a coalition of 53 charities and umbrella organisations. I declare an interest as vice-president of Marie Curie Cancer Care, which provides care to cancer patients. In the briefing, which has been widely circulated, the coalition recognises that this is a highly technical Bill&#151;certainly far too technical for me, as I am purely a clinician. The Bill seems to be an opportunity to ensure that charities in the coalition are able to locate assets bequeathed to them in supporters&#146; wills which remain unclaimed.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000030"></a>One in seven of those who die leaving valid wills also leave legacy gifts to charity which, on average, amount to 5 per cent of their total estate; so potentially large amounts of legacy income have yet to reach the charities named in the wills. These legacies are an important source of voluntary income&#151;46 per cent of the British Heart Foundation&#146;s income comes from such legacies. The coalition urges that the Bill be strengthened, because it is reasonable to assume that charities are owed a significant proportion of the unclaimed assets in the UK. Unlike in the US, there is no mandatory register that can be used to identify assets. That issue is addressed in Amendment No. 24 and I hope to return to it when we reach that amendment.</p>

I heard what the noble Baronesses said, but if we are talking about small charities, then I am not sure that the Big Lottery Fund is exactly the ideal vehicle. However, that is a matter for debate.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000032"></a>I support my noble friend on the first subsection of the new clause inserted by Amendment No. 15. In Parliament, we too often put through a law and do not take stock of its effect. That amendment requires that there shall be a report to Parliament one year after this Act comes into operation. The noble Baroness who spoke at the beginning indicated that there will be future developments. That is a fundamental point in the report, and I would not have thought that such a point was in the least bit party political. I hope we will be able to pass the amendment, and that the Minister will be able to take it on board quickly without much further debate.</p>
<h5><a name="07121041000378"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07121041000033"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121041000399"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this important debate. I am sorry about the trouble the opposition Front Benches have had with the Public Bill Office. That is not an experience I have ever enjoyed. Generally it is the Government who wince a little at just what is acceptable in the Public Bill Office, but we do not normally bring any complaints before the Committee so that they are on the record. I appreciate the frustration of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, but now and again the issues will rub against them and they must take that in their stride.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000034"></a>The 2005 Pre-Budget Report and subsequent announcements set out the scheme, which is reflective of a clear government manifesto commitment. The scheme is restricted to retail banks and building societies&#146; bank accounts. The rather facile arguments that have come from the two main opposition Benches about how easy it is to extend the Bill to other areas merely betrays the fact that they are high in ambition and low on practicality with regard to such a scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, indicated that the banks would not necessarily enthuse about a scheme of this kind because it represents a loss of the yielding of an asset, and the Government have had a difficult task in persuading the banks and building societies to participate in a voluntary scheme that will make substantial resources available to the good causes that my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley identified.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000035"></a>It is asking a great deal to suggest that it is simple to extend the Bill to banks and building societies. The accounts we are dealing with are cash accounts, but the orphan assets to which the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, refers, otherwise known as the inherited estate, are held by insurance companies in with-profit funds. They represent assets in excess of those needed to meet the fund&#146;s liabilities. Orphan assets are different from unclaimed assets. To take one obvious issue, if the assets are held by an insurance company, the policyholders have a right to share in any distribution according to the rules of the fund. What is suggested here, however, is that the fund should be contracted&#151;without consultation with policyholders, from what I have seen so far&#151;and that there should be a concentration of the fund to which policyholders  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would otherwise have the right of access. I am not saying that that cannot be done; I am merely saying that it is a pretty important issue to confront.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000036"></a>All other forms of unclaimed assets&#151;particularly pension assets, which often come within this framework&#151;raise a whole different set of legal and procedural issues compared to banking assets. Both the legal ownership structure and the nature of the investment assets are very different from cash. For instance, if we removed assets from the majority of unclaimed pension funds managed by insurance companies, that might well require higher members&#146; and employers&#146; contributions. Again, I am not saying that that is totally impractical, but I am indicating that it is another hurdle to cross beyond the one which the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, identified with regard to the banks and building societies.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000037"></a>We have to be limited in our ambition with this scheme, but it represents a massive step forward. It is the fulfilment of a pledge that we made in 2005, and it will realise significant assets. The issues which have been raised are important but difficult ones. Getting this scheme off the ground will take probably until 2009. To undertake full consultation in seeking to overcome the difficulties with all the other assets that I have identified would mean, even if it proved practicable, that we would be a good deal more distant from effective legislation. The Government are proud of what is before the Committee; it is the fulfilment of a commitment and a significant step forward for banks and building societies whose co-operation we have achieved.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000038"></a>There has been extensive consultation, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, emphasised. We received 56 responses to the scheme&#146;s first consultation, of which around 30 were from the charities which she identified as part of the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition. Those representations were more in the form of a campaign letter advocating how widely we should set our ambitions than practical solutions towards realising our objectives.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000039"></a>As for the Bill&#146;s limitations, one of the joys of opposition is to be expansive and ambitious beyond the wildest dreams of government. But Oppositions also have to temper those dreams with the hope that one day they may have to address themselves to the practicalities. The great danger is that they may be out of practice, and they may remain so for a considerable time. As has been identified on the noble Baroness&#146;s own Back Benches, bringing the banks and building societies within this framework is an achievement, and we have had widespread consultation.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000040"></a>I turn to the proposal about a report within a year. We will have to bring the Financial Services Agency into the scheme in order to make it viable and guarantee that matters are conducted properly and that will be done after Royal Assent. A report on such a scheme within a year could only indicate that we were making very limited progress indeed on meeting any ambition at all. It is not realistic to talk about a report in one year. It is important, as the noble Baroness identified, that the Government should be accountable for the scheme, but it is a scheme with a light regulatory touch. I warn noble Lords opposite that if they press us too far on certain aspects of  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulation and enforcement I might be prone to use the argument that they have on other occasions been in favour of the lightest possible touch.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000041"></a>The Bill is a product of consultation and agreement. That is why it is limited in its ambition. We have had an interesting debate, but it is not realistic for the Government to produce a report on an Act that contains a great deal of secondary legislation which will come into effect to guarantee that the Financial Services Authority plays its part effectively. To expect a report annually on this is asking a great deal.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000042"></a>From the vast range of amendments which have been tabled already, it would appear that noble Lords opposite believe that the breadth of our ambition is limited. This project is difficult enough within its framework. I hate to think how many amendments the noble Baroness would have tabled had we sought to include those orphaned assets which raise so many other issues. She would rightly have advanced a critical analysis, as she usually does.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000043"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121041000400"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> I do not think that anyone said that this would be easy. I did not think that the Government were here to do things that are easy. I thought that they were here to do things that are perhaps difficult. The Irish, bless them, have done very well, but it has taken them three Acts of Parliament. Perhaps they are cleverer than the Government, because they have managed to include insurance assets. I understand why the Minister is saying, &#147;Let&#146;s do it a bit at a time&#148;, but we would like a bit more to be done at some time. The noble Baroness talked about this year but perhaps that was not her first thought. These things had to be done in a hurry because of what we said about the Public Bill Office. The main issue is whether or not the Government have greater horizons.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000044"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07121041000401"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> We have had an interesting first debate. I notice that the Minister did not ask me to withdraw my amendment. Perhaps he will accept it&#151;or perhaps not. I wish he had read the amendment, because he spent most of his response telling me how difficult it was to deal with other categories of asset. I recognised that in my opening remarks. The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, rightly reminded us of how hard it has been to get to this stage. I do not dispute that, and I pay tribute to all those who have worked to get us to this stage. The point of the amendment, however, was simply to ask the Government to report on the operation of the scheme and&#151;importantly, as I pointed out&#151;on the desirability of establishing schemes in respect of other providers of financial services, and to ask that the drafting be reviewed. I also said to the Minister that one year was not the right period and that I would consider a longer period. As he said, the amendment would not require an annual report.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000045"></a>We have never said that moving into other categories of asset was easy. The Minister tried to say that the Opposition do not understand how difficult everything is.

That is why we drafted a very modest amendment that asked for a report. As I said, one year is almost certainly too short and the definition of what that report should cover certainly needs to be worked on, but we should be in no doubt that we should not lose sight of those other categories of asset. There is a great danger that when the Minister says, &#147;We&#146;ve fulfilled the commitment in our manifesto&#148;, people will breathe a sigh of relief at the Bill&#146;s passage and think that the job of collecting in large amounts of value which could be put to better use has been done.</p>

The Minister was unclear on whether the FSA will be charged with producing an annual report on this aspect of the totality of things it looks after. The key dimension of this issue for organisations with charitable foundations whose dormant accounts will be taken away is where this money will go. Perhaps I am being a little flippant here but&#151;as the Minister and I often debate the Olympics&#151;let us say that the whole lot will go to the Big Lottery Fund to pay off the further debts of the Olympics. Those charitable foundations would not be too pleased. They have every right to know where this money is going.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000052"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<h5><a name="07121041000379"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07121041000053"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121041000406"></a>Lord Newby</b> moved Amendment No. 2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000355"></a> Clause 1, page 1, line 5, leave out from &#147;applies&#148; to end of line 8 and insert &#147;&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) to all banks which are required to transfer to an authorised reclaim fund the balance of a dormant account that a person (&#147;the customer&#148;) holds with it, and&#148;
<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000054"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to make the scheme compulsory rather than voluntary. The key words in the amendment are that the scheme applies to all banks. We should probably have put a comma after the word &#147;banks&#148;; there is a slight <I>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</I> issue there but I am sure that, if the Minister is minded to accept the amendment, we can deal with that on Report. However, as I said, the purpose of the amendment is to require the scheme to apply to all banks and building societies. It seems strange to us that a programme which is deemed to be so important and on which the Government put so much store should be completely voluntary. Why should some banks hang on to these assets and keep them on their balance sheets? Under the scheme as it stands, there is no sanction for doing so.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000055"></a>We were very interested to see how this issue is already being dealt with and debated in the context of the Treasury Select Committee in another place, which considered this matter. The Government helpfully anticipated the noble Lord&#146;s speech this afternoon by making a number of objections to the proposal, which I should like to go through.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000056"></a>The Treasury Select Committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000356"></a>&#147;A compulsory scheme has the overwhelming advantage of guaranteeing fairness and consistency between institutions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000338"></a>That seems to us to be an overwhelming case. However, in their response, the Government came up with a number of reasons why that overwhelming case was not adequate. Essentially, they came up with four objections, all of which, in my view, are to a greater or lesser extent spurious.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000057"></a>The first was that a voluntary approach,</p>
<ul><a name="07121041000370"></a>&#147;enables the use of private sector expertise to manage and invest the money paid to the reclaim fund by banks and building societies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000339"></a>Why does a compulsory scheme not allow that possibility?</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000058"></a>The second objection was that a voluntary approach means that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121041000371"></a>&#147;it will be the private sector that takes responsibility for managing liabilities to account holders, which will remain on the private sector&#146;s balance sheet&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000340"></a>Why is that affected by whether it is a compulsory or a voluntary approach?</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000059"></a>The third objection was that a voluntary approach, </p>
<ul><a name="07121041000372"></a>&#147;brings added flexibility. It will allow individual institutions to determine whether an account is genuinely dormant&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000341"></a>Why does that have anything to do with whether it is a voluntary or compulsory approach?</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000060"></a>The fourth was that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000357"></a>&#147;A voluntary scheme&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000342"></a>I like this&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07121041000373"></a>&#147;also takes account of better regulation principles, building on existing regulatory arrangements, helping to maximise the money available for reinvestment in the community&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000343"></a>Why does a voluntary approach help to maximise the money available for reinvesting in the community when banks can simply opt out of it if they want, thereby reducing the amount of money available for investing in the community?</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000061"></a>Those seem to be almost completely spurious arguments, and I suspect that the real reason for the Government going forward in the way that they have is as follows. A throw-away line in the next paragraph says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000358"></a>&#147;In light of the sector&#146;s ongoing support for a voluntary scheme, the Government&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000344"></a>and so on. I can see that the sector might like a voluntary scheme but banks and other institutions of all sorts like voluntary schemes across a whole raft of areas where we now make things compulsory. Therefore, that is a poor argument.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000062"></a>The Treasury Select Committee, in a spirit of extraordinary generosity, then said that if the Government cannot bring themselves to make the scheme compulsory from the start, they ought to have reserve powers&#151;to which the Government gave the following terrific response:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000359"></a>&#147;Including these powers in legislation would not be a good use of Parliament&#146;s time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000063"></a>There may be compelling arguments why it is a bad idea to make this scheme compulsory, but I think that there are very strong arguments for making it compulsory. The Government have so far failed to make their case. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000064"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07121041000407"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I should perhaps outline our position. Although we have considerable sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, we recognise that it has been a long and rocky road&#151;a point to which the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, alluded&#151;to get to where we have got. This is an uneasy truce, or a fragile agreement, but it is where we are at. Our general principles would indicate that if a voluntary scheme can work then it should be allowed to work and we should not go to compulsion as our first port of call. So to that extent we are comfortable with a voluntary scheme as the first port of call. However, if that does not work&#151;and we have tabled amendments on a review to probe whether it is working&#151;then compulsion will be necessary. But a voluntary scheme would be better: it is a lighter touch and avoids a heavy regulatory hand and bureaucratic overlays. If it can work, that has to be the better way. That is why we are just about content to go along with the scheme in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000065"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121041000408"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> We may be surprised by what the Minister says but my guess is that he will defend the voluntary scheme. I have just one question on this voluntary scheme: what is it that we are asking the banks to volunteer for? Is it whether they join the scheme, or the extent to which they join the scheme?  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They could say, &#147;We&#146;ll put so much in&#148;. In other words, it is the hokey-cokey&#151;some in, some out. The answer will be very important in determining whether it is a proper scheme or a hokey-cokey scheme. The spirit must be that they are in the scheme. If it is hokey-cokey, we will not have a level playing field even though that should be the position. I hope the Minister will address that.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000066"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121041000409"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> I do not think there is any doubt that robust self-regulation and total commitment to the scheme is what we would hope for from the banks, with as little bureaucracy as possible and the minimum of anything getting in the way of the actual administration of the funds for the benefit of the charitable sector. We therefore need to look at enshrining the spirit of co-operation. Although I agree with many of those who say that we should aim for compulsion, such a course would veer us away from the one we want by making the banks start from a position of defensiveness rather than co-operation. If the scheme is to work to the benefit of the charitable sector we will need to see co-operation all round.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000067"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07121041000410"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> Commercial considerations would suggest that it makes a lot of sense for a bank to agree to do this, but to do it as slowly as it possibly can. Can the Minister answer that point?</p>

<p><a name="07121041000068"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07121041000411"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken, particularly to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who I thought put the rejoinder to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, far more eloquently than I could. I therefore do not propose to embellish the main argument; the position she outlined is exactly the one that the Government adopt, and we do so for the excellent reasons that she put forward.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000069"></a>However, there are issues of detail to which my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley drew attention and which I wish to emphasise. A voluntary approach enables the use of private sector expertise to manage and invest the money paid into the reclaimed fund by banks and building societies. It means that the private sector will take responsibility for managing liabilities to account holders, which will remain on the private sector&#146;s balance sheet. If it is asked why they should do that and what is in it for it for them, as did the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, we should explain that it will be a publicly explicit scheme. The public will know which banks sign up to the scheme and the extent to which they take part, so we do not have to worry about whether any of the major institutions will refrain from participating&#151;very far from it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000070"></a>The basis of the agreement&#151;or &#147;uneasy truce&#148;, as the noble Baroness abstracted from the sense of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, but it is a little more than that&#151;is a willing partnership to give effect to what the banks and building societies recognise is the unacceptability of money lying in accounts which according to their records they do not own. A careful, articulated approach will be taken to safeguarding the owners of those assets until we are clear that there are no claimants. We will also guarantee that claimants  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will get their money at any stage that they establish that they have a rightful claim, at whatever point of transfer the money has reached. That is all part of bank and building society goodwill and commitment. Therefore, the advantages of the voluntary approach are considerable.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000071"></a>This approach also adds flexibility. Instead of going in with a heavy hand of state regulation, we can expect significant aspects of the scheme to operate on the basis of good practice. It also takes account of better regulation principles, building on existing regulatory arrangements, which will help us to maximise the money flows rather than detract from them. The great trouble with regulation, which requires the enforcement of law, is that one is compelling the unwilling, when what we expect within this framework is a light touch that will indicate how the willing meet their obligations.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000072"></a>I emphasise again that the scheme will be wholly transparent, so there will be no question of significant institutions reneging on their public responsibilities or commitment to this scheme to which they have signed up in this agreement, on which all the proposals are based.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000073"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07121041000412"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> When the voluntary negotiations with the banks and building societies were going on, they must have quantified the money that was at stake. They must have a good idea of what it all amounts to. Have they agreed to any time scale by which the great majority of the money should be paid over?</p>

<p><a name="07121041000074"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07121041000413"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> We have a broad range of figures for the money that may be available through the scheme. I could not be pinned down to a particular figure. At Second Reading, the noble Baroness trumped me by indicating that she thought that rather more money would be available than in the Government&#146;s more modest estimation. Well, time will tell. However, I make it clear that the reclaim fund will publish a list of participating institutions, so the public will know those which are pulling their weight in the scheme and participating voluntarily. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, is never persuaded by my arguments and will probably not accept my response. He will emphasise that law is the compulsive element in our society, as it is, but if within these voluntary terms we can get willing participation with a light touch, we may meet the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, about the time scale within which the scheme begins to realise the majority of its assets. I cannot put a figure on it, not least because many difficulties about defining the accounts will have to be worked through. But the intent is there, and the public responsiveness of the institutions will be clearly identified.</p>

However, the Bill clearly identifies the broad contours of the funds and accounts available. As I have said all along and will continue to reiterate throughout proceedings on this Bill, any claimant who appears, however late, is entitled to his resources because he is the owner of them. But in a publicly accountable scheme such as this one, there will be substantial leverage on the participating institutions which have voluntarily and with good will engaged in it to meet their obligations under it. The light-touch regulatory regime and public opinion are important dimensions in that respect. The informed opinion of Parliament and the operations of Select Committees and so on also will hold institutions to account on meeting their obligations.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, indicated his suspicion of a bank that was extraordinarily restrictive in its definition of dormancy. If a regular comparison showed that other banks of about the same size and role had a wider definition which released more funds to the scheme, then the restrictive bank would come under pressure. The reclaim fund will publish the flows into the scheme. So if the smallest building society in the country was producing more resources than the biggest bank, informed public opinion would want to ask a few questions of the large bank.</p>

There are many references to the <I>Banking Code</I>, which started 15 years ago. It is amazing that assets also have to be 15 years old. It is possible for a bank to say that there might have been unclaimed assets but they were written off before the <I>Banking Code</I> came into effect and now there are none. The starting point is very important. The bank could say that unclaimed assets were written off to a suspense account, then to the profit-and-loss account, and then were paid out as dividends. The starting point is important, particularly when the <I>Banking Code</I> was, in effect, invented 15 years ago.</p>

The Committee would not want me to trail an extensive answer before further significant points are made. We are all too well aware of the importance of the starting point. That is why the definitions of dormancy established by the institutions will be subject to scrutiny. Norms will be established, and if it were thought that a bank was operating well out of line with what other banks were doing by using an argument about accounts that preceded the <I>Banking Code</I> which enabled it to siphon off substantial resources, that would be identified and aired and the bank would scarcely be participating in the scheme to the extent that we all would wish. The banks retain their liability to customers at any stage, and so does the reclaim scheme. The institutions have committed to update the <I>Banking Code</I> to take account of this legislation when it is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000087"></a>I would have preferred to deal with this by making it compulsory from the start. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, suggested. Perhaps on Report we should come forward with a reserve power in case the scheme does not work as well as the Minister might hope. We will consider that between now and then. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000092"></a>I referred to this legislation in the course of the debate on the gracious Speech. Unfortunately arrangements for a funeral prevented me from being at Second Reading, but I have read the debate carefully. The Minister, and a number of others, stressed that reuniting account holders with their money must be the first priority wherever possible. I am sure that is right. On the one hand, as has been implied just now, the banks have an interest in hanging on to the money, while on the other hand the charities are saying how marvellous it would be if they could get their hands on it, but in the middle of all that are the actual account owners. We must ensure that everything possible is done to find them.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000093"></a>When I spoke in the debate on the gracious Speech I referred to the fact that almost exactly 10 years ago I was asked by Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve in America and a distinguished American public servant, to act as one of the arbitrators on what became known as the Claims Resolution Tribunal for dormant accounts in Switzerland. I took that on, and on the whole it operated well. We were successful in uniting many of the dormant account holders or their heirs with the money that was rightfully  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>theirs. I say to my noble friend Lord Hamilton that on the whole I found the Swiss banks extremely helpful in the course of that exercise.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000094"></a>The task we had was a much more difficult one than identifying dormant accounts in British banks will be. To start with, Swiss bank accounts, certainly in the earlier period, on the whole did not have anything by way of a signature. It was simply a numbered account&#151;someone wandered in, opened the account and that was that. To try to find the heirs to that account 70 years later was not easy. It involved identifying individuals to see whether they were the right person at all. That ought not to be a difficulty so far as these bank accounts are concerned. Similarly, we had trouble tracing the addresses and so on. But that was a long time ago.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000095"></a>With this legislation we are talking about an account being dormant if it has been so for more than 15 years. I suspect that many of them have been dormant for a much longer period. We are not really seeking to find the &#147;customer&#148;, but probably the heir or even the heir of the heir, as the rightful owner of the account. The question then is how should one seek to find them? On the Claims Resolution Tribunal we were faced with this problem. What we did&#151;and I am extremely grateful to the Library for digging this out&#151;was publish in the press lists of names and addresses, as far as they were known. It will be easier in this case, because we could simply put in the last known postcode of the person. Eventually, we dealt with it on the internet, which was in its infancy. That would be a much easier way of doing this, together with an explanation of what it was all about&#151;namely that these were dormant accounts. If you thought that the accounts belonged to you or your grandmother or whoever, then you should write in because we would be able to check.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000096"></a>I notice from the banks&#146; briefing that two of the largest deposit takers have launched reunification exercises, while others are at an advanced planning stage. As I am coming a little late to this, I have not previously looked at the proposed legislation as closely as I might have. However, if two banks have launched reunification exercises, I am not aware of it, and I do not know whether many people in this room are aware of it. There is an overwhelming case for adopting a similar approach to the one we adopted on the Claims Resolution Tribunal&#151;namely, to publish the names of the dormant accounts and the last known postcodes, inviting people to write in and apply if they think that an account is theirs or that it belonged to one of their relatives and they may be entitled to it. The individual cases can then be examined in the same way as the tribunal examined such claims. The scale of the operation would not be vastly different&#151;some &#163;250 million or so, and some &#163;100 million or so in relation to building societies.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000097"></a>We were dealing with similar amounts regarding the Swiss accounts. I never totted up how much I actually disbursed, but it was certainly tens of millions of pounds and it may have even been hundreds of millions. Therefore, such an exercise can be carried out  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>successfully, and it would be the right approach for us to adopt. I was concerned with the Holocaust accounts, but a great many others were nothing to do with the Holocaust and were accounts that had simply gone dormant. Very often a person died and did not tell their heirs or relatives of the account. Indeed, in some remarkable cases, having given the family everything else, a person had not mentioned that they were hanging on to a dormant account, for whatever reason. It is interesting, perhaps, to speculate on that.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000098"></a>This is a positive amendment and it would be helpful to incorporate it in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what present arrangements are being made, but it is not my impression that a great deal is being done at the moment. It is essential to hit a balance between the banks and potential beneficiaries and I would like to consider whether those who have tragically suffered regarding their pensions in the past 10 years should be recipients, rather than charities, and whether this is the right approach. I hope that this amendment is a constructive suggestion.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000099"></a>Other questions arise, and one that I hate to raise relates to safe deposit boxes. Many safe deposit boxes may contain very large sums. Again, I say from my own experience that all kinds of different things turn up once you start to open up safe deposit boxes. In one instance, it was believed that the box contained a magical jewel that would allow a certain sect to, if not rule the world, be a lot better off.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000100"></a>This amendment is a constructive suggestion and I hope that we have a positive response from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps he could help the Committee with one question. When he did his work in Switzerland, how was the duty of confidentiality reconciled with publishing names and other personal details? That is one of the issues that has been raised as a reason not to advertise particular details. If that can be overcome, it is a very powerful tool to enable reuniting to occur.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000102"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121041000427"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> It did not seem to us a particular problem at the time. I suppose that if you use just the name then it does not really breach confidentiality, because it could be anyone. If you put in the postcode, what is the confidence that one is breaking? We did not find it a problem, and I do not remember anyone ever raising the issue or asking whether it was wrong. Certainly, none of the newspapers concerned raised the point. I have here the <I>Times</I> of 23 July, which the Library very kindly dug out. The <I>Times</I> and other major newspapers were involved, and we covered the whole range of tabloids, and none of them seemed to feel that there was any problem with this at all. If the Minister has a legal angle on this, he should by all means tell us about it&#151;but we were not aware of the problem.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>properly be&#151;namely, with the people whose accounts they are, or their heirs and successors. The amendment would be one way in which to begin to improve the proportion of people who reclaim their own assets. My query is whether it goes far enough. We have tabled our own amendment, Amendment No. 24, which seeks to do something slightly more comprehensive. One problem is that if heirs are unaware that there may be such a dormant account, having to trawl around a number of banks and building societies to find it is quite a business. How you do that is also a challenge. I do not think that for the clearing banks and big building societies you could do it by advertising in the newspapers because that would involve too many names. Using the internet would mean that you would not need a paper-based approach. Our approach is a slightly different one but would achieve the same aim as this amendment, and I shall be interested to hear how the Minister responds.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000104"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121041000429"></a>Lord Monson:</b> Although I understand and to a considerable extent sympathise with the argument put by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, if it is the case that the holders of dormant accounts will genuinely be no worse off when the balance has been transferred to a reclaim fund than they would have been if it had not been so transferred, are we really justified in imposing such burdens on banks and building societies? The larger banks and building societies could afford it, but for the smaller building societies to have to take up quarter-page advertisements in the whole national and much of the regional press is asking too much. I should be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on that.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000105"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121041000430"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The whole Committee is at one on the objective, which is as far as possible to reunite people with their rightful resources, so I very much welcome the motivation behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000106"></a>I shall be increasingly embarrassed in this Committee if the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, continues to put forward my arguments for me, as she will render me redundant somewhat before my time. However, our concern is exactly as she articulated&#151;namely, that the banks and building societies are concerned about confidentiality and identity fraud. Let us remember that under the amendment they would be writing after 15 years to an address which may or may not be correct. They would not know the recipient, otherwise they would be able to solve the problem of the dormant account. There are real anxieties on this score.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000107"></a>I hear what the noble Lord said about newspaper advertisements. Being costly, that may not be practicable for the smaller building society, but it beggars belief that we would expect the major banks to produce advertisements which would make sense to anyone. The process would therefore presumably involve a letter to an address, with all the risks that that would carry.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000108"></a>I emphasise that the banks and building societies are all too well aware that this legislation raises the question of how diligent and efficacious they are in seeking to ensure that dormant accounts are kept to  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an absolute minimum as they are not their property but the property of customers. Banks have a practice of pursuing dormant accounts. They have a clear definition of when an account becomes dormant in terms of a lack of activity in the account and they seek to reduce the number of such accounts.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000109"></a>All banks recognise that, when they signed up to the agreement which underpins this legislation, effectively they were throwing a searchlight on the whole process of dormant accounts. In doing that, it behoved them to address more vigorously whether they were guaranteeing that they had made strenuous efforts to reunite owners with their resources. They made it pretty clear on 8 November that they intended to make additional efforts in this field. A one-stop shop is being established for customers searching for their lost accounts. It will be launched in January and will enable people to initiate a free search covering banks, building societies and, in this respect, National Savings &amp; Investments via a single application.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000110"></a>In addition, a great deal of publicity and activity will attend the development of this legislation. After all, a lot of institutions will be potential beneficiaries. The banks and building societies have entered into the agreement in the full knowledge that more effort will now be necessary to reunite owners with their money and there will be vigorous activity in that regard. The <I>B</I><I>anking </I><I>C</I><I>ode</I> will also identify progress on these issues. Therefore, there will be public recognition of the success of the work done in regard to dormant accounts in terms of both what it facilitates for other institutions and the effort that the banks make to ensure that these accounts are kept to a minimum. The customer is, after all, their main responsibility.</p>

They are the real villains of the piece here but they make absolutely no effort to reunite with their money those who are entitled to dividends and, in some cases, capital sums following reorganisations or takeovers. People change addresses and there must be hundreds and thousands of unclaimed assets knocking about but the registrars do nothing about it.</p>

On the one-stop shop argument, it is a question whether someone&#146;s children or heirs know to go to the one-stop shop. Unless they have some positive indication that the account exists, I do not really see why they should. Whether it should be one shop, in the sense that it is not individual banks that should seek to discover the owners of the assets, or whether it should be done collectively, is something that is worth considering. In that context, given the point made by the noble Lord about the position of small building societies, it may be that they should get together in seeking the rightful owners.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000113"></a>I do not get the impression at the moment that this problem is being tackled sufficiently proactively. If I understand it correctly, these building societies and so on are not being proactive but are sitting and waiting  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the owners to come along and say that they have their account. There is a big difference between those two things. The attitude that we took was that we wanted to find these people. I do not really get the impression that that is what is happening, although I may be doing them an injustice.</p>

They are very regional; there is no point in a small building society in Cumbria getting together with a small building society in the depths of Kent and then another one from Norwich getting involved. That is a hopeless situation. We should leave the individual building societies to find their own people.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000115"></a>Those building societies are being proactive, in fact. Earlier last week I had a session with Nationwide and asked people there specifically how many dormant accounts there were&#151;the answer was 25,000&#151;and how long they had been trying to find the people whose accounts they were, to which the answer was &#147;years&#148;. They are still very active in trying to find them.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000116"></a>Finally, the vast majority of those dormant accounts are absolutely tiny. Of course, some are bigger. I can speak only for the mutual movement, but it is trying and has tried very hard to find the owners of those dormant accounts.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000117"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07121041000434"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> My noble friend has come precisely to the points that I was going to make. With regard to the smaller accounts, it could well be that the local or regional press is a better way in which to pursue this aim. Furthermore, there is presumably already some idea of the minimum amount; I presume that the banks are not chasing people with 50p in their account. Perhaps the Minister could let us know whether it is envisaged not to intend to find smallish accounts.</p>

It is the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, so he does the replying. However, I shall comment on one point that he emphasised very strongly&#151;that there is no evidence of the banks or building societies upping their game on this issue. As agreement has been reached on this legislation and as the legislation proceeds, a searchlight has been thrown on their activities&#151;and they are all too well aware of that. On 8 November, they said that they would take further steps on notification. One dimension is the concept of the one-stop shop in January. Halifax and Nationwide have already indicated that they are engaging in much more strenuous activity than they have in the past. So the noble Lord may be a little unfair in saying that there is no sign of the necessary response and urgency about this. What would be contended by the Government and certainly the industry is that they are all too well aware of the fact that they cannot see this legislation go through without making very strenuous efforts to reunite the owners of the property&#151;that is, their accounts&#151;with that property.</p>

I find it difficult to believe that British banks are more worried about confidentiality than are Swiss banks, which had no problem with this.

It may be that the consideration is not particularly relevant, but at all events we need to be clear on the position. With the Swiss situation, we had to set up a most distinguished group of economists to distinguish what the interest rate would have been over that period of 70 years. At some periods it was incredibly low and not really significant. But we ought to be clear whether these accounts will include interest, as the interest will not have been paid in the period during which the account has been dormant, although it may have been&#151;and I presume normally would have been&#151;added to the accounts as they rolled along. Can the Minister enlighten us on what the various banks do? Do they tot up the interest on a dormant account or do they wait until the account is finally claimed and then add it on?

<p><a name="07121041000130"></a>At Second Reading, I and at least one noble Lord on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Newby&#151;raised the question of what interest would accumulate on sums transferred into a reclaim fund. That is an important matter that is not set out clearly in the Bill, and it is fair to say that we did not get a very clear answer; indeed, I am not at all sure that we got an answer at all. I had not at that point read the Explanatory Notes, which are much more precise and specific on the question of interest and charges. However, the Explanatory Notes have no legal validity and do not form part of the Bill. If I have interpreted them correctly, it is the Government&#146;s commendable intention to see that account holders are no worse off&#151;and, conversely, no better off&#151;following a transfer into the reclaim fund, than they would have been if their account had remained open. That is by far the fairest option, albeit the most expensive to administer. I imagine, too, that the banks and building societies and not the taxpayer will pay for the administration. I hope that that can be confirmed.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000131"></a>Clause 8 as drafted is somewhat imprecise and ambiguous. I believe that Amendment No. 32 would go a long way to clarifying matters for all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000132"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0003.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="07121041000443"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, for Amendment No. 4, which makes clear that when a bank or building society transfers a dormant account to the reclaim fund under Clause 1, this includes any interest due. The amendment would ensure that when customers reclaim their money, they are repaid the interest due on their accounts. We agree that this is an important and vital principle. Dormant account holders should be repaid in full. The amendment is unnecessary&#151;and I believe that it is put forward in a probing way&#151;as we have taken separate steps to ensure that this will be the case.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000133"></a>Clause 8, which defines the term &#147;balance&#148;, is an important clause in the Bill. It explains that the amount a bank or building society will transfer into the scheme, and the amount a customer is entitled to be repaid, must be adjusted according to the terms of the original deposit to include any interest accrued or charges deducted.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, expressed surprise that Amendment No. 32 is grouped with Amendment No. 4. May I just say to him that that is nothing to do with us! The amendment seeks to clarify that the interest rate that will apply will be the contractual rate. This is unnecessary, as it is clear in relation to Clause 8 that the interest will be calculated in accordance with the contract between the individual and the bank. In particular, subsection (2) sets out that the interest rate that the customer will be repaid is the one that would have applied had the transfer not taken place. It is not therefore possible for any other interest rate to be applied, as subsection (2) prevents this. It will be individual financial institutions that will be responsible for calculating how much a customer is owed, including accrued interest, according to their records, and will make the payment on the reclaim fund&#146;s behalf accordingly. Customers will be repaid their balance, adjusted for interest according to the terms of the original contract.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000135"></a>If the bank were to make a mistake and transferred too little or too much to the reclaim fund, the institution would still be obliged to repay to the customer the full amount that they would have been owed under the terms of their contract. The banks and the reclaim fund are expected to adjust for overpayment or underpayment. If there is a dispute about the fairness of any charges deducted post-transfer, customers can now complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000136"></a>I hope that I have made the position crystal clear on the record as to what the Bill intends. If noble Lords want to raise any other matters on this issue, I am happy to answer them.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000137"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121041000444"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> How is this supposed to work? If a bank transfers &#163;100 from a dormant account to the reclaim fund and at some later stage someone establishes their entitlement to that account, and if the bank then says, &#147;Oh, it is &#163;120&#148;&#151; and tells the reclaim fund that it is &#163;120&#151;does the reclaim fund pay out &#163;120? Whether the extra is for accrued interest from the time the &#163;100 went over to the fund or some other amount, how will this work in practice? The reclaim fund will not have access to the information and therefore will not know whether that is the right amount. I am a little confused as to how this will work. I apologise for asking this basic question but it was not until the Minister started describing it that I thought, &#147;I am not sure I know how this works&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000138"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121041000445"></a>Lord Bach:</b> In part, the voluntary nature of this enterprise means that I cannot give the noble Baroness a direct answer as to how it will work. The relationship between the banks and building societies and the fund will be critical in how people are paid. Working out the interest will, of course, be a matter for the bank, and if the customer is not satisfied, he will be entitled to take the matter further. As I understand it, because the bank is likely to act as the agent for the fund, the bank will pay the customer and will reconcile matters with the reclaim fund through the agency arrangements. So it will be an agency arrangement between the bank and the reclaim fund, and that is how the right amount will be paid.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000139"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121041000446"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> So, in my example, the reclaim fund would have to pay the additional &#163;20 even though it had received only &#163;100 in the first instance, and that calculation is entirely in the hands of the banks. I think that is what the Minister is saying.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000140"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121041000447"></a>Lord Bach:</b> As I understand it, it is a responsibility of the banks.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000141"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121041000448"></a>Lord Newby:</b> This raises the question of how the reclaim fund invests the money. Potentially, it could be required to pay out significantly more than it receives&#151;for example, the five shillings and eleven pence of my noble friend Lord Shutt could be worth &#163;20 or &#163;30, whatever it is. Presumably the reclaim fund will have to invest its money to best effect for it to be capable of paying back to the banks any amounts that are required to be paid.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000142"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07121041000449"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I believe the noble Lord is right.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07121041000143"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121041000450"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> There is another issue here&#151;the rate of interest. The Committee will be aware that banks and building societies keep changing the style of their accounts. I have not heard of a brass account&#151;they usually talk about gold, silver and platinum and so on&#151;but if you do not watch it they say, &#147;This issue is now closed and has a reduced rate because we have now got the double gold account&#148;. If people ultimately turned up to claim their money, the dormancy position would perhaps be a code of conduct or a banking code issue.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000144"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121041000451"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It is certainly an issue. I repeat the basic principle that the customers will be repaid the amount they would have been repaid had their accounts not been transferred to the scheme; so they will get the interest. If a particular type of account has been withdrawn, which I think is what the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is referring to, the bank or building society will obviously need to determine what happened to equivalent non-dormant accounts which were not transferred into the scheme. If these had automatically moved on to some other terms, the interest on the transferred dormant account should be calculated in accordance with the new terms too.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000145"></a>The noble Lord looks sceptical about what I have said. I repeat that customers will have the right to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service, just as they have now, if they wish to dispute the fairness of the repayments. Ultimately&#151;we hope that it does not come to this&#151;customers will have recourse to the courts. That is why I said to the noble Baroness that it is impossible to say exactly how the scheme will work in every single case, but I hope that the principle is clear from what I have said.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000146"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised an important point. It is expected that the fund will manage money prudently. FSA regulation, too, will need to be taken into account, but the noble Lord is right that the claim fund may have to pay out more than it sometimes anticipates.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000147"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07121041000452"></a>Lord Monson:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will obviously decide what he wants to do about Amendment No. 4, but perhaps I may touch briefly on what the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said about my Amendment No. 32. If one reads Clause 8(2) very carefully, it is just about possible to make out what the Government intend. However, legislation should surely be intelligible to the reasonably literate man in the street. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, might consider having the clause redrafted so that it makes a little more sense. It would not do any harm to insert the word &#147;contractually&#148; after &#147;interest&#148; in Clause 8, simply as belt-and-braces extra clarification.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000148"></a>Will the noble Lord confirm that interest at the standard rate, which is currently 20 per cent, will be deducted from all the accumulated payments and paid over to the Treasury annually? I imagine that that is the case. What happens about higher-rate tax, which will be due in a few cases, I have no idea.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000149"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07121041000453"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I take seriously the noble Lord&#146;s point about the way in which the subsection is drafted. Perhaps we may look at that again.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000150"></a>I am waiting for an answer from my officials that confirms what the noble Lord presumed. He may have to wait a little longer. It is better to get it right than jump into an easy answer.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000151"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07121041000454"></a>Lord Hamilton of Epsom:</b> There are two points here. Bank deposits yield money gross, and building societies pay the tax. Is there not variation between the two?</p>

<p><a name="07121041000152"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07121041000455"></a>Lord Monson:</b> I think that the noble Lord is wrong. Interest is normally deducted at 20 per cent on ordinary deposits. On special, fixed-term deposits of very large sums&#151;let us say, &#163;50,000&#151;it can be paid gross.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000153"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07121041000456"></a>Lord Bach:</b> If the noble Lord will allow us, we will write to him with the correct answer to his previous question.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000154"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07121041000457"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> I am grateful to those who have contributed to this debate. It was what I would call an &#147;onion-peeling&#148; debate, in that more and more layers came off and questions that we had not thought of previously, even if we had sat down for 10 hours to look at the Bill, suddenly emerged.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000155"></a>I think I am right in saying that the situation is as follows. There is a dormant account on which interest will be paid, but one of two things can happen to it. It may simply be paid out to the owner, in which case I presume that interest either has been or will be added. I am a little more doubtful about fees. If the account has been dormant for 30 years, there will be little of it left if the fees that have accumulated in that period, in which nothing has happened, wipe out the whole account, which might have been quite large 30 years previously. We had that problem in Switzerland as well. Perhaps we should reconsider the fees aspect. In all events, that is the case where the money goes to the rightful owner.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000156"></a>Alternatively&#151;and this is a more difficult issue&#151;the account with interest up to that point goes to the fund. The problem is what happens then. Does interest continue to be added to it and, if so, at what rate? It would be jolly difficult for the fund to track back what interest was being paid by the bank and then apply that rate of interest. Does a charity, for example, eventually get what that interest would have been?</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000157"></a>Finally, there is the question of tax&#151;on which the noble Lord says he will write and I do not ask him to comment further today. A dormant account may hold a large amount&#151;say, &#163;0.5 million&#151;which has been there for 30 years and the interest will have piled up. Will the Revenue get its hands on that?</p>

<p><a name="07121041000158"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07121041000458"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Yes, probably.</p>

That is probably true, so we need to consider all these issues. The difficulty in this case is that the Minister is replying for the Government but, in a sense, is a proxy

Perhaps he could say at a later stage what the Government understand the position to be. That might be helpful if this matter turns out to be more complicated than we thought. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000162"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is the last that I shall be moving for some time. Throughout, the Bill uses the term &#147;customer&#148; of the bank. I am troubled because the customer may well be long dead and gone and no longer exist as far as this world is concerned, but the account is the property of one of his heirs. Therefore, I believe that it would improve the drafting if we used the word &#147;owner&#148; instead. I shall leave it there but I hope I have made the point. I beg to move</p>

In responding to the noble Lord, I have to resort to strict legal terms as to why &#147;customer&#148; rather than &#147;owner&#148; is used. Strictly speaking, the customer does not own the money in the account. The balance on an account is a debt that the bank owes to the customer. In other words, the customer owns a right to enforce the debt, as opposed to owning the asset. That is a strict legal definition and one does not know how much that would affect the position but, as I understand it, that is the main reason why the term &#147;customer&#148;, as opposed to &#147;owner&#148;, has been employed in the drafting of the Bill.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000165"></a>Of course, heirs can still claim money back if they prove their claim; in those circumstances, they become the customer. However, because of the strict legal position, we think that on balance it is better to leave the term &#147;customer&#148; in the Bill rather than change it to &#147;owner&#148;.</p>

The Minister said that he cannot use the word &#147;owner&#148; because it has a specific legal meaning, but this is simply a shorthand word being used in the Bill&#151;it does not carry any other implication. The Bill could have said &#147;a person (the monkey)&#148; holds the account, and we could have carried on using the word &#147;monkey&#148; throughout the Bill. It would have been offensive and we would not have done that, but there is no magic in the word &#147;customer&#148; and my noble friend&#146;s point is that &#147;customer&#148; does not reflect the relationship. It is not a good shorthand word to use throughout the Bill.</p>

He has just said that it is a debt but that point is not met by the use of the word &#147;customer&#148;. Customers may or may not have debts. I understand that he has an objection on those grounds to the word &#147;owner&#148;. It seems to me to be better than &#147;customer&#148; but perhaps it should be &#147;creditor or his heirs&#148;. I do not think that &#147;customer&#148; is right because the person owning the asset may not be, or ever have been, a customer of the bank concerned.</p>

<ul><a name="07121041000375"></a>&#147;building societies and smaller banks&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000346"></a>I am persuaded that it would be right to treat all building societies the same. The Bill treats 51 building societies in one way, and eight in another. At Second Reading, I referred to the position of a provincial but progressive building society with some national touches: the Skipton Building Society. Its resources would be deployed nationally in the main scheme and there would not be a local element. I was therefore concerned about the cliff edge, an issue to which I shall return.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000178"></a>There is a case for considering building societies as a whole. Eight building societies will be pushed into the main scheme but the bulk of them have local roots. Many of them have their own charitable activities and foundations. The Nationwide&#151;the biggest of them all&#151;has given out &#163;22 million over the past few years. Serious amounts of money are involved and the members have a say; they go to the annual meetings of building societies and take a view on what should happen</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000179"></a>There is a real case for &#147;mutuality&#148; meaning something and for the members having a real say. The Nationwide has its roots as a co-operative building society, with all that that means in terms of mutuality. Amendment No. 8 is about taking building societies out of the national scheme and entering them into the local scheme, or enabling them to operate nationally, with their own foundations which have been tried and tested. That is my first point.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000180"></a>Secondly, we should look at the national scheme and consider what is currently the cliff edge. At the moment, even a locally based society, such as the Skipton, would be in the national scheme. Perhaps we can deal with building societies, then consider the smaller banks and, indeed, banks as a whole. Some banks, such as the Halifax, started in the mutual movement. I restate the interests I declared at Second Reading so that they are on the record. The Halifax, which is now part of HBOS, has responsibilities in Halifax, Leeds, Birmingham and Scotland and it would be wrong if, because the bank is so big, those local communities did not benefit in the way that the smaller communities will benefit under the Bill. Similarly, other banks, such as Lloyds TSB, have their own serious and substantial foundations. I suggest that there should be a scheme whereby 10 per cent of the money can be either localised or put into the foundations or charities run by the respective banks.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000181"></a>The proposal&#151;this is important for the Government&#151;accepts that the Bill is basically about using the resources to enhance youth services and not about trying to include every favourite charity in the world. It accepts that that is the basis of the Bill but seeks to remove the cliff edge whereby only smaller communities can benefit locally. It seeks to include an opportunity for all communities to benefit, either locally or under the guidance of their own charitable foundations. I beg to move.</p>

I was a little mystified by the noble Lord&#146;s introduction to Amendment No. 8. It seemed to me that it was another compulsion amendment, like Amendment No. 2 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and that this was not just a question of what options we gave larger building societies and banks in terms of falling within the alternative scheme in Clause 2. That is why I shall reserve my comments for the two groups of amendments that follow this one.</p>

We have tailored the Bill to meet the needs not only of the large institutions but also those of smaller banks and building societies. He made excellent points about the role which some building societies play in their local communities, and we want to foster and encourage that.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000184"></a>However, we are talking about five or six building societies under the definition to which we are working. When we consulted on where the line should be drawn, assets of &#163;7 billion received broad support, reflecting a consensus on the scheme and providing a specific option for the smaller institution. I understand that the noble Lord is saying, &#147;Well, that&#146;s fine for the smaller institutions. You have safeguarded their role, identified exactly the position for them and it is light touch. But I&#146;d like the big boys, with resources vastly in excess of &#163;7 billion, to enjoy the same role in localities&#148;. That threatens the concept of the scheme.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000185"></a>We are seeking a light-touch approach and not heavy regulation. The moment we brought within the framework some concept of a local dimension to very large institutions, we would need much greater specification from both the institutions and the scheme&#146;s reclaim fund. Within that framework, we would have to have the machinery to look at the way in which resources would be utilised. The scheme&#146;s light-touch approach is designed for small financial institutions. It is appropriate that it applies to banks and building societies within that framework. The light touch will not work for the large institutions if they are able to concentrate significant resources in the local way the noble Lord has identified.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000186"></a>I understand what the noble Lord said. After all, all building societies were small once. The Halifax, one of the largest of them all, started off small and has, I understand, local connections and loyalties. However, in creating the reclaim fund, we could either have gone for a scheme where everything was distributed on a national basis, with the Big Lottery Fund distributing resources to areas where they are beneficial; or we could have recognised the significant role which small building societies play in their community. We recognised that role and we have made specific arrangements for it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000187"></a>The Bill would have looked very different if we had not made that division. The division is agreed with the industry. The noble Lord is arguing about only eight building societies. We maintain that the dual scheme meets need and enables us to keep regulation to the absolute minimum. On that basis, I defend what is in the Bill while recognising the arguments of the noble Lord about the history of all building societies in their localities. However, eight of them at least are large enough to produce a different dimension from the local institutions for which we are seeking to provide a particular relationship. I hope that, on that basis, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

That is 0.0005 of 1 per cent of the asset base. That means that if the largest of the smaller societies was able to use these funds locally, a sum of &#163;3 million would be available for its communities. However, the Skipton would generate &#163;4.5 million, which would not be used locally but nationally. The issue at stake here is the comparison between communities with small building societies and communities with slightly larger ones. That is why I mentioned the cliff edge.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000189"></a>This concerns the eight societies to which the Minister referred, the banks and the bigger financial institutions. There should be an element included in the Bill allowing them to honour their local connections and contributions over the years. That is why I have put in the figure of 10 per cent. It is simple; it does not complicate anything; it widens things; and it treats communities up and down the country on a much more even keel.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000196"></a>The noble Baroness said: I was not expecting the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, to approach his amendment in the way that he did. As I explained earlier, I thought he was talking about compulsion, which is the way in which Amendment No. 8 is drafted. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I deal with the next two groups together because they cover similar issues.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000197"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 13 and our opposition to Clause 9 standing part of the Bill are designed to take out limits from the Bill so that all banks and all building societies have the option of entering the alternative scheme in Clause 2. This is distinct from the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, spoke, where he suggested that the larger banks could perhaps put 10 per cent of their reclaim money through the Clause 2 scheme. I suggest that they should have the option of putting the whole amount through if they want to do so. The amendments would achieve this.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000198"></a>The Government&#146;s defence of segregating banks and building societies is that they believe the larger financial institutions should go into the main scheme so that the money goes via the Big Lottery Fund, as the Minister said. In fact, in their summary of responses they said it was more appropriate given the wider outlook of the larger financial institutions. What they mean by &#147;wider outlook&#148; is that the larger financial institutions want the Government to decide where their money goes, in this case to the Big Lottery Fund. This ignores the fact that large financial institutions can have clear relationships with the communities in  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which they operate. All large financial institutions have branch networks and strong community bases even though they are not confined to one particular community. The Clause 2 scheme is not restricted to communities; it can also apply to charities with which the banks or building societies consider they have a special connection. One can think of a lot of large institutions that have a special connection with particular charities that they have built up over a long period of time. Some banks, such as Northern Rock, have their own foundations, rather like building societies&#151;Northern Rock was a building society. Clear mechanisms that allow the money to be spent do exist.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000199"></a>My first group of amendments asks why large financial institutions cannot reflect the fact that they have branches throughout the land and well established connections with specific charities. They fit fully within the concept of Clause 2 and would direct the money to causes that they would have thought about carefully, and that would be aligned with things that they want to achieve. Why is that worse than transferring money via the Big Lottery Fund? There is a sense in which the Minister was saying earlier that somehow the Government now own the money that comes from the larger financial institutions; they can spend it on things that they want it spent on and can ignore the wishes of others. </p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000200"></a>Amendments Nos. 10, 14, 17 and 18 form the next group. They have been pressed on us by Nationwide, the largest building society in the world, which has spoken to a number of Peers and has been very active in presenting its case. The Minister said earlier that there was a consensus that small building societies should have the alternative provisions. That is probably the consensus among building because there are more smaller building societies than large ones. There are only eight above the &#163;7 billion threshold and 50-odd below it so there will be a natural consensus within the building society community, but that does not make it right that large building societies should be deprived of joining the alternative scheme in Clause 2.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000201"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, has already explained, Nationwide has a foundation that has existed for a long period of time. It has committed to putting a certain amount of its profits into it every year and that has been approved by its members in general meeting. It is very committed to that foundation, and wants the ability to put further resources into it. I am struggling to see why the Minister goes against good voluntarism closely associated with causes and projects that have clearly had a lot of thought put into them, and instead goes for the big black hole of the Big Lottery Fund. I am sure that good will come out of it, but it has less immediacy. It is always difficult to draw dividing lines. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, raised the case of the Skipton Building Society. It is local and not that much above the &#163;7 billion threshold compared with some of the larger building societies.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000202"></a>I have another concern about the Government&#146;s approach that smaller building societies can have the alternative scheme. That will skew money into certain communities, because I suspect that most of the smaller building societies are not based in conurbations such  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as London. From a quick look at the list, I could see only one building society that had a connection with London. That means that Londoners will be deprived of targeted money, although they have branches of banks and building societies everywhere. That seems unfair.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000203"></a>My first group of amendments suggests that we should allow all financial institutions the choice of whether to go into the alternative scheme in Clause 2. If that is not acceptable to the Government, they should at least allow building societies, with their mutuality and their close connection with their members and their communities, to support the schemes that they have so successfully developed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000204"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121041000475"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I rise to support the noble Baroness. In relation to Amendment No. 13, I do not think that any of us has had a chance to check with every building society. However, it is conceivable that there will be a small building society that does not want to take on the job of dealing with its lost or closed accounts but will prefer to hand it over to the Big Lottery Fund because the administration involved will be just too much for it. Therefore, I think that that option should be kept open.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000205"></a>The key point, if I may say so, is that the Minister needs to understand the difference between the building society movement and high street banks. The difference is one of mutuality. My noble friend on the Front Bench tends to wince when I talk about mutuality but that is the fundamental difference. The members of a building society own the building society and the whole thrust of the organisation is to meet the members&#146; needs. There are no shareholders, no outside bodies can hold influence and the building society cannot be taken over, so it is a very different animal. Therefore, the threshold of &#163;7 billion is wrong and unrealistic. Ultimately, the members will benefit and in many cases they have already set up charities within the building society.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000206"></a>The Minister talks about a light touch. At the moment, control over where the money goes lies with the Charity Commission and, frankly, no one else has to get involved. The Charity Commission is charged with looking at whether the trustees of a charity are appropriate persons. One has only to look at the breadth of experience of the Nationwide&#146;s trustees to see that they are.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000207"></a>I asked the Nationwide, as I was able to get hold of it quickly, what sort of awards are given. An awful lot of them are around &#163;5,000 and they are all over the place; for example, &#163;5,000 for the Newtownabbey CAB and &#163;3,737 for North Wales Victim Support. Also listed is the Benefit Advice Shop in Rhyl, Wales&#151;and the list goes on and on. Why are the awards so small and why are they so regionalised? It is, as the noble Lord said at the beginning, because they basically started from the co-operative movement and they have a footprint in the local community which they have developed, in some cases, over centuries.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000208"></a>It irks a building society to hear that money that has lain in a dormant account will be transferred to the Big Lottery Fund, over which it has absolutely no influence. The members do not want that and I think  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Government should listen to them. The key point is that there is a big difference between a mutual society and a mainstream, high street bank. The amount of money involved is substantial: I think that the figure of &#163;22 million has already been mentioned in relation to one society over the past 10 years. We should also look at the quality of what has been done. Who won the Charity Awards 2006? It was a building society&#151;the Nationwide.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000209"></a>I repeat that there are good, solid trustee boards. If the Government really believe in a light-touch framework, they will recognise that the mutual movement is different from the joint stock bank movement. There is already a track record there and there should not be a differentiation of an arbitrary figure of &#163;7 billion.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000210"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121041000476"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I do not want to repeat the eloquent speeches that noble Lords have already made on Amendment No. 10 and the other amendments in that group; I simply rise to support them. The key is that there are differences, of the nature that the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has just explained, between a bank and a building society. One of the key differences is the link with the local community. Bar the Nationwide, the eight building societies that we are talking about still have a very local or regional base. I gather that, in addition to the Nationwide, the Britannia, Chelsea and Skipton Building Societies support the amendment. Those three have very clear local or regional bases. That is very different from virtually all the banks; it is certainly completely different from banks which may have just one branch&#151;it may be a foreign bank&#151;in the City of London, which I presume would be included in the scheme. The nature of building societies is different. They are in many ways admirable institutions. Many of us, I think, wish that there were rather more of them, and we might not have some of the current problems that we have with our banks. However, be that as it may, they do admirable work. It is in the interests of the public that we support them when we can. This is a way of strengthening the building societies. Therefore, I hope that the Government will treat the amendment sympathetically.</p>

My own experience would suggest that that is not the case. They are involved in local charitable concerns, and many of them delegate powers to branches to support different activities. It may require a clearance procedure, but, nevertheless, the money comes from the banks&#146; charitable arms into the charity sector. Removing the word &#147;smaller&#148; from Clause 2(4)(b), and therefore making it a voluntary scheme, whereby everybody who joined it could opt for the alternative scheme, would be a very good option. That would be the lightest-touch of all the options in the Bill, because the charities, as my noble friend Lady Noakes said, are regulated by the Charity Commission and have to

If they are lucky enough to receive extra money from dormant accounts, they just put in place exactly the same procedures as they already have, whereas, as has already been said by the Minister, the Big Lottery Fund has to create a whole new, ring-fenced system, which has to keep any assets that come to it separate from its lottery assets and enter a series of complicated agreements. Banks and building societies, if they are in the alternative scheme, will make sure that they do not forget Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The simplest way in which to deal with the matter is to leave the scheme voluntary, keep it as light-touch as possible and, as we move on to the next group of amendments, recognise that the building societies have now, whatever they are thought to have said at the beginning, decided that they would like to be in the alternative, and not the general, scheme.</p>

We are to a certain extent straining over relatively minor features of the Bill. All the smaller institutions, if they want to, can participate in the nationwide scheme, so there is no restriction on them. The scheme is designed to facilitate their possible contribution to local communities, in recognition of the role that they want to play there, but they may prefer the other option. We are not talking about the small institutions in these terms; we are talking about the large ones. With regard to the large ones, the idea that they could not participate in their local communities is a little strange. One obvious objective of the national fund is financial literacy. Is it conceivable that a building society cannot bid successfully to the distributor, which will be the Big Lottery Fund, for the opportunity to provide financial literacy locally? Who is likely to compete against it and do better? There will be competitors, of course, and the Big Lottery Fund is used to competition of that kind. The idea that because large building societies are within the framework of the national objectives of the scheme they will have no relationship with the locality, apart from their present independent schemes, is based upon a misunderstanding of the Bill.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000213"></a>We are not talking about lottery funds. It will not do for noble Lords to give the impression that these resources now flow to the lottery. They do not flow to the lottery; they have nothing to do with it. The Big Lottery Fund is merely responsible for distribution. The only reason why it is in the frame as far the legislation is concerned&#151;legislation that has been welcomed by those who are participating voluntarily in this scheme&#151;is because it is a recognised distributor with the regional and local centres and the powerful position in each of the nations of the United Kingdom to do its job well. It is acting as an agent for this scheme, and one should not confuse the lottery with the distribution of these resources. I must insist&#151;as far as I am able&#151;that we draw a clear boundary between any criticisms we may have. I recognise that criticism is not infrequently in the air about certain aspects of the National Lottery, although I have never met anyone in this country who thinks it has been a bad idea and for every person who has voiced criticism, I have met many more who have identified what it has

We are not arguing about the National Lottery. This part of the lottery is merely the distributor. In that sense, it is entirely neutral with regard to the allocation of the assets and will play its role within that framework. That is why the big banks and building societies signed up to this scheme and are happy with it.</p>

I assure the Minister that the big building societies are not happy with this scheme. I cannot put it more plainly. I would be grateful if the Minister would address the point about the difference between mutual financial organisations and high street banks. That difference is the primary reason for some of the unhappiness about at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000216"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121041000481"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I hope I paid due regard to the role of building societies, whatever their size, with regard to local communities, particularly those in which they originated. I have already made that comment. I am not gainsaying the value of that. I was going on to emphasise that they play their role through their own structures. I recognise the letter from Nationwide and the role it plays. It already has structures through which it can fulfil a great many of its objectives in those terms. With the national scheme, it has the opportunity to play its part at a local level. It is not denied the local-level position but it applies to a different distributor for that role. As I indicated, a large number of the overall priorities of the national scheme will accord well with what the building societies want to achieve&#151;particularly the development of financial literacy&#151;so it will be recognised that we think that the big mutuals will play their part at a local as well as a national level. I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s point about the derivation of the institutions, but all banks were local once and the big banks, too, can play their part in localities through this framework if they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000217"></a>I recognise that there are reservations and representations from some quarters but broadly the financial institutions will willingly participate in the scheme. It is a scheme that embraces two concepts, one of which is the local, for which we have made particular provision. I recognise the point that the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, made: any figure that we put in will have an arbitrary quality, and &#163;7 billion is an arbitrary figure for small as opposed to large financial institutions. However, there are clearly three priorities to be achieved through the structure of the scheme, and the large institutions are well placed to play their part in its development in those terms.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000218"></a>I think that this is the last that I have heard of this representation. I am pretty sure that, once again, the noble Baroness will emphasise that she may be withdrawing the amendment for now but there is still trouble to come. However, the trouble is &#147;sufficient unto the day&#148; for the moment, and I hope that she will withdraw her amendment.</p>

I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. My noble friend Lord Naseby referred to the fact that normally I express myself as an extreme sceptic on the benefits of mutuals, as opposed to any other form of commercial organisation. To that extent, I agree with my noble friend Lord Eccles, but there is not necessarily a distinction between banks and building societies to this extent. If large banks wished to take part in the alternative scheme, I would want to support them, but even the banks that used to be building societies have not been knocking at our door to say that they should be able to do so. However, it is clear that the larger building societies, led by the Nationwide, wish to have more flexibility in how they approach the use of dormant account money on their books.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000220"></a>The Minister said that these building societies can go to the Big Lottery Fund. It is a ludicrous argument that has the building societies paying the money to the reclaim fund, which pays the money to the Big Lottery Fund, which then, if it feels like it, might hand it back. That is such a nonsensical argument that it is barely worth responding to it, other than to note that it is ludicrous.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000221"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07121041000483"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I hesitate to intervene in my noble friend&#146;s comments. I do not know whether the Minister has ever seen the form that you have to fill in for either the regional lottery or any of the big lotteries but it is horrendous. However, all the charities in existence have already organised a scheme and they know what they are doing. Frankly, the prospect of filling out one of those forms is absolutely horrendous.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000222"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07121041000484"></a>Lord Newby:</b> Does the noble Baroness also accept that the Nationwide&#146;s priorities over the period to 2010 are domestic violence, prisoners&#146; families and young offenders? As we understand it, those are not subjects on which the Government intend the youth strand of this fund to concentrate.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000223"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07121041000485"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank both noble Lords. I agree with everything that has been said and, in particular, the bureaucracy aspect that my noble friend Lord Naseby pointed out. It is nonsense to pass money through several organisations and to pick up several layers of bureaucracy en route. I shall return in a later amendment to the subject of several layers of bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000224"></a>The Minister urged us not to confuse the Big Lottery Fund, as a distributor, with the lottery. For the record, we insist that there is a major connection; the reason why the dormant account money is being put through the Big Lottery Fund is to conceal the fact that large amounts of money that would otherwise be available for good causes through the lottery distributors has been stolen for the Olympics. By funnelling this money through the fund, the Government will be able to give the appearance of large sums of money going through the lottery distributors when in fact it is coming from the dormant accounts. We will not forget that throughout the whole of our consideration of the Bill and when we consider the Big Lottery Fund itself.</p>

</ul>
<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000229"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment has been suggested to us by the Law Society of Scotland, which, as I am sure the Minister is aware, often produces careful and well thought-out amendments, which I am always happy to table in Committee for the purposes of discussion.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000230"></a>The intent of Clause 2 is that the small bank or building society should transfer its dormant account money to its own pet charity, but that it should reach an agreement with the reclaim fund to transfer some money to that fund to meet possible repayment claims. There is no problem with that.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000231"></a>The Law Society of Scotland believes there is some ambiguity about the use of the term &#147;balance&#148; in subsection (2)(b). Because the balance on the dormant account is being split into two destinations, the references in subsection (2) could mean the balance transferred to the reclaim fund or the balance transferred to the charity. The amendment is designed to make it clear that what is intended on a repayment is the whole balance, calculated before any transfers were made elsewhere. I hope the Minister shares the Law Society of Scotland&#146;s desire for clarity, and I beg to move.</p>

I share her high opinion of the Law Society of Scotland, having met it a number of times. As I said in reply to an earlier group of amendments, though, we rely on how Clause 8 defines &#147;balance&#148;. We have already had a discussion about whether Clause 8 deals with the issue of interest in particular. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, reprimanded me for&#151;he did not describe it in these terms, but it is what he meant&#151;the opaque language of Clause 8(2) and wondered whether we could do better. The answer to the noble Baroness&#146;s question is to be found in the definitions in Clause 8.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000236"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment. Under Clause 2, in the alternative scheme the amount available to be transferred to charities by the smaller bank or building society is the amount that is left after paying an agreed proportion to the reclaim fund. That seems reasonable because the reclaim fund will have to meet any repayments. In Clause 2(3) we are told that the agreed proportion must take account of the need for the reclaim fund to have enough money to meet repayment claims. My amendment is a small one: it inserts the word &#147;only&#148; into that formulation so that the reclaim fund can take only amounts needed for repayment and not for anything else.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000237"></a>This is the first time we have encountered the issue of the finances of the reclaim fund. I hope the Minister will be able to explain how much it is anticipated will be withheld by the reclaim funds before it is decided how much a smaller bank or building society can transfer to its charities, or indeed how much the reclaim fund has to hold back before it distributes money. None of the papers I have seen thus far has given any information about how this holding-back of money will work in practice.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000238"></a>Will the banks and building societies under Clause 2 be involved in setting the percentages or will they be told by the reclaim fund how much the fund wants? Will the Treasury be involved in that, or will it be left entirely to the fund and/or the banks and building societies? While we are dealing with Clause 2 schemes, is it anticipated that there will be a flat rate for all transfers, or will it be institution-specific or dormant account-specific? If it is the latter, which is arguably the most accurate, we are talking about significantly detailed calculations being involved.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000239"></a>We touched on the Financial Services Authority earlier. It will supervise the payment of customer claims because the Government intend to specify that as a regulated activity. Does that mean that the authority will get involved in the policies adopted by the reclaim fund, either for the amounts taken from those involved in the Clause 2 scheme or from the amounts that it holds back within the fund and does not pay over to the Big Lottery Fund? That raises the question of whether the Financial Services Authority has any competence in this area and how transparent its involvement might be.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000240"></a>The amendment arises in the specific context of the alternative scheme in Clause 2, but the principle&#151;that of the money that is set aside to meet repayment claims&#151;has a wide application throughout the rest of the Bill. I hope the Minister will be able to answer questions on that basis as well. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000241"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121041000490"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The reclaim fund is a company run by the private sector and regulated by the FSA. We expect it to act reasonably and manage its affairs responsibly. Its directors will have a duty to act in accordance with company objects and articles of association, particularly those objects that are defined by this legislation. In order to obtain FSA authorisation, the fund must satisfy the &#147;fit and proper person&#148; test that forms part of the threshold conditions for authorisation under the Financial Services and Markets Act.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000242"></a>I emphasise that the scheme will be highly transparent. The reclaim fund will prepare audited annual accounts. In addition, its articles will require it to publish detailed figures on the flows of money into and out of the scheme. If we believe that a reclaim fund has not managed its assets appropriately, we have powers under the legislation to take action. The Treasury would be able to direct the reclaim fund to comply with its company objects or any of its articles required by Schedule 1. If it did not comply with such a direction, the Government would be able to take action in court to ensure that that was rectified.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000243"></a>The reclaim fund will have costs. An aspect of its necessary expenditure will be the costs involved in administration. It is reasonable that the income from dormant accounts covers the fund&#146;s running costs, but those will need to be subject to public analysis through the transparent structure we are putting in place.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000244"></a>I am grateful that the noble Baroness has said that this is a probing amendment. I hope that I have met the most precise of her probes. I have no doubt I will have an opportunity at a later stage to deal with any that I have not answered.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000245"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121041000491"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> The Minister might even have an opportunity now. He has answered one specific point covered by the amendment: the reclaim fund will claim not only money set aside to meet repayments but also money set aside to meet other costs. That will raise concerns in building societies, which will be wary of the amounts that will be held back from them, diverted away from their local charities, with which they have special relationships, and going into this more amorphous body, the reclaim fund, which they will probably have nothing to do with.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000246"></a>I asked the Minister specifically whether the Financial Services Authority will be getting involved in the way that the reclaim fund sets its policies for holding money back or indeed taking money from the Clause 2 schemes. I do not think he answered that.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000247"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121041000492"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I indicated that the company that is established will be subject to financial services regulations. It will have to meet the objectives that this legislation lays down for it.</p>

Just to say that something is regulated does not mean that an aspect of its activities is regulated. As I understand it, the Treasury has said that the making of repayment claims would be a regulated activity. I am not sure how far that takes the FSA into the financial policies of the reclaim fund. It is important to establish that.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000249"></a>I want to link that to something else the Minister said about the Treasury having the ability, if things were not going right, to tell the reclaim fund to comply with its articles. It has the direction power, which we will be coming on to later. I was wondering how the Treasury knows about that&#151;as well as what competence it has&#151;and how it gets into questions of that nature. The Minister was keen to say that the reclaim fund will be a private sector body, and I am

<p><a name="07121041000250"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121041000494"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> I shall try to help here. There are three jobs for the reclaim fund. First, it has to keep proper records. Secondly, it has to invest any money it receives. The third and main aspect, though, is judgment. The fund has to judge how much it dares to give to charitable purposes, whether a local or a national scheme, and how much it holds back. Then, having held back that amount, it has to exercise more judgment on a later occasion about how much more of that sum it should hold. With regard to the word &#147;only&#148;, what else does the fund need to spend money on? That is what the noble Baroness is asking.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000251"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07121041000495"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As I have indicated, the fund has running costs. That is all I was prepared to vouchsafe as a contributory answer to the question. I hope it meets the noble Lord&#146;s anxieties, but it will not meet the noble Baroness&#146;s as she wants some precision on the calculations. She will have to show a little patience on that. I have indicated that the Financial Services Authority will authorise a reclaim fund and will consult on the rules that should govern it, but it is a little early for any precision about how that structure will develop. I have already indicated that there is much work to be done on that. However, the structures are in place to guarantee public accountability.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000252"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121041000496"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, who is right that it is a question of judgment. The judgment of the reclaim fund will be set against the judgment of others, like the smaller banks and building societies that do not want so much kept back, or it might be the judgment of the Treasury and/or the Financial Services Authority. The latter might incline to greater prudence in holding money back, while the Treasury might be keen on more money flowing through to the Big Lottery Fund. I was trying to tease out who will actually make those decisions. I accept that precise percentages cannot be given today but, based on what the Minister has said, I am not much clearer about the actual process for determining them.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000253"></a>The Minister said that much work remains to be done. I hope we do not hear that throughout Committee. The scheme has been a long time in gestation, and to be told that much work still needs to be done is not a satisfactory response. I will let it go this one time, but I hope it does not become a constant refrain from the other side of the Committee. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000264"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 45. I said at the beginning of our session that we thought the Bill was too narrowly drawn in relation to the purposes to which the money gathered under the dormant accounts scheme could be put. The amendment is intended to widen the way in which the money can be used on a national basis.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000265"></a>Amendment No. 19 would insert some additional words into Clause 5(1)(c) so that a reclaim fund could transfer money either to the pension protection lifeboat fund set up by my Amendment No. 45 or to the Big Lottery Fund. The amendment itself does not create an obligation on the reclaim fund to transfer money to the lifeboat fund, but there is a Treasury power of direction in Clause 5(4) that would allow the Treasury to direct a reclaim fund to give effect to a specified object. Transferring money to the lifeboat fund would be one of the reclaim fund&#146;s objects.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000266"></a>Amendment No. 45 would insert a new clause after Clause 10 setting up the pension protection lifeboat fund. Noble Lords who followed the passage of the Pension Bill in our last Session will recognise the drafting of that amendment. It draws very heavily on the amendment which was passed by your Lordships&#146; House during the passage of that Bill but overturned in another place before the Bill became an Act.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000267"></a>The lifeboat fund is designed to ensure that those unfortunate individuals who lost their pension entitlements prior to the setting up of the Pension Protection Fund get pension payments at the same level as those who qualify for payments from the Pension Protection Fund. I shall not recite the whole messy history here. The Parliamentary Ombudsman has said that the Government should provide compensation to those who lost their pensions. The Government have refused to do that and have instead introduced a financial assistance scheme that gives some additional pension payments but certainly not at the level that would be paid under the Pension Protection Fund.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000268"></a>The amendment does not address the many concerns that there are about the efficiency of the financial assistance scheme in delivering additional pension payments but it does help to address the need to increase the level of payment beyond the FAS level. The lifeboat fund, which would be run by the PPF, would pay top-up pensions up to the PPF levels. Under subsection (4), the Secretary of State could make loans to the lifeboat fund to enable the pension top-ups to be paid until sufficient had been received from a reclaim fund. If the reclaim fund ended up transferring more than was needed, subsection (6) would require the funds to be returned to the reclaim fund, which could then transfer the money to the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000269"></a>When we moved our amendments to the Pensions Bill, we also tried to set up an asset recovery agency, which was designed to gather in dormant assets to pay  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the lifeboat fund. That was widely misreported as being aimed only at unclaimed pension assets&#151;about which there are technical issues, as well as strong opposition from the pensions industry&#151;but in fact the agency was designed so that dormant bank account money would also have been covered.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000270"></a>We believe it is important not to let the Bill pass without creating the opportunity&#151;it is no more than that&#151;for dormant bank account money to be used to supplement the FAS level of support. The work being undertaken by Mr Andrew Young&#146;s review of scheme assets is identifying some further money for the FAS, but the interim review did not find enough to fill the funding gap. Today&#146;s papers are saying that Mr Young&#146;s final report will say that there will be enough money only if the Treasury matches certain elements of funding, and it is no surprise to learn from the newspapers that the Treasury does not want to stump up. Hence, these amendments are potentially important in ensuring that decent pensions are delivered to those who were unfortunate enough to suffer pensions loss before the PPF came into force.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000271"></a>I should say that that we support money being spent on the matters listed in Clause 17 and, in particular, we support spending on youth facilities, provided that it produces things that young people actually want and not what some well intentioned committees think they want. At Second Reading, I asked some questions about that as the Prime Minister had been talking about &#163;670 million being spent on youth, which is way ahead of the amount that will be available from the dormant accounts scheme according to the figures from the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association. I asked the Minister to cover that question in his winding-up speech but he chose not to do so. I have heard from the Commission on Unclaimed Assets that the &#163;670 million was a classic bit of government spin because it included already budgeted government expenditure and existing lottery money amounting to &#163;495 million. What a surprise! The additional amount going to youth projects, being spun as &#163;670 million, is, I understand, somewhere between &#163;100 million and &#163;150 million, depending on whom you ask.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000272"></a>So, we can fulfil the Prime Minister&#146;s promises to fund youth and still have a lot left over, even on the cautious estimates being put up by the banks and building societies. Few would deny that spending money on youth projects is a good thing, but I hope that the other end of the generation spectrum is not forgotten when the dormant account money is handed out. Pensioners and prospective pensioners forced to rely on the stingy FAS support payments should be among those first in the queue for help, and I hope that noble Lords will support these amendments, which create the ability to give some very deserving pensioners a slightly better income in retirement. I beg to move.</p>

They relate to how thinly we spread any resources that are available under this fund. There are already considerable doubts about whether enough resources will be available to fulfil the third of the three objectives set out for the reclaim fund in respect of the social investment bank. My immediate view is that, unless there is considerably more money available than we have been led to believe, adding a fourth limb to the spending streams&#151;if you can add a limb to a stream&#151;would dilute (which you can do to a stream) the purposes. It also opens up the project to further amendments. I have colleagues who feel strongly that some or all of this money should be going to support international development goals. Indeed, at one point it may well have been Liberal Democrat policy that we should do so. There are no end of positive, useful things to do with the money.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000274"></a>To go back to the discussions that we had earlier, if we were extending the scope of the scheme to include the dormant assets of insurance companies and pension funds, the logic for some of the funding going in this direction would be stronger. However, we are clearly not going in that direction in the foreseeable future. Within the scope of the scheme as it is likely to emerge from the Bill, because of the &#147;spreading thin&#148; argument we are not minded to support these amendments.</p>

Originally, it was thought that there were some 60,000 of them, and the Government decided that &#163;400 million over 20 years was quite enough money to lay aside. Since then, that has been ratcheted up, not least in the Budget last year. There will be an order on exactly that subject in this very Room on Thursday, which will bring a total of &#163;2.3 billion into the FAS pot.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000276"></a>The indefatigable Dr Altmann, who is the spokesman and, arguably, leader of the Pensions Action Group, has pointed out, first, that that is still not nearly enough and, secondly, that what is needed is for the Government to accept the moral result of the ombudsman&#146;s report of some two years ago. My noble friend mentioned the investigation that is going on into the use within the FAS scheme of those residual assets that are coming into the scheme. A report was due in July. I still have not seen it&#151;and of all people, I would be the most likely in your Lordships&#146; House to do so.</p>

I should have looked up my earlier speeches on the FAS and read them out verbatim to show how much &#147;I told you so&#148; was a justifiable comment on this occasion.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000279"></a>Like my noble friend, who has done a splendid job on this subject since I left the Front Bench, I was surprised by the comments in the weekend press&#151;those are the ones I saw, rather than the comments today&#151;with regard to the funding of the FAS. It was also suggested somewhere yesterday that the administrative costs of the FAS have amounted to more than it has succeeded in paying out. No doubt the Minister will tell us whether that is so. At all events, it was clear from the beginning, when the FAS was introduced to quell a rebellion in another place, that the amounts involved were totally inadequate. They were sufficient to buy off the rebellion in the other place, but they certainly were not sufficient to meet the needs of the group of people who are on the wrong side of the deadline. If you got the other side of the PPF being set up, it was all right; but if you have to rely on the financial assistance scheme, it has proved totally inadequate.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000280"></a>The ombudsman&#146;s report seems to have been totally disregarded by the Government. This is becoming something of a pattern with independent reports. The reports spell out the problems arising as a result of government policy and maladministration, and then the action for which they call is not taken. Given that this is a deserving group of people who have been grossly misled about what was being done to help them, there is an argument for saying, as my noble friend Lady Noakes said, that this is indeed a charitable enterprise, albeit one which ought to be financed quite straightforwardly by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000282"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, is right: the issue of support for deserving pensioners is of great concern to the Government, hence the great deal of activity going on at the present time which is giving rise to some remarkably ill-informed press comment. The issues we are seeking to address are challenging, but it would be singularly inappropriate to divert resources from dormant account funds to the lifeboat fund.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000285"></a>It cannot be an intelligent strategy to divert to the lifeboat fund the dormant account money. It would be an open-ended commitment. We do not know how much money would be involved nor how long the undertaking would be. So we would be building into these accounts and the structures of the Bill a long-running commitment which we would not be able to calculate and the end of which we could not foresee; we would not know when the obligation was fulfilled. I have not the slightest doubt that in other areas of the Bill&#151;I have already had some experience of this today&#151;the Opposition are only too keen to identify how precise we need to be with certain calculations. Here we have a grandiose scheme which is utterly open-ended.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000286"></a>We have set out our key priorities for the dormant account money, we have discussed with the institutions the structure of a light-touch regime to which they broadly give their support and, of course, we have our priorities within it. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, emphasised that the issue should be dealt with elsewhere and the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, although he supports the amendment, also thought that the resolution of the pensions issues lies in other funding structures. The Government are extremely busy about meeting those needs, and it will be appreciated that the reason why there is considerable press comment at present is because of the degree of hard work going on to see how issues with regard to those suffering losses can be remedied. That is all against a background of the review of the financial assistance scheme taking place under Andrew Young to find out what better use can be made of the residual assets in the pensions scheme, and we expect that report in the near future.</p>

The changes in taxation will ensure that any interest credited to a dormant account on transfer to the reclaim fund or credited while the funds are held by the reclaim fund will be treated as paid for the purposes of income tax and tax reporting requirements only if a customer reclaims the money.

But the Bill covers not only charities, but any social enterprise, as I understand it.

While my noble friend Lord Higgins was delighted by the Minister&#146;s explanation on taxation, I wish to report that I am not going to be diverted by a red herring on taxation in this amendment, which is about a serious issue of how we get appropriate resources to a relatively small group of people&#151;some 120,000 or so&#151;who lost their pensions before the PPF kicked in to give protection.</p>

It does not require any amount to be transferred and the decision on whether money could be transferred, as opposed to being put to any other purpose via the Big Lottery Fund, would be taken, in part, in the light of the amounts available. As I shall say later, there is significant doubt about how much money is available and, therefore, it is a shame to miss this opportunity to reinstate a version of what we tried to include in the most recent Pensions Act&#151;this is not very different.</p>

Some reflection of the amounts that could probably be spent in that direction would be a useful addition to the Bill. The Minister castigated me for saying that it was an open-ended commitment, but it is open-ended only to the extent that there are some variables, such as longevity, in how much is involved. However, the Government are grappling with the amount that is involved, and the mere fact that we cannot calculate it down to its last penny does not make it not a problem or a proper use of money, it simply makes it difficult to ascertain the final bill.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000368"></a> Clause 5, page 4, line 10, leave out &#147;15(1)&#148; and insert &#147;15&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000308"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 52.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000309"></a>In my previous amendment, I sought to amend Clause 5 so that payments could be made to a pensions lifeboat, which is a specific example of something that could be funded from dormant account money. With these two amendments, I am seeking to allow money to flow through bodies other than the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000310"></a>Amendment No. 20 is a small, paving amendment, but the meat is found in Amendment No. 52, which would alter Clause 15, which sets up distribution of funds only via the Big Lottery Fund. My amendment would allow the Secretary of State to specify the body or bodies to which a reclaim fund should transfer money. That money would still have to be transferred for social or environmental purposes, so the purposes for which money could be spent would not be changed. The mechanism or the distribution channel would be changed. That mechanism would be an order requiring the approval of both Houses. It is clearly a significant issue that should be brought for parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000311"></a>The order could specify the bodies to which the money was to be transferred and how the money was then to be distributed. It could specify particular sums to be transferred to a particular body or say that money could be transferred to the bodies only if certain levels of money or thresholds had been met. This could be important if, for example, the Government wanted to specify a transfer to the lifeboat fund&#151;I do not detect any enthusiasm for that&#151;but not until, let us say, &#163;150 million already had been distributed for youth purposes. My amendment would allow some flexibility in how money could flow and transfers to be time limited.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000312"></a>If, or to the extent that, the Government had not specified particular bodies under new subsection (1A), new subsection (1B) would require the money to flow to the Big Lottery Fund. The scheme would then operate under Part 2 exactly as the Government have drafted it.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000313"></a>The advantage of drafting the Bill in this way is that it would allow the Government to specify that money should go for national purposes. The scheme of distribution via the Big Lottery Fund is predicated on sharing money out among the individual countries, with spending priorities set by those countries. That simply does not allow for money to be spent on things which cross our internal borders in the UK. One  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example is the lifeboat, because, clearly, pensions are a national issue which could not be addressed through the devolved Administrations without ending up with a curious result of different pensions being paid in different parts of the UK.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000314"></a>There will be other examples related to functions which operate on the national dimension. The noble Lord, Lord Newby cited one, international aid, which would not easily flow out of how the Big Lottery Fund is structured but may well be a proper priority. Another example that I want to press on noble Lords is the Armed Forces and the ability to provide additional support to our servicemen and their families. This may not fit well within a distribution system that is not focused at national level. The Bill means that national causes will almost inevitably be bypassed.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000315"></a>One of the main reasons for seeking flexibility in distribution outside the Big Lottery Fund is that the scheme may well realise far greater sums than have been estimated by the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association, which have referred to sums of &#163;400 million to &#163;500 million initially, dropping down to possibly &#163;10 million a year. As we discussed at Second Reading, estimates based on the Irish experience lead to very much higher sums. It was the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, who said&#151;probably about 63 times&#151;we are talking about billions, my Lords, billions. If we are talking about a sum of around &#163;20 billion, we are talking about a sum of an order of magnitude such that it should not be pushed through the Big Lottery Fund. There ought to be another mechanism in the Bill for dealing with money in another way.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000316"></a>The Government have steadfastly refused to discuss figures and have given the impression of not having the faintest idea of how much is involved. For example, the Minister during the Second Reading debate said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121041000369"></a>&#147;Of course we are vague about the figures&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000349"></a>That was some form of boast, I think. He went on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="07121041000377"></a>&#147;I cannot talk about categorical figures at this stage and I do not think that it is reasonable that we should do so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; cols. 896-7.]</ul>
<p><a name="07121041000350"></a>It is quite clear that that means, &#147;not the faintest idea&#148;. By saying that they cannot estimate how much money is involved, the Government cannot avoid the fact that they are setting up a system on the basis that it could be handling anything from low tens, or perhaps low hundreds, of millions up to many thousands of millions&#151;billions of pounds. The distribution structure should be robust in the face of potentially very variable outcomes.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000317"></a>The amendment does not threaten the Big Lottery Fund as a distributor. I shall leave that to my noble friends, who have a series of penetrating amendments to which we shall doubtless come on our next day in Committee. In this amendment I am simply seeking greater flexibility and the ability to direct money on much broader fronts than the scheme is currently set up for. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000318"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07121041000516"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> It just occurs to me that it would be right to ask a question of the noble Baroness. I am not trying to be clever about this but she seems to  


<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have a hierarchy of ambition in the sense that in earlier amendments she has suggested that all banks and all building societies should be able to take part in the alternative scheme. I was more modest than that when I talked about the 10 per cent versus 90 per cent thing. If the banks and building societies availed themselves of that, there would be nothing left for either the pension life boats or anything else that she is suggesting. Will she set out her hierarchy of ambition here, because it is very important to be clear? I know where I stand on this, but I should be interested to know where she stands.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000319"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07121041000517"></a>Lord Newby:</b> While the noble Baroness thinks about the hierarchy, I have a further couple of comments to make. If we were to go down the route that she proposed on the pensions protection lifeboat fund it would be logical for this amendment to be carried, because you would be pretty crazy to expect the Lottery fund to get involved in all that. However, if we are not going down that route the argument seems to be much less clear. As the noble Baroness said, it would be possible for the Government to specify UK-wide causes for this money to be spent on. It would also be possible to expand that to cover completely different fields&#151;and the noble Baroness mentioned the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000320"></a>It seems that whatever amount of money is to be available from this fund&#151;no doubt it will be between the lower and upper estimates that have been made&#151;the causes to which the fund will be directed are perfectly capable of absorbing virtually any amount of money that one could conceivably imagine the reclaim fund could attract. Therefore, potentially to expand the scope in the way proposed by the noble Baroness beyond even the lifeboat fund runs the risk of a serious lack of focus. I do not doubt that one could propose many national programmes. The Armed Forces need additional resources but the same applies to the health service and to every aspect of public expenditure.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000321"></a>The Bill must plump for a definition and a series of containable and manageable programmes. I am not saying that it is absolutely perfect, but our broad view is that the way in which the Government are planning to spend the money makes sense. If you start dissipating it across a whole raft of other things you will lose focus, and that would be detrimental to the whole scheme, not least in the public&#146;s perception of how the dormant assets are being used. For that reason, and the reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, we are unable to support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07121041000322"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0007.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07121041000518"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> That is all very well, but one of the Bill&#146;s purposes is for funds from this particular conglomeration to go to social enterprises. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has just mentioned the health service. I was thinking much more in terms of health charities. Surely to goodness they would be defined as social enterprises. Irrespective of the pecking order for which the noble Lord has just asked my noble friend, the Bill should specify whether the shelling out is going to local charities or whether national charities are included. I hope that the Minister can answer that question for once.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07121041000323"></a><b><a name="71210-gc0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07121041000519"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate, particularly to the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord Shutt, who have raised very interesting issues with the amendment. I have no doubt that the noble Baroness will answer with her usual accuracy.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000324"></a>I was surprised, however, that neither the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, nor the noble Lord, Lord Newby, drew attention to the fact that the concept of distribution proposed by the Government in the Bill pays due regard to the rights and obligations of the national Assemblies and Parliaments of our devolved Administrations. We have been scrupulous in recognising that they have a role in defining priorities for their areas&#151;a role that would be handed over to the Secretary of State if the noble Baroness&#146;s alternative model of distribution were accepted.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000325"></a>We are seeking to develop a light-touch structure, one to which the financial organisations, the banks and the building societies, are prepared to subscribe, for the distribution of resources. I wonder how much consultation the noble Baroness has carried out with those organisations on the suggestion that the Secretary of State should have a much more significant role with regard to the allocation of priorities. She readily identifies national priorities spanning the whole of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, while the Bill pays due regard to the fact that our banks and building societies have concerns for their localities. We have provided a structure within the framework to deal with that.</p>
<h5><a name="07121041000391"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000326"></a>We will have many opportunities to discuss the strengths of the Government&#146;s proposals in detail, particularly the strength of our proposal that the Big Lottery Fund should be the distribution mechanism. It is not for me to test extensively on that now, although I have indicated already that the fund has great strengths in terms of its representation in each of the four areas of the United Kingdom, and its regional and local representation&#151;to say nothing of its great experience. But this amendment is translated from a distribution mechanism which has all those scruples and flexibilities attached to it and potentially establishes by order the Secretary of State as provider of an alternative national distribution mechanism. I hope noble Lords will recognise that it deliberately runs counter to the whole thinking behind the Bill and to one of the most important concepts&#151;that the Government are seeking to enlist the willing co-operation support and administration of resources that are within their domain. This amendment looks like the great hammer of central government being imposed instead.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000327"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will appreciate that I have the strongest reservations about the amendment and recognise that we will have plenty of time in due course to discuss the ways in which we could perfect the alternative mechanism that the Government propose.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>position on the various aspects of the drafting of their scheme. One will then regroup and decide on the most important areas to take further. If the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, wants a more detailed answer, he must buy me a drink in the bar afterwards.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000329"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, was absolutely right to say that the number of causes that could benefit from this money is infinite. However, is the Big Lottery Fund the right place through which to launder the money? That is the question being posed by my amendment. In case there was any misunderstanding, when I suggested that money be provided for the Armed Forces, I did not mean that it should buy guns and uniforms for them, I meant that it should support servicemen and their families for the things that make their lives better and in ways that are not related to armed operations.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000330"></a>My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale asked a question on national charities, which is an important issue, because if the money goes into the Big Lottery Fund, it has to be shared between the countries. How does a national charity fit in with that scheme? That is another reason why I thought that an alternative scheme that would reflect national issues was important. The Minister then said: &#147;Ah, but this is terrible, because the Secretary of State will be making decisions without reference to the devolved Administrations&#148;; but the Secretary of State makes decisions as a cabinet colleague and I believe that there are cabinet colleagues representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although they are part-time. I do not have a particular problem with that.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000331"></a>The Minister then said that the Government were seeking to enlist the willing support and co-operation of those whose funds were to be liberated by the Bill; but if the Minister has read the comments of the British Bankers&#146; Association on the amendments, he will have seen that it regards where the money goes as a matter of public policy that does not concern it. Its main concerns are the arrangements for how money is gathered in and not how it is spent. The BBA does not regard itself as having a say in that; it has left that to the Government, so this is a question that we should debate.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121041000332"></a>I will reflect further before we come back on Report. My previous amendment was on the lifeboat, which I continue to believe is a very important cause. This amendment reflects that the Bill is not robust in the face of very differing outcomes in terms of amounts collected through the scheme and does not allow some national projects to be supported, so I regard this issue as having continuing importance.</p>

<a name="71210-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0712101000016"></a>I met counterparts from Poland, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with experts from the seven countries for a two-day symposium at Schwielowsee, near Werder, on 30 November and 1 December 2007.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0712101000017"></a>The symposium was intended to provide a chance to reflect, together with the help of legal and academic experts, on developments in international terrorism and to intensify dialogue on effective measures to take against this threat.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0712101000018"></a>In May 2007, the interior Ministers of the G6 countries and the US met in Venice at Italy's invitation to discuss counterterrorism issues. They came to the conclusion that they needed to work together on legal issues around how states counter international terrorism in order to come up with effective responses to the wide variety of threats faced by the international community and its citizens. At that meeting, the participants agreed to intensify their dialogue.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0712101000019"></a>The symposium discussed, inter alia:</p>
whether there were problems and gaps in the legal environment in which states worked to counter terrorism, and how such issues could be addressed;some specific issues, such as: deportation of terrorist suspects; the creation of new criminal offences; and intelligence sharing; andother related issues such as the European Police Mission (EUPOL) in Afghanistan.
<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0712101000022"></a>I am today announcing that the Home Office will be increasing its contribution to the work of police forces and authorities dealing with serious and organised crime and other protective services. In 2008-09 and 2009-10, &#163;11 million will be made available, rising to &#163;13 million in 2010-11. This will help the police service to ensure that it meets the standards expected in the delivery of protective services throughout England and Wales by 2011.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0712101000023"></a>From these amounts, grants will be available up to &#163;5 million in 2008-09 and &#163;4 million a year in 2009-10 and 2010-11 to continue the work of the regional intelligence units addressing serious and organised crime. These have been developed, with Home Office financial support, by the Association of Chief Police Officers in collaboration with police forces and authorities throughout England and Wales. We shall be discussing with police forces and authorities the financial contribution that they will need to make in collaboration to ensure the success of these units.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0712101000024"></a>We shall continue financial support to the East Midlands Special Operations Unit recognising its success in tackling serious and organised crime and the special needs of the region. We expect the five forces and authorities in the region to become increasingly self-sufficient in the collective provision of this capability and will therefore be discussing with them a tapering of financial support over the period.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0712101000025"></a>These funds also include completion of grants towards the start-up costs of protective services demonstrator sites and the project to evaluate their development and disseminate best practice. Thirteen demonstrator sites are now being funded involving  34 police forces working in collaboration to deliver protective services.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0712101000026"></a>Finally, we will be discussing with police forces and authorities the other opportunities there may be to make critical enhancements to their collaborative contribution to protective service improvements using the money the Home Office is making available.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0712101000033"></a>I would like to bring the House up to date on a number of matters connected to the collapse of Farepak.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0712101000034"></a><I>Investigation of the </I><I>collapse</I></p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0712101000035"></a>The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform's Companies Investigation Branch conducts investigations into companies where there is concern over the way a company's business has been conducted (usually a suspicion of fraud, misconduct or sharp practice). That is why an investigation was instigated into the collapse of Farepak within days of the appointment of administrators.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0712101000036"></a>While the Companies Investigation Branch completes 90 per cent of its investigations within six months, the investigation into Farepak has regrettably taken longer because of the huge number of documents that have had to be analysed, the inter-company relationships and the numerous parties to be interviewed. The investigators (CIB staff with long experience of these types of investigations) have compulsory powers&#151;those facing questions must answer them or face court proceedings. These powers are certainly wide enough to embrace all those who have had dealings with Farepak, including its bankers and advisers. It is anticipated that the investigation will be completed early next year.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0712101000037"></a>As a proportionate and acceptable balance against these compulsory powers, the Companies Act requires that these investigations be accorded a limited disclosure regime&#151;information obtained can only be disclosed through legal gateways and the report cannot be directly published.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0712101000038"></a>But if subsequent court proceedings are initiated as a result of the investigation&#151;such as disqualification proceedings against a director, or any prosecution, the story will be revealed during those proceedings. The report can also be disclosed to other regulators so that any appropriate lessons can be learnt.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0712101000040"></a>It is the liquidator's central duty to secure as much of a return as possible for all the creditors, including the customers. We understand that they are expecting to be able to secure a return of about 5 pence in the pound.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0712101000041"></a>It is not yet possible to confirm when a payment will be made to customers as every agent and customer claim must be finalised before this can take place. As well as processing claims, the team has had a huge task in verifying claims and double checking that claims have not been duplicated by agents and customers. This work so far has reduced claims by approximately &#163;2 million for the benefit of creditors.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0712101000043"></a>The Government have worked closely with the remaining companies to put in place effective measures to protect customers' payments, including oversight by a new body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, and a code of practice. The companies have put in place new independently controlled trust accounts to protect customers' money. The OFT has carried out a preliminary assessment of the code against the criteria in its Consumer Codes Approval Scheme, and the association has amended the code with a view to making a formal application for approval under the scheme.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0712101000044"></a>The Government have also given the OFT &#163;1 million for a consumer education campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings, and are empowered to make decisions that are right for their own circumstances. The Government's action plan for financial inclusion announces that the OFT will receive a further &#163;2 million funding to continue the Save Xmas campaign into the next spending period.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0712101000045"></a>We note the view of the Treasury Select Committee in its 13th report that, provided the operation of these arrangements proves to be satisfactory, formal regulation of this market is not likely to be appropriate or proportionate. But it remains our intention to reassess the regulatory framework once the outcome of the investigation is available, taking account of earlier advice from the OFT and FSA.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS5"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column WS5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0712101000050"></a>The UK continues to be deeply concerned by the political instability resulting from the absence of a president in Lebanon. President Lahoud's term of office expired on 23 November. The ongoing political divisions over who should succeed him remain a source of instability. We have been urging all sides to come together in the spirit of compromise to choose a president who can lead the country forward. We support them in their efforts to do so and hope they will be able to resolve the political crisis as rapidly as possible.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0712101000051"></a>Despite the ongoing uncertainty, progress continues towards the establishment of the special tribunal for Lebanon. On 30 May 2007, the Security Council adopted Security Council Resolution 1757, establishing the tribunal. The tribunal will try those accused of killing the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, who was assassinated on 14 February 2005 along with 21 others in a car bomb in central Beirut. This attack was part of a campaign of targeted political attacks against anti-Syrian MPs and political activists in Lebanon. The most recent of these was the assassination of MP Antoine Ghanem on 19 September. Mr Ghanem was killed along with two bodyguards and four other civilians in a car bomb explosion in east Beirut which also injured more than 70 other innocent civilians.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0712101000052"></a>The UK has been, and remains, firmly committed to the pursuit of justice for Rafiq Hariri's murder and the sequence of assassinations that followed it. The UK worked closely with UN partners to establish the UN Independent International Investigation Commission (UNIIIC) into Mr Hariri's assassination. We were also co-sponsors of UN Security Council Resolution 1757 establishing the special tribunal. As part of our continued commitment, and in response to the UN Secretary-General's call for contributions, I am pleased to announce that the UK will be contributing &#163;500,000 ($l million) to the tribunal.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0712101000053"></a>The success of the UN-led investigation process and of the tribunal remains vital for the stability of Lebanon. It is essential that justice is done to send a clear message that political assassinations will not be tolerated. The UK will continue to offer its strong support to the UN and the Lebanese Government as they take this important work forward.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0712101000055"></a>In March this year, I announced the overall public sector funding package for the Olympic and Paralympic Games totalling &#163;9.325 billion. Of this total, &#163;6.090 billion, including tax, and &#163;500 million of initial contingency was identified as public sector funding for the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). The remainder of the package covered security, sports and other non-ODA costs, together with a prudent contingency for ODA and security costs. A fuller breakdown is included at Table 1.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS6"></a><b>10 Dec 2007 : Column WS6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0712101000056"></a>As with any major project at this stage, further work was needed to ensure that the budget is fully aligned with scope, programme and risks. This work has now been completed allowing us to publish a more detailed ODA budget in line with the recommendations of the NAO report in July 2007 (<I>The Budget for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games)</I>. I can now confirm that this has validated the ODA budget and overall funding package I announced in March.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0712101000057"></a><I>Detailed Project and Programme Plan</I></p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0712101000058"></a>The ODA has completed a detailed project-by-project analysis of its scope, costs, programme and risks, to assess the total projected cost of its programme of works for the Games and for legacy transformation. This has confirmed that the base cost, excluding general programme contingency, is &#163;6.090 billion, the same  as the ODA budget within the announcement in March 2007 of a total government funding package of  &#163;9.325 billion.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0712101000059"></a>It is recognised that regenerating a 500-acre park to stage a great Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as providing the underlying infrastructure so that long-term legacy benefits can be achieved, involves managing significant risks. This is the reason why the Government included a prudent contingency in the March announcement.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0712101000060"></a>Therefore, in addition to the project level analysis, programme-wide risks have also been assessed and quantified. The contingency available, within the funding package announced in March, has been confirmed as sufficient to cover the risks at both project and general programme levels.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0712101000061"></a><I>Allocated Contingency</I></p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0712101000062"></a>In June 2007, the Ministerial Funders&#146; Group&#151;established to manage the allocation of contingency to the ODA within the overall budget&#151;met and agreed a first allocation of contingency to the ODA, being &#163;360 million out of the &#163;500 million of initial contingency announced in March, to enable the ODA to manage early cost pressures.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0712101000063"></a>Following its second meeting on 26 November 2007, the funders&#146; group has now agreed:</p>
a baseline budget and scope proposed by the ODA. The total budgeted base cost to be met by the public sector funding package remains at &#163;6.090 billion including tax and excluding general programme contingency as I announced in March; andthis includes the allocation to the ODA of the remaining &#163;140 million from the initial &#163;500 million contingency that I announced in March, covering as planned the cost pressures on early projects across the ODA programme.

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0712101000065"></a>As a result of this further work and recent decisions, there still remains &#163;2.009 billion of contingency.  This contingency includes provision against known programme-wide risks, and against risks that are outside the ODA&#146;s control. The programme-wide risks, and other risks outside the ODA&#146;s control, have been assessed and quantified and the contingency available has been confirmed as sufficient to cover such risks.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0712101000066"></a>Access to any of the &#163;2.009 contingency will only be on the basis of a case-by-case assessment of actual risks arising and any mitigation that can be taken. The ODA is also incentivised to limit requests for release of the contingency to the minimum consistent with securing good value in such a large and complex programme, and will manage its contracting strategy accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="0712101000067"></a>Table 2 summarises the funding position, including a detailed breakdown of the ODA budget as a result of these decisions, and Table 3 summarises the contingency released.</p>

<a name="71210-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="0712101000068"></a>In addition, as previously identified, &#163;238 million of the &#163;2.247 billion contingency has been set aside to cover the risks in relation to security beyond the budget of &#163;600 million I announced in March. The funding allocated to security will continue to be subject to oversight and scrutiny in the coming months and years by the relevant Cabinet committee, the Home Secretary and the Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0712101000070"></a>In the new year, the ODA will issue a summary of the baseline scope, aligned budget, programme and risks. The budget and scope now agreed will provide a robust baseline for future reporting.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_213"></a><a name="0712101000236"></a>Consultation begins today on draft regulations which will allow protected rights to be held in self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs).

<p><a name="wms_stpa_214"></a><a name="0712101000237"></a>The consultation is the result of the very useful dialogue we have had with the pensions community about the existing restrictions preventing SIPPs from holding protected rights.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Whether, in light of the bovine tuberculosis and bluetongue outbreaks, there is any research data which relate to the possibility (a) that in-breeding has lowered the resistance of farm stock, particularly dairy cattle; (b) that particular breeds of either cattle or sheep have a greater resistance than others to either of these diseases; or (c) that less intensive farming, for example organic, reduces incidence.

Research is under way in Great Britain (funded by the Welsh Assembly Government) and the Republic of Ireland to determine whether there is any evidence of inherited traits for increased resistance or susceptibility to the disease in cattle. In addition, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council is funding research into the &#147;interplay between host and pathogen genetic factors in the increasing incidence of bovine TB&#148;, which should provide fundamental information on host genetic factors that influence TB susceptibility in cattle.</p>

<a name="71210w0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_104"></a><a name="07121013000247"></a>The department's strategy for assisting young people to re-engage is based on four key elements: careful tracking to identify young people's needs; a flexible mix of learning provision designed to meet the needs of every young person in every area; good advice and support to enable young people to access suitable provision; and a set of clear rights and responsibilities for young people to re-engage should they become NEET. Together with the education and training and Youth Matters reforms, these will make a significant reduction in the proportion of young people NEET and put us on the pathway to ensuring that all young people participate in education or training up to the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_109"></a><a name="07121013000258"></a>The details of the constitution and administration of the board are currently being considered and discussed, including with London councils. It is disappointing that the Mayor has announced his intention not to sit on the board or contribute to the fund. However, the Government will continue to seek ways of working together to ensure that the efforts of the board and the Mayor to improve waste infrastructure in London are mutually reinforcing.</p>
