<a name="50113-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>NHS: Refugee Doctors</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will provide the necessary support for refugee doctors in order for them to qualify to work in the National Health Service.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, over the past four years we have invested over &#163;2 million in providing support, advice and training for refugee health professionals. That has been good value for money as over 1,000 refugee doctors have benefited from the funding. We believe that at least 160 refugee doctors are now working in the NHS as a result of our support. Many more are beginning to reach the position where they can apply for jobs.
</p>

<a name="50113-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has praised our pioneering work in this area and pledged support for the work that we are doing and which the NHS will continue to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Indeed, the Government have done extraordinarily well in supporting refugee doctors thus far. Until August 2004, the money to support refugee doctors was held centrally and now it has been spread out to the special health authorities, to the strategic health authorities and to the Workforce Development Confederation. Will the Government consider reinstating central funding to support refugee doctors because refugee doctors move around so much and local funding makes it difficult for them to reach the support that has already been given to them by the Government?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we took the advice of our Refugee Health Professional Steering Group, which believes that it has fulfilled its original purpose to increase the awareness of the skills and knowledge offered by refugees. We made the final allocation of central funding in August 2004, but it will continue to be overseen by the steering group.
</p>

<a name="50113-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>It is worth giving one example: the North East London Strategic Health Authority, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, has developed a national website to provide career advice and support for refugee health professionals. That shows that there is commitment at the strategic health authority to continue with that work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that a number of centres have been helping refugee doctors, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_354"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 354</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly in honing their clinical skills? That means more than just attending a course or receiving advice from a body. As that money is now being localised, will the Government, together with hospitals and GP practices, give direction, particularly on university-based courses, so that there is continued support for that very good work and to ensure that the refugee doctors find employment? The figure of 160 out of 1,000 is not very high.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is worth bearing in mind that one of the conditions for receiving funding for particular projects from the central fund was that they had to demonstrate that they had plans for future sustainability. We are wise to the problems with central funding projects, in that one runs the risk that they may not continue. That is why we have ensured that partnerships are being put in place with pump-priming money that has been spent over the past four years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, four government departments&#151;the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Home Office&#151;have a role to play in regard to refugee doctors. Can the Minister explain what steps are being taken to ensure the successful collaboration of those departments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is right that all those government departments have to work together. We have worked very hard to ensure that our work in the health sector fits with other polices across government. There is a close working relationship with   colleagues in the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Education and Skills. It is a tribute to that close working relationship that the United Nations gave such a resounding vote of support to the work that we have undertaken in this area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister happy with the facilities to enable refugee doctors to learn English, and perhaps Welsh, in the different areas where major hospitals are situated?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there is a requirement on the doctors to demonstrate their mastery of English before they can practise in this country. Part of the support that we have given is to help doctors to attend language training courses and to improve their English so that they can practise medicine in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has already mentioned the Home Office, so will he ask his colleagues in that department to ensure that their specialised agency providing services for asylum seekers makes the maximum possible use of refugee doctors, both while their qualifications are being recognised in this country and once they are recognised?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I have said, there is a good close working relationship with the Home Office <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_355"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 355</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on this point. People want to give refugee doctors the opportunity to practise in this country when they have attained the necessary qualifications. We have to bear in mind that there are patients at the other end of the equation and we have to ensure that the doctors are suitably qualified to practise in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I can press the Minister further. Given that only 160 out of over 1,000 refugee doctors that we know about are at present working, does he feel that still more could be done? For those who are ready to work and who can be registered by the GMC, but who are prevented by immigration rules, could an exception be made, given that we are so short of doctors in this country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I have said that we believe that at least 160 are now working in the NHS. There are over 1,000 doctors registered on the British Medical Association&#039;s refugee database and many of them are in the process of qualifying. As I tried to demonstrate in my reply, we hope that we shall see more of those doctors completing their qualifications and working in the National Health Service.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="50113-01_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What action they propose to protect the category of heritage and cultural public assets identified in the Lyons report as &quot;falling within the scope of the Government&#039;s proposals to meet their overall public asset disposal financial targets&quot;.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, it is the responsibility of individual departments to determine whether to retain or dispose of assets. Departments are aware that they need to take into account all aspects, not just financial, when deciding to dispose of an asset. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has published specific guidance on the disposal of surplus heritage assets, such as historic buildings. This is referred to in Chapter 24 of <i>Government Accounting</i>. The department will also advise on proposed disposals affecting heritage assets. This guidance has not changed in the light of Sir Michael Lyons&#039; report, which made no specific recommendation in relation to the disposal of heritage assets.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, it is that latter point which concerns many of those who have read the Lyons report. There is, as the Minister has confirmed, no central register relating to the disposal of heritage assets. As a result of government targets, which are to dispose of some &#163;30 billion of publicly owned assets by 2010, there will be pressure on government departments. What <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_356"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 356</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

guarantee can the Minister give that the DCMS will ensure that the guidelines are observed by other government departments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50113-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, the short answer is that the guidelines of 1999, to which I have referred, which are in <i>Government Accounting</i>, still apply and are not affected by Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s report. They say that the aim must be the best return for the taxpayer, consistent with government policies for the protection of historic buildings and areas. That is the protection which is required.
</p>

<a name="50113-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>In addition, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, may remember that a couple of years ago the House of Lords scored a victory when it prevented the sale at auction of what was called the &quot;Treasury silver&quot;, the Privy Council silver. Those cultural assets were transferred to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and are on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum. There is protection for heritage assets; there is no threat to heritage assets from the Lyons report.
</p>

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, how many departments are there? Does each department now have a committee headed by an assistant secretary looking at the assets to be disposed of? Does each department then in turn have to register with the Treasury, or whatever, and say, &quot;These are the assets we want to get rid of&quot;? As the noble Lord, Lord Cement-Jones, said, would it not be much better to have a central register and a central group of people to look at all our assets, so that there is no second, third and fourth-time guessing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, has caught up. We published the first National Asset Register in 1997. A revised and improved version was published in 2001 and the new one is expected shortly. The National Asset Register is exactly what the noble Baroness asks for.

</p>

<a name="50113-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>In addition, English Heritage has a Government Historic Estates Unit, which produces a biennial conservation report that reports on the state of the heritage assets held by government. Furthermore, there is a great deal of protection for assets through the Museums and Galleries Act, charitable status and so on. We know a great deal more about the heritage assets held by government than we have done in the past.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask a question for clarification.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew3"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, I just want to know why there are 30 different committees. Why cannot there just be one to deal with the disposal of the assets?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, there is no need for 30 different committees. The Government set out a strategy and target for the disposal of assets. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_357"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 357</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sure that, as somebody with experience in business, the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, would agree that the operational use of assets is a valuable adjunct to government economic planning, but it does not require any additional bureaucracy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I am a bit surprised. At one point my noble friend seemed to be saying that disposing of financial assets is entirely a matter for departments. Can my noble friend clarify that? Does he mean that the Treasury takes no interest whatever?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, on the use of assets held by government, government departments are not set total targets and they are not told which assets to dispose of. The important point, which my noble friend Lord Barnett will remember from our debates a couple of year ago, is that under this Government operational assets are treated as a capital charge on the departments concerned. Therefore, the depreciation on those assets is counted against those departments&#039; accounts. So there is pressure on departments to dispose of assets which are surplus to the department&#039;s requirement. I suggest to the House that that is a very desirable thing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Marlesford: </b>   My Lords, is there not an underlying problem that is very relevant to the noble Lord&#039;s question? There are large numbers of works of art that are publicly owned&#151;sometimes by central government, sometimes by local government, and sometimes, indeed, by museums&#151;but are not catalogued. Is it not undesirable that these assets should not be catalogued? That means that, first, they probably will not be looked after; and, secondly, they may be disposed of inappropriately by one means or another. Will the noble Lord encourage the cataloguing of all publicly owned works of art?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, that is exactly what the National Asset Register does. If the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has any evidence of uncatalogued assets I should be glad to hear it because it is a matter that would concern us. Of course it is important that we   should know what our assets are and that those assets should perform financially when necessary. It is also important that they should be disposed of if they are not performing financially. But I emphasise that heritage assets are not counted in that sense; they are not a charge   against departments; and departments are not encouraged or forced to dispose of them for financial reasons.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that one of the virtues of the victory that the House of Lords won two years ago was to remind the Treasury in this Administration that candle ends are still important?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, it was not a failing of the Treasury that had ever occurred to me. I thought that it had always had candle-ends departments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, the Minister paints a very rosy picture, but is it not a fact that there is no <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_358"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 358</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

central disposal of heritage assets and the DCMS guidance does not cover assets such as pictures and other works of art?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   No, my Lords, I am painting an accurate picture of the situation. There is pressure for the disposal of non-performing assets other than heritage assets. Heritage assets are protected by the fact that they are not a capital charge on the departments that own them. The guidance that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport gives on the proposed disposal of heritage assets is that it should be in accordance with government policies for the protection of those assets. That seems to be a 100 per cent answer to the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Chan </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What arrangements have been made in the National Health Service regarding the risk of an outbreak of avian influenza from South East Asia.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, at present there is no confirmed evidence of person-to-person spread of avian influenza in south-east Asia. Guidance for the NHS on the detection, diagnosis and treatment of potential cases of avian flu has been prepared by the Health Protection Agency, in collaboration with the Department of Health, and is published on the HPA&#039;s website. Antiviral agents are available within the NHS for the treatment and prevention of infection.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, but I wish to press him on some further points. First, will he consider further what public health messages should be disseminated to the public through primary care trusts; secondly, what advice should be given to those considering taking holidays in south-east Asia, given the difficulties encountered in the past two weeks in Thailand, Vietnam and China, where there have been regular outbreaks of avian flu, with deaths in the latest outbreak; and, thirdly, what information should travel agents disseminate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is the Government&#039;s longstanding practice to advise the travel industry on areas where people need to consider their decision to go or to take necessary health precaution before going. I see no need to amend that in the light of the avian flu situation. It is worth bearing in mind that there have been outbreaks of avian flu in Vietnam and Thailand in the past 12 months, with 45 cases in total.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may press the Minister further on the arrangements already made, should there be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_359"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 359</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The United States Government have apparently commissioned 2 million doses of avian flu vaccine, enough for people working in the healthcare industry and laboratory workers. Is the United Kingdom making any such arrangements?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have a pandemic flu plan, whose revision is under way. The United States has pursued its own policy in this area. Antiviral drugs are very expensive and do not have an indefinite life. Our plans must be proportionate to the risk.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, when the outbreak occurred, there was a temporary ban on the import of wild birds into this country as part of the caged-bird trade. Has that ban, which expired a month or so ago, been renewed? Notwithstanding all the welfare and biodiversity arguments against the capture of wild birds, does the Minister think that the ban should be in place permanently on health grounds?
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50113-02_spnew21"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, I was not clear from the Minister&#039;s answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, whether the Government have any plans to stockpile the antiviral drug Tamiflu, which remains our only and best avenue to tackle an outbreak of avian influenza.

Will she confirm the UN estimates that some 70,000 fatalities have   occurred there, 1.7 million people are displaced, 2.2 million are now dependent on aid and therefore at great risk should starvation begin to occur, and some 400 villages have been razed to the ground?

achieved so far, which as I understand from the noble Baroness is 1,256 people, to its agreed strength of 3,320 which was decided on by the African Union Peace and Security Council on 20 October? Initially the troops began to arrive and then there was a hiatus. Is that anything to do with the refusal by the Sudanese authorities to allow US planes to land on their territory? Does the Minister recall that, after the genocide in Rwanda, the UN commission of independent inquiry found that the fundamental failure was a lack of resources and political commitment? Are we not in danger of repeating the same mistakes? What steps are we taking in the Security Council to inject a much greater sense of urgency into this matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="50113-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, a major part of the problem has been logistical. This is the first such mission on this scale undertaken by the AU under its new peace and security mandate, which is partly why we have given so much logistical support, including 143 vehicles and support on the management side.
</p>

<a name="50113-03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The noble Lord will know that we are one of the countries that have been pressing within the Security Council for a much stronger UN Security Council resolution. He will also know that the last resolution was at least unanimously agreed by the Security Council. There has been some movement in that respect. I anticipate that, following last night&#039;s report by Jan Pronk to the Security Council, the Security Council will need to review its current position and think about the next steps.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="50113-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness the Leader of the House agree that the problems of the   overstretched African Union mission are being exacerbated by the increasing hostility shown by the government of Sudan to international aid organisations, resulting for example in the murder of one worker from M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res and the reluctant withdrawal of Save the Children Fund from Darfur?
</p>

<a name="50113-03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Despite those actions by the regime which are increasing the appalling projected death rate of 100,000 per month in the next few months, can the noble Baroness confirm that when the Prime Minister visited Khartoum recently he offered every support possible to the National Islamic Front regime in order for it to survive? How do the British Government square their support for a regime that has had, and which continues to have, so much blood on its hands?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="50113-03_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be aware that we have said consistently that the government of Sudan have to take very seriously indeed the issue of providing security to the citizens of Darfur. When my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was in Sudan, one of the things he did was to press the government of Sudan not only on wider human rights issues but on these issues of access and security. We have been monitoring very closely the commitments made by the government of Sudan not only in response to that visit but also in response to visits by my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for International Development and the Foreign Secretary.

<a name="50113-03_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The noble Baroness is quite right. The humanitarian situation remains fragile. Like her, I share concerns about the impact that that has had on aid organisations and the deaths that we have seen with Save the Children and MSF. Save the Children reluctantly came out of Sudan towards the end of last year. Other NGOs remain there. We must ensure that they remain as safe and secure as possible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50113-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, we welcome the additional support that the Government have sent to the expanded African Union mission. Of course we welcome that mission itself, which as the noble Baroness rightly says is unprecedented and greatly to be supported. We also, of course, welcome the Naivasha agreement ending Sudan&#039;s other war and any knock-on benefits that that may have for Darfur. But meanwhile the killing goes on and the atrocities continue.
</p>

<a name="50113-03_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Are we really going to press not merely for a revision of the Security Council&#039;s view but for a tough new resolution to the UN Security Council sanctioning the government of Sudan effectively and specifically and preventing the over-flying of the Darfur region by government of Sudan aeroplanes? The noble Baroness says that that is difficult because of monitoring, but frankly that sounds rather a feeble reason. It did not prevent over-flying in another area, over Kurdistan, and it should not prevent it over Darfur. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has reminded us, the atrocities go on. We must press very firmly for them to stop. Are we going to be tough enough?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50113-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, recognises as a result of what I and others have said across the Dispatch Box that we have been very tough indeed. He will know from his own experience that part of what we are doing is negotiating with other nations through the Security Council. A number of members of the Security Council are, for example, concerned about moving to the imposition of sanctions. The EU has had an arms embargo against Sudan for many years. We should like to see that extended to a UN embargo. That has not been achieved yet, but, in his report last night to the Security Council, Jan Pronk made a number of recommendations with respect to taking it forward.
</p>

<a name="50113-03_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Of course we will continue to work robustly within the Security Council. Of course we will continue to press our international allies on this. But we must also ensure that the government of Sudan and the rebels do   what they have promised with respect to the ceasefire and with respect to ensuring humanitarian access and the protection of the vulnerable people in Darfur.

&quot;(   )   in the course of any inspection of a school to consult and have regard to the views of the head teacher, staff, parents, pupils and governors of that school,&quot;


<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 22 is all about consultation during the course of inspection with heads, staff, pupils and governors and having regard to   the views expressed by them. In the run-up to this Committee stage, various organisations got in touch with us and suggested that when conducting an inspection the team needed to consult all these various groups. The simplest thing appeared to us to be to incorporate them all within one amendment. Importantly, the amendment says that the inspector must &quot;have regard&quot; to their views, not just consult them.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I recognise that we have a dilemma here. On the one hand, how can Ofsted achieve the desired short, sharp, very short notice inspections and yet arrange to see and talk to all of these people? Yet, on the other hand, how can it really get an impression of how well the school is performing, particularly within its wider context in relation to the well-being of children, without talking to this range of people? There has been a real advance in recent years with Ofsted paying more attention to such issues of governance, and meeting and talking with governors, and most recently with it taking the views of pupils into account, which is all very welcome. It would be a great shame if all that were lost.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Specifically, how can an inspection be completed without considerable discussion with the head and the staff about the aims and objectives of the school and how they go about trying to fulfil them? It is really vital that that goes on to the face of the Bill. Of course, you then get into, &quot;If heads and staff, then what about <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_364"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 364</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

parents, pupils, governors and support staff?&quot;, and we quickly get down to a list&#151;which the Government hate, I know.

</p>

<a name="50113-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The issue is that all these stakeholder groups representing all the people I have mentioned need to be established and consulted, as that will enable each of their different standpoints about the school to be taken   into account in the school&#039;s own self-evaluation. Information gathered on how well a school is performing will therefore reflect more directly the priorities of all these stakeholders who have a close day-to-day involvement in the school.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Teachers&#039; judgments need to be at the centre of assessment and evaluation. The evidence from countries which have adopted this kind of bottom-up self-evaluation is that such approaches have contributed to high levels of achievement for the vast majority of young people&#151;where teachers&#039; own assessment and evaluation of their standards goes up and not down.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Similarly, it is vital that all those within the school community have a proper stake in and ownership of the inspection and improvement process. This consultation and having regard to their views would contribute to that.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Parents undoubtedly have more information about schools than they have ever had before, but the nature of this information has in many cases been somewhat misleading, involving a concentration on tests and examination score outcomes.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Issues of concern to pupils and parents&#151;such as care, enjoyment of learning and emotional security&#151;have been overshadowed by a national focus on targets and performance tables. The Ofsted consultation document, <i>New Inspections and the Viewpoint of Users</i>, referred to questions parents are most likely to ask about schools, such as, &quot;Will my child be happy, safe, learning something, secure from bullying, able to enjoy school?&quot;. Yet Ofsted has not provided the means to be able properly to assess whether the new arrangements will achieve that purpose.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Under the new arrangements it is proposed that Ofsted no longer has a meeting with parents and instead seeks their views via a questionnaire. That brings certain dangers. These meetings have long been criticised for their low turnouts and the new arrangements may well be a more sensible development, but they have the potential to place additional burdens on schools unless they are carefully managed. Given the reduced notice period for inspection, can the Minister say who will be responsible for the reproduction, distribution and collection of the parents&#039; questionnaires?
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>There is also the question of the ability of the parents to complete the questionnaires. As communication with Ofsted is now to be primarily in written form, those parents and carers with poor literacy skills and/or those who have English as a second or third language would not have equal opportunity of access to express what they feel about their concerns or even their praise for the school. Can the Minister tell us how the profile of parents and carers who fill in the form and participate in this consultation will be monitored? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_365"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 365</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

What action will be taken if there is any evidence that certain groups have been disfranchised by the new arrangements which are now to be in writing?

</p>

<a name="50113-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>It is for these reasons that we feel that our amendment would be much more appropriate and would avoid that danger. I beg to move.

<a name="50113-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   I speak to my Amendment No. 36 which follows on from the contribution that we have just heard. On the first day of Committee my noble friends were particularly helpful in their responses and I hope that my noble friend will agree to consider this matter.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Section 6 sets out the duty on the appropriate authority to inform parents that the chief inspector proposes to undertake a Section 5 inspection of their children&#039;s school. But it does not specify that a meeting should have to take place between the chief inspector and the parents of that school. My amendment ensures that wherever it is reasonably practical&#151;I stress those words&#151;such a meeting should be held.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I am very happy with the proposed new inspection regime&#151;shorter notice, shorter time, more frequent inspection and, in particular, the fact that a greater number of inspections will be led by one of Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate; also, the chief inspector will be accountable for all reports. All these changes are warmly welcomed. I believe that they will lead to a much more realistic inspection and I hope a rather less stressful one for teachers. But I have a real concern about parental involvement.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="50113-04_time1"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I understand from a very helpful letter from my noble friend that because of the short notice it is considered unreasonable to require schools to arrange the kind of parents&#039; evening that is now arranged prior to the inspection. I also acknowledge that some of the practical points about that were discussed in the DfES paper, <i>A New Relationship with Schools</i>. The paper gave practical examples of about two to five working days&#039; notice being given of inspections. One example was that staff would be informed towards the end of a week, with an inspection running in the following week&#151;from, say, Tuesday lunchtime to Thursday lunchtime.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Unfortunately, in these illustrations, there is to be no opportunity for a meeting between parents and the inspecting teams. That would be a great pity and I ask my noble friend to give further thought to this. After all, the whole purpose of Ofsted is to improve the quality of schools. To exclude parents from the most visible part of that process would be a major mistake.

</p>

<a name="50113-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, schools will be obliged to inform parents of the inspections and give details of how to contact the inspector. But it is very different relying either on a paper-based response or on one-to-one meetings between parents and the inspectors which to many will be intimidating. One cannot substitute that for an opportunity for parents, in the round and collectively, to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_366"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 366</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

meet the inspecting team. Not all parents will take up that opportunity, but many will come and many will come at short notice.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Ofsted may say, as I think it has, that some of those parents will be unrepresentative. But are we to say that because parents are active and take the trouble to turn up they are to be discounted by Ofsted because they are regarded as somehow peculiar and unrepresentative?
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>My own experience in Birmingham with state schools, with four children, has generally been a happy one. My noble friend knows that I have been concerned, along with many parents, about the direction of my youngest child&#039;s primary school, Kings Heath. We have not had an Ofsted inspection for years. If we were to get a short-notice inspection&#151;in a school where there is concern among a lot of parents&#151;and then found out that there would not be an opportunity for parents to come together to discuss their concerns with the inspector, particularly where the concern is about the leadership of a school, the result would probably be that parents would have far less respect for the inspection report.
</p>

<a name="50113-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>On the practicalities, I recall many occasions when a school has forgotten, for example, that there is a concert next week, so we get a letter on Friday about the school concert on Monday or Tuesday, and we all troop to it. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that parents will come to a meeting with two or three days&#039; notice. Ofsted has enormous powers over these schools. On the first day of Committee, we debated the accountability of Ofsted; surely one of the most appropriate ways by which Ofsted can be accountable is its accessibility to parents. The meeting with parents is very valuable and I hope that my noble friend will agree to give this further thought.

<a name="50113-05_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b> In view of the shortage of time for these inspections, does the noble Lord completely discount the possibility of parent governors taking that role? That is why they were constituted in the first place.

<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="50113-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   If the parent governors were doing a good job, that would be perfectly possible. However, what about a school where the governing body is weak and has no control over a strong, assertive head? If parents make their concerns known to the governing body and find that nothing happens, what should they do? One of the great opportunities is to go and meet the inspectors. If a lot of parents turn up at the meeting, as they do with some inspections, the inspectorate at least knows that there are some issues that must be confronted. It is in such circumstances that we need the opportunity.

involved at every opportunity in every way possible in decisions that affect the upbringing of their children. That might seem to go without saying, but I do not think that it does.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I listened with great interest to the Conservatives&#039; debate yesterday on a low-tax economy and to what my noble friend Lord Skidelsky, the economist, said about the importance of a low-tax economy. He did not argue that the primary reason was an economic one but that it was a question of responsibility, a moral question, and that individuals should not have their responsibility eroded by an unnecessary tax burden.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I have come across the issue in past debates on childcare. We know that many children arrive at school with language difficulties caused by their poor experience of parenting and that good childcare can help to remedy that and prepare children to arrive at school in better shape. There is a danger that people will say to parents, &quot;We can look after your children better than you can. You can trust us with your children when they are very young&quot;, when sometimes the quality of the childcare is not what we would wish. That tension needs to be attended to. I am concerned that we should not, even with the best intentions in the   world, erode the sense of parental responsibility. That is why I support strongly what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, said, among the other reasons that he gave.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>My Amendment No. 37 is similar to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. It seeks to involve those in the care system concerned with children who are looked after by local authorities. In particular, I think that it is important to involve birth parents, where it is possible and safe to do so. Many children in the care system return to their birth parents, and it is important that the parents are kept in touch with the process. Birth parents often feel excluded and frustrated by the system.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I shall give an example. A mother with mild learning difficulties might have her child placed in the care of the maternal grandmother. It may be a marginal case, and one would hope that the child could soon return to the mother&#039;s responsibility. It would help the mother not to lose hope that she might one day be fully responsible for her child again, if she were involved in the process and could feel that people were still interested in asking about the fate of her child and the   decisions taken about the child. A mother in the process of recovering from alcohol or drug addiction could be kept involved with her children and in any important decisions about them.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The issue also highlights the need for a designated senior teacher at the school, as the guidance on the education of looked-after children recommends. That teacher could liaise and would be well aware of the situation in the local authority, so that, even at short notice, he or she could think, &quot;Who shall I speak to? Who might it be helpful to contact in the short period before the inspection?&quot;. There might be a good deal of utility in that. Many foster carers and many people who work in residential childcare are concerned about the quality of the educational experience that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50113-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>It is a probing amendment. I am seeking information about what happens currently and what might happen in the future with children who are looked after by local authorities. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="50113-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Amendment No. 38, which is in the group, is similar to the two amendments that have been spoken to.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The key change in this Bill from the one that it follows so closely&#151;the 1996 Act&#151;is the scrapping of the meeting between the inspector and the parents of children at the school being inspected. We believe that that is a retrograde step and will act as a further disenfranchisement of parents.

</p>

<a name="50113-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The Explanatory Notes point out that such a meeting would be impractical, as we heard from other speakers, given the intention to reduce notice of inspections. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, that it is neither impractical nor impossible. The two sides&#151;inspectors and parents&#151;have a great deal to offer each other. Both have valuable insights and information that it would be advantageous to share. Inspectors can get a true picture of the wider environment in which the school operates, including any ongoing concerns that might not be understood or spotted in an all-school environment. It is very important that parents are involved.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>It is an easy opt-out to deem such a step impractical. We simply do not agree that that should happen. It would be relatively straightforward for the head teacher in a school, once he or she knows that an inspection is to be carried out, with the support of the appropriate authority, to set up a meeting between the interested parents and the inspection team. Parents are well aware of the importance of an Ofsted inspection, so attracting interested individuals would not be a problem. The intention behind our amendment is to leave it to the discretion of the head to arrange a suitable meeting.

<a name="50113-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>My second point is that the amendment presses the importance of a meeting with the governors. There are two reasons for that. The first has already been alluded to in the debate: the governing body includes parent representatives. As a fail-safe position, the amendment would be one way of ensuring that some parents&#151;those elected to represent the parents&#151;met the inspection team. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, reasonably pointed out, it may be that the governing body is weak and the parents on it not very active or particularly representative.

</p>

<a name="50113-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>That brings me to the other reason why a meeting with the governing body is important. If the governing body is not strong and active and playing its part in the school, that fact needs to be drawn to its attention. Who could do that well, other than the inspectors with whom it should properly meet? The governing bodies of schools have had their responsibilities increased over the years, and rightly so. They can be a major source of support to the head teacher and other teachers and a major source of policy making in the school. The responsibility that they have for being accountable to the wider community is wholly in line with the intention of the Bill. Hence the importance that my colleagues and I attach to a meeting with the governors.
</p>

<a name="50113-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Governors ought to be available on short notice for such an important matter, but we suggest a failsafe position, so that, if they were not, it should not be a reason for not meeting the chairman. Whoever chairs the governing body ought to be available for such a session. Not only should the chair of the governing bodies and the other governors available be given the opportunity to meet the inspection team, it should be drawn be drawn to their intention as a responsibility. How else will they realise what their responsibilities are and ensure that those responsibilities are taken seriously by the department, the parents and the community at large? How else will they face up realistically to the report that will be made on their school? They ought to see the whites of the inspectors&#039; eyes early and know how serious they are about their business.

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="50113-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   I speak to Amendment No. 39 and support very much the intentions behind the other amendments in this group about which I shall say something later.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>It is pretty clear that the intention behind the 1998 and 2000 Education Acts was to give greater responsibility to governors. At the moment what is being put forward is a reduction in the involvement of governors in this particularly important aspect of the inspection of schools. I am with those who are in favour of shorter inspections.

</p>

<a name="50113-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>There are three reasons why I, and others, such as the National Association of Governors and Managers, which has just changed its name, and the NUT, are not entirely happy with what is proposed. My first reason is that during the passage of the Children Bill many of us argued for schools and the governors being involved in the delivery of children&#039;s well-being and, turning to the comments of my noble friend Lord Listowel, particularly that of the most vulnerable children.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>There are requirements in the Bill for inspections to report on the school&#039;s contribution to the well-being of pupils. Secondly, therefore, it is more important that there is a meeting with the governors while the inspection takes place.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>My third reason is a little different. All schools are now to have rather more responsibility for their budgets over a period of three years, which is excellent. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_370"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 370</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

There will be a huge range of different sorts of schools under the Government&#039;s plans. They will have greater responsibility once they have been approved as a specialist school or an academy. The governors&#039; role will be even more important and, therefore, they should have a much greater say and be spoken to when inspection takes place. Those are my reasons for very much wanting to support a greater role for governors in the important inspection procedures.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>As regards the parental side, I support very much what has been said, particularly the extremely effective and persuasive speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. It is not good enough to say that, because parents do not attend meetings at the inspections, that is a reason for cancelling them. Sadly, it is more likely to be an indication that the school is not doing enough to communicate with parents. It may be that that side should be considered.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>At a time when the Government are recognising the issues rather more effectively&#151;and I note, sadly, the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, who is so passionate about parental involvement in all aspects of children&#039;s upbringing&#151;it is a backward step not to have this subject included. As regards the idea that parents are likely to feel included by filling in a series of forms, even if they have the capacity to understand them, that is a laughable suggestion. What is needed is a demonstration of how a closer relationship between parents and schools can be achieved, which is increasingly recognised as necessary for getting the very best out of children in attainment and well-being. How is that to be achieved? What is suggested now appears to be a step backwards towards earlier days in my time when there was a notice outside the school saying. &quot;No parents beyond this point&quot;. We need to watch that danger.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="50113-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   I offer my support for all these amendments, although my name supports only Amendment No. 38. There is a great body of research that shows the importance of the relationship which children sense between their home values and the school. The more a child feels that there is continuity of understanding between the parents&#151;or whichever one it is living with&#151;and the teacher, the more the child&#039;s work improves and it thrives as an individual. Sadly, the reverse is true. The more the child senses that the parents and the parental home are at variance with the values and understanding of the school, the more the child&#039;s work is liable to suffer. The visible example of the parents being brought in at a meeting at which the performance of the school is being discussed with the involvement of the parents is an immensely valuable part of the inspection experience.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Similarly, governors have had more and more responsibility placed on them in the past 10 years. Being a member of a governing body now is quite a scary thing. The legislation for which you are responsible is pretty formidable. The idea that we take away the valuable meeting between the inspectors and those who are in law responsible for the overall educational character of the school is very retrograde.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_371"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 371</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I have been asking myself why the Government&#151;and, presumably, the current chief inspector&#151;are in favour of this change in the arrangements. My own experience in all three roles as a parent at my children&#039;s schools when inspected, as an inspector, and as a governor of one or two schools is that such meetings have been very positive and contributed to the inspection and to the long-term well-being of the school.

</p>

<a name="50113-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, there may be anxiety on the part of the Government and the inspectorate that the short timescale of notice is not enough to allow attendance to happen. I agree with the noble Lord entirely that that is not the case. Parents and governors will make themselves available and will turn up. Perhaps not all of them will attend, but certainly enough to be a representative group. Ministers tended not to want to accept any amendments at the first meeting of the Committee on Tuesday, but I hope that they will take this amendment away and think very seriously about reinstating the meetings.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="50113-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, to expand on a point that he raised. I am grateful for his support. I do not usually enjoy much support on education matters from those Benches. It is an enjoyable position to be in. Amendment No. 38 appears to leave to the discretion of the head teacher whether a meeting should take place between parents and the chief inspector. In those few schools where there are real problems over leadership, does the noble Lord accept that the head teacher will often discourage such meetings taking place? Will the noble Lord reconsider leaving the matter solely at the discretion of the head teacher?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="50113-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   In tabling this amendment we felt very strongly that 99 per cent of head teachers would want the parents involved in the inspection. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was very persuasive. In a school where there are considerable problems with the head teacher, there might be difficulties as regards him wanting to have other people involved. That is a point the noble Lord made in his speech. However, I would be most concerned if the situation were not apparent to bodies other than parents, such as the local authority. That would ensure that the point was covered.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>We have tabled our amendment because we felt that it might be one which the Government could accept. It is not as strong as the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and given that it is slightly milder in tone, we hope that it will be accepted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="50113-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I support Amendment No. 39. Given the consequences of an inspection, how can a school be inspected without consulting or even seeing a body as important as the board of governors? To leave the governors out of the consideration seems entirely inappropriate.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_372"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 372</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I also support the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. If you were trying to form a picture of a business, this would be like not talking to the customers. It would be similar to sticking close to the factory, watching what goes out of the door and assuming that everything is all right outside. If something is causing concern in a school, it is more than likely to be revealed in the parents. It is much easier to find out something subtle, unusual or difficult to elicit from the ordinary procedures and school records by talking to the parents. As the Minister knows, I built a business on those grounds. You find out a lot of things from parents which would never be revealed by simply going around the school. Meeting parents is an absolutely crucial element when trying to understand how a school is working.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I turn to the questionnaire. It will have to be sent out with the agency of the school, because there is no other way in which it will happen. The questionnaires will have to be returned to the inspectors before they leave the premises. It is not possible to deal with a disparate collection of responses without having an opportunity to discuss them with the school. If this is to be done within the timescale, there may as well be a meeting of the parents involved in the process.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Beyond anything else, a meeting would allow parents to express points that are not raised in the questionnaire. I have never seen one that asked the right questions. It cannot be done in a one-size-fits-all-but-it-must-fit-on-to-two-sides-of-A4 exercise. Such questionnaires always ask the questions you are not interested in. Moreover, because the questions go through so many committees, they will be totally anodyne and lacking any point. There will never be a question such as, &quot;What is the history teaching like?&quot;. If there are real concerns, they are likely to be much more focused than anything that would ever appear in a questionnaire.
</p>

<a name="50113-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>However, at least the questionnaire may act as a prompt. I approve of it because it may encourage parents to recognise that they have a real role to play. But for goodness&#039; sake give them a meeting because that is where the real information will come out.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="50113-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   We have had a good debate on an important group of amendments. My noble friend has already told me to stop nodding, but there is much that the Government can agree with in the spirit and intent of what has been said. I hope to be able to demonstrate that in my response. I want also to address the many concerns that have been expressed, such as time factors, the imperatives of the new system and what impact they will have on the processes and the people involved.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I shall start by addressing the general amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which sets out the stall for the group. We welcome the positive statements from all around the Committee about the vital roles played by all the different participants in a school when it comes to inspection. As each amendment has been spoken to, warm tributes have been made to those roles, which I wholly endorse. We do not take any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_373"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 373</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of those for granted and acknowledge their value in the year-on-year improvements in performance we have seen in schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The current position is that the School Inspections Act 1996 places a requirement on schools to arrange a meeting with parents and inspectors, and requires inspectors to consult the appropriate authority about the inspection. However, there is nothing in the statute about consulting pupils, head teachers or staff. That is something on which we shall reflect. However, we know that in the past inspectors have consulted widely with all the relevant parties. That has always been extremely important. Without that, we would not now   have a school inspection system. However, the question of why we should put certain provisions into statute has been raised.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I shall address first the issue of head teachers and staff before turning to the role of parents. We do not believe in general that the amendment is necessary because&#151;recalling our debate on Tuesday&#151;of self-evaluation, which lies at the heart of the new system. Self-evaluation means looking at the way things are done at each level within the school: teaching, learning, organisation, leadership and the relationships between teachers and the whole range of people involved in educating and bringing up children.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The inspection will start with a professional engagement between the inspection team, the head teacher, his senior management team and the staff. Inspectors will examine the self-evaluation exercise, looking at how it relates to their experience of what is going on in the school during their time on the premises. They will ensure that the initial statistical and other data concur with what they find. They will then sit with the senior management team to explore and challenge the self-evaluation. They will work alongside and engage with independent members of staff in particular areas of the curriculum to understand what people are actually telling them about what is going on. During the event, there will be similar engagements with pupils and parents. The aim is to verify the evidence set out in the self-evaluation summary, ensuring that it accords with what people without any vested interests tell the inspectors about their experience of the school and how it is delivering.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="50113-07_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>That is a fundamental principle. One must involve the child and the parent at all stages. Each of the views gathered will be used to inform the final judgments that the inspector puts into his report. The inspector will provide verbal feedback at the end of the inspection, at which the governing body should be represented, with the draft report following shortly after. Where it has not been possible to meet the chair of governors, Ofsted intends to provide every opportunity for the chair to speak to the lead inspector at first hand. At that point additional evidence can be brought forward. Time will be available to correct any factual mistakes.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I am not talking about theory in my response, but   about what is now being tried and tested in the 100   pilot inspections. The results of those are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_374"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 374</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

constantly being fed back to Ofsted so that the process itself can be refined and improved. To date we have had, as I said, 100 pilot inspections in which the head, staff, parents and governors have each had a full opportunity to take part in what is after all a defining moment for the school. Is it working? Noble Lords would expect me to say that it is, but not only does Ofsted believe that it is going well; schools themselves are telling us so. Satisfaction ratings, which are measured independently of the inspection team, show us that almost every school feels that the report resulting from the pilot inspection is a fair and accurate reflection. Almost 100 per cent of those schools taking part have expressed that they were very happy with both the process and the final report.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>But do not mistake this for complacency. We are looking to improve on those findings. I shall explain how that is to be done, particularly in relation to the points raised about governors. We are in a process of iteration about improvement.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>First, I shall address the issue of parents. There is a clear sense among noble Lords that we are somehow giving parents less or even inadequate opportunity to make their views known. Let me reassure noble Lords, especially my noble friend Lord Hunt, that that is absolutely not the case. The whole thrust of what we have been trying to do with parents in our school improvement policies over the past seven years is to bring them into a proper relationship with schools&#151;not an occasional meeting to talk about the curriculum or visits if the child is in trouble. We want to see proper relationships based on continuing dialogue. We see that as part of the process we are now engaged in with the inspection system.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>In response to Amendments Nos. 36, 37, and 38, we want to strengthen parents&#039; hands. We would not make impracticality an excuse, but there are issues regarding time that we have to address, which is now being done in the pilots. We are looking for improvement. However, it will be difficult for all parents to meet an inspector during an event that schools will know is taking place only at very short notice, and which might last for no more than two days. It would be a burden for both schools and parents to arrange meetings with a representative number of parents at such short notice. Indeed, schools might complain that on the one hand we are giving them less notice and asking them to do more. However, they will continue to be under a duty to notify parents of an inspection, and that has certainly proved possible in the pilot.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>We should also remember that in Ofsted&#039;s consultation parents were strongly in favour of reduced or no-notice inspection. They also wanted to continue with the requirement that all schools must arrange a meeting, which is often poorly attended and does not necessarily contribute to the cycle of school improvement. So we believe that this would not add to the inspection&#039;s findings and outcomes.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The latest, very recent, figures show that attendance at pre-inspection meetings for parents averages 16 in a primary school and 30 in a secondary school. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_375"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 375</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could be 15 families out of 300 or 400 in a secondary school. We may deplore the reluctance of parents to come to these meetings but the reality is that this is not a very efficient or humane way to engage people in this process. Given the views received from parents we have sought to find better ways of encouraging their participation.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I intend to talk about the questionnaire and address any practical problems but the most important thing I wish to say is that this has been worked through with parents themselves. We are being kept informed by the pilot schemes and are working with focus groups who are helping to develop a friendly and accessible questionnaire. We should not patronise parents by expecting them not to be able to fill it in. Parents are extremely well used to dealing with forms, not least on the web.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>This questionnaire will be something that the parents themselves will own. I take the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Questionnaire-creating is a science as well as an art. One has to get the language right and ask awkward as well as comfortable questions. If parents are involved in that process we can trust them to do that properly. The schools will circulate that questionnaire and it will be returned to Ofsted.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked me how this would be done. Schools will issue the questionnaire as part of the notification of parents provided by Ofsted. The questionnaire will be returned via the school but it will be the inspectors who analyse it. We do not anticipate any additional burden on them because there is no evidence of that in the pilots. There has been a good response and we believe we are getting it right. The questionnaire will be in minority languages as well as English and I hope that will encourage the participation of parents. The letter within which the questions are presented will provide details of how parents can make contact with the inspection team.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>What can we do and what else are we doing to involve parents? Parents can provide comments on a confidential basis directly to the inspection team, who will use them as part of their evidence-gathering. We are working with parents&#039; groups to understand how best to manage that process in the light of the shorter notice. However, let me stress that questionnaires are not the only option.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I was interested in the exchanges between my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. During those exchanges the Government were asked if we would retain the discretion of schools to retain meetings. Yes, Ofsted will encourage schools who wish to do so to arrange a meeting. There is nothing to stop the head teacher from setting up a meeting if there is demand for it. That does not need to be specified in law. I have an interesting example of one school in the pilot where 400 parents signed and submitted a petition to Ofsted complaining about the school prior to the inspection. That was part of the process.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>We all know that some head teachers are more charismatic leaders than others. We know that some are reluctant to meet parents and engage with them but, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_376"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 376</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield said, there are ways to encourage them to do that, not least through the governing bodies or the parents&#039; associations themselves. I believe that parents and schools will take up this opportunity. I would argue that we are looking to the best of both worlds. It will be a more systematic means of gathering evidence. It also be more democratic since the questionnaire will go to every parent and every parent will have the opportunity to respond and at the same time have an opportunity for face-to-face meetings. This is a system whereby schools are free to build on their strengths and reflect on the way in which they manage their relationships.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Turning to the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, he will know that, following the Children Act, local authorities have a duty to raise educational achievement and ensure that foster carers, children in care and key workers are fully responsible and fully engaged with the school. We want them to come along, not only to parents&#039; meetings but at every possible opportunity. The designated teacher responsible for looked-after children has a duty to ensure that these key workers are fully engaged in the process. While I am very sympathetic to his amendment, I should point out that we are putting a whole raft of guidelines in place. We are looking constantly at whether these are robust and I believe that we are getting better at this. The national minimum standards on fostering will have something in the placement agreement about these necessary meetings between key workers.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Several noble Lords spoke about inspectors meeting with the governing body. We do not intend in any way to reduce the scope, the competence or the opportunity for the governing bodies to be fully involved not just in a meeting with inspectors but in the whole process of self-evaluation. This will not work unless parents, children and governors are fully engaged in that process. Self-evaluation is about ownership. I should point out that the amendment has a flaw because it would require the appropriate authority&#151;in most cases the governing body itself&#151;to arrange a meeting with the governors of the school. I am sure the purpose of the amendment was to place a duty on the chief inspector to meet with the school governors.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, talked about the greater role of inspectors in auditing. However, development to inspection forms a key part of the strategy for accountability in the new relationship with schools. There will be no diminution of the principles underpinning the role of governing bodies. I must point out to the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of Southwark, that governors have a key role to play in the self-evaluation process. They will contribute to the process of gathering evidence as well as being responsible for signing off the self-evaluation form. That way they know whether there are any discrepancies.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>This annual process will be linked to the planning and improvement cycle. One great burden on the governing body is how to be fully engaged with such a cycle. They will take forward any actions arising from the inspections. This is a massive challenge so we have to ensure that they are clear about any essential outcomes. In recognition of this, under the new arrangements, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_377"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 377</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

governor representation at the feedback meeting with the head teacher and the senior team will be standard. Lead   inspectors will be able to invite a governors&#039; representative to attend the feedback meeting. That is in itself a major improvement. The current system provides that governors can be represented only at the discretion of the registered inspectors. In the majority of cases no governor is currently present at feedback sessions.

</p>

<a name="50113-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Members of the Committee were concerned about meetings with the inspectors and governors. We recognise that the issue of short-notice inspection raises a challenge. The difficulties are not insurmountable. I am able to say that because in the pilots, during the 100 or so trial inspections that have taken place, governors have participated in every single inspection. Ofsted has used a variety of methods to secure that, including telephone discussions if that is more convenient. We have been monitoring this process and have insisted that inspectors meet with governors to discuss their role. This has happened as the trial inspection process has developed.
</p>

<a name="50113-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>We have also asked governors about matters arising from the standard evaluation. When the school is contacted about its inspection we ask that the chair of the governors be available at the beginning and end of the inspection. We expect governors to meet with inspectors on every inspection. However, neither we nor Ofsted are complacent. We are watching the trials and effectiveness of these arrangements.

<a name="50113-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I have not participated in the debate but I have listened very carefully to it. The Minister referred to 400 parents who protested in advance of an inspection. Did the inspectors meet representatives of those 400? What was the further outcome, as it were, of that protest?
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   The school was judged to require special measures. Although I do not have much detailed background, I should imagine that the parents involved wished to draw quite a number of different aspects of the school to the inspectors&#039; attention. I would have thought that almost certainly there would have been a meeting. I shall check on that and write to all noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>In conclusion, I hope that I have addressed every issue raised. If I have not, I shall certainly write to noble Lords. It has been a high-quality debate. It is always a pleasure to read <i>Hansard</i> the following day and to reflect on the quality of the arguments. In the mean time, I hope the amendment will be withdrawn.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I was pleased that the Minister basically agreed with our amendment that heads could call a meeting of parents. She went on to give several instances of where Ofsted could require meetings&#151;for example, with the chairman of governors. Will this requirement be given to the school by Ofsted in notes of guidance during a pre-inspection phase, or something like that? Obviously, if a note goes to a school saying that a meeting with parents is desirable, the school is likely to arrange it. Although the noble Baroness has said several <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_378"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 378</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

times that this is desirable, we will feel much more comfortable if we know how the school will know that, what will be the process and how it will happen.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>There have been several references to the 100 trial schools. Of course&#151;I have been trying to make a quick   calculation&#151;100 schools is not even 0.5 per cent of all the schools in the country. I suspect that the 100   schools were fairly good ones which volunteered for the process. Perhaps the noble Baroness will let the   Committee know at some stage how those 100 schools were chosen. They represent a very, very small percentage of the total number of schools in the country and I do not know whether one can make a judgment on such a small sample. Perhaps the noble Baroness will tell the Committee about the process of Ofsted alerting a school to what might or might not be desirable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   The answer is yes, there will certainly be a full statement, which will set out in detail what is expected. Of course 100 schools in relation to the 20,000 schools, or whatever, in England and Wales is a small number. But they are a representative sample&#151;they were carefully chosen&#151;and come from 15 LEAs. This summer there will be a further 100 in the rolling pilot. If the noble Lord would like me to do so, I shall be happy to send him more information about the nature of the pilots.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for her helpful response. I did not know that the national minimum standard ensured that foster carers have a duty to be involved in school processes. That is welcome information.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The Minister referred to the designated teachers in a school for looked-after children and the important role that they play in ensuring that foster carers and residential childcare workers are involved. However, let me draw her attention to what is said in the Social Exclusion Unit&#039;s recent report, <i>A better education for children in care</i>. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;Evidence about the impact of designated teachers is mixed. Some schools allow non-contact time for designated teachers to liaise with other agencies . . .  Elsewhere, designated teachers have few or no additional resources and can struggle to reconcile their different roles, particularly where they have to combine teaching and advocacy functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>It has certainly been my experience that while these teachers should be senior teachers, they can be teachers with a very low level of experience.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I thank the Minister for her response but it has not entirely allayed my concerns in this matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Let me reply to those two points. First, as to the fostering service, I would refer the noble Earl to standard 13 of the national minimum standards. It is not quite as specific as I said. Standard 13.3 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;The fostering service requires foster carers to contribute to the assessment of the child&#039;s educational needs and progress for the planning and review process. The fostering service helps the foster carer to contribute to the delivery of any personal education plan&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Standard 13.4 states:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_379"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 379</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;The foster carer&#039;s role in school contact, e.g., parents evenings, open days, discussions with teachers, in conjunction with the birth parent where appropriate and in line with the care plan, is clearly laid out in the placement agreement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50113-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>As to designated teachers, I know that there is room for improvement. We are looking at that issue in the whole context of improvement in the delivery of quality to looked-after children.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   Whether correctly or not, I attempted formally to move Amendment No. 39 and it is right that I should for the record formally withdraw it.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Perhaps I may make two comments. First, I appreciate the answer of the Minister and the stress that it puts on the work of the governors. Secondly, I leave one thought for further reflection. The emphasis has been on the rights of Ofsted and the processes that the chief inspector has the right to go through. If I were a governor of a school about to be inspected, I would want the right to see the governors, and this is one of the ways of building that into the system. I ask the noble Baroness to reflect on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew7"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   I apologise for intervening once more. Can the noble Baroness provide the Committee with more information about the experience in the pilots of parental involvement with the inspectors? What value did parents and inspectors place on these meetings? It would be helpful to have that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I shall certainly try to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="50113-08_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I thank the Minister for her careful comments on the issue. I hope that she does not really think it was patronising of me to raise the issue of low literacy and minority languages. It is not patronising but realistic in a situation where some schools have as little as 2 per cent of pupils who have English as a first language. But I very much welcome her statement that minority languages would be used where appropriate for the questionnaires.

</p>

<a name="50113-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I thank noble Lords on all sides of the Committee for their support on the issue of parents and governors, in particular, and the importance of them being properly consulted during an, albeit short, inspection. However, I stress that our amendment also included heads, teachers and the children. Although I accept what the Minister said about the professional engagement between inspectors and teachers that occurs at the beginning of the process and the self-evaluation of teachers, I would point out that our amendment contains the two very important words &quot;have regard&quot;. The process the Minister described does not necessarily include that. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, the pupils are the customers at the school, and you would not evaluate a retailer without talking to its customers. That is very important.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The Minister&#039;s main argument against the amendment is that it is not necessary; it happens anyway and so there is no need to put it into statute. I believe that passing legislation is often an opportunity to send out a message <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_380"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 380</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about the importance of things. Clearly the Committee believes that it is extremely important that the opinions of the various stakeholder groups should be fully taken into account during an inspection.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>But we are in a new situation; we are legislating for a new kind of inspection. In these very short inspections we are asking the inspectors to do a great deal in a very short time. That is why it is necessary to specify that they consult these various stakeholder groups during the course of an inspection.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I welcome the statement of the Minister that heads will keep the discretion to have a meeting with head teachers, but if it is not in statute, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed out, there may well be very dominant heads who really do not want to encourage contact between the inspector and the parents and they will not use that discretion to have a meeting.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>For those various reasons, we need to legislate because of the change in the inspection regime. We need to make it very clear how important we think it is that all the various stakeholder groups are consulted and that the inspectors have regard to their views.
</p>

<a name="50113-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I shall not press the amendment but, as the feeling of the Committee is so strong, we may well return to the matter on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="50113-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden </b>   moved Amendment No. 23:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 3, line 41, after &quot;inspection&quot; insert &quot;(including an age-appropriate report for registered pupils)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No.   23, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 35, 45, 62, 75, 98 and 99, which are listed in my name in this group. At the outset, I declare an interest. I was for many years a trustee and council member of the well-known charity, Save the Children. These amendments have been suggested to me by Save the Children and I am indebted to it for briefing on the subject. The amendments in this group all deal with the same subject and it therefore seemed sensible to deal with them together.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Save the Children has a long history of working in a participative way with children and young people and has been involved in many statutory organisations, including schools, social services, local authorities and central government. It takes its steer from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under Articles 12 and 13 of that convention, children and young people have the right to express an opinion, to have that opinion taken into account and to express their own views, unless that would violate the rights of others.

</p>

<a name="50113-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Save the Children believes that the full and meaningful participation of children and young people in school inspections is necessary. It is important that their views are taken into account if an inspection is to be based on a full understanding of how a school is performing and   meeting the needs of the community it services. Information regarding the purpose of the inspection, and child-friendly reports following it, would help children and young people to become more involved in the process. Independent inspectors, lay inspectors and Her <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_381"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 381</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate would benefit greatly from training in children&#039;s participation. There are resources available on many different methods of participation and consultation that could easily be developed for use by inspectors and incorporated in their initial training or in their professional development. Children and young people could be trained to form part of the inspection team, which is a model that is used by the Social Services Inspectorate. The formal assessment of inspectors could   include particular reference to their knowledge of involving children and young people in school inspections. Inspections should involve a broad range of children and young people in the process and should include ethnic minority, refugee and asylum-seeking children.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The aim of these amendments is to ensure that there is a participative role for children and young people. I am sure that this would be to the benefit not only of the children and young people themselves but it would assist the inspectors and the inspection process. I hope what is proposed in this group of amendments, for which Amendment No. 23 is a paving amendment, will receive favourable consideration.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Amendment No. 23 requires an age-appropriate report to be available for registered pupils. I remind the Minister that in earlier discussions she has referred to the need to involve children fully in this process and I therefore hope for a favourable response to these amendments. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="50113-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 34, which stands in my name in this group of amendments. The purpose of this small amendment is to ensure that at the beginning of the process, when parents are being notified about the timing of an inspection, pupils are also informed in their own right. If pupils are to be genuine stakeholders in the school process, they too should be informed. I am quite aware that most schools will be very anxious to tell pupils that inspectors are coming in because they want pupils to be on their best behaviour. But I want to enshrine in statute an equal right for children in the school to have that information. That would respect their dignity and their position in the school. They are vital participants in the school community. I know that it is a small matter, but it is important because it recognises the dignity and the position of the children.

<a name="50113-09_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baronesses who have spoken on these amendments. We fully support the sentiments that have driven them. My noble friend Lady Turner has been a very powerful champion of Save the Children for many years. We fully agree with the importance of involving children and young people in the school inspection process. If we were asked what the school inspection process is for, our answer would be that it is for and about them, their education and their life chances. They have an important part to play in the inspection process. There is an increased emphasis on discussion with pupils under the new arrangements because of the vital element of self-evaluation.

<a name="column_382"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 382</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>During the pilots, we looked at pupils&#039; views about inspection. Evaluation of the pilot inspections showed that pupils thought that inspection was necessary and important for them and their schools, and that those that had the opportunity to speak to inspectors about themselves and their work enjoyed the experience. They emphasised how important it is for inspectors to ask them questions in order to understand what it is like to be a pupil at the school. That answers in part some of the questions raised by my noble friend about the nature of the inspectors&#039; own qualifications.

</p>

<a name="50113-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The amendments proposed by my noble friend Lady   Turner and the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, would put the duty of a school to notify registered pupils of a forthcoming inspection on the same footing as the duty to notify their parents. The noble Baroness spoke eloquently about their equal right to be so informed. It is very important that pupils should be aware that an inspection is taking place; they can hardly have been unaware in the past, given the high degree of activity and stress that they will have picked up on in some schools.

</p>

<a name="50113-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>It is important to note that the evidence is that schools do inform pupils in advance of a forthcoming inspection. Pupils need to be made aware that inspectors may want to speak to them about their experience in the classroom and out of it, in lessons, between lessons and during breaks. Schools will want to know that pupils are fully aware of what that will involve. There have been several references to the fact that pupils have been notified to make sure that they are as well behaved as they possibly could be, but in my experience that cannot be guaranteed under any circumstances. However, it is extremely important that pupils know what might be expected of them, if they have the opportunity to reflect on their experience with the inspector. I am sure that pupils are frank in what they say.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>There are numerous reasons why schools need to keep pupils informed of forthcoming inspections and we must be confident that schools will involve pupils as part of the normal business of preparing for the arrival of the inspector. When Ofsted notifies the school of a forthcoming inspection, the head teacher informs all those involved. The staff would be informed at a staff meeting. We would expect schools to arrange for pupils to be informed through the normal working mechanisms. In the pilots, we found that all pupils at the schools involved had been told about the inspection in advance. In most cases, this happened at assembly and was followed up by teachers in form time. We have to trust schools and teachers to get this right. I do not believe this practice would be enhanced through a further statutory requirement, but I understand why the noble Baroness&#039;s background and conviction make her ask for it.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Notifying parents is a rather different matter. Parents are outside the normal day-to-day running of the school. They are not in the school and there is no vehicle for them like the assembly. That is why we have included in legislation the duty on schools to take reasonable steps to ensure that parents are notified. This is an important protection for parents. They are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_383"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 383</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

users, but they are not participants in the day-to-day workings of the school. So, despite my agreement with the sentiments, I am bound to resist the amendments.

</p>

<a name="50113-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I now turn to the amendments to Clauses 5 and 15   tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner. They require age appropriate reports. I want to examine two ideas. The first is the principle of the provision of inspectors&#039; reports to pupils and the second is age-appropriateness. I support the aim of ensuring that pupils and parents receive a version of the inspection report and are informed of the outcome of the inspection. We are working with schools in the trials to develop mechanisms for involving pupils and we are committed to producing pupil-focused feedback after each school inspection.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>One new element, for example, is that Ofsted will send to the school council a letter summarising the key outcomes of the inspection. In 80 per cent of our schools at key stage 2, we have school councils. Where no school council is yet in place&#151;the Government are very much behind the idea of school councils&#151;a letter will go to head teachers. That, of course, means that the schools can also cascade the information down. Let us therefore use the internal mechanisms to get it right. That approach was used, and a further evaluation of six schools involved in that process showed that all the pupils in the schools had seen the report.

</p>

<a name="50113-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>What is the situation with regard to age-appropriate reports? It is very difficult to define. We had some debate during proceedings on the Children Bill about how we would get reports written that reflected the different age levels and sophistication. In fact, the reading ages varied and were consistent with chronological ages and so on. Because of the diversity of needs across a single year group in a school with many children with special educational needs, it is very difficult to define centrally what would be an appropriate report for any particular age group.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Ofsted is already committed to providing a pupil focused summary of the outcomes of all school inspections, which can be tailored by the school council or the school for all the pupils. That also has been trialled. Those reports are charming and do the job, and I shall be happy to provide some examples of them. For example, in a special school that was inspected during the trials, the inspectors produced a summary report for pupils in Makaton, the communication method that uses pictures instead of words, which was very popular. The letter to the school councils will tell people how they can access the full inspection report.
</p>

<a name="50113-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I therefore fully endorse the aim of the amendment, and I should like to reassure the noble Baroness that steps are being taken to address the issue and that we shall continue to consider what can be done about it.
</p>

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="50113-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   Before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may raise one short point. The Minister pointed out that during assemblies schools will tell pupils about the inspections, about which there is an obligation to inform parents because they do not attend assemblies and are not in school every day. I accept that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_384"></a>

</p>

<a name="50113-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>However, what will be the situation of those pupils who perhaps may be absent due to long-term sickness and who may have a view about how well the school is coping with providing them with work in that situation? What will be the position of students who may have been bullied, causing long-term absence because of the school&#039;s failure to be sufficiently proactive and effective in preventing the bullying? Such students would have very important opinions to give to the inspectors. Unless there is a good deal of notice of the inspection, which will not be the case under the new regime, the information may not get back to them via the grapevine that there is to be an inspection.

</p>

<a name="50113-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>For those reasons in particular, I believe that it is important that the legislation should contain an obligation to inform all pupils of an intended inspection. It is very easy to inform the majority by making an announcement in assembly. However, for the kinds of pupils that I have described, it really needs to be picked up to give them the opportunity of expressing to the inspectors their views about the performance of the school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="50113-10_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Those are very important points in respect of children who are absent as a result of long-term sickness or have a history of being bullied. That is not to say that that is the only or best way in which the information could be conveyed. It certainly would also be picked up through the response of parents. I should have thought that if there are concerns about such important matters, the parents themselves would want to look at the construction of the questionnaire to ensure that they are adequately reflected.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>In terms of the pupils themselves, I should have thought that, in its own guidance, Ofsted may want to make sure that schools are aware that children who have particular experiences and views are not left out of the process and are positively encouraged to come forward. However, I shall take advice and return to the noble Baroness on that.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>With regard to the publication of age-appropriate reports, as it currently stands, Clause 10 provides the chief inspector with the ability to publish any report made as part of his general or specific school inspection functions. That clause enshrines a general power, which protects one of the key principles of inspection referred to by my noble friend Lord Sutherland&#151;that is, the power of the chief inspector to publish reports. However, it is a general power. It does not specify particular kinds of reports or thematic subjects. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to single out individual school inspection reports for pupils in that context.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I understand that the noble Baroness wants to place on the chief inspector a duty to publish age-appropriate inspection reports, which I have addressed at some length in my reference to the school council or the school itself. The preparation of what I have described as the pupil-focused summary is simply the first step in that   process. The idea is that the school council itself <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_385"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 385</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should become involved in tailoring those messages. We could not strictly say that any one report that Ofsted could publish would be appropriate for the pupils of the school. Furthermore, one of the key aims is to provide feedback to pupils on how their input had influenced the outcome of the inspection. Therefore, the information might not be as relevant to pupils outside the school who are not parties to the inspection process.

</p>

<a name="50113-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We do not want to increase the burdens on schools. We need to be very careful as we discuss changes to the nature of the inspections. Because of the shorter, sharper inspections, we do not want to do anything that will overcomplicate the processes and increase the burdens. We shall continue to monitor the involvement of pupils.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Finally, in one of the amendments under Clause 48 there is a short reference to religious education. That would place a duty on those conducting inspections of religious education in schools with a religious character to prepare an age-appropriate report and would place a duty on schools to make those reports available.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Churches and other faith groups have demonstrated that they, too, are keen to move towards the arrangements piloted by Ofsted for Clause 5 inspections when conducting Clause 47 inspections in future. We are working with them on those detailed mechanisms. Our expectation is that they are likely to include the preparation of pupil-focused summaries in the way that I have described. We are working with all faith groups to secure the best practice, and I hope that at Report stage we can update the House on our progress.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>With those rather lengthy explanations, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="50113-10_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I thank my noble friend for that long and detailed explanation of the Government&#039;s position. I am glad that she at least accepts the principles involved in all these amendments.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I understand what she said about the phrase &quot;age appropriate&quot;. I should like to think about that and consider whether a more acceptable form of wording could be devised. She referred to pupil-focused information. I should like to take some advice on that, which perhaps would result in a better way of devising a suitable form of wording.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I believe that these are very important issues and that some attempt should be made to try to include them on the face of the Bill. A good deal has been said in the press recently about the alienation of some pupils from the whole school system. If steps can be taken to give pupils greater involvement in every possible process, including inspections, it would help to remove the feeling of alienation that may exist in some schools. We discussed that matter yesterday when we debated in great detail the issue of discipline.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>These are very important issues and I should like to think about how they may be included on the face of the Bill. However, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50113-10_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton </b>   moved Amendment No.   24:


</p>

(i)   the headteacher, staff, parents, pupils of that school,

<br>
(ii)   and in relation to a community, foundation or voluntary school, a community or foundation special school or a maintained nursery school, the school&#039;s governing body or, if the school does not have a delegated budget to the local education authority, and


<br>
(iii)   in relation to a school falling within paragraphs (d) to (g) of section 5(2), the proprietor of the school&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment, which would place on the chief inspector a duty to make available a copy of an inspection report arising from Clause 5 to a school&#039;s head teacher, its staff, registered pupils and the parents of such pupils. Furthermore, it would need to be made available to a school&#039;s governing body, its LEA, or in the case of a non-maintained school to its proprietor.

</p>

<a name="50113-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I hope that the Minister can assure us that further parts of the Bill adequately deal with what this amendment attempts to achieve. That certainly appears to be the case under Clauses 13 and 15. However, there is no specific mention of making the report available to staff, students or parents of the school that has undergone an inspection.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Clause 6 places a duty on the appropriate authority to notify parents of a Clause 5 inspection, but it does not place a duty to make available a copy of the completed report. Surely that is an anomaly.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Further, given that the Bill includes scrapping the meeting between parents and the inspectors&#151;an issue on which we have had a most productive debate&#151;is it not crucial that we do everything that we possibly can to ensure that parents are engaged in the inspection process, especially in their knowledge and understanding of a completed report?
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Clauses 13 and 16 place a duty on both the appropriate authority and the proprietor of the school to make a copy of the report available to any interested member of the public. That is not the same as including in the Bill named individuals, such as staff and parents, who must be made aware that such a report exists.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The amendment simply attempts to widen the number of key groups that in our view have the most to gain from an Ofsted report. Surely there can be no harm in including them in the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50113-10_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I hope that I can give the noble Baroness the assurance that she seeks. Clauses 13 and 15 provide that inspection reports are made available to all stakeholders. The provisions are wide, providing for the chief inspector to send copies of reports to specified persons and for the appropriate authority in the case of maintained schools, and the proprietor for non-maintained schools, to send copies of the full <br>&nbsp;<br>

inspection report to parents and to any other persons who ask to see it. Staff have access to the report through the mechanisms of the school. All inspections are on Ofsted&#039;s website.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>With regard to pupils, as I said, we are trying a new approach whereby pupils will get their own feedback, following inspection, which is tailored to them. We are involving the schools council in that.
</p>

<a name="50113-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I believe that the scope of the clauses meets the considerations expressed by the noble Baroness. If we have more to say on this issue, I shall do so in writing.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>Page 3, line 41, at end insert &quot;, and</p>

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
(   )   to establish a complaints procedure by which the appropriate body for a maintained school or the proprietor of a non-maintained school may complain about the conduct of any section 5 inspection or the findings of the report of a section 5 inspection&quot;

<p><a name="st_88"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 25, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 51, 59, 73 and 86.

</p>

<a name="50113-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>All the amendments deal with establishing a complaints procedure in relation to inspection reports. There are two different sets of amendments. Amendment No. 25 and its two consequential amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 59 and 73&#151;were suggested by the National Association of Head Teachers to provide a more generalised complaints procedure. The main aim is to establish some form of complaints procedure. The more specific proposals in Amendments Nos. 51 and 86, which duplicate the system in Wales, come from the National Union of Teachers and are more detailed. Both sets of amendments establish the principle that there should be a complaints procedure, and both would establish a less cumbersome and fairer complaints procedure than currently exists.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>It is worth reflecting on the present procedures. The Ofsted guidance on complaints procedure is as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;If your complaint is fully or partially upheld&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>that is by the inspectors themselves&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;the response will include an apology, an explanation and, if necessary, an indication of what steps have or will be taken to put the matters right. Where allegations or complaints are not upheld the response will say so and explain why. Every effort will be made to reach authoritative conclusions. However, where the Head of Division is presented with two conflicting views and there is no compelling evidence to support either account, it is likely that the outcome of the investigation will be inconclusive.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>If you remain dissatisfied with OFSTED&#039;s response, you will be informed of your right of recourse to the OFSTED Complaints Adjudicator (OCA). The OCA provides an external and independent element to the procedures and may only accept a case once OFSTED&#039;s internal procedures have been exhausted. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_388"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 388</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>OCA reviews the handling of complaints but cannot recommend that the judgements of HMI or of additional inspectors are changed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50113-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>An Ofsted complaints adjudicator does not deal with judgments nor with the inspection outcomes. He or she investigates not the complaint but how the complaint was handled. Even when the Ofsted complaints adjudicator produces a report, it is discussed with Ofsted, rather than the school itself.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>In October 1999, Elaine Rassaby, the then complaints adjudicator, stated publicly that the process of complaining was so burdensome that many teachers simply gave up and did not bother. She also described how the office was not truly independent. She was appointed and funded by Ofsted itself.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>To some extent, one of the complaints is that Ofsted is both judge and jury. The issue of complaints was raised on Second Reading by a number of people, including the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who I regret is not here today. He was anxious that a form of complaints procedure should be established. On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;Ofsted is currently developing a new complaints handling procedure to accompany the system of inspection. The procedure will make it clear that judgments about inspections can be challenged and will be considered seriously and fully&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50113-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>If that is the case, it is welcome, but the amendment would be a further guarantee. The noble Lord went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;There will also be an independent complaints adjudicator who will be able to examine complaints about the way in which the inspection has been conducted and the way in which Ofsted has handled such complaints&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>13/12/04; col. 1152.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>By that, the Minister appeared to imply that it was a new initiative. As there is already an independent complaints adjudicator for Ofsted and the adult learning inspector, it would be interesting to know precisely what is intended. We question why there is nothing in the Bill to guarantee the continued existence of the complaints adjudicator if such a role is to continue.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Our main concern is with the current role of the adjudicator. It is extremely limited, and nothing in the Minister&#039;s statement suggests that that will change. Apparently the adjudicator investigates complaints that Ofsted has failed to resolve using its internal complaints procedure. There are about 20 of those a year. Will the Minister say how the complaints procedure that is currently being developed will shape up? What ideas are there? What will be the role of the independent adjudicator? Will it remain as at present, or will it be expanded? Will there be slightly less of Ofsted being both judge and jury? Will the complaints procedure really be independent? That is what we hope for.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The amendments have come from the head teachers&#039; union and the National Union of Teachers, who are concerned that under present procedures there is not a fair method of appeal.

</p>

<a name="50113-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Given that we are in a new era and these new inspections will be short and sharp, at the moment the assumption is that the report will be published within three weeks. Yet, schools and teachers can be damned <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_389"></a>

by those reports. It is vital that there is a fair complaints procedure. These amendments aim to achieve that. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50113-11_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment and shall also speak to Amendments Nos.   46, 60, 74, 84, 89 and 90. I note with interest that the intention of Amendment No. 46 is similar to a number of amendments tabled by noble Lords from all opposition Benches. I shall own up now to say that our amendment is undoubtedly the weakest in drafting terms.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>With tongue firmly in cheek, perhaps I may suggest to the Minister that before we reach the next stage of the Bill, he, too, might attempt to draft his own version of the amendment. It would complete not only a full set from all sides of the House, but, given the evident strength of feeling, I suspect that we shall return to this issue throughout the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I have had a number of meetings with interested parties in which a common concern emerged that, under the reform system, there is an inadequate appeals process. The Government intend to speed up the inspection process and we welcome that. However, it should not be at the cost of putting into the public domain any reports that are manifestly inaccurate or unduly misleading. In speeding up the inspection process, there must be suitable safeguards to ensure that the school has a reasonable opportunity to comment on the draft report before wider publication. Careers of staff and, particularly, head teachers can be changed for ever with the publication of an Ofsted report&#151;not to mention the impact upon the morale, and the entire future of, a school. That aspect should not be rushed.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Amendment No. 46 would therefore ensure that the chief inspector could not publish an inspection report unless its contents had been agreed with the education establishment in question. We are trying to achieve a difficult balance, and, perhaps, that amendment would not quite address the issue, as it should. We are trying not to hamper the chief inspector in passing a suitable judgment on a school, but merely to ensure that inaccuracies are corrected. Equally, the school should have the right to appeal when it believes that the inspection has been conducted in a less than professional manner. Maybe that could be achieved by a longer interval between inspection and publication, to allow time for appeals to be conducted more discretely.
</p>

<a name="50113-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Our amendment would allow the Secretary of State to create by regulation an independent adjudicator who could examine any difference of opinion between the chief inspector and the education establishment regarding contested reports and would report on that, as necessary. The chief inspector would then have to take note and act upon any pronouncements from the adjudicator before publishing the final version of the report. We believe that this amendment would create an important appeal system that would help to guarantee the accuracy and fairness of inspection reports.

</p>

<a name="50113-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 84, 89 and 90 would have exactly the same effect as the amendments that I have described, but in relation to Wales and to the Welsh Assembly.

<a name="50113-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   In speaking to Amendment No. 49 in this group, I pray in aid the   support of my absent colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who would wish to make some points that I shall try to describe.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Amendment No. 49 follows others in this group in seeking a fair and clear appeals procedure and we support the thrust of them. This amendment takes on board the difficulty of encapsulating all that should be on the face of the Bill, so we seek a requirement to have regulations dealing with this matter, which may have to be altered from time to time as we learn through experience. One of the points of our amendment has already been made&#151;the damage done to a school by a bad report can be considerable. As the chief inspector in post when the first school in England was declared by an HMI report to be failing, I do not flinch from speaking the truth, if that is the reality.

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>On the other hand&#151;such points were made by the noble Lords, Lord Dearing, Lord Tombs, and others, in a debate about Ofsted in September last year&#151;I am aware of the damage that a report can do. If that report is not wholly fair and accurate, the damage is almost infinite, because no retraction will receive the same publicity as the first negative report. Hence, our amendment reflects our keenness for a requirement that a report should not be published until any reasonable appeal or correction in terms of accuracy is received by the chief inspector. We are moderate in what we say thereafter, but it is vital that the chief inspector has total confidence in the report, which means giving a school the opportunity to point out errors in procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="50113-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 84, 89 and 90, to which I have added my name, although they share the imperfections that my noble friend on the Front Bench attributed to the similar system of appeal that is proposed for England by my noble friends. Amendment No. 49, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, may well be more appropriate, although I am not sure that even that achieves perfection.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The whole point of inspection is to appreciate what a school is doing right and to identify where it is performing inadequately and going wrong. The latter element may become hurtful, especially when the identified defects are obvious to outsiders, but not so obvious to those who become over-familiar with them <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_391"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 391</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and ignore them. Criticism of that kind is inevitable in any inspection report and so, arguably, is the hurt that goes with it, unless some special steps are taken to soften the tone of criticism.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I was reminded by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the NUT has referred to the punitive nature of past inspections. That punitive element is certainly present in any kind of critical inspection report. Our real concern is the possibility of gross error or misjudgement by inspectors. We are all human and mistakes can be made which appear in reports. That becomes more likely as inspections become shorter and sharper. When such mistakes occur, they can be grossly damaging to the reputation of schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Ideally, schools should have prior knowledge of the contents of inspectors&#039; reports, and steps have been taken to ensure that schools are aware of the drafts. Whether they should actually approve of reports before their publication is a totally different matter. I think that it will be very difficult to secure such approval. But if there are serious errors in a report, schools should have some remedy. They should be able to remonstrate with the inspectors at an early stage and, if necessary, appeal to a higher authority.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The higher authority seems to be within, or related to, the inspectorate. As always in such circumstances, the question arises of <i>quis custodiet custodes</i>&#151;who inspects the inspectors? The obvious answer is the chief inspector. So far as concerns Wales, there is to be provision to remove an inspector from the register and that is to be preserved for the time being in Wales.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>However, so far as I understand it, the existing system does not provide the appropriate answer for a school which believes that it has been very wrongly represented in an inspector&#039;s report. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the chief inspector cannot be judge and jury in these matters and there must be an independent system of appeal of some kind. I do not suggest for a moment that in our amendments any of us have achieved such an independent system, but I am sure that the Minister has grasped the fact that such an independent system is required.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="50113-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   I rise briefly to support all the amendments. There is a really important point of principle here and, wider than that, of natural justice. Clearly the old procedure had flaws and I am sure that that is being investigated by the Government. Indeed, I am hopeful that we shall hear from the Minister a satisfactory answer to all the points raised. The three issues are: first, it is imperative that there should be a short period before the report is published; secondly, the effect on parents and others of the standards provided by the schools should be taken into account; and, thirdly, it is important that an inspector should be independent of Ofsted. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer all those points and that he will be able to satisfy all those who tabled the amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="50113-12_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   I also support all the   amendments&#151;particularly Amendment No. 49, which certainly comes closest to addressing the points <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_392"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 392</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about which I feel most concern in relation to the current procedure. Because the period of time over which the inspection and report are carried out will be fairly short, it will be all the more difficult for the report to be accurate factually.

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>We are addressing two separate issues: one is that of a school&#039;s complaint against the judgments made; and the second is that addressed by Amendment No. 49 where a simple factual error has occurred. The school must be given an opportunity to put that right&#151;not only for its own sake but also for the sake of the reputation of the inspectorate. It is very easy for a school not to produce the evidence of an activity that it undertakes. I can think of examples where the inspectorate&#039;s report has said that it is unfortunate that very little effort is made on out-of-school activities. It may simply be that the school was not asked the question sharply enough or in a form that it understood and therefore it did not produce the evidence. Once the school sees that that is what the report says, it can produce a mass of evidence that it is doing all kinds of things.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>This is a simple issue, but it concerns the reputation of   the inspection process and what it can achieve, the reputation of the inspectorate and, of course, the reputation of the school and the accuracy of the report. It is vital that there is an opportunity for such dialogue between the inspectorate&#151;particularly the writer of the   report&#151;and the school so that the report is correct. The issue of an appeal against the judgments is far more substantial and difficult.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="50113-12_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The amendments concern a very important set of issues and this has been a clear and focused debate. We very much accept that the quality and credibility of the complaints process and the ability to resolve disputes, which is ideally what the complaints process should be about, is integral to the development of the new system.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Perhaps I may give a little of the background before I go into the specifics of the amendments. We are not starting from a position that the process is a disaster. Clearly, in the vast majority of cases under the current system there is a high level of satisfaction with the inspection processes. When Ofsted carried out a post-inspection survey in 2002&#150;03, of the 2,811 head teachers who responded to it, 90 per cent agreed that the inspection judgments relating to their schools were fair and accurate. I consider that to be a remarkably high satisfaction rate. Of course, that does not mean that there is total justice for everyone; it simply means that, from what head teachers are saying, there is at least a good sense that, by and large, what is being done is pretty impressive.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>We hope that our proposals for inspection will bring greater consistency and reliability of judgment. Perhaps I may talk about the process for making the judgments before I deal with the process for handling complaints.

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>First, self-evaluation, which underpins the format, puts the school at the centre of the process and engages it in a meaningful and, it is hoped, professional dialogue with the inspectors about the school&#039;s performance. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_393"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 393</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

participation should contribute to greater reliability. In other words, Ofsted is not going in and making 1,000 judgments; the school is making its appraisal and the inspector is then having dialogue and listening to testimony.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Secondly, increasingly both schools and inspectors will have access to more sophisticated data. Through the Bill, we are also seeking to make the chief inspector directly accountable and responsible for inspections and reports. That will provide a powerful incentive to ensure that he secures the highest possible standards in delivery.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The Bill also seeks to enable the chief inspector to make greater use of his professional HMI workforce in conducting inspections and assuring their quality. These changes will enable Ofsted to make important improvements to the quality assurance process itself. In addition, every draft report will be reviewed and signed off by an HMI managing inspector. Records will be maintained on the performance of each inspector&#151;HMI included&#151;and those will be used to inform the performance management process.

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Furthermore, where the inspection team forms the view that a school is causing concern, the school will be given feedback, including that provisional judgment. This will trigger a process of moderation, involving senior members of HMI, to test and confirm that the evidence supports the judgment. All that will build even further on what we think is a good base of reliability and consistency of inspections and inspection judgments. That is the basic system.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I move on to the issue of complaints handling. Ofsted is now developing a new procedure for resolving concerns at the earliest possible opportunity. In many cases, this process will take place during or shortly after the inspection. Schools that have concerns about the way in which the inspection is heading, including the emerging findings, will in future have access to a helpline where they can discuss those concerns with a professional who is independent of the inspection team. Where necessary, it will be possible for an HMI managing inspector to visit the school during or shortly after the event as part of the process of seeking early resolution of the concerns of the school.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I shall talk later about the independent process but I emphasise that, in terms of achieving effective justice, the quality of the informal process is crucial. If we simply rely on formal processes, we are less likely to achieve justice than if we have a culture and a system in which an attempt is made to achieve early resolution within the system.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="50113-12_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>These improvements are possible because of the changes being introduced by the Bill, which will make the chief inspector directly responsible for all inspections and reports. Currently, registered inspectors are responsible for the reports that they produce. This makes it extremely difficult for the chief inspector to secure early resolution of concerns. In a situation where the chief inspector thought that an adjustment was necessary, he has very little power or locus should the registered inspector say, &quot;No&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_394"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 394</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Therefore, Ofsted will shortly be consulting teacher and governor associations on the informal process that I have outlined. In addition, there will be formal processes and the formal complaints process, which will be necessary only where the early resolution action does not satisfy the school. The formal complaint procedure will   be rigorous, involving a number of different management tiers within Ofsted and will culminate where necessary with a final review&#151;separate from Ofsted&#151;by an independent adjudicator.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The adjudicator will look at complaints about aspects of the inspection or conduct of an inspector and at how Ofsted has managed complaints. She&#151;it is a she&#151;will look at complaints about inspections, the content of Ofsted and its staff and she may involve the conduct of inspections, the quality of reports, mistakes, delays or the response provided to complaints. If Ofsted do not accept her recommendations, it must publish the reasons. In direct answer to the question: essentially it is the same system as at present; but, on the independence issue, the independent complaints adjudicator is appointed by the Secretary of State and, therefore, is separate from Ofsted. Her independence is protected by that process.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The issue of whether the publication of reports should be delayed until complaints are resolved is sensitive and tricky. Where a school has a complaint, it is right that it has proper access to every stage of the complaints procedure, including external adjudication. A number of amendments have called for the chief inspector to delay publication of a report while a complaint is being considered. On occasion, delaying publication will be the right thing to do. That happened on one occasion during the trials.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>While on the face of it delaying reports where a complaint is ongoing seems just, making that a feature of the inspection arrangements could be bound to encourage complaints to become more protracted. It could also provide an incentive to make a complaint, particularly if the school did not like the findings&#151;regardless of the evidence&#151;leading to an unnecessarily long and drawn out process. That would not be in the interests of parents or children because they would face substantial delays in getting reports which identified issues that needed to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Therefore, we need to strike a balance between the importance of schools being able to make complaints and challenging inspection findings when they think that they are wrong in fact or wrong in judgment and the right of parents and pupils to proper, timely information. The chief inspector will publish reports only when he is satisfied that they meet his quality requirements. The Bill provides him with flexibility to do that. Therefore, he will delay when he deems that is necessary, but delay must not become the norm.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I appreciate the feelings behind this group of amendments. We want our schools to have confidence that the inspection team is skilled, but there is an opportunity for the school to make representations about fact, process and judgment before matters are finalised.

</p>

<a name="50113-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Ofsted already is committed to a complaints procedure that I have covered in detail. In short, the chief inspector, under the new system, will ensure that no <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_395"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 395</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report is published until the school has had the opportunity to comment and provide additional evidence where appropriate. The introduction of new informal processes focused on early resolution and a rigorous formal process developed through consultation with key stakeholders has to be the right way forward. I stress that the informal process followed by the formal process of Ofsted is in addition to the independent process to the independent complaints adjudicator.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>On Wales, I shall speak first to Amendment No. 86, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp. It would add a power by regulation to appoint an independent adjudicator, who would be required to consider complaints lodged against the conduct of a school inspection. That could include complaints that an inspection had been conducted in a manner inconsistent with legal requirements.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>In such circumstances, the chief inspector would be required to act in accordance with the findings of the adjudicator. It is quite right that there should be clear and readily available avenues for redress for those who wish to lodge complaints about both the conduct of a school inspection and the findings in an inspection report. That is why Estyn has detailed and transparent procedures for the handling of such complaints.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The procedures are published and made widely available. They provide for complaints to be lodged initially with the lead inspector. If not satisfied with the response, the complainant may require the issues identified to be considered by senior HMI and ultimately by the chief inspector. Those dissatisfied with the conduct of an inspection can approach the Welsh Administration ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Initial consideration has been given to the appointment of an independent adjudicator in Wales akin to the post put in place by Ofsted in partnership with the Adult Learning Inspectorate. However, given the relatively small number of complaints received each year alongside the ready access to the Welsh Administration ombudsman, we do not believe that such an appointment would improve current procedures or provide value for money. So we do not propose any action in Wales at present, although we shall keep the matter under review.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Amendment No. 84 would require any complaint made by a school to be resolved before the inspection report was published. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, had a twinkle in his eye when he recognised what that implied. I would love to be in negotiation with a party whereby nothing could move forward until I was satisfied. Of course, that is a power of veto. I recognise that that is not what was intended, but it illustrates the difficulty of legislating in that form.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>It is quite right that an inspection report should not be published without the prior knowledge of a school. Current procedures already provide for that. I have sought to illustrate how we shall go into that further in terms of ensuring very active participation with the school about the report and its draft findings. There must be opportunities throughout the inspection to discuss the inspection findings.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_396"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 396</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-12_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>There must also be opportunities for formal challenge to both the professional judgments and opinions expressed. Again, Estyn has such procedures which are published and made widely available. Ultimately, the professional opinion of the inspectorate has to be recognised and accepted. In a sense, the power of the ombudsman in that respect and of the independent adjudicator is foursquare with the power of ombudsmen elsewhere: they can make findings, but they cannot overturn the decision, otherwise the independence of the inspectorate is compromised. However, when a complaint has been made, it is an unwise body that does not listen seriously.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>With regard to the processes and procedures followed during an inspection, it is right that schools should have access to further and independent avenues for redress. Those dissatisfied with the conduct of an inspection or with how Estyn has managed the complaint can approach the Welsh Administration ombudsman, as I have said.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I have covered the point about delay and not publishing until there is agreement.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 brought forward by the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Roberts of Conwy, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, would establish procedures by which maintained schools and non-maintained schools would not be required to make an inspection report available or take reasonable steps to ensure parents receive a copy until any appeals by the school have been finalised. That links with Amendment No. 84 to Clause 27, which would require a complaint to be resolved.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I can only emphasise that it cannot be right that an inspection report should not be distributed to parents and others simply because the school disagrees with the report. As I have already indicated, there must, of course, be opportunities for schools throughout the process to be able to challenge findings of fact and judgment. There is a flaw in saying that the report cannot be published until the school is happy, as I have already pointed out.
</p>

<a name="50113-12_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I have spoken at length. This is an important debate. I believe that I have fully answered the points raised&#151;but this is not the first time that I have said that. I was invited by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, to draft my own amendment. I thought one of the purposes of being in government was that one did not have to draft one&#039;s own amendments. Nevertheless, I understand what she says. I shall read what has been said to see whether anything further is needed. At this point I am unpersuaded that we have not put on the record an adequate set of responses, but, as ever, we shall reflect on the situation. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="50113-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Craig of Radley </b>   rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what progress has been made on the Typhoon (Eurofighter) programme and the aircraft&#039;s introduction into service with the Royal Air Force.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The noble and gallant Lord said: My Lords, since I tabled the Question the contract for a second tranche of 89 Eurofighter Typhoons has been signed. This is a good moment to learn more about this aircraft, which will be a key addition to our defence capabilities.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an indication of the delivery rate for these new aircraft, the proposed programme for the procurement of a further tranche of aircraft for the RAF and the prospects for orders from countries outside our immediate collaborative partners.

</p>

<a name="50113-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Thanks to the good offices of the Minister and the Chief of the Air Staff, I recently went to RAF Coningsby to meet people actively involved with Typhoon. Those who had flown the aircraft were full of praise for its performance; some even used the word &quot;awesome&quot;&#151;not the sort of phrase normally associated with top-gun fighter pilots. Two aircraft, one with no more than a dozen flight hours on the clock, had been deployed to Singapore only a short time before my visit&#151;a most impressive achievement, both operationally and logistically.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_398"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 398</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Listening to all of this and briefs about immediate plans for the future work at RAF Coningsby was stimulating. For me it could only be bettered in one way: that I should try out Typhoon for myself. So, with a medical check for fitness and a ministerial blessing, this 75 year-old did just that. Even nearly 20 years on since I last flew a fighter aircraft, I found it a delight to fly and easy to handle. I soon started to understand and follow   the latest instrumentation and enjoy the aircraft&#039;s fantastically impressive performance. It was a marvellous finale to my erstwhile involvement with this programme, but a stark reminder of the time taken from a go ahead to reaching operational capability.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Eighteen years ago, in 1987, when I was Chief of the Air Staff, I signed, along with my opposite numbers from Germany, Italy and Spain, the revised European air staffs&#039; operational requirement for a new fighter which our four air forces were most anxious to have.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Time is too short to remind your Lordships of the many years, even before that date, that the RAF and the other air forces had striven to find common ground for the design and production of a single type of aircraft to meet our various most pressing operational needs. For the RAF it was then to fill a key void in our range of capabilities&#151;an air superiority fighter, but, using an airframe capable of undertaking other, offensive, operations. Such flexibility is highly desirable. It allows for re-roling of the airframe throughout its service life.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Air superiority means to have the performance edge to achieve and maintain dominance over the enemy in the airspaces above and adjacent to our own side&#039;s forces, and is vital for our ground and maritime forces as we become ever more committed to expeditionary-type operations.

</p>

<a name="50113-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>It was the chiefs of air staff expectation when we signed the operational requirement that prototypes would be flying in the early 1990s, and we would have aircraft in front-line service by the mid-1990s. Now, a decade later, this aspiration is only just beginning to become a reality.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Such delay is not a new experience for the RAF. Collaborative programmes suffer the risk of far greater delay and a failure to achieve development milestones than is likely with a national one. In Typhoon&#039;s case this has been a considerable, but by no means the only, part of the reason for such protracted progress. The German Government of the early 1990s became disillusioned with the programme; so much so, that they withdrew.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Although they eventually returned, this was a major delay factor, and the repercussions within the partner countries, including our own while we re-evaluated the   cost-effectiveness of a programme without Germany, simply compounded the delay. All high-cost collaborative programmes of this type require revalidation by incoming governments, and the wider the collaboration, the greater the possibilities of such reviews causing delay.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Moreover, complex and innovative technology, such as that used by Typhoon, brings its own problems. Software writing and validation, especially when both flight and engine controls are all computer driven, has to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_399"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 399</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be right. The risks involved if there are software errors can be catastrophic, not just for the aircraft in the air, but for the whole future of the programme.

</p>

<a name="50113-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>It is for these reasons, based on experience with a number of programmes over the past 40 years, that I remain concerned about the validity of milestones predicted for new collaborative equipments. It is hazarding our airpower capability to withdraw equipment such as Jaguar and Sea Harrier when replacements are still in early development, even hardly off the drawing board. Delays are sometimes beyond national control; no amount of smart procurement can offset them.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>In Typhoon&#039;s case the first development airframes started flying in 1994. Ten years later only 10 two-seater aircraft from the first batch of tranche one were in RAF hands.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Even if all goes exactly to plan with operational evaluation and the training of squadron pilots, a significant front-line capability with this aircraft is still some time into the future. No doubt the Minister will be able to give the House an outline of the RAF&#039;s plans for this phase in the introduction of the aircraft to service.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Delays like those I have outlined lead inevitably to cost increases, either directly, attributable to the programme itself, or&#151;and this is often overlooked by commentators&#151;in run-on costs of aircraft and equipment due to have been withdrawn, and the extra training and support costs for them. These additional costs press heavily in short-term budgets.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Another often repeated criticism is that the aircraft was designed for the Cold War so that it is an expensive white elephant&#151;no use against asymmetric threats like Osama bin Laden or other terrorists groups. Such criticism is very wide of the mark. Do not forget that the Americans and ourselves actually hold fighters at readiness to deal with hijacked aircraft, though I sincerely hope as a successful deterrent to such an attack.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>And who will assert with confidence in the 30 or more years of the life of Typhoon that there will be no other even more serious threat to which this country will respond? Since the end of the Cold War&#151;and going back even before that&#151;in the past quarter of a century we have been using both high-quality defence and offensive air power operationally on many occasions, and particularly in the past decade.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Typhoon will give the RAF the edge over other opposition&#151;one hopes deterring them from attacking our ground and maritime forces, but, if not, finding that Typhoon is master. It would be morally indefensible to equip our pilots to take on the enemy in the air without a better than evens chance of being the victor.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree that Typhoon and other advanced equipments achieve the expected performance only if their pilots and ground crews are highly motivated and well trained. That has been the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_400"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 400</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hallmark of the Royal Air Force since its inception. Today&#039;s personnel can rightly be proud of their service, with an aircraft such as Typhoon.
</p>

<a name="50113-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Typhoon, when it has been fitted out with its full potential and its pilots have gained experience with its capabilities, will provide that winning edge in any theatre of war for the next 20 or 30 years. It is truly an awesome aircraft.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="50113-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, for arranging this opportunity to review the progress of the introduction of Eurofighter Typhoon. I declare a past interest: I served on the air staff in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the noble and gallant Lord&#039;s leadership, and we were often interested in the progress of this project.

</p>

<a name="50113-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>As the noble and gallant Lord said, we can track progress back over a very long period. One can look at the origins in the air staff target laid down in 1972 for an air superiority fighter. The changing nomenclature gives us a feel for the complexity of bringing the deal to fruition. We had ECA (European Combat Aircraft), ECF (European Combat Fighter), ACA (Agile Combat Aircraft), EAP (European Aircraft Programme), FEFA (Future European Fighter Aircraft), EFA (European Fighter Aircraft), Eurofighter, EF2000 and now Typhoon. We had a three-nation collaborative programme with France and Germany at the start, but in the end our requirements differed too much. The French requirement to be able to operate from an aircraft carrier perhaps looks more foresighted now than it did then. The 1980s saw the entry of Italy and Spain into the partnership as we lost France.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>In looking back at this long and challenging programme we must remember the important part that technology demonstrators played in how it was put together. The EAP demonstrator prototype flew in 1985, just over two years after the production contract was let. That demonstrator had nearly six years of flying, which allowed much of the development work to be tested before going final on the Eurofighter itself. It was perhaps overconfident, although it did not seem so at the time, to rename the aircraft Eurofighter 2000 in late 1992. The first development aircraft flew in 1994, the tranche one contract was signed in late 1998 and the first instrument production aircraft flights took place in April 2002. The formal delivery of aircraft to the four nations took place in June last year, and, as we have heard from the Minister, we have now signed up for the second tranche.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Some commentators look at this long history as though the Eurofighter is a legacy system of the Cold War, but that assessment is absolutely wrong. We can be proud that we have produced an appropriate capability for the current security challenges. In the Cold War we faced a geographically well defined threat, which required long-range air interception. The F3 Tornado was an appropriate capability for that. Now the agile fighter, with an ability to use a range of <br>&nbsp;<br>

smart weapons systems, is an important part of any nation&#039;s armoury. The long history of development and testing of the technology has allowed that capability to adapt to the changing requirement. So it is not a legacy system; it is an up-to-date system.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>We might have gone down the same route as the Americans did of producing a very high cost stealth fighter optimised against a Soviet threat. We see that in the United States F22 Raptor. There have been unclassified reports of simulated combat using the various options available today, ranging from the F22 to cheaper fighters. If you put an F22 against a Sukhoi Su-35 in unclassified informal tests in network simulators, you manage to shoot down 10 Su-35s for every F22 that you lose. If you do it with Eurofighter you manage to shoot down 4.5 aircraft for every Typhoon that you lose. The next best air superiority capability using the same missile systems is the Rafale, which shares a one-for-one exchange rate. F15s, F18s and F16s are all less than unity. We are buying one of the best capabilities. Those are unclassified results, but they give an idea of the order of the advance in our performance and what we are getting.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I wish to deal briefly with the question of price, because it is often said that this is an expensive capability. All modern combat aircraft are expensive, but we are getting an extraordinary capability at what seems a good price. It is difficult to predict the ultimate cost of any particular aircraft system without knowing   what the Minister and his Government will do about tranche three. One must spread the costs of development over the total fleet. Nevertheless, one can cost it from the price charged to the Austrians, whose aircraft is reported to cost 62 million euros a copy. I imagine that ours will be slightly more expensive. According to the Minister&#039;s figures for tranche two, given in his statement and his letter, the cost is about &#163;50 million a copy or thereabouts.

</p>

<a name="50113-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>By comparison, the latest figures for the F22 are 42   billion dollars for the 276 that they originally planned to buy&#151;152 million dollars each. But they are going to reduce those numbers, so the price will rise, making each aircraft even more expensive. Despite the fall in the dollar, Eurofighter&#039;s capability will be extraordinarily good value for money. That has serious implications for its ability as an export product, when other nations look at where they want to go with that sort of aircraft.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Although the Eurofighter is good value in military aircraft terms, there is still the question of costs. As we all know, it is a time of enormous strain on the defence budget. I assume that the Minister will search for ways to keep costs down. Convincing more of our allies to buy Eurofighter would be a good starting point. In that respect we are missing a great opportunity for encouraging sales, while at the same time reducing our own operating costs and increasing overall European capabilities.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The four nations that have now committed will get nearly 400 aircraft. If tranche three goes ahead&#151;we will perhaps talk about that on Monday&#151;the figure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_402"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 402</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will rise to more than 600. That is a serious capability for Europe, which the United States will really take notice of. If we looked at ways to operate the fleet on a more shared basis, there could be significant cost savings in maintenance logistics and training. It would also have the advantage of smaller European air forces being able to operate a few aircraft put into the bigger pool without having to set up the infrastructure normally associated with high-performance aircraft.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Some of that opportunity has already been lost as the four nations have set up their own national arrangements. I do not doubt that in years to come we shall be under great resource pressure; we will look for ways to co-operate and rationalise beyond our own shores. I would like us to consider at some stage operating the Eurofighter force more as a pooled fleet; after all, we are prepared to do it with the Trident missile system with the US. I understand the political difficulties at this stage, but we must not freeze out the option. In that regard we can learn from our experience with the Tornado. In the end, we had to give up the tri-national unit on the Tornado at RAF Cottesmore because each nation had independently modified its Tornado fleet so much that there was not enough commonality in the systems to make common training useful any more. I ask the Minister to look hard at the advantages of keeping all nations&#039; Eurofighters modified to a common standard so that the advantages of shared costs are still open to be exploited if we need to.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>When the Minister reports on the progress of the programme, I trust that he will include an update on the state of simulator support. After the problems with   the Apache programme over the provision of simulation, we need to ensure that it is coming on-stream for the Eurofighter in the right timescale.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Simulation has other important benefits. The use of network simulators will make training time much more productive. While aircrew will continue to need training time in the air, we have argued for many years that technology will change the balance of that time in the cockpit and the time in the simulator. That will have not only cost benefits but environmental benefits as well. Perhaps the Minister could indicate how the balance will be changed by the introduction of Eurofighter with its simulators into service.

</p>

<a name="50113-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The reduction in fast-jet numbers under the latest RAF drawdown will presumably have eased the shortage of pilots. However, we are looking now at the introduction of Eurofighter, the continuation of Tornado F3 for a slight overlap, the continuation of Tornado GR4, and then the Harrier/JSF transition to come. All of that will require a sustainable long-term plan for sufficient numbers of fast-jet aircrew. I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the current plans will be able to sustain the necessary numbers.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>In addition, if we are moving towards a smaller fleet of aircraft overall, they will need to be used as efficiently as possible. So perhaps there is a case for raising the aircrew-to-aircraft ratio. Are we looking at that, and what plans does the Minister have?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_403"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 403</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>We on these Benches very much welcome the precision attack capability development. This is not just an air superiority fighter but will be capable of air-to-ground missions. That raises another question. How do we organise those different capabilities? It appears that we are still looking at having different air defence and ground attack squadrons and specialisations. Is that sensible any more? Are we looking at crews being multi-roled rather than specialised as they have been in the past? We need to be thinking of more imaginative approaches in the light of the experiences of other nations and the new changing requirements we have in terms of the operations we do.
</p>

<a name="50113-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Finally, I congratulate the Minister. He has had responsibility for defence procurement, seeing the first tranche into service and signing the contract for the second tranche. This is an important defence capability. The technology has been developed within Europe and the export potential is significant.

<a name="50113-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Luke: </b>   My Lords, I also should like to thank the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, for initiating this debate, on an issue which, judging by the press it is constantly receiving, can indeed be considered topical. It has been a most interesting and exceedingly well informed discussion covering a range of points which are most pertinent to the subject. I will not try to reiterate too many of those already made today, especially considering the transcendent expertise of the noble Lords who have just spoken.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The operational arrival of the Eurofighter Typhoon&#151;a really excellent aircraft, I have heard from all sources&#151;is critical to bringing the RAF&#039;s capabilities into line with those required in an air force in the 21st century. Once fully operational, it will have replaced the F3 Tornado in the air defence role and, when the ground-attack variant of the Typhoon is developed, also the Jaguar and its ground attack and reconnaissance role. It will therefore become the RAF&#039;s premier swing-role strike fighter.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Could the Minister please tell us more about the planned retirement of the F3 Tornados? When deliveries of the first tranche of Typhoon are complete, will the F3s be offered for sale to allies not involved in the Typhoon programme or will they be scrapped? Could he also tell the House when he expects to conclude a contract with the manufacturers on the ground-attack variant? Is this likely to cost more over and above the Typhoon budget as it is at present?
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>We on these Benches recognise that the Typhoon will play an increasingly important role in our air defence over the next 30 years. To those who suggest&#151;as it has been suggested really rather a lot in the media&#151;that the aircraft is obsolete and irrelevant, I say that without command of the air, ground and sea based forces are placed at serious risk. Of course we recognise that this four-nation project has been over budget and behind schedule, and that is putting it pretty mildly, but that is partly attributable to the collaborative nature of the project and partly to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_404"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 404</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

advances in technology incorporated in it. In terms of upgrades, can the Minister tell me whether there are likely to be any significant advances in software between the first and second tranche?
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>There is no doubt that these planes are prime examples of a new military technology and that the contracts to build them are providing significant employment both here and abroad and will continue to do so for a number of years. In fact, as I understand it, we are now at a point where cancellation of tranche three would, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned, be almost as expensive as going ahead. Could the Minister please confirm whether that is the case?
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Much has been said about the Typhoon itself; however, these aircraft will not be of much use without sufficient trained pilots to fly them and indeed technicians to maintain them. Like the noble Lord, Lord Garden, I am a little worried whether there are enough trained pilots and technicians for the first tranche and indeed whether there will be enough coming along for the second and possibly the third tranche later on.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>My eye was caught by a piece in the <i>Times</i> last week, with which I am sure that most of your Lordships will be familiar, concerning an alleged dispute at a senior level within the MoD that it is no longer feasible or affordable for the Government to go ahead with both the Typhoon and the planned aircraft carriers. What is the Minister&#039;s response to the article? Is his department indeed considering axing or curtailing one or other of these extremely expensive projects?

</p>

<a name="50113-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I should also like to ask the Minister what effect the cost overruns such as that seen with the Typhoon will have on other parts of the defence budget. I understand that the 20 largest major procurement projects which were originally intended to cost &#163;44 billion have now risen to &#163;50 billion, an increase of 14 per cent. From where will the money come to pay for those costs?
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>It seems that the Government are unable to manage their major procurements efficiently enough, and that means that our frontline forces have had to suffer under-funding. Our defence budget is already seriously overstretched, and as we are quite rightly committed to numerous major defence projects vital to delivering our future security at the same time as more of our Armed Forces are deployed than at any time in recent years, we simply cannot afford these endless cost overruns and interminable delays. Can the Minister inform the House what contingency arrangements the Government have made to cover any increase in costs that the next two tranches of Typhoon may incur?
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The strategic value of this impressive swing-role aircraft will undoubtedly and unquestionably benefit our   Armed Forces immeasurably, but the delay and overspend on a project that is far from completed, and the commitment of funds during a period of extremely sensitive defence cuts elsewhere in the Armed Forces, casts a distinct shadow over the political handling of this project. Nevertheless, I look forward very much, as always, to listening to the response of the Minister.

<a name="50113-15_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, I too congratulate the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, on securing this debate. I should like to thank him and the other noble Lords who have spoken for their contributions and particularly for their support, well expressed in every case, for this project. This project is an extremely important programme for the future.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, and I stand out as the only two speakers who have not had the experience of the RAF at the very senior level that both the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and the noble Lord, Lord Garden, have enjoyed. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Luke, will forgive me if I say that the two of them spoke with obviously much more experience and expertise than perhaps he and certainly I can manage on this occasion. I am very grateful for what they have said. It is good that both were young enough to have been around at the start of this project.

</p>

<a name="50113-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>A view that I am sure will be common to all Members of the House is that no matter how technologically advanced our equipment is or may become, we rely first and foremost on the quality of those who fly these aircraft and those who prepare them for flight. I am sure that the House will agree that in the RAF, as in all our Armed Forces, frankly we have the very best.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>However, the dedication and professionalism of our service personnel must be supported by provision of the equipment that they need to do their job effectively. The order placed last month for the second tranche of Typhoon is solid evidence of our commitment to provide our people with the best equipment.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Typhoon will provide the RAF and our partners&#039; airforces with an outstanding combat aircraft that, with its multi-role capability&#151;and I break off now to say that there will not be some kind of multi-role variant, this is a multi-role aircraft now&#151;its flexibility and its adaptability will provide the cornerstone of their fighting capability well into the 21st century. Recent operations, most recently in Iraq, have demonstrated the vital role of air power on the modern battlefield. In Typhoon we have an aircraft capable of extending this capability and meeting the threats of the future, which will enable our RAF to deliver its effects within a wider, network-enabled capability, both with our own armed services and with our allies.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It is right to say that Typhoon started out as an air superiority fighter with a secondary ground-attack capability, and commentators&#151;both distinguished and yet still uninformed&#151;still criticise it as a Cold War relic. I was particularly glad to hear what the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, and the noble Lord, Lord Garden, said in dismissing that criticism. However, as we all know, today&#039;s operational environment demands much greater emphasis on all-weather precision and stand-off attack, while retaining the air superiority role. The Typhoon of today has been developed to meet this requirement and we will continue to adapt it throughout its life to maintain both its effectiveness and its superiority.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_406"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 406</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The measures being taken to ensure an early air-to-surface capability for the tranche one aircraft provide a good example of how we are adapting Typhoon to the needs of today&#039;s and tomorrow&#039;s RAF. That will   be achieved through the provision of a laser designation pod and precision-guided bombs&#151;in this case, Enhanced Paveway II. The flexibility to equip the aircraft to meet the weapon requirements of individual partner nations is an important feature of the aircraft, which we will be exploiting. But the majority of the aircraft is common to all partner nations, including the airframe structure, engines, avionics, flight and utility controls. We are intending, as are all nations involved, to operate our own aircraft. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Garden, will be pleased to be reminded that the partner nations have developed the integrated weapon support system in order to maximise the commonality of support requirements. I take on board the points he made about that.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>In due course, the tranche one aircraft will be brought up to tranche two standards. To answer the noble Lord, Lord Luke, tranche two has increased and better software. That will create a truly multi-role fleet, equipped to complement other air and land forces in a wide variety of theatres worldwide.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Perhaps I may refer briefly to tranche three. Under the four nation Memorandum of Understanding that underpins the Typhoon joint programme, the UK has undertaken to procure 232 aircraft out of a total production of 620; 55 were ordered in tranche one, with an additional 89 aircraft being purchased in the second tranche. Decisions on tranche three are not required before 2007.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>I have so far spoken about capability. I turn to the significant progress we have made with Typhoon&#039;s introduction to service with the RAF, which has already taken delivery of 10 tranche one aircraft. We expect to continue delivering aircraft at a rate of approximately 13 per year. Industry does, however, have the capacity to increase production to cope with export orders.

</p>

<a name="50113-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Typhoon has now flown over 650 sorties, equating to over 900 flying hours, and is supported by BAE Systems under the very successful Case White industrial partnering arrangements. Under Case White, Typhoon is matching, and indeed exceeding, expectations, not only in its flying performance but also in terms of its reliability and availability. Since the RAF flying started, only about 3 per cent of planned flights have had to be aborted due to aircraft issues. Such a record of reliability is particularly impressive in an aircraft of this sophistication so recently introduced into service. The best example of this excellent reliability was demonstrated last year by the deployment of two brand-new aircraft to Singapore to take part in the Republic of Singapore Air Force evaluations. That is a testament to the quality of the product and to the effective working relations developed between the Royal Air Force and BAE Systems.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Consequently, it is no surprise that interest in the aircraft has been shown by a number of other nations, and we are actively supporting industry in seeking <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_407"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 407</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

export orders. We have a special four nation committee dealing with exports alone. Others clearly recognise the aircraft&#039;s merits. Mention has been made of Austria, which has ordered 18. That is excellent news both for the Government, because it spreads the costs, and for our economy by providing high-quality work for a skilled workforce.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>We are now moving towards the next major milestone in the programme&#151;the move of the RAF Typhoon squadrons to RAF Coningsby and the build-up of the Typhoon fleet. That embraces a wide range of military planning, including the standing down of the existing systems&#151;such as Jaguar and Tornado F3&#151;that it will replace, the very significant personnel implications of introducing a new aircraft into service, and the preparation of infrastructure at the RAF stations from which Typhoon will operate. F3s will be put into our normal disposal system, which may include onward sale to third parties or&#151;and I hope not&#151;sale for scrap, as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Preparations are almost complete following a large programme of renovation and new-build projects that will provide a modern state-of-the-art base for this state-of-the-art aircraft. Much of the RAF&#039;s current focus is on bringing Typhoon into service at Coningsby.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>We will see the Typhoon Operational Conversion Unit and the Operational Evaluation Unit move to Coningsby later this year and the build-up of the unit&#039;s operational Typhoon force during 2006 and the year following. I can assure the House that we will have sufficient pilots to operate our fast jet fleet.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The Typhoon squadrons&#151;and I hope that this will please the noble Lord, Lord Garden&#151;will be multi-role and will replace the current single-role Tornado F3 and Jaguar squadrons. The transfer of squadrons to Coningsby kicks off Typhoon&#039;s role as a central part of Britain&#039;s fighting capability&#151;a role that will last a very long time into this century.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>A vital part of establishing our multi-role squadrons is having properly trained pilots to fly and operate the aircraft. We will provide a balanced mix of simulators and live training and have invested a significant effort to ensure that the balance is right. The balance between simulator and in-training is kept under constant review and we are confident that we have the   right balance. Before proceeding with ASTA&#151;the training programme connected with this project&#151;the investment decision process included a full training needs analysis and investment appraisal that ensured a cost-effective balance between simulator and on-aircraft training.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Defence investments do not get much larger than Typhoon. Some might say that we should have signed up to tranche two earlier, but, on such an important investment, it was essential that we got the contract right. I am delighted that we have been able to work with our partner nations and industry to conclude tranche two negotiations. I thank all those involved for their sterling efforts in achieving that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_408"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 408</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-15_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The tranche two order is worth some &#163;4.3 billion. That is a huge investment in front-line capability that will provide the RAF with 89 aircraft in addition to the 55 already on order under tranche one. Typhoon is not in competition with any other large project. The noble Lord, Lord Luke, asked me about that with regard to an article in the <i>Times</i> last week. There is no competition between the projects, and both are essential parts of our future programme.

</p>

<a name="50113-15_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The order forms part of a larger contract shared with our three partner nations&#151;Germany, Italy and Spain&#151;for 236 aircraft. It represents one of the largest European defence investments ever. The order is obviously good news for British industry as well as for the Royal Air Force. It has been estimated by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce that, during peak production, the tranche two order will help sustain 16,000 jobs with defence manufacturers and their suppliers. As importantly, it keeps alive key skills and capabilities&#151;including system integration, specialist software, crew and escape systems and sensors&#151;that are vital to the future prosperity of the UK&#039;s aerospace industry.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>As has been rightly pointed out, however, Typhoon has not always had the smoothest of rides. That is not all that surprising for a programme of such size, complexity and importance. There have been challenges. As was pointed out, we carefully considered our planned future capabilities after the Cold War. Eurofighter was not exempt. We concluded, along with our partners&#151;we know about the delay in the early 1990s through one of our partners&#151;that Typhoon still had an important role to play in the less predictable post-Cold War strategic environment. That point was made clearly in this short debate.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>We should also remember that Typhoon was initiated long before the Government&#039;s Smart acquisition initiatives were introduced. I believe that, if we were starting today, we would have negotiated some of the earlier challenges more deftly under Smart acquisition. Nevertheless, we are still finding ways, we hope, of improving the way in which we conduct business, by taking steps with fellow partner nations, NETMA and industry to improve the delivery and management of the project as we move forward to tranche two. We have adopted Smart acquisition policies where appropriate. For instance&#151;this is significant&#151;the capability of Typhoon will progressively increase as part of the Future Capabilities programme that will commence in 2005. Future weapon systems will be integrated on to the platform as and when they become available.
</p>

<a name="50113-15_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Typhoon will provide our Air Force with an exceptional weapons system that will be the cornerstone of the RAF&#039;s future fighting capability. The words of the RAF pilots who have flown it speak for themselves. Indeed, the words of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord   Craig of Radley, who has flown it, speak for themselves. I shall quote some current pilots. One said:

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Lest it be thought that those of us speaking today are biased in some way, either because of having served in the Royal Air Force or for any other reason, I must refer to the senior United States Air Force general who, fresh from an exhilarating first flight in Typhoon and, naturally, quite excited, was heard to say, &quot;This is the best fast jet in the world&quot;. We agree. What more can be said, beyond thanking the noble and gallant Lord once again for the opportunity to commend Typhoon to the House?

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 5 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>


<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50113-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Perhaps I may use this opportunity to raise a perhaps rather esoteric point. From conversations outside this House, my understanding is that the new inspection regime will not involve contact between the inspector and the heads of department in a school, which used to be the case. I want to establish that that is true. The consequence I am aware of is that it seems possible that it will lead to the collapse of the present inspection system for independent schools. When Ofsted was set up, the ISCis swung in behind the system in the end. The   argument which persuaded them to do that was that the benefit which would arise would be contact between the inspection team and the heads of subjects and departments and the way in which that would be used to spread good practice and improve the way in which all schools deal with it.

</p>

<a name="50113-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>If ISCis is to swing behind the new system, as I understand is proposed, there seems to be a very substantial body of opinion that under those circumstances the inspections are not worth having at all. Without requiring an answer now, and I would appreciate a letter, I would very much like to know whether my understanding about subject inspections is right.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I would also like to know whether the Government are aware of the position being taken by HMCI and ISCis on the subject and whether they are content with that position. If not, I would like to know what they are going to do about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="50113-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I am very happy to give the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, an undertaking that I shall reply to him on all three points and on anything else which is germane.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para6"></a>

<a name="column_410"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 410</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="50113-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 33:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
   &quot;REDUCING BURDEN OF INSPECTION ON SCHOOLS

<br>
   The Chief Inspector when conducting an inspection under section 5 shall exercise his functions with regard to the desirability of avoiding excessive administrative burdens being placed on governing bodies and head teachers of maintained schools.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_106"></a>The noble Lord said: The intent of this Bill is to introduce a far lighter touch, quicker and rationalised inspection regime and one that places greater emphasis on school self-evaluation. That is a desire that we can all support.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The need for such reform is evident. We are all aware of the pressures&#151;they have been debated several times already&#151;that an inspection places on a school from the headmaster downwards. It is often a nerve-racking, fraught and an exceptionally busy couple of weeks with a lot of preparation beforehand. The danger of the reforms outlined in this legislation is that the pressures will simply be concentrated not over a matter of weeks, as now, but with a reduced time-frame and notification period over a few days. Therefore, the level of stress and work is not reduced during that time but heightened. This could be a disturbing development.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>However, I must share with the Committee a suspicion that the legislation, although it does much to reduce the bureaucracy on the inspectors themselves, does little to reduce the bureaucracy and the need to perform on the schools. The most important part of the education system is the teachers and they will have more work to do in self-assessment. They will have to collate it.

</p>

<a name="50113-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>We on these Benches believe that the teachers&#039; first priority must be to deliver quality education and not to please an official from Whitehall. Perhaps the Minister can explain to us how these reforms will reduce the levels of bureaucracy placed on our teachers by inspection. There is nothing whatsoever on the face of the Bill which addresses this key issue. We all know that one of the single biggest reasons why teachers are disillusioned with their jobs and are leaving the profession is because they often face too much red tape.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Therefore, Amendment No. 33 will place on the chief inspector a duty to exercise his functions with regard to the desirability of avoiding excessive administrative burdens being placed on governing bodies and head teachers. I expect that we shall return to this amendment at a later date, but I would like to hear the Minister&#039;s views on it now. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="50113-16_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   This is an important probing amendment by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, because if we can obtain the same or better benefits with less bureaucracy, pain and even stress, then clearly we have advanced, and that is clearly one of the aims of the Bill. We are clear that an excessive burden should not be placed on the schools. That is one of the purposes of the revised inspection system and one which is sure to be more focused with far fewer inspectors, albeit at short notice. I do not agree with the noble Lord. I believe that stress compressed over a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_411"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 411</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

few days in response to a short notice inspection has to be less in aggregate than an inspection over a period of months, but be that as it may.

</p>

<a name="50113-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>The regulatory impact assessment that was published to support the Bill, which has been made available to the House, highlights the benefits to the schools which will be brought about by the inspection process on exactly the issue the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has spoken of.

</p>

<a name="50113-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>For example, it is anticipated that savings in schools, not to Ofsted, will be equivalent to at least &#163;40 million a year as a result of these changes. I shall be happy to send a note to the Front Benches summarising that regulatory impact assessment, if that were to be of use.

</p>

<a name="50113-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>The process will mean less preparation by schools. The self-evaluation form, which is the only form that will need to be available prior to inspection, will be used not only for inspection, but it will form part of the school&#039;s own self-review. It is important to see the self-evaluation form and process as not a burden of compliance with an inspection system, but a responsibility of management and leadership in the institution itself. That is part of doing the job properly even if an inspector was not about to arrive. It is different from the current procedure where schools require four pre-inspection forms, which are solely for the purpose of the inspection itself.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The basis on which inspections will be covered in the future will be the school&#039;s own self-evaluation evidence. We are also not being prescriptive about how schools self-evaluate, as we have said previously.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>We have also tested this process through consulting with the Implementation Review Unit, which is a panel of 12 head teachers and senior school practitioners who have a function specifically to cut bureaucracy across schools. They have been closely involved in the new arrangements. They will continue to monitor, through visits to schools and meetings, with Ofsted and departmental officials.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>Perhaps I may quote from its review and annual report of 2003&#150;04, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;A new, lighter touch inspection regime is something that we believe will be of great benefit to schools: we have shared this view with senior Ofsted officials. We welcome the emphasis on self-assessment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Therefore, I believe that we have strong grounds for the expectation that this will not only reduce costs to Ofsted but perhaps, more importantly, reduce costs to schools. That has to be a continuing ambition and we intend it to be so. I hope that in view of what I have said, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is not minded to press his amendment.<i> </i>
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="50113-16_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that response. This is a difficult issue in many walks of life. As I have said before, I am the leader of a large council. The Audit Commission has asked for an assessment, but it has cut its staff and is now asking us to do a lot <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_412"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 412</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the self-assessment. We have had to ask a very senior government officer who works part-time to spend all their time collating all the self-assessment processes operating within the authority. While I accept that we should take it on, it amounts to reams of paperwork.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Moreover, as a school governor I know that a great deal of self-assessment is going on there. Although there may not be quite so much on the PE and arts side at the moment as there will have to be in the future, someone will still have to collate all the data and, I hope, present it more frequently to the governing body so that it, too, can become more closely involved in the school&#039;s self-assessment processes.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>If we are not careful, more work will be created for schools. Also, whenever money is saved by one person, it inevitably seems to cost someone else more. I fear that if Ofsted saves money, this will cost schools more.
</p>

<a name="50113-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The level of bureaucracy in schools is such an important issue that I should like to test the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="50113-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 40:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>Page 5, line 17, after &quot;may&quot; insert &quot;, having first sought and secured the approval of the Secretary of State,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is another relatively short amendment that is probing in nature. Clause 7, which is itself a very brief provision, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;The Chief Inspector may inspect any school in England, in circumstances where he is not required by section 2(2)(b) or 5 to do so&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The Explanatory Notes state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;This clause replaces section 3(1) of the SIA [School Inspections Act] 1996 and gives the Chief Inspector the power to inspect any school at any time, even when not under a duty to do so under clause 2(2)(b) or clause 5. This allows the Chief Inspector to inspect any school where he may have cause for concern in respect of his general duty under clause 2. It also enables the Chief Inspector to conduct inspections for a range of purposes, including monitoring visits by HMI to schools in special measures, visits to schools to aid him in keeping the Secretary of State informed under clause 2, or to contribute to reports on, for example, the teaching in a single curriculum subject&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The probing issues I want to raise with the Minister are as follows: does this clause give any new powers to the chief inspector, or is it really just a straight mirror image of Section 3(1) of the School Inspections Act   1996? Will it mean monitoring visits for schools designated as &quot;requiring significant improvement&quot; as well as those in special measures? What will this provision mean for schools in terms of the notice period for such inspections? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="50113-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   In response to the first of the questions put to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, the intent and effect of Clause 7 is not new, although I will have to check the wording. It reflects the same powers as were previously in place.

</p>

<a name="50113-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>However, the vast majority of the work of Ofsted will be undertaken through the powers given to the chief inspector under Section 5 for the routine inspection of schools, and through Section 2(2)(b) which will cover, for example, advising the Secretary of State on particular types of school such as specialist schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The purpose of the clause is to give the chief inspector the power to conduct visits for other purposes. This would include monitoring visits which take place once every term for schools causing concern, action which is based on a policy agreed with the Secretary of State as part of checking on the progress of such schools. In practice, therefore, there are very few instances where the chief inspector would be visiting schools without the prior agreement of the Secretary of State in some capacity. There will be a small number of occasions where the chief inspector has serious concerns about a <br>&nbsp;<br>

school. Clause 7 gives him the power to act quickly, where necessary, if he has such concerns. We believe this to be fundamental to the independence of the chief inspector&#039;s role. As to whether he would be routinely visiting schools under the &quot;significant improvement&quot; requirement, the answer is no. These are inspected after a year.
</p>

<a name="50113-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>In conclusion, we would not want to get in the way of the chief inspector&#039;s ability to discharge his duties effectively and to be able to inspect and report. As to what it means for the notice period, I will have to reflect on that question. I think it can be done without notice; but, if I am wrong on that, the noble Baroness will receive a rapid correcting letter. I hope that that is helpful. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment if she feels so minded.

<a name="50113-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Under what other criteria, apart from that outlined in Clause 5(5), does the Minister envisage the chief inspector might wish to inspect a school?

<a name="50113-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Amendment No. 41 seeks to place restrictions on the power of the chief inspector. As I indicated previously, we believe that is undesirable in principle because it would fetter his discretion.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The discretion given under Clause 7 is not new&#151;the 1996 Act had an equivalent provision&#151;and will be used for a range of purposes, including in relation to <br>&nbsp;<br>

monitoring visits which are conducted for schools in special measures. It would also be used on the rare occasion where a school is causing serious concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>However, the power should not be limited to these purposes. The chief inspector will want to use this power to inspect single subjects and other matters which have come to his attention, where the breadth of a Clause 5 inspection is not necessary or appropriate but nevertheless the inspector feels it is desirable to go in and assess the situation.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The inspection must also, of course, serve to identify good practice, an important aspect of how it can contribute to improvement. The consequence of this amendment would be that the inspector could not gather in evidence about good practice in that respect.

<a name="50113-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>As to more than once per school, no, we do not expect that to happen. Although, if one thought hard enough one could clearly envisage extreme circumstances, but that is not the expectation.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 47 is similar to one of my previous amendments and it would perhaps have been better had it been grouped with it. However, I should like to return to the issue and perhaps have another go.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>This is a simple probing amendment. As the Bill currently stands, it seems to imply that the chief inspector has to publish inspection reports only by electronic means&#151;that is, presumably, on the Ofsted website. In his answer to my previous amendment, the Minister said that the Ofsted website had had a record number of hits. It may be that that was because Members of the Committee were preparing for the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I am pleased about that. It is a step that we can all support. However, is there not a danger that in doing so we could, in effect, withhold vital information from those people and parents of pupils at the school in question who do not have access to the Internet? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_417"></a>

Surely it would be sensible to ensure that copies are available in both electronic and hard copy to allow as many people as possible to access these reports. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="50113-18_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, is right in that respect but, in practice, that is what the Bill as crafted does. It does so in a careful way. It requires not that absolutely everything has to be both electronically published and printed at the same time but that the inspector has to use his judgment as to how it is published according to the circumstances. Therefore one could imagine a situation where a parent who, for some reason, had not been sent a copy of a report, or wanted a copy of a report but did not have access to the web, would write to the chief inspector saying &quot;I would like a copy of this report about the school&quot;, or whatever. In a situation like that, it is hard to envisage that the inspector would write back saying &quot;No, you cannot have it. Go to the website&quot;. You would expect, as a good public servant, that he would send a copy. He has got the power to do it either way without essentially forcing him to have a large warehouse where everything is stocked just in case someone asks for it.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>With that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, will feel that the Bill addresses the position correctly. It does not expect the website to be the only means because, as the noble Baroness said, there will be some people who cannot make use of it.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>This would appear to be a new protection which does not reflect the potential for real damage to a school&#039;s reputation arising from an inaccurate report. While it is obviously important to discourage court action being taken against individual inspectors, there is a need for a robust complaints procedure, as we debated this morning. Given the limitations of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

inspection complaint process, this could effectively cut off the last possible course of redress that a school could pursue.
</p>

<a name="50113-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>One of the reasons we have brought forward the amendment is that we wonder what are the reasons for, and the purpose of, the clause within the Bill. Does it reflect a report in the <i>Observer </i>last November? The article stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;Lordswood Girls&#039; School&#151;judged in government league tables to be the best in the country for improving pupil performance&#151;is planning to sue Ofsted after discovering that two pages of a critical review were identical to an earlier report on Parkside School in Bradford.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Ofsted admitted this weekend that the inspection team for Lordswood failed to give an accurate and fair portrayal in the section relating to leadership and management of the school. It has promised to amend the report and add an addendum on its website about the school&quot;.</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-18_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Clearly it is not a good idea to encourage schools to pursue the inspectors through the courts&#151;we are very sympathetic with that&#151;but we should like to know a   little more of the background as to why the Government have felt it necessary to include in the Bill what is, in effect, a privilege clause.

<a name="50113-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I shall say more than a little in response, which may help during the later stages of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>In essence, the subsection is not new but a re-enactment. It establishes that the chief inspector is a Crown appointee. This effectively has benefits. It provides society with a very powerful tool&#151;a truly independent chief inspector who is able to operate within government and yet is able to criticise the policies of the day if they are not contributing to the ambitions we all share for good education.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>In conducting his inspections the chief inspector makes judgments, as we know, upon the school and how it meets the criteria that the chief inspector must report against. A truly independent inspector reports without fear or favour on the evidence as he sees it. He provides opportunities for the school to have causes of concern considered and he drafts inspection reports in a way to avoid identifying individuals in any negative statements within reports.

</p>

<a name="50113-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Inevitably there will be cases where the school is not satisfied with the judgment, but being able to publish reports that are critical of a school&#039;s performance is   necessary and has contributed greatly to the improvement across the system over the past 12 years.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Of course, the chief inspector is a Crown servant who must adhere to the seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. He must present his findings as he sees them. To remove the protection afforded by the clause that has existed since 1992 would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_419"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 419</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

undermine his independence. Schools can challenge the findings. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was clear that a welter of litigation would not be beneficial, so I shall not labour the point.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>We talked about the complaints procedure earlier. To pile on the agony further, the chief inspector is an appointee of the Crown and is liable to legal proceedings in tort, which would include an action for defamation by virtue of the Crown Proceedings Act. While it may be that the defence of qualified privilege would apply to reports published by the chief inspector in any event, Clause 10(3) clarifies the legal position where there might otherwise be some doubt.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Under the common law, the publication of inspection reports may be subject to the defence of qualified privilege in any event. However, since the common law doctrine of qualified privilege may be applied on a case by case basis, it is not possible to say with certainty that qualified privilege will attach to the publication of inspection reports for all purposes. Clause 10(3) removes doubt about that. I hope that that is helpful.

We had a lengthy discussion this morning on complaints and appeals procedures. It is right that we have an acceptable form of complaints procedure within the framework of the inspection regime. Clearly, as a Crown appointee Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector is covered by the defence of qualified privilege. As the Minister said, the clause reinforces that, and it was helpful to have his explanation. I had not realised that it was a straight re-enactment, so I am grateful to the Minister for his elucidation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;PROVISION OF INSPECTION SERVICES BY LEAs IN ENGLAND

<br>
(1)   Any local education authority in England may provide a school inspection service for schools within their area.


<br>
(2)   In this section &quot;school inspection service&quot;, in relation to any local education authority in England, means a service providing for the inspection of schools (other than Academies, city technology colleges and city technology colleges for the technology of the arts) under section 5 by officers of the authority.


<br>
(3)   Any school inspection service provided by a local education authority in England may, in addition to providing for the inspection of schools which are maintained by them, provide for the inspection of schools which are not maintained by them.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_420"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 420</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(4)   Any school inspection service provided by a local education authority in England must be operated by the authority in such a way as can reasonably be expected to ensure that the full cost of providing the service is recovered by way of charges made by the authority to those using the service.

<br>
(5)   The Secretary of State may by regulations&#151;


<br>
(a)   make provision as to the making of tenders by local education authorities in England,


<br>
(b)   make provision with respect to the accounts to be kept by local education authorities in connection with any school inspection services provided by them, and


<br>
(c)   make such incidental and supplemental provision with respect to school inspection services provided by local education authorities as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of Amendment No. 52 is to ensure a greater role for LEAs in England with respect to school improvement by allowing them to provide inspection services. If, as the Government state, inspections are to be a lever for school improvement, there is no reason why LEAs, who have the responsibility for school improvement, should not have their hands on that lever.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The amendment re-enacts similar provisions in the School Inspections Act 1996 in relation to England and Clause 51 re-enacts Section 24 of that Act in its application to Wales.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>In line with the provision under Clause 51 in Wales, the amendment would enable a local authority to provide a school inspection service for schools within its area. It allows the service to be provided for both maintained and non-maintained schools and requires the local authority to recover the costs through charges made to those using the service. It provides that the Secretary of State may by regulation make provision on the making of tenders and the keeping of accounts by local education authorities. Under the proposals for joint area reviews local authorities will be accountable for the performance of schools, and yet under the new relationship proposals their influence on the operations of schools is limited. This proposal would extend that influence.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>In addition, we spoke on Tuesday about the benefits of regional arrangements for inspections&#151;in particular, the benefits in Wales being a small country. Those benefits would apply here, too, where the local knowledge of the LEA about the ethos of local schools and the context in which they operate would be very helpful background to the inspection process. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="50113-19_spnew4"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   I have brief points to make. First, none of us is unaware of the importance of the work of LEAs. On the other hand, some of us are a little cautious about going back on what seems to be an admirable policy in lightening the burden of the bureaucracy&#151;that much used word&#151;in inspections.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I wonder whether the amendment would effectively go back on restrictions on the powers of Ofsted to inspect worship and religious education in voluntary-aided schools. It does not have that power at the moment, and the inspection is done competently and properly by various denominational authorities. I speaking not just for the Church of England. Sometimes we have to <br>&nbsp;<br>

apologise for that these days. I think that the Roman Catholics would be even more sensitive about this, so I need to ask the noble Baroness that question now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50113-19_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I shall certainly attempt to answer the question, although if I am wrong, I shall write to the right reverend Prelate about it. I do not think that the amendment would restrict that. Religious education is inspected by appropriate people, and I do not think that my amendment would get in the way of that.
</p>

<a name="50113-19_para14"></a>

<a name="50113-19_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   While the noble Baroness is still in action, perhaps she can clarify something for me. I read her amendment as a service rather than an imposition. Therefore, it is an offer that may or may not be accepted.

On that basis, I can say yes.

</p>

<a name="50113-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The amendment would reintroduce a provision in Section 24 of the School Inspections Act 1996, which enables an LEA to provide an inspection service for schools. The involvement of LEAs in the inspection of schools has declined markedly in the past few years. In   2001 LEAs represented about a third of the 125 providers of inspections nationally. In the past two years the number of providers of inspection services has fallen to two dozen and has not included any LEA providers. I suppose that they are not doing Ofsted inspections in that form currently.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>We also think that it is consistent with the general development of a more strategic role for local authorities as the champion of children and education rather than necessarily the direct provider of services. The provision in Section 24 of the 1996 Act is no longer needed under the new arrangements, under which Ofsted will let contracts to a number of regional inspection consortia&#151;substantial groups of inspection consortia. However, it will still be possible for local authorities to be involved in school inspections by subcontracting with regional consortia. Therefore, it will be possible for local authority advisers to take part in school inspections. That experience will benefit advisers and the authorities for whom they work.

<a name="50113-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Clause 50 of the Bill also provides a local education authority with power to inspect a school maintained by the authority, where it needs to do so for a particular purpose in order to enable the authority to discharge its statutory responsibilities. That power is still there, as it should be, without the local authority being seen as an essential provider of services to Ofsted. They can be a sub-contractor who is part of a wider consortium. I hope that that is helpful and I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will not press her amendment.

In the new situation of the &quot;light touch&quot; and the &quot;single conversation&quot;, it could well be that more LEAs would be interested in providing such services in the future. I thought that the suggestion that they should continue to be allowed to do so as the prime mover was interesting. I accept what the Minister said about advisers being able to subcontract, but that is not the same as being in charge of the inspection.

<p><a name="st_136"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No.   53, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 56, 64, 70, 91 and 94, which are grouped with it. The purpose of the amendments in this group is to change the designation of schools in &quot;special measures&quot; and those requiring &quot;significant improvement&quot; to a new, more positive, categorisation: &quot;schools in need of additional support&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>This is not just semantics, although it has to be said that the tone of the designation can affect the morale of a school; it is also about the right of the school to appropriate support. In its document <i>Bringing down the   barriers</i>, the NUT argues that the terms &quot;special measures&quot;, &quot;significant weaknesses&quot; or &quot;notice of improvement&quot; should be replaced by the term &quot;schools in need of additional support&quot;. Such support may involve external support. If external evaluation identifies problems in a school, the local authority should be required to provide support, including advisers and seconded teachers based in the school. There should be no &quot;one size fits all&quot; deadline for improvement. That is the NUT&#039;s view on this and I have considerable sympathy with it.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>The initial Ofsted consultation on the future of inspection, which was published in June 2004, states that &quot;schools designated as requiring significant improvement&quot; suggests that the inspectors&#039; judgments <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 423</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would be largely reliant on performance data, even though it is widely recognised that the accuracy and reliability of such quantitative data are not always secure. The consultation document also implied that such schools would be reinspected within a year. It is important that LEAs should have the responsibility for supporting schools with problems, including the provision of additional targeted resources. The progress of each school toward resolving its problems should be evaluated on merit by validation teams and LEAs.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I think there is a great deal of merit in a system similar to that in Guernsey. There, if serious problems are identified as a result of an external validation review, the school is given three months to draw up an action plan to address the problems identified. It also has active support and input from an external adviser, such as an EMI, to enable the school to make progress in the right direction. A year after the initial visit, the school is revisited by the external validation review team to look at the progress that has been made. The emphasis is on supporting the school. There are no labels such as &quot;special measures&quot; or &quot;improvement notices&quot;.

</p>

<a name="50113-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>All noble Lords are keen on ensuring that the inspection process results in a school improving. It is important that we are very clear that schools have a right to the appropriate support to make that improvement. It should be done in a way that sounds supportive to the school and makes it feel that it is not being punished or criticised, but is being helped. Even if there is fault, or less than the best teaching practice, the carrot always works better than the stick. Semantics are important, but the right to appropriate support is extremely important. I beg to move.

It is not just a question of semantics or political correctness. The phrases in her amendments usually&#151;but not always, as the noble Baroness indicated&#151;show what a school needs; that is, the extra time, resources and staff needed to cope with the special needs of often multiply-damaged children. I had this argument years ago, when I served on the ILEA. Personally, I would pay teachers in such schools double and have a contract to ensure that they achieved whatever they declared they would achieve within a limited period. That is what schools need. They need more teachers&#151;the best teachers&#151;and outside support than schools in middle class areas that are better able to cope and to benefit from the education provided in the generality of schooling. I hope that, as well as approving these amendments, the Minister will indicate that these   schools will get the extra resources that they undoubtedly need.

your Lordships&#039; House, I was handed a note from Portsmouth that told me that St Luke&#039;s School, which is not in a middle class area of the country, had just been designated the seventh most improved school in the country. Having watched that school, and others in other parts of the country, going through the process of being &quot;improved&quot;, persuades me that these amendments merit careful attention and possibly even improvement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="50113-20_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   This is an interesting opportunity to go back to issues that we touched on briefly at Second Reading because they are part of the central architecture of the Bill. Therefore, this amendment gives an opportunity to engage with those issues.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>After a lot of consideration and consultation, we decided on two categories for schools causing concern;   that is, &quot;special measures&quot; and &quot;significant improvement&quot;. These categories, defined in Clause 43, underpin the provisions in the Bill relating to the schools. The amendments in this group would provide for one category of cause for concern, &quot;in need of additional support&quot;, in relation to the schools causing concern provisions in Clauses 12, 14 and 43. We should pause on that before we engage with the question whether one uses positive or negative language.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The Bill seeks to capture the differences between schools that are very seriously failing and there is no confidence that they will turn themselves around. It is the most serious signal possible. In different language, that has been part of the history and development of Ofsted designation and governmental interventions to try to turn schools around.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Without being able to recollect off the cuff the figures, the experience has been a powerful one&#151;that although it is ghastly for a school to be so designated, sometimes one has to say that a spade is a spade. The consequence of that is that although it must be dreadful for heads or governors to know that they are put into that category, the need for improvement is so massive and serious that it also engages a range of other action, such as planning and intervention, and the evidence from that has been that schools so designated have turned around. I wish that I could remember the date of it. No doubt I shall.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>If we went from that system and sought to put everything into one category, as is suggested, and did not make the differentiation that we are talking about, either the schools needing significant improvement would be put into the very heavy sin bin category or we would compromise on the very heavy intervention sin bin category because we had many others that needed significant improvement. That would not be good public policy. For those reasons, I do not believe that it is right.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>We agree, of course&#151;we are full square with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on this&#151;that schools facing particular difficulties should receive additional support. It is not a case of saying, &quot;Let us give you some marks and then leave you to sin or fail for ever more&quot;. It is a case of trying to evaluate fairly where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_425"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 425</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

schools are not performing and, as part of a whole range of processes, to turn them round and make them better.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>Under the Bill&#039;s arrangements, a designation will continue to trigger such additional support where necessary. In the new relationship schools, we will be able to look to the school improvement partner for ongoing advice and support. The school improvement partners will have important roles in relation to schools that fall into any &quot;cause for concern&quot; category. They will work closely with the school to address weaknesses, mobilising additional support from the LEAs or other agencies where appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>We recognise the wish to see more positive terminology used for schools that cause concern. However, we do not believe that it would be right to refer to schools as &quot;in need of additional support&quot; in that terminology. That would be misleading. The term &quot;special measures&quot; is now well understood in the education world and by parents. It is synonymous with school failure. All concerned&#151;pupils, parents, LEAs, governors and staff&#151;recognise that a designation of special measures is very serious and that radical and urgent action needs to be taken to turn round the school. I believe that children and parents in such schools need that clear signal for those limited number of very serious cases. The fudging should stop and there should be a recognition that things must change.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The designation of &quot;in need of additional support&quot; would carry the implication that matters were not so bad, that all a school needed was a little extra support. The risk is that it would be taken less seriously by schools and LEAs and would not trigger the urgent action, including the very significant support that sometimes forms part of it, which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, wants to see, that the special measures categorisation currently brings with it. We therefore risk undermining our policies to tackle school failure rigorously and drive up standards.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The &quot;schools causing concern&quot; categorisation is about more than just identifying schools that need additional support. It is certain that most, if not all, schools would welcome additional resources, and many would welcome additional support. Schools that fall into one of the two &quot;cause for concern&quot; categories will need a range of challenge, support or intervention. The lesson from our experience of school improvement is that the solution must be tailor-made for the school.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Every school can improve. A key role for SIPs will be to challenge schools to have the highest aspirations and expectations. The new &quot;significant improvement&quot; category will help to identify those schools that are not performing as well as they should. The remedy for such a school is not necessarily, although it may be, a range of additional support. Where a school already has strong leadership, it may be able to develop strategies to improve performance, with the school improvement partner playing a part as necessary.

</p>

<a name="50113-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>As we all know, leadership is a key factor in the success of a school. In some cases of schools causing concern, weak leadership will be a major issue. Intervention may be necessary to secure effective <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_426"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 426</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

leadership and management of the school. It would be misleading for parents and the wider community simply to refer to such a school as being in need of additional support. It would not. It would need new, stronger, tougher, more skilled, more effective leadership. We believe that the Bill&#039;s arrangements provide the necessary framework for accountability and intervention to tackle failure and drive up standards.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The current definitions have been successful in raising standards. We believe that the revised arrangements build on that success and will ensure that the schools that need significant improvement are identified, supported and challenged to raise standards. The current system for schools causing concern has therefore worked, and the designations have concentrated minds on remedying weaknesses.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>Our proposals are designed to build on the success of the current arrangements. We still need to single out the very worst cases&#151;special measures&#151;and to recognise that in some cases improvement is necessary but that the failure is not so serious. Since 1997, over 1,200 secondary schools have recovered from special measures. As a consequence, over 400,000 pupils have benefited from special measures.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>In summary, although I do not believe that a shift to a single category would be right and although I believe that support is a necessary component of improvement in many cases, one needs to identify the cases in which it is not only about support but may also be about leadership.
</p>

<a name="50113-20_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>I am not sure that I can add anything further. Having said a good deal already, if there are points that I have missed, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, can bear a letter from me.

(c)   that the school is likely to fail,&quot;

<p><a name="st_142"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 54 in relation to England and Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 in relation to Wales would allow the respective chief inspector in each country to take action to notify the Secretary of State, the LEA or the proprietor of a school whether in his opinion the school was likely to fail.

</p>

<a name="50113-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>We are concerned that, as the Bill currently stands, the chief inspector can recommend that action be taken only if special measures are required or, under the new   phraseology, if the school requires significant improvement. That suggests that action to improve a school could be taken only once the school was already in difficulty. Our amendments would therefore introduce the category &quot;likely to fail&quot;, allowing the inspector to recommend action if he believed that the school was likely to encounter serious concerns at a future date.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>We cannot afford to jeopardise the future or the education of a single child. Action to improve a school may take a number of months to implement, with results taking even longer to come to fruition. All the time, the educational attainments and life chances of the pupils will suffer. The introduction of this new category would allow action to be taken before the problem worsened. We should allow the inspector to decide whether he or she believes that there is a serious enough problem just around the corner to merit immediate action, thereby nipping in the bud any concerns.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 93 and 95 in this group. As the Bill currently stands in relation to Wales, a school would require significant improvement only if it had already been deemed to be performing significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected to perform. This suggests that action to improve a school could be taken only once the school was already in difficulties.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>Our amendment would therefore introduce the category, &quot;likely to perform significantly less well&quot;, allowing the inspector to recommend action if, in his view, he believed the school was likely to encounter serious concerns at a future date and was likely to perform significantly less well.

</p>

<a name="50113-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>We will reflect on that but do not think that it is appropriate. We appreciate that the current definition of special measures refers to a school likely to fail to provide a satisfactory standard of education. We propose to move way from that. Under the revised definition in Clause 43, a school&#039;s capacity to improve will be taken into account, which is an important shift, because it makes a judgment as to whether that school is likely to move from its position of weakness as a consequence of the leadership, the commitment and the honesty of the self-evaluation and so on.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and I agree that this is a more positive approach, because it recognises the capacity to move forward. This will be welcomed by schools which have made good progress and can show they have the capacity to improve further.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>Amendment No. 95 would mean a school would also require significant improvement if it was likely to perform significantly less well than might reasonably be expected. Again, we do not believe that this would be appropriate, as it would introduce a negative element into a judgment, which would be unhelpful to schools. The focus of inspectors will be on the progress being made by schools. In making the significant improvement judgment, inspectors will give specific attention to the progress of pupils and the value added by a school. They will consider how a school&#039;s performance compares with other schools in similar contexts. This will ensure that schools that are not doing as well as they should, are identified and, given additional support and challenges, can raise their performance.

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Surely, in the case of the chief inspector informing the Secretary of State or relevant LEA that a school was to be placed in special measures, a full report would already have been produced.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure  . . . every registered parent of a registered pupil&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>I do not believe that there is such a thing as a registered parent. It also refers to receiving a copy of the report. At the moment, parents receive only a copy of the summary of the report and it seems absurd that they should have to receive and that the school should have to duplicate the report and send a full copy to every parent, many of whom will not wish to read it. They would prefer to receive a summary.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>So the purpose of our amendment is to replace that wording and to do away with the concept of the registered parent so that the parents of pupils registered at the school receive a summary of the report and may request a copy of the full report. That would be sensible. If they wish to receive the full report, they can have a copy. Most parents would not want a full report and would be perfectly happy to receive the summary.
</p>

<a name="50113-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Amendment No. 63 takes up the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, this morning, regarding treating pupils as full stakeholders within the school. That amendment seeks to clarify that pupils should know about the report and, if they wish to see it, they should have access, either to the summary or to the full report, if they wish and as is appropriate. Clearly most pupils in a primary school would not be involved, but some senior pupils might wish to see it. Certainly some pupils in a secondary school might wish to see a copy of a full report.

<a name="50113-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>So, the purpose of these two amendments is, first, to make clear that the school does not have to go to the length of producing the report in full and circulating it to all parents, and, secondly, to extend access to the report to pupils.

<a name="50113-22_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   I wish to comment briefly on the process and then on the amendments. In listening to this and to Tuesday&#039;s debates, I have constantly been struck by the difficulty that we face. I know that it is not the first time where one is trying to legislate in a simplifying way in the context of something that is much more complex. Many of the amendments fall in a sort of &quot;no-person&#039;s land&quot; between a legislative process which is about freeing up and simplifying in a context in which people say, &quot;Ah, but might there be problems and do we entirely trust each other?&quot;. The amendment is another example of that.

</p>

<a name="50113-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>My comments may betray that I am a devil&#039;s advocate or that I am even more cynical than everyone else. But might there not be an unintended consequence of the summary, in that the report itself will go back to being long? In the academic world it is now common to have English-speaking summaries at the end of articles of immense complexity, which allows the articles to become even more complex. That probably means that the scholars read the summaries rather than the articles.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>In making that somewhat whimsical remark, perhaps I may ask whether the amendments might produce the opposite of what is intended. I speak as a parent as well as a cleric.

<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="50113-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Not for the first time, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth has put his finger on the kind of dilemma that governments face and that we are facing in this debate. One is trying to simplify and yet, within government, there is always a tension between that and seeking to move to less regulation, less specification and less <i>dirigisme</i>. At the same time, there are always one or two in the corner who will say, &quot;Well, that&#039;s all right for you but we must have X, Y or Z&quot;. That is a characteristic of government and we are part of that tension.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>What is different here is that one of the key features of the new inspection arrangements is that the inspection report is meant to be much more focused. Secondly, it is an inspection report that sits on the self-evaluation. So, whereas at present Ofsted goes in and almost measures, evaluates, quantifies and describes everything for itself and writes up the basis on which it comes to its conclusions, the process that we are now talking about is very different.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>In a sense, through the inspection process and the report, Ofsted is commenting on the self-evaluation of the school and on the enormously powerful set of data that has been built up over 12 years of the process showing objectively how the school is performing. There is no need for all that information to be put into the report because, effectively, it is a commentary on the inspectorate&#039;s judgment on the performance data <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_431"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 431</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which are accessible, and on the school&#039;s evaluation and therefore its judgment on what is really important about the school&#039;s performance and its capacity to improve.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>As a consequence, while current reports are 40 or more pages in length, under the new system they will drop to around six pages because they will focus on the key essentials that need to change. I think that it may be helpful to the Committee if I send examples of those to all Front-Benchers and to all who have taken part. They will give a flavour of the fundamental difference in the process.

</p>

<a name="50113-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>It is not a matter of seeking to quantify and define absolutely everything and then, from that mass of documented detail, come to a conclusion. It is basically a case of taking two foundation sources&#151;the evaluation and the data&#151;and then, through the process of inspection and the interactions that go with it, coming to judgments which focus on what matters most. From our previous debates, I think that what matters most in inspections is being clear about what matters most. It is not a description of the 75 things that it would be nice to change but about the five or six things that really must change. Focusing in that way is crucial and that is why the report can be completed in six pages.

</p>

<a name="50113-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>While parents currently receive only the summary and have to ask for the full report if they want it, in future they will receive the full report as a matter of course. They will have the whole job because parents are seen as the prime audience for the report. Ofsted is currently using focus groups of parents to check that the new style reports meet their needs, and that will be an ongoing process. So far, the early feedback is that parents have been extremely positive about the change.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>In terms of the amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, I have said that a summary does not need to be sent because parents will receive the full report. I have also spoken about the arrangements for involving pupils in inspection and reporting to pupils on the outcomes.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, to Clause 12, which sets out the inspector&#039;s duties where a school causes concern, include a requirement to send a summary of the report to the Secretary of State, local authority or proprietor when giving notice that the school has been identified as causing concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I am not trying to tease the noble Baroness, Lady   Morris, but I should also mention that all the reports will be available on the website and the full report will be sent to the appropriate authorities. The chief inspector already has a duty to send the reports to the local authority or proprietor, and therefore there is no need to increase burdens by requiring each report to be sent to the Secretary of State when he is notified that a school causes concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Replacing the current lengthy report and separate summary with the new style report will therefore not place additional burdens on schools or governing bodies. But it will mean that parents and others have direct access to the full outcome of the inspection.

I hope that that has been helpful.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="50113-22_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 65:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>Page 8, line 18, after &quot;must&quot; insert &quot;, after consultation with the appropriate body for a maintained school and the head teacher of that school&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 65, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 66 to 70 and 76. The purpose of this set of amendments is to ensure that the action statement prepared by the local authority where a school is deemed to be in need of significant improvement or special measures is produced in consultation with the school concerned and, in particular, with the head teacher and the governing body of that school.

</p>

<a name="50113-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>When a school is in special measures or requires significant improvement, the Bill places sole responsibility for action on the local education authority without mention of the contribution that the school, or any other body with a key part to play in the school&#039;s performance, is expected to make. LEAs cannot be expected to improve a school&#039;s performance without there being a legal requirement for the school and the other relevant bodies also to contribute. This is of particular concern as, under the new relationship with schools, it is proposed that a school improvement partner will work primarily with the school, although it will be managed by the LEA.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>The limited number of days available to the school improvement partner is likely to result in a disconnection between the school and the LEA. The LEA has had little or no involvement with the school. It is not reasonable for the LEA to find itself responsible for a school when it goes into special measures. Again, it is not reasonable for local authorities to be judged against the performance of schools in their area if they have direct involvement with a school only once it is in special measures and then cannot guarantee the support of the school and other bodies in trying to secure its improvement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_433"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 433</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Another issue that concerns us is leaving out the responsibilities of governing bodies. Under the new arrangements the proposed reduction of involvement in inspection by governors is disappointing and surprising. The important role played by governors in school improvement was first highlighted by Ofsted itself in 1994. The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the Education Act 2002 set out ways in which governing bodies should contribute to school improvement. Subsequently, that was used to underpin successive inspection frameworks relating to the leadership and management of schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>The current inspection framework indicates clearly that governors are expected to have a significant leadership role. That role is not intended to be performed in isolation, but in conjunction with the head teacher and other school staff as part of the corporate team. However, the proposed marginalisation of the governing body in inspection would not support such strategic involvement in the school. Such an approach seems to us to contradict the research evidence that has found a very strong association between the inspectors&#039; judgment of a school&#039;s effectiveness and their judgment of its governing body. That finding is supported by evidence from Ofsted, which similarly reported a clear association between effective schools and effective governing bodies.
</p>

<a name="50113-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>In conclusion, in moving the amendment and in speaking to the series of amendments grouped with it, we feel that, where a school needs to be turned around, the team element involved has proved to be significant. It is wrong to move away from that team element, back to placing the sole responsibility on the local education authority when often the local education authority will have but a minimal role. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="50113-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Sometimes the problem is that until the Government have expressed, as a result of probing amendments, the intended system in more detail, it is difficult to spot what on earth is going on. On reflection, it is sometimes an inefficient process, but now is not the time to speculate on that.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>I understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, says what she has said. I would share her horror if we intended to do what she worries we will do. But that is not so. We would not for a second consider that it would be remotely sensible to place the sole responsibility for turning a school around on others, to the exclusion of the school and governors. Nor do we believe that the local authority has a minimal involvement in the process of deciding what is going on in a school before, during and after an inspection report. We would expect the reverse: we would expect that the local authority, through its SIP&#151;if I can use that ghastly abbreviation&#151;would be very actively involved in understanding that. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has indicated, a good local authority knows where there are worrying areas and it would focus its efforts accordingly.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The amendments would introduce additional requirements to the arrangements for schools causing concern, including the action to be taken by local authorities and others. Amendment No. 65 would require the local authority to consult the appropriate body for, and the head teacher of, a maintained school <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_434"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 434</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before preparing a written statement of action that it   proposes. We totally agree that the LEA should consult with the school in preparing the statement. It is essential that the head teacher is involved from the outset. That already happens without any legal requirement. It must and will continue in the future.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Where a school is judged to be a cause for concern, inspectors give oral feedback to governors and to the head teacher at the end of an inspection and, therefore, the head receives early notification of the inspection findings. It is then for the governors and the head teacher to consider how to address the issues identified by inspectors. The current guidance from the department makes it clear that governors, head teachers and staff should be closely involved in drawing up school action plans. I can give the Committee an assurance that that will continue and will be made clear in guidance in the new legislation.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>A similar consideration applies in relation to Amendment No. 76. That would require the proprietor of a non-maintained school to consult the head teacher before preparing a written statement of action, when notified by the chief inspector. Again, such consultation will happen as a matter of course. It is not necessary to cover it in legislation, but it will be in guidance.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>In all cases, therefore, we expect the head teacher, the staff and the governors to be closely involved in decisions about action to be taken to address issues raised by inspectors. The current guidance makes that clear, as it will in the future.


</p>

<a name="50113-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 would require the LEA&#039;s statement to include any action it recommends the school or any others should take and the timescale for this action. I think that that is unnecessary. As we have explained, in practice, LEA&#039;s statements will be drawn up in consultation with the school and anyone else whom the LEA considers has a part to play in securing improvements.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 would require the LEA to send its written statement of action to the head teacher and governing body. Once again, it is not necessary to put that in legislation. Much of the action needed will fall to the head teacher and governing body. It is unthinkable that the LEA would fail to send a copy to them and anyone else with a role to play. We will ensure that this is also covered in guidance.
</p>

<a name="50113-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>Amendment No. 70 would extend to significant improvement cases the Secretary of State&#039;s power to specify a shorter period than prescribed for the LEA to prepare the action plan. We do not see a need to extend the Secretary of State&#039;s powers in this way. The intention is that regulations will prescribe 10 working days from receipt of the inspection report as the deadline for the LEA to prepare its statement of action. In the majority of cases this will ensure attention is given in a timely manner to the needs of schools judged to require special measures or significant improvement. In a few cases the needs of a school may require more urgent action. The clause gives the Secretary of State power to ensure that this happens. It is appropriate for only the categories of school which give most cause for concern.

<a name="50113-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The Bill is intended to simplify existing arrangements for schools causing concern, including the requirements for follow-up action by LEAs and schools. Clearly, this simplification would be undermined by the amendments, but the thrust of those amendments will be protected by the guidance that I have indicated&#151;and given a commitment to the Committee&#151;will follow through from the Bill. I hope that clarification has therefore reduced the need to press the amendment.

It raises exactly the same issues as those we talked about in relation to appeals procedures and the involvement of pupils, and so forth. We have the assurance that of course this will happen and that it will be set out in guidance. Yet, in a sense there is always the question of, &quot;Is it going to be set out in guidance?&quot;. Is it not useful to have at least some short mention of these issues in the Bill in order to make sure that guidance is there and that it follows the wishes of the legislature?

We keep getting assurances from the Government, but we would like to see some of these issues on the face of the Bill so that we know that they will still happen in three or four years&#039; time. Ministers and inspectors come and go and some of these issues might be lost if they are not in the Bill. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, on this issue.

The Bill and Explanatory Notes provide scant information on the panel&#039;s remit. We do not even know how many members it will comprise. What role, therefore, does the noble Baroness envisage? We should be careful to ensure that we do not just create another quango.

<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>Who will choose the members of the advisory panel: will the First Minister, the Welsh Education Minister or the Assembly have the final say over the appointments? How will the independence and impartiality of each member be guaranteed? What criteria will be used to judge each candidate? How much will the panel cost each year, and where will it be based? I note that much of those details, such as members&#039; remuneration, will be left to the regulation-making powers of the Assembly. However, it would be helpful if the noble Baroness could shed some light on this particularly cloudy area.

<a name="50113-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I, too, find it difficult to see why the Assembly requires a panel to advise it on matters relating to the inspectorate, bearing in mind that it has a Minister in the Assembly Government and a committee of Assembly Members dedicated to education. They also have Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Schools (HMCI), a Crown appointment, on which the Assembly is to be consulted.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>One would have thought that the chief inspector and the education committee would provide sufficient advice. It might be argued that further advice from a panel, presumably consisting largely of professionals, would be superfluous and could even cause confusion in decision-making. On reading the clause it is noticeable that the Bill is uncertain on the functions of the advisory panel, other than its own appointment, fixing remuneration and allowances, ensuring co-operation with HMCI and making reports to the Assembly. The proposed panel gives the impression of being superfluous from its inception. There is little that it can do that HMCI cannot do better or more authoritatively.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>The briefing on the Bill that we received from the Government Whips&#039; Office states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;the Assembly discharges a range of responsibilities with regard to Estyn (the Chief Inspector&#039;s Office) related to appointments, agreement of terms and conditions and funding. Currently, there are no mechanisms to provide the Assembly with independent advice on such matters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Is a special panel really necessary for those functions? I doubt it very much. Surely, they are matters for the Minister and civil servants. The Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, who covers a far wider spectrum of services and is also a Crown appointment, does not require a special panel attached to him and his office to advise the Assembly. I am not aware of any other similar case. This panel is an Assembly quango by another name and I am surprised to see the proposal in the Bill bearing in mind that the Assembly Government are currently setting alight the long-promised bonfire of Welsh quangos.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>In fairness, I should point out that the NUT believes that the panel will be welcomed by teachers in Wales, but that welcome was extended in the context of the inspectorate&#039;s increased accountability to the Assembly after a period when the NUT endured what it described as a punitive system of inspections. It is not at all clear that the panel can have a role in changing perceived attitudes on the part of the inspectorate. I do not think that the panel will be able to change the inspectorate&#039;s functions at all. Any change of that nature in the style of the inspectorate, and so on, will have to come from the inspectorate itself or from the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Like my noble friend, I do not find the case for the proposed panel at all compelling; quite the reverse. It is an unnecessary addition to the bureaucratic burden <br>&nbsp;<br>

on the education budget. Admittedly it is a permissive clause; it is a &quot;may&quot; clause; but that is no reason for us to allow it to proceed in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="50113-24_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   On these Benches we do not support the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. We feel that the Assembly might perhaps be somewhat undermined. It should be allowed to keep its panel. The situation in Wales, as people often say, is somewhat different. In England we have the Education Select Committee in another place; they do not have that in Wales, therefore an advisory panel of experts may very well be most useful in advising the Assembly on inspection matters. Wales is different and I would like to see Clause 21 left in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="50113-24_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I am grateful for the support of one part of the Opposition. I hope to bring the other part round to my way of thinking by the time I have explained in a bit more detail what the panel is supposed to do. I take on board the specific questions asked by both noble Lords; if I cannot answer them all then I will write.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>Clause 21 provides the Assembly with a new and necessary power to establish through regulations a panel to advise the Assembly on any matter relating to the functions of the chief inspector. It might be worth stating the role of Estyn in relation to the Assembly. Estyn is independent of but funded by the National Assembly for Wales under Section 104 of the Government of Wales Act. It is accountable to the Assembly in relation to financial matters and to the audit committee. It has a key role in raising standards in quality of education and training across Wales in all areas through inspection and advice. Although the management of the inspectorate is a matter for the chief inspector, the Assembly is required to discharge a range of responsibilities with regard to Estyn. It is in relation to those other responsibilities that we seek to enable the Assembly to discharge its duties with a little more dialogue and enrichment, without imposing any new duties or any new bureaucracy.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>Clause 21 allows the Assembly to make provision for the appointment of members of the panel, remuneration and allowances, and the preparation of reports. It requires the chief inspector to co-operate, for example, by providing the panel with access to staff and papers.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>We fully recognise that the management of the inspectorate is clearly a matter for the chief inspector. However, the new panel will provide what has been felt lacking for some time&#151;it will fill a gap with an informed and independent view on the range of duties and responsibilities the Assembly is required to discharge with regard to Estyn&#151;Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales. There is no mechanism for providing the Assembly with independent advice, and it is the independence of the advice that concerns us particularly.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>It might make sense to noble Lords if we consider what the panel might do. It will have three potential tasks. It will be able to advise the Assembly on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_439"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 439</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

annual remit issued to the chief inspector by the Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning. The   chief inspector can devote 20 per cent of inspectorate time to strategic issues and development. That might go across a range of educational issues; it might relate to primary education, curriculum development or whatever. The inspector has the right to request that but, to date, has had no mechanism to obtain or commission advice for that purpose. So we look to the panel to provide an expert and informed view on the development of such a programme that would identify and address key issues consistent with policy objectives and priorities throughout Wales. It will bring a new strength to the inspectorate&#039;s arm and to the Assembly&#039;s arm and would draw them closer together into that dialogue. The panel will be able to advise on that range of issues.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>The panel will also be able to provide advice to Ministers in meeting the Assembly&#039;s statutory obligation to approve Estyn&#039;s annual plan. It will be able to advise the Assembly on the extent to which it believes that the plan will provide an effective platform for raising standards and quality in education and training to support the vision. It will be a critical friend to the Assembly in assessing how effective education and training in Wales has been, as mediated through Estyn&#039;s annual plan. I would have thought that that would be an extremely helpful new resource for the Assembly.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>The panel will also advise Ministers on the handling of any complaint against the chief inspector. There is no current mechanism for the consideration of such complaints, if they do not fall within the remit of the Welsh Administration Ombudsman. Therefore, it will be in the interests of all parties to ensure that the panel has unfettered access to papers and is in a position to provide such an informed and full opinion on the subject matter.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>The panel is essentially advisory. It will not have executive powers. It will be for Ministers to determine whether to accept or act on the advice, but it will be new advice that will be useful to the Assembly.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Who will be on the panel? The noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, asked me how many members the panel would have, who they would be and how they would be appointed. Much of that detail will be subject to consultation by the Assembly as part of the framing of the regulations, but I can tell the Committee that the panel will provide an informed, independent view on the role and contribution of inspection in raising standards. Essentially, it will be composed of practitioners. They will be people with wide experience in education. There will be representation from the business sector. We expect the membership to be no more than six, and the appointments will be made through the established Assembly procedures. I can write to the noble Lord with more detail about that. The clause sets out the basic principles, and the detail will be subject to consultation, as we frame the regulations.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked what the panel would cost. The costs will be limited to travel and subsistence for panel members, and we expect Assembly officials to provide support for the panel. It will not be expensive.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>There is no duplication of roles and responsibilities in that there are no executive powers. It is not adding to the bureaucratic burden, but is added value. We believe that it is an important development. There can be no assumption that the panel will be an advisory, Assembly-sponsored public body. When it is established decisions on its status will be taken as part of the process to establish the panel itself. We believe it unlikely that the panel would draw one-third of its membership from outside the public sector, for example. It will be based in Cardiff. I do not have any other information available to me so I make that assumption.

</p>

<a name="50113-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, concluded by asking why it is unnecessary in England. Part of the answer was given by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. We have the education committee in England which provides advice. In addition, we have mechanisms in England: there is the body which enables a chief inspector to be called to account. We have independent adjudicators available to deal with complaints against a chief inspector. We have a different system.
</p>

<a name="50113-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>We are trying to create something which we have been advised is needed and will be welcome. It is very good to know that the NUT in Wales has welcomed it. It will be limited, advisory, modest and effective as regards what it is intended to do. I hope that reassures Members of the Committee. I shall certainly write if we can provide any further details.

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="50113-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conway </b>  : I am very grateful to the Minister for her justification of this clause. Nevertheless, I am far from convinced of the necessity for this particular panel. I turn to the three functions which the noble Baroness described, the first of which is the advice on the inspector&#039;s remit. I would have thought it is very much a matter for the education committee of the Assembly. There is a statutory education committee and it is a matter for that committee and the Minister as to what the inspectorate&#039;s remit should be. Similarly, as regards the inspectorate&#039;s annual plan, that is surely a matter for the Minister to approve. It is not a matter on which to seek advice from a body of practitioners.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>If the advisory panel is there to examine complaints against the chief inspector, that is a role, as we heard this morning, which can also be played by the public services&#039; ombudsman who is about to be created under another Bill which is coming before this House.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>I am sure that it will be costly. The noble Baroness referred to allowances, but she did not refer to the other related item&#151;remuneration. Therefore, these advisors will be paid. There is not much doubt that they will find something to do. I shall certainly seek to inquire into the matter further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="50113-25_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Perhaps I may have the last word. As regards who sets the remit, it is advice which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_441"></a>

is required by the Minister for Education. One of the points I hoped to get across to Members of the Committee is that it is an independent group providing advice which the Minister and the Assembly will be unable to obtain anywhere else. That will be extremely important. I reiterate that the costs are limited because the panel members will be covered for travel and subsistence. I have no further advice as regards remuneration.

   &quot;INSPECTION AT DISCRETION OF CHIEF INSPECTOR

<br>
   The Chief Inspector may inspect any school in Wales, in circumstances where he is not required by section 19(2)(b) or 27, where he may have cause for concern arising from his duty under section 19.&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would allow the chief inspector in Wales the same power as his counterpart in England to inspect schools at his discretion where, under his duties outlined in Clause 19, he has cause for concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>The particular merit of this clause is that it would allow the chief inspector to inspect any school at any time if he had cause for concern. He would not necessarily have to wait for the usual and planned range of inspections. This is a step we can support in relation to England, and is why we thought it would be a useful addition to the powers available to the chief inspector in Wales. We are in favour of any measures that bring greater flexibility and responsiveness to the position.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>Perhaps the Minister could explain why such a power is to be granted to the inspector in England, but not in Wales. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="50113-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   This is a valuable new clause in that it would give the chief inspector the right to inspect any school in Wales, whether required to do so or not by the Assembly or under Clause 27, if he has cause for concern arising from his general duty under Clause 19.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>I assume that the clause would allow a snap inspection when a school suddenly comes into the news and allegations fly&#151;such a situation is not unknown in Wales. I am reminded of an occasion not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_442"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 442</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

so long ago in a rural area of Wales when some trouble arose. A school and its teacher were in the news, which occasioned a visit by a television camera crew. I recall the interviewer asking one of the mothers of a pupil at the school whether she had, &quot;something against Miss   Jones&quot;&#151;or whatever was the teacher&#039;s name. The mother replied, &quot;Oh, goodness me, no. Only what I&#039;ve heard&quot;. Clearly she knew something, but there was no way in which the interviewer could elicit what it was.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>That kind of situation does boil up from time to time and might require a snap inspection. I am not sure that it is the kind of circumstance that any HMI would like to step into, but at least they would not be debarred from doing so. Indeed, the inspectorate might be positively encouraged by the presence of such a provision. Moreover, public pressure often calls for a snap inspection, which might ease pressure on the Minister in the Assembly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="50113-25_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   Although just a few minutes ago I said that England and Wales do not always have to be the same because they are very different countries, particularly in size, on this occasion I think there is merit in the proposed new clause. The reason I say that is that to a great extent children have only one chance at their education, although there are reparatory mechanisms available&#151;sometimes, sadly, in the education department of a young offender&#039;s institution. We all know how difficult that can be. So if there is a need to get in quickly if there is immediate cause for concern and the chief inspector believes that an inspector will be able to identify clearly what the problems are and kick into place mechanisms to help put things right then there is no reason why that should not be as valid in Wales as in England. I support this amendment.

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="50113-25_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I can give the noble Lords the assurances they seek. They have sought to bring forward a power for the chief inspector to inspect any school in Wales irrespective of whether such an inspection had been specifically requested by the Assembly under the powers in Clause 19(20)(b) or was part of the cycle of regular school inspection provided for in Clause 27.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>We talked a bit about Estyn and its functions in the previous debate. I agree with everything noble Lords have said about how essential it is for the inspectorate in discharging its remit to have unfettered access to schools and to be able to have the freedom to disseminate good practice without fear or favour. It should be able to identify shortfalls and be able to praise success. In the new inspection arrangements in both England and Wales we are trying to maximise the access that is vital to raising quality and standards.
</p>

<a name="50113-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>It is for this very reason that Clause 23 enables the chief inspector to arrange for any school in Wales to be inspected by an HMI. It also provides for an HMI to monitor school inspection being carried out by a registered inspector under Clause 27 and makes provision for right of entry and a right to inspect documents for the purposes of inspection.

</p>

<a name="50113-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Inspection plays a key part in school improvement. The chief inspector must have the flexibility to arrange inspection and to monitor as and where necessary. That is the basis for open and fair reporting, and without that the integrity of the inspection system could be seriously impaired. Clause 23 ensures that is provided for Wales. On the basis that Estyn can inspect at the chief inspector&#039;s discretion at any time and at any school in Wales I hope that this amendment will be withdrawn.

<p><a name="st_173"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 92 is a simple probing amendment in relation to categories of schools causing concern and where special measures were required in relation to schools in Wales.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>As the Bill currently stands, special measures would be required to be taken if the school was failing to give its pupils an accurate standard of education and the   persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>My question is simple: why before special measures are taken is it necessary to have both categories of failure occurring at the same time, as the inclusion of the word &quot;and&quot; in line 2 suggests? Surely it is possible for one to occur without the other. Indeed, as it stands, one would have to wait for the other to be judged to have occurred before special measures could be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_444"></a>

implemented. Given the seriousness of either of these categories, action should be taken if only one occurs. I hope the Minister can provide some assurance in this regard. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="50113-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I will do my best. It starts with a recognition of the seriousness of special measures. We have spoken about that and I shall not elaborate upon it, but clearly it is understood that they are implemented only in a situation where a school is very seriously failing.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>The way in which Clause 43 defines special measures&#151;and, therefore, the way in which it triggers intervention action&#151;is when a school is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing and governing the school are not demonstrating a capacity to secure the necessary improvement. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, that means that both criteria would need to be met before a special measures designation would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>This probing amendment would require a school to be made subject to special measures if only one of the two criteria was not met. That would mean that a school could be placed in special measures even though it was providing an acceptable standard of education but the leadership was not likely to secure improvement. We do not believe that would be right. Special measures are a serious matter and require radical and urgent action. They are not appropriate for a school whose performance is acceptable even though the leadership is not of the quality that would lead to the school being judged as likely to improve significantly.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>In any case, the standard of education is unlikely to be acceptable if the leaders, governors and managers do not demonstrate the capacity to secure the improvements that the school needs. The two often go hand in hand. Leadership is often a factor when a school is judged to require special measures.

</p>

<a name="50113-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>We believe that it is right to continue to identify the most serious cases of failure and to require action. The Bill does that. It also strengthens our drive to achieve higher and higher standards. A significant improvement category will ensure that schools with weaknesses in sixth form or other aspects of their provision are identified and receive additional support to help them. It will also put the spotlight on schools which are doing reasonably well but should be doing better. It will ensure that these schools, too, raise their performance.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>Let me with some hand signals&#151;again to the bafflement of <i>Hansard</i>&#151;try to illustrate that. Under the Clause 43 definition, there could be a school which was not giving its pupils an acceptable standard of education but which could, in the judgment of Ofsted, improve with new governors coming in, a new head and some new key staff. For the sake of argument, let us say that, after a year, it may have demonstrated such leadership potential that Ofsted could be confident that that was likely to move the school out of that unacceptable standard of performance without needing the heavy hand of the full <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_445"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 445</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

special measures category. I expect to have the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, with me on this point of the argument.

</p>

<a name="50113-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>The alternative is that a school could be coasting. It could be perfectly acceptable in terms of performance but not brilliant, in which case the judgment of Ofsted might be that the head or the governors, or both, did not demonstrate the necessary ambition and seriousness required. It could be classified as an average school which did not have the push to go further. If Ofsted judged that the leadership was such that it was not going to improve the school further, it would be a case for action but it would not be a case for special measures.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>That is the reason, therefore, for the differentiation that the clause, as currently drafted, allows. We believe that it is a proper differentiation. Of course it is Ofsted&#039;s judgments which trigger different actions. I hope that has been helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="50113-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. Sometimes the leadership is not particularly good but pupils still do quite a good job because of their wonderful teachers. As long as there is pre-emptive action to ensure that poor leadership does not permeate downwards, effectively causing the children to suffer, we are satisfied. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="50113-26_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I am here under my own flag now. Clause 44 alters the power contained in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 for the Secretary of State or, in Wales, the Assembly to direct a local education authority to close a school that is causing concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>At present the Secretary of State or the Assembly has such power in relation to schools that require special measures or have serious weaknesses. In future, that power will apply only to schools that are placed in special measures.

</p>

<a name="50113-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The change gives rise to a number of questions on which we would welcome the Minister&#039;s comments. We understand that the clause has been prompted by the change in the terminology and categories of schools that cause concern. My question is simple: what will happen to those schools that were categorised as &quot;in serious weakness&quot; and which were liable to be closed by either the Assembly or the Secretary of State? Presumably they   will now be termed as &quot;needing significant improvement&quot; and will stay open. What will happen to the pupils in those schools?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50113-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>Perhaps the Minister can also give us the relevant information on how many schools each year were included in that category and were closed. The figure would be helpful in understanding the nature and scale of the problem that we are addressing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="50113-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The clear and simple questions are always the worst, but I shall have a go.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>The clause continues the power of the Secretary of State or of the National Assembly for Wales to direct a local education authority to close the school that has   been in special measures. The clause gives the Secretary of State and the Assembly such a power only in relation to the most serious category of schools which give cause for concern.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>In that sense there is nothing new. The power has existed for several years. The clause largely re-enacts Section 19 of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by Section 56 of the Education Act 2002.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>At present, the Secretary of State and Assembly have power to direct closure of a school that is either subject to special measures or has serious weaknesses. The clause covers only those schools that require special measures. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to exercise powers in relation to other schools. The clause, therefore, does not cover schools requiring significant improvement.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>We believe that the power in this clause is still needed as a preventive measure. It has never been used by the Secretary of State or the Assembly, but it may be needed as a last resort if a school is in severe difficulties and rapid improvement is unlikely. We must retain the Secretary of State&#039;s and Assembly&#039;s ability to direct closure in such circumstances, and we must retain their ability to give such direction when a school is failing children and other intervention powers have not achieved improvement in standards.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>LEAs have powers under Section 29 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to close schools they maintain. Those apply whether or not a school is in special measures. LEAs may choose&#151;that is probably the central point of the good question posed by the noble Baroness&#151;to close failing schools, taking into account the number of school places available locally and local opinion. One hundred and seventy schools in special measures were closed by LEAs since 1998.
</p>

<a name="50113-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>Our policy has been that schools in special measures should be turned round or closed in two years. However, this policy is not applied inflexibly where signs of a school&#039;s recovery are evident. Where failure exists, we shall not hesitate to intervene and encourage local authorities to consider closure.

</p>

<a name="50113-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>Before making a direction under the clause the Secretary of State or the Assembly must consult the LEA. In the case of foundation or voluntary schools, they must consult with the diocese or other appropriate authority and any appropriate persons. These requirements ensure that any decision on closure takes account of the position in the local area. The greatest concern must be to ensure that children receive a good <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="50113-27_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth </b>   moved Amendment No. 96:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>Page 30, line 3, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In exercising their duties and functions under this section, the governing body and the foundation governors of a school that is a Church of England school or a Roman Catholic Church school shall have regard to any advice issued by the appropriate diocesan authority.&quot;

<p><a name="st_180"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: In moving Amendment No. 96, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 100, 101 and 102 because they all touch on denominational inspection of schools of a religious character, often known as Section 23 inspections. I shall be as brief as I can.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>Amendment No. 96 is replicated in the case of Wales by Amendment No. 102. These amendments would require school governing bodies to have regard to any advice issued to them on such inspections by the appropriate diocesan authority. In the case of Church of England and Church in Wales schools, the appropriate authority is the diocesan board of education of the diocese in which the school is situated.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>I am in the happy position of moving these amendments in a warm ecumenical spirit. They take into account the particular needs of the two largest groups of schools with a religious character, the Anglican and Roman Catholic schools in England and Wales, although they are not the only groups. I stress that this is not the first time that someone speaking from these Benches has had the privilege of consulting the Catholic Education Service before moving an amendment with its explicit support. However, I am conscious that these amendments do not take account of the needs of other Christian schools&#151;for example, Methodist schools&#151;nor do they take account of the needs of Jewish, Sikh, Muslim or Seventh-day Adventist schools. I know that the Government have had discussions with the trustees of those schools and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_448"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 448</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that they might be inclined to consider giving them similar powers to those proposed for diocesan authorities in these amendments. I heartily welcome that development.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>The additional powers over governing bodies that I am proposing for diocesan authorities require some explanation since they do not imply any lack of trust in the thousands of people who, to great effect, give large amounts of their free time for the benefit of schools and their pupils.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>It should be noted that these powers are modest. Governing bodies would be required to have regard to any advice over denominational inspection that they received from diocesan authorities. This falls into line with a group of powers that Church of England diocesan boards of education have through the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991, as amended. Those noble Lords who laboured through the Education Act 2002 may remember that an amendment to the measure extended similar powers to diocesan boards of education to give advice over school admission policies to governing bodies to which they must have regard. I was not directly involved in those discussions, but I heartily welcomed them.

</p>

<a name="50113-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>Secondly, these powers would be the first modest constraint over governing bodies or, in the case of voluntary controlled schools, the foundation governors, in the conduct of denominational inspection. At present, they can appoint who they will to conduct an inspection on any basis that they choose. In practice, as soon as they hear that they are to be inspected by Ofsted, the overwhelming number of church schools turn to their diocesan authorities and ask for advice on who to appoint as a denominational inspector.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>In the case of the Church of England and the Church in Wales schools, the dioceses have a list of inspectors who have been trained and registered through a national process organised by the National Society which I chair as chairman of the Board of Education of the Church of England. They are slightly overlapping bodies. I will not go into the details. One day I will understand the full details myself. They conduct the inspection in accordance with a framework developed by the National Society through national consultation.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>A new, lighter framework, influenced by the current Ofsted changes, is presently being piloted and taken very seriously by us. The system generally works well, but not every school seeks or heeds the advice of the diocesan authority. It is important that the quality of the process continues to be improved and is as may be assured, and these new powers are a step towards greater quality assurance. Even so, they would probably not be necessary, nor would I be seeking them, if it were not for a significant change in the proposals for Ofsted inspections, which I fully support but which make a radical difference to the way in which inspections are arranged.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>Currently, with the support of the diocese, schools arrange inspections to take place at the same time or immediately after an Ofsted inspection. That is desirable in every way, but it would not be possible under the new arrangements without two changes. A <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_449"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 449</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

school may hear on a Friday afternoon that it is to be inspected the following week. That would leave no time for a denominational inspection to be arranged to take place at the same time.

</p>

<a name="50113-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>My officials have discussed this issue with Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Schools, who has agreed in principle that diocesan authorities can be notified well ahead of the date of forthcoming inspections, provided that they maintain confidentiality and do not tell the school. They will then arrange an inspection and inform the school on the Friday afternoon who is to undertake it. No doubt they will act on a basis agreed with each of the diocesan schools; the governing bodies will still formally make the appointment, having had regard to   the advice that they receive from the diocesan authority; and Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector has the power to inform the diocesan authority ahead of time. However, under the current arrangements they could do nothing with the information that they had received. Therefore, without these modest new powers, which also serve as a degree of quality assurance, the system would not work.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>Finally, I turn briefly to my proposed new clauses after Clause 48, in Amendments Nos. 100 and 101. These relate to academies with a religious character and, where they are Church of England or Roman Catholic institutions, extend to them the requirement of denominational inspection. At present there is a small number of such academies, and in a number of dioceses there are some developed plans for more. I hope that Members of the Committee will not find these proposals controversial but may even see in them a reassurance about some concerns over RE in one or two of those institutions that might be regarded as lacking in breadth or depth. I shall say no more on that.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>In summary, these probing amendments are about using and adapting existing structures and procedures in schools and academies with a denominational character, without frustrating, duplicating or ignoring them. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="50113-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   As one who has some involvement in the life of a Church of England school and has done previous work assisting in the development and thinking in Church of England schools, I intervene, having declared that interest, to say how very much I support these proposals. It is helpful to such schools to have the advice and guidance of the diocesan authority, although I note that it is to &quot;have regard to&quot; rather than to be told what to do, which I also welcome.
</p>

<a name="50113-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>I was particularly interested to hear what the right reverend Prelate had to say about the possible extension of such arrangements to Muslim, Jewish, Sikh and Seventh-day Adventist communities. In relation to academies and the powers of the proprietors, that could be a particularly helpful proposal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="50113-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </b>   I support the amendment. I was interested to hear the right reverend Prelate premise part of the practical proposals on an assumption that confidentiality would be kept by the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 450</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

diocesan board and offices. I shall go home to read more Trollope and reconsider whether I should send the right reverend Prelate a volume or two. That said, I support this amendment, particularly its ecumenical nature. Perhaps I may raise a wider point that the right reverend Prelate has raised by implication. The relation between religion and education, not least in the field of religious education <i>per se</i>, has been a notorious point of delicacy and, sometimes, of difficulty for Secretaries of State.

</p>

<a name="50113-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>When the great Butler Act of 1944 was first shown to the then Prime Minister Churchill, he referred to the relevant clauses as advocating Zoroastrianism or the county councils&#039; creed, such were the difficulties that was faced in formulating the arrangements for religious education. The arrangements of the 1992 Act, which are reflected in this Bill, were correct; but they were drawn up in considerable haste, I suspect, because that Act was moving through the Houses as a general election approached.

</p>

<a name="50113-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>The broader denominational and multi-religious character of our country was, perhaps, not given the attention that it might have received if there had been more time. In the light of that and the introduction of city academies, which equally were not known about at the time, would the Government welcome, at a later stage in the Bill, an amendment which provided for regulations to be made, after consultation with the relevant bodies, to extend the amendment to a wider range of schools which might fall under the classification of &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;denominational&quot;? That would be one way of handling the matter, without having to rush to develop a clause which would require broad consultation in the community.
</p>

<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="50113-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The amendment seeks to provide a greater statutory role for the diocesan authorities in the appointment of an inspector to inspect religious education and collective worship in the Church of England or Roman Catholic schools in England, or in Church in Wales or Roman Catholic schools in Wales. For the great majority of schools this is already custom and practice and works well. Schools already have existing close working relations with their diocese and are happy to take the recommendations of the diocese in appointing a suitably experienced and qualified inspector to undertake these inspections. Further, many dioceses actually relieve schools, at the schools&#039; request, of the burden of arranging these inspections.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>However, there are a few examples where the inspector appointed has not been of the right stuff&#151;where their experience has been found wanting or their processes were not sufficiently rigorous to identify areas for improvement in the teaching of the faith. This does no one any good. Parents rely on these inspectors to assure them that the faith they hold is being taught well in their schools. Schools may not be provided with sufficient challenge to their teaching of the faith to help them understand how it can be improved. To that end, we agree with the principles behind the right reverend Prelate&#039;s amendments.

</p>

<a name="50113-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>The aim is to ensure that the inspections to be carried out in schools with a denominational character are as congruous as possible with these additional inspections. We do not want to see schools subjected to multiple inspections where it can be helped. I know that there have been fruitful discussions with Ofsted and the representatives of the faith groups on this issue. I believe that it is intended that a protocol to allow the sharing of relevant information between Ofsted and appropriate individuals, on a confidential basis, is developed. Yet that would be of little effect if those inspections were not more robust.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>The Government believe in opportunity for all and the amendment would not aid those pupils in schools from other faiths. Officials from the department have been working hard with representatives from all faiths to look at how this can be achieved. No firm conclusions have been reached, but I am hopeful that the Government can support an amendment that will achieve the ambitions that we share.

</p>

<a name="50113-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>In Wales, the aim is also welcomed and the situation is similar. The aim is to ensure that the inspections to be carried out are of equal rigour to those undertaken by Estyn. Similarly, officials have been working with representatives from all faiths to consider how that can be achieved. Again, conclusions have not been finalised, but we are optimistic that they will be.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the other amendments tabled by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth. Amendment No. 100 concerns academies and city technology colleges which are designated as having a religious character. The amendment would create the same arrangements for the inspection of religious education and collective worship undertaken in those institutions as in maintained faith schools. The Government support the principles behind the amendment; namely, that the provision for the teaching of religious education and for a daily act of collective worship in academies should be inspected in a manner consistent with that for foundation and voluntary faith schools. We do not believe that it is necessary to place these requirements in the legislation as the same objective can be achieved by stipulating them in the funding agreement for each academy and CTC.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>We are confident that all existing academies and CTCs which are designated as having a religious character and which are sponsored by the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church will willingly change their funding agreements to implement the proposed inspection arrangements. The model funding agreement will be altered so that all new designated academies will be required to follow the inspection arrangements that apply to maintained faith schools.

<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>In response&#151;I am afraid that I simply cannot resist this&#151;as the son of a spy and a reader of Trollope, an episcopal colleague of mine was interviewed for a post at Lambeth Palace. On being asked a question, he replied, &quot;Confidentiality in the Church of England means telling one person at a time&quot;, whereupon he got the job. But I have to say that my experience of other walks of life is that this place leaks as well. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, will accept that in the spirit in which it is offered.

<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>I am very pleased to have the Minister&#039;s reassurances, and I conclude with one or two brief remarks about academies and RE. The Church of England can be very proud of pioneering by adapting what was in the past traditional and rather wooden RE in two directions&#151;in an ecumenical direction and an inter-faith direction&#151;and in the context of this kind of legislation, which will call into account academies and Church and faith schools. I also refer to the new initiatives relating to the RE framework, which personally I hope will move towards a syllabus. It will mean that in the schools of the other faith communities we shall be able to expect the same kind of breadth that I am proud to say is operated by the Church of England.

</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="50113-28_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton </b>   moved Amendment No.   104:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>Page 81, line 21, leave out paragraph 1.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>The noble Baroness said: Schedule 7 expands the general duty of the chief inspector for England to keep the Secretary of State informed about child minding. In addition to the quality and standards of child minding, he must also keep the Secretary of State informed about how far child minding and day care meet the range of children cared for, about the quality of the leadership and management of day care and about the contribution made by such facilities to the well-being of each child.

</p>

<a name="50113-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>In effect, it extends to childcare and day care the same judgment criteria now used by Ofsted in regard to the inspection of schools. Therefore, such an expansion raises a number of clear issues both from the inspectors&#039; point of view and from that of the day care and child minding providers. There is, of course, the general concern that this is yet another growth of the inspection services in yet another area of education provision that is seemingly unwarranted and unhelpful.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>However, in regard to the inspectors, the concern is not so much over the availability of inspectors, but whether the inspectors themselves will have adequate knowledge and be <i>au fait</i> with the particular circumstances involved in such provision.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>I know that the Minister in answer to an earlier question said that inspectors would have specialist knowledge, which would be very important, but inspecting a sixth form is considerably different from inspecting a child minding centre. Yet under this system that is what inspectors will be asked to do; they will be asked to judge both. Does the Minister have any concerns that there is a risk that the inspectors are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_454"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 454</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

becoming too generalised without the specialist knowledge required for different circumstances? Furthermore, what sort of additional strains, both in financial terms and in manpower, will this new responsibility place on Ofsted and how will it cope without cutting back in other areas?
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>In relation to the day care providers, there is very genuine concern that they may be swamped by new burdens and targets that are simply impractical for them to achieve. We might be dealing here with tiny, independently operated facilities that may well cater for only two or three children and yet they will be expected to know how best to contribute to the well-being of each child. I am not saying that they do not, but I am talking about the targets that they have to achieve.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>It may be possible for a 1,000-strong school, where there could well be the resources to accommodate such a requirement, but surely the Minister can anticipate some of the likely problems in regard to small day care centres. Indeed, how many owners of such facilities will know about the whole raft of legislation on well-being, let alone the official version as set out in Section   10(2) of the Children Act 2004? Therefore, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that childcare providers are made aware of those new categories on which they are to be judged? Will there be some sort of information exercise?
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>This seems to be very much a step too far in terms of excessive bureaucracy which is unlikely to improve the existing system. We have serious reservations about this paragraph and that is why Amendment No. 104 would remove it from the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-28_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>The other amendments to this schedule are consistent with our concerns over the scrapping of the registered inspectors and would retain the status quo for registered inspectors in the inspections of early-years provision in England and would ensure a unified approach between England and Wales. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="50113-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I start by saying that I fully share the concern that Ofsted&#039;s early years inspection workforce is of the highest quality and fit for the purpose. We attach great importance to the training and development of inspectors.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>Early childhood is a time of vital importance in children&#039;s development and the quality of care that children receive in their early years makes a real difference to their development and achievements in later life. Recent powerful research studies have shown that the gain achieved from good early years&#039; interventions into learning in primary school is sustained. So we have good reason for feeling that this thrust of policy is right.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>Schedule 7 removes the requirement on the chief inspector for England to maintain registers of early years childcare inspectors and nursery education inspectors. The amendment seeks to reverse that, which, in logic and consistency with the stance of earlier debates this week, we would expect. But we do not believe that removing these registers would be detrimental to the quality of childcare inspectors.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_455"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 455</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>At present, most Ofsted early years inspectors are Ofsted employees and, as such, are not separately registered. In the early years sector, Ofsted is already able to monitor the quality and ensure the accountability of its inspectors through its internal processes. Therefore, there is little need for a register.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_573"></a>However, should Ofsted decide in future to engage more external inspectors, as it currently does for its school inspections, it would be administratively cumbersome for Ofsted to have overlapping registration and contracting arrangements. We propose that Ofsted monitors and controls the performance and quality of any external inspector it may decide to engage in future through normal contract terms and contract management, which we believe is perfectly adequate and appropriate. That is currently the case for Ofsted-employed inspectors.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_574"></a>Contract negotiation and management will be just as effective as any registration system in securing the services of appropriately qualified and experienced inspectors, and a lot less bureaucratic for Ofsted to operate. All inspectors, whether external or directly employed by Ofsted, will still be required to meet stringent criteria. In addition, Ofsted already has in place robust quality assurance and performance management arrangements to ensure the quality of its early years inspectors.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_575"></a>Our proposal to remove the registers of early years childcare inspectors and nursery education inspectors represents an important simplification in the administration of the inspection arrangements in England, and should therefore stand.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>The other change we seek to introduce through Schedule 7, and which would be affected by the proposed amendments, is the additional matters on which we propose Ofsted and Estyn should be required to report. Our proposals for change apply both to the general duty of the chief inspector to keep the Secretary of State informed about the state of childcare nationally, and the individual reports that are made following inspection of childcare settings. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 7, which the amendment would remove, covers the latter. They also apply to all reports by Estyn in relation to nursery education.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>As the House knows, the Children Act 2004 provides that each children&#039;s services authority must promote co-operation in the delivery of children&#039;s services with a view to improving the well-being of children in their areas. Early years settings have their part to play and it is important that Ofsted assesses, as part of the inspection process, how the childcare contributes to children&#039;s well-being, not least so that these findings can be fed through to the joint area reviews to be led by Ofsted. Similarly, it is important that Estyn assesses how nursery education contributes to children&#039;s well-being. You could argue that in fact it is more important that there is an inspection of the well-being contribution, given the powerful evidence of the impact of early years influences on a child&#039;s future ability, not only to learn but also to socialise and to take a positive attitude to life. I shall not go into detail.

<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a>We believe it is important that Ofsted and Estyn report on how the childcare meets the needs of the range of children for whom it is provided, as children may have very different needs. Ofsted therefore plans to change the focus of its early years inspections so that judgments are made on the basis of what it is like for individual children within a childcare setting. The results of pilot inspections that have been carried out on this basis are encouraging. Both childcare providers and inspectors have been positive about the new approach and we believe that this will ultimately benefit the children.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>It is important to make specific reference to leadership and management for day care. As for schools, good leadership and management are crucial in securing high-quality early-years services. The amendment would remove those key changes to the matters on which Ofsted and Estyn must report. We believe that extending those criteria will ultimately help us to secure better childcare services that meet children&#039;s needs and contribute to their well-being&#151;all part of our determination to ensure that children are given the best start. Inspection is an important lever in improving quality, and the proposed changes to the legal frameworks will enable Ofsted and Estyn to carry out their inspection activity more effectively.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_580"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked whether inspectors were at risk of becoming too generalised, and whether they would be expected to cover both the sixth form and early years. My understanding is that they would not, because there would be specialisation. The most effective answer that I could give on manpower loads would be in a more detailed note from Ofsted that signals why we believe it is perfectly manageable. I will also respond in writing to the noble Baroness&#039;s question on how childcare providers would be made aware of the process. Although I have not given the noble Baroness full answers, I hope that she will await with eager anticipation the letters that will fill the gaps.

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>One of the most important elements of our 10-year childcare strategy, published last month, is that parents should have the information they need to make informed choices about childcare. Not least, they need to know what aspects of quality are important for their children&#039;s development and how the childcare they have chosen matches up. As noble Lords have said previously, parental involvement is vital; we share that view. They can exercise influence in securing improvement where necessary.

</p>

<a name="50113-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>That has been an established feature of the school inspection arrangements for some time, and the amendments, which apply to England only bring the early-years inspection arrangements into line with those considerations. School governing bodies are currently required to notify parents of forthcoming inspections and to ensure that each parent receives a copy of the subsequent inspection report. There is currently no such duty on early-years childcare or nursery education providers. The purpose of the amendments is therefore to ensure that parents&#039; rights to information before and after an inspection are the same for both schools and early-years settings.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>The amendments relate to Schedule 7, which deals with inspection of childminding, day care and nursery education. They propose that regulations may provide that registered childminders, day carers and &quot;responsible persons&quot; must notify prescribed persons of a forthcoming inspection. It is intended that those &quot;prescribed persons&quot; would be parents. They also provide that regulations may prescribe who is sent a copy of the report and to whom a copy of the report must be made available. It is intended that parents would be sent a copy of the report.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>Another technical amendment, Amendment No. 112, is not intended to make any practical difference to the inspection of nursery education but is necessary due to the repeal of Section 120 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 by the Children Act 2004.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>Although the regulation-making powers provided for in the amendments to Schedule 7 do not expressly make reference to parents, the regulations will make it clear that parents will be entitled to receive a copy of the inspection report. Draft regulations have already been provided to the House, but I will ensure that revised draft regulations, which take into account these amendments, are made available.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>We have carefully considered the impact of the new requirements on early-years settings, the majority of which comprise private and voluntary-sector providers. We are confident that the impact of the amendments will be minimal.
</p>

<a name="50113-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>I should also explain that Amendment No. 121 remains starred, as a small error in new sub-paragraph 2(c) was spotted late in the day; it has now been corrected. I hope that my remarks clarify the government amendments sufficiently for the Committee. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="50113-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>I believe that with any power to investigate and inspect an individual&#039;s personal possessions, or what in this case could be described as their intellectual property, we must be mindful that such a power does not unnecessarily intrude into private lives. It would therefore be useful if the Minister could explain where such a clause would be used&#151;in what circumstances and to achieve what aims. The matter of who would be authorised to carry out such an investigation also is relatively vague. I would also welcome the Minister&#039;s clarification on that.
</p>

<a name="50113-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>As the power has been around for just under 10   years, presumably the Minister can tell us how often it has been used and for what purposes and whether any difficulties in its use have arisen during that time.

The clause ensures that inspectors can go to the source of the records where it appears to them that there may be related material which is relevant to the inspection. That notion of related material is particularly important.
</p>

<a name="50113-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>As the noble Lord said, the power already exists. It is important because of the nature of the evidence inspectors collect when they come to cast judgment on the efficacy of the work being done. For example, where inspectors evaluate children&#039;s work done on computer, they may wish to look at preparatory work, previous drafts, source materials or test animations or to look at work using control technology&#151;in a sense, the prehistory of the project. Increasingly, schools&#039; and early-years providers&#039; management systems, timetables and attendance records are also held electronically. We are looking at a departure from the use of paper because much of the evidence used to validate pupils&#039; work and the schools&#039; organisational structures and strategies are on computer.
</p>

<a name="50113-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>Computer systems are inevitably secure systems. Inspectors will need to be given access to them or have material retrieved or demonstrated for them. This clause gives them the right to do so. It makes a specific distinction between computers and other records and provides for inspectors to have access to relevant computer records during an inspection. That is what it does.
</p>

<a name="50113-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>The noble Lord raised issues of personal property and personal data. In looking at schools&#039; records and documentation, inspectors will see personal data of the staff and pupils. However, they will not take copies of the data and Ofsted does not collect personal data on individuals when inspecting schools; that is outwith the inspection. Therefore, the Data Protection Act does not apply. We are looking at Ofsted&#039;s own records in that respect. The school has its own responsibilities for data protection. If it is concerned about material that it is presenting to the inspectors, including personal data, it would have to decide whether to anonymise that information. So I think that the noble Lord&#039;s first point is covered by that.
</p>

<a name="50113-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>This clause is very much about the inspectors&#039; access over the past 10 years to the sources of information, to give them a good fix on what they are looking at superficially. So in that sense the power is benign. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that such access is necessary. It minimises the burdens that would otherwise be placed on schools and early-years settings.

</p>

<a name="50113-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>Schedule 7 includes a number of provisions which replace references to the School Inspections Act with the equivalent references in the Bill. Paragraph 6 of Schedule   7 would amend Section 79(u) of the Children Act 1989 by replacing a reference to the School Inspections Act 1996 with a reference to the provisions in Clause 57. Clause 57 re-enacts Section 42 of the 1996 Act, <br>&nbsp;<br>

as the noble Lord said. Paragraph 6 of Schedule 7 is therefore required as a consequential amendment to the repeal of Section 42.
</p>

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="50113-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Clause 53 and Schedule 8 amend Part 10 Chapter 1 of the Education Act 2002, which relates, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, to the inspection of independent schools. The amendments are of a technical nature and are required&#151;as the noble Lord signalled&#151;as a result of the discontinuance of the use of registered inspectors to inspect schools in England. Registered inspectors will still carry out inspections in Wales.

</p>

<a name="50113-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_611"></a>To make the changes, it has been necessary to provide separate clauses for England and Wales. No other changes to the inspection arrangements for independent schools are being made and the powers to inspect independent schools as set out in the current Section 163 and the rights of entry and related supplementary responsibilities in Section 164 remain.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_612"></a>In practice, registered inspectors have not been used in the inspection of independent schools in England since the power was introduced in Section 163(1)(a) of the Education Act 2002. All inspections carried out under Section 163(1)(a) have continued to be undertaken by Ofsted, and the removal of the power for inspection by registered inspectors has no practical effect.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_613"></a>Schedule 8 inserts a new Section 162A into the Education Act 2002 that replicates the provisions of existing Section 163 but removes the references to registered inspectors in Section 163(1)(a). The amendment relates to the inspection of independent schools by Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Schools in England only.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_614"></a>Schedule 8 also inserts new Section 162B, which replicates the provisions of the existing Section 164 in relation to inspections of independent schools in England, except that the reference in Section 164(1) to registered inspectors is removed and Sections 164(2)(3) and (4) are no longer relevant, as they refer to inspections conducted by registered inspectors.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_615"></a>Finally, Schedule 8 replaces existing Sections 163 and 164 of the Education Act 2002 to maintain the status quo for inspections of independent schools in Wales, where power to allow registered inspectors to conduct inspections will continue.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a>I hope that that explanation is clear, if fulsome. I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on the point about consultation. I hope that my explanation has been helpful. For those reasons, we believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

education and training providers within the chief inspector&#039;s remit. It means that the same rigour is applied to the inspection of the careers service in Wales as has been applied to all other aspects of education and training. The provision will also give the power to inspect any provider of career services and to publish the findings. This is an important and welcome development. It will mean that there is more readily accessible information on the quality and standard of the services provided for young people in respect of Careers Wales. Inspection reports will provide a template for the Assembly working with Careers Wales to continue to improve the services provided and to take early action to address shortcomings.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>Therefore, it is quite right that the chief inspector should be required to report every year and that the report be published. It will be an annual report to the Assembly. It is a kind of state of the nation report and that is why the Assembly is the right place to receive it. It will summarise the key findings.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>As regards the laying of the report, Clause 20 requires that it is made and published by the Assembly, as is currently the case under the School Inspections Act read with the Government of Wales Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, education and training in Wales are devolved matters as a result of the provision in the Government of Wales Act which makes the National Assembly for Wales responsible for the funding of the inspectorate. As I have said, there is no doubt that a report on the state of the nation like this belongs with Wales.

</p>

<a name="50113-31_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>I cannot avoid saying that to accept the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, to require a report to be laid before Parliament as well as the Assembly would alter the devolution settlement. We are not inclined to do that. It is the Assembly which is responsible for the direction of education policy in Wales and it is right that the chief inspector should report only to the Assembly on matters which fall within that function.
</p>

<a name="50113-31_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_629"></a>Parliament does have a wider remit and in particular as regards discharging duties related to the use of public money and the value for money obtained. There are already mechanisms: there is the Comptroller and the Auditor-General who can carry out examinations into and report on the finances of the chief inspector&#039;s office. The House of Commons&#039; Public Accounts Committee can ask the Assembly&#039;s Audit Committee to take evidence. That is laid down in the Government of Wales Act.

<a name="50113-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   It is clear from some of our debates that we have a diverging education system on either side of the border. It is separate and distinct, which is only right with the creation of the Welsh Assembly. As we said several times at Second Reading, it would have been advantageous if we could have had a separate Bill to deal with the specific elements relating to Wales.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_636"></a>Although we have an assembly in Cardiff with its own education Minister handling the devolved responsibilities for education, it seems slightly odd that Members of your Lordships&#039; House are being asked to take part in judgments on an area of devolved responsibility. However, I am of course aware that such powers are far more limited than is the case for the Scottish Parliament.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_637"></a>Make no mistake, I believe that this is the Parliament of the entire United Kingdom. However, when considering the lack of amendments tabled in respect of the Welsh elements of the Bill, it worries me that noble Lords may be under the impression that such areas are somehow off limits. We are concerned that we may be passing legislation while the expected level of scrutiny that this House demands is not being met, thus doing a gross disservice to the Welsh people.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_638"></a>Perhaps the Minister could take a moment to explain&#151;if he is unable to provide an answer today, perhaps he would write to me&#151;why we are discussing such matters of devolved responsibility. Which particular elements of the Welsh education policy are devolved and which are reserved? Which section of the Government of Wales Act 1998 is applicable to this concern, and what if any plans do the Government have to address this issue in the near future?

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_642"></a>That is what we have given Wales and we want to act on it as far as we can in this Bill.

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="50113-32_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I am sorry that that lively debate has come to an end. To be called to arbitrate between the two Opposition parties is rather a luxurious position. Moreover, I am glad that the noble Lord has confirmed the welcome given by the Conservatives to devolution in Wales.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_643"></a>Education and training are wholly devolved matters. I understand that certain provisions set out in Clause 61 will allow for changes to be made by regulation, but those will be based on consultation. That said, part of the answer to the noble Lord&#039;s fundamental question is that when changes are made in Wales following enabling provisions set out in legislation in this place, that is done, as always, on the basis of consultation undertaken in Wales. There is a dichotomy here. There is always some difficulty for us in the London Parliament discussing in detail Welsh affairs which we are not fully informed about. It is for the Assembly to get that right and to put consultation processes in place.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_644"></a>Let me explain why Wales has the ability to make changes at a later stage. A new inspection system was introduced in Wales in September 2004. Bringing all inspection within one framework is a major change. That puts a major new responsibility on the providers and on the inspection process. It is based on the principle that the scale of inspection should be proportionate to performance with scaled-down <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_467"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 467</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

inspections for schools with a strong emphasis on high standards continually being achieved. The inspection process remains vigorous and effective.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_645"></a>Along with those changes and with this Bill it was recognised that there is some point in making a number of changes in legislation to support the implementation of the common inspection framework in Wales. However, the emphasis is on taking powers to amend inspection arrangements by regulation as the common inspection framework beds in. Any changes will be subject to full consultation with schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_646"></a>I believe that we should leave this subject there. These are matters for the Welsh Inspectorate and Welsh schools, the Welsh education framework and interested parties. The noble Lord is right; at Second Reading there was discussion about whether consideration had been given to a separate Bill for Wales. My noble friend subsequently wrote to the noble Lords, Lord Roberts and Lord Livsey of Talgarth, confirming that we had considered this. However, we thought that the synergies between the changes for England and Wales were strong enough to warrant a single Bill; in view of the large number of clauses covering England and Wales, that makes sense.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_647"></a>The most important point is that the department, the Welsh Office and the Assembly work well together so we get both the process and the outcome right. Whether we have a single or joint Bill is less important than whether its implementation is properly done and effective.

</p>

<a name="50113-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_648"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, is not in his place. He spoke very eloquently about what it was important to achieve in Wales. He said that Wales could adopt the new inspectorate system for England in its entirety but, having taken the view that this novel common inspection framework was only recently introduced, it was too early to change the system yet. That sounds reasonable enough. It is important that Wales should keep its options open. The noble Lord <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_468"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column 468</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

preferred any impression of lack of joined-up thinking to regretting a missed legislative opportunity by closing off an option early. Those were wise words.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_649"></a>I hope the noble Lord is reassured by that. The central provision has to be that inspection develops in a manner that is distinctive to and serves the needs of the learners. The provisions in Clause 61 will provide the Assembly with the necessary powers to develop an inspection framework which is sensitive to need but which is also progressive and consistent with what young people will need in the coming years. So I hope on that basis he will withdraw his objection.
</p>

<a name="50113-32_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that. I was never going to vote to remove part of this clause. I opposed the Question, that Clause 61 stand part in order to get the sort of answer that we have just had. We felt&#151;my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy was unable to stay for this debate&#151;that there is a big chunk of the Bill about Wales but that there has not been that much discussion or amendments about it. Therefore it was not fair on Wales that we were not discussing this more. Yes, we have a Welsh Assembly; whether we agree with it or not it is here and has devolved powers. We felt that there should be more discussion in your Lordships&#039; House.

</p>

<a name="50113-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
   &quot;PUBLIC REPRESENTATION

<br>
(1)   Section 4C of the 1995 Act (office-holders: introductory) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 4C(3)(a) the words &quot;and in respect of which they are entitled to remuneration&quot; are omitted.


<br>
(3)   In section 4C(3)(b) at end insert &quot;or regional or local authority&quot;.&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would extend the protection of the legislation to public appointees who do not receive any remuneration for their work. It would also cover public appointments made by regional and local authorities such as school governors. At present, disabled people who serve on public bodies such as health authorities are protected against discrimination if they are appointed by Ministers and paid for their services. If they are not paid or the post-holder is appointed by a public body such as a local authority, they are not covered. It has been pointed out by the Disability Charities Consortium that unpaid service on public bodies can provide an important bridge for disabled people into paid employment, and that service on public bodies allows disabled people to become fully involved and valued in their communities.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>It is worth pointing out that the record of public bodies in promoting disabled people&#039;s inclusion is poor. The Joint Committee had some figures from the department showing that there are 9.7 million disabled adults and 750,000 disabled children&#151;more than 10 million people altogether&#151;yet only 3 per cent of members of non-departmental public bodies are disabled people. Another part of the reason why disabled people are excluded from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

public life is the failure of too many public bodies to make reasonable adjustments to allow disabled people to participate by, for example, holding their meetings in locations with loop induction facilities and that are accessible for wheelchairs.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Whether or not a public appointee receives some remuneration should make no difference when it comes to them being protected by anti-discrimination legislation. Indeed, many disabled people who would be interested in public appointments are discouraged from accepting posts that are remunerated as it may adversely affect their benefits position. Similarly, why should a disabled person whose post is a ministerial appointment be protected against discrimination, while someone appointed by a local or regional authority receives no protection?

</p>

<a name="50113-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 extended protection to office holders where they are entitled to remuneration and where the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;post is one to which appointments are made by a Minister of the Crown, a government department, the National Assembly for Wales or any part of the Scottish Administration&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The Joint Committee, which I had the honour to chair, recommended that the Government re-examine the subject&#151;it was covered by Clause 15 in the draft Bill&#151;and all existing anti-discrimination legislation, with the intention of ensuring that no statutory elected and appointed office and post holders were excluded from   coverage. The Government did not accept that recommendation. They feel that the DDA offers protection at least as comprehensive as any other domestic anti-discrimination legislation, which I find hard to understand given the distinction between the remunerated and the unremunerated posts.

</p>

<a name="50113-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The committee also recommended that the relevant clause should be reviewed, and that the full Bill as introduced to Parliament protected disabled councillors from direct discrimination in appointments to posts of the kind described in the amendment. The Government said that they did not accept that legal oversight was necessary in relation to such appointments within a democratically elected body, which I thought a rather odd answer. There we are, however; that was the answer that we got. The point is straightforward. I beg to move.

Any resultant delay is the fault of the Government Whips and not any Member of your Lordships&#039; Committee.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The Minister has made a great start on her side as far as co-operation is concerned and I would like to congratulate both her and her officials on managing to get the promised quasi Keeling schedule to us before Christmas. Perhaps a reflection the word &quot;quasi&quot; is a little unfair. Non-statutory were the words that the Minister used on Second Reading. However, in my own defence, &quot;quasi&quot; is shorter.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said, as it stands now, office or post holders are covered by the Act as far as their role as employers of both direct employees and contract workers are concerned. Furthermore, local authority partnerships, barristers and advocates employed by local authorities arguably could be said to be contract workers, but could be directly paid employees. Curiously, those in charge of practical work experience courses are all covered. However, they are covered under Section 4C(3)(a) only if their employer, for want of a better word, is paid. Many office or post holders will not be paid as such. Like Members of this House, they will get only expenses that can hardly be described as remuneration. It seems to us on this side of the House that since both the remunerators and the remunerated are doing exactly the same job, they should be covered in exactly the same way. Therefore, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Carter.

<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50113-33_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   I briefly add my support to the amendment. The lack of education and life opportunities mean that many disabled people lack the confidence to   take part in public life. These unpaid public appointments are a vital bridge for many in gaining the confidence and experience to go further. I hope that the Minister will give kind consideration to this amendment.

</p>

<a name="50113-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Several Members of the Grand Committee were also on that committee and I appreciate that, as a result, we have not needed some of the probing amendments that we might otherwise have needed because that job has already been done in pre-legislative scrutiny. I hope that that should allow us a more expeditious handling of this Bill and to focus on policy issues rather than elements of the drafting. As a consequence, as the noble Lord rightly said, that should allow us to do what disabled people are expecting&#151;to get this Bill securely on the legislative book before any judgment may be made at the end of this parliamentary Session.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The apparent discrepancy raised by my noble friend about appointments by Ministers but not appointments by local and regional authorities is more apparent than real because one is done in the first clause and the other in the second clause. Therefore, I do not think that there is an issue, but let me spell the matter out in greater detail.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The purpose of this clause, as its heading suggests, is to ensure protection against discrimination for disabled people involved in public representation. That is the very   thing the DDA already does and the Bill would complete. Once our package of reforms is in place, the DDA will protect office holders as comprehensively as any other equality legislation.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The 2003 regulations covered many offices and posts for the first time&#151;as Committee Members will know because most of us were present at those discussions&#151;and gave greater protection to offices and posts that had previously been covered. For example, police officers gained protection for the first time and people appointed by Ministers gained much wider protection than had   previously existed under the DDA. This clause covers councillors, fulfilling a promise made by the Government towards inclusion. Clause 2 covers the functions of public bodies and is therefore intended to cover appointments&#151;for example, school governors&#151;made by such a body in that clause. Therefore, many of the concerns that my noble friend had are not well founded because it is simply a case of a disjunction of the purpose of the two clauses.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Let me expand a little. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 transposed the European Framework Directive on equal treatment in employment. The DDA now protects those who are appointed to an office to discharge functions personally, are remunerated and who perform their duties under the direction of another, and also those who are appointed by government or on advice of Ministers. They are protected not only in relation to the appointment, but also, for example, in the tasks they undertake and in how their appointment is ended. Previously only ministerial and government appointments were protected and then only in relation to the actual appointment. This means, for example, that the chair and commissioners of the DRC are covered in this way or lay magistrates because they are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. People holding the office of police constable are protected separately by the DDA, but also as a result of the 2003 regulations.
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>This Bill brings forward the remainder of our reforms that affect office holders. The provisions contained within the Bill will further extend cover to local councillors (Clause 1).
</p>

<a name="50113-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>In addition, Clause 2 will ensure that in broad terms all the activities of the public sector are covered by the DDA; for example, people appointed by local authorities&#151;as my noble friend asked&#151;and regional authorities which are not covered under Clause 1. This would mean that it would be unlawful for a public authority to treat a disabled person less favourably, or   fail to make a reasonable adjustment without justification when carrying out its functions. As I say, school governors would be a good example of that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Our approach therefore means that the DDA will work in a similar way to the Race Relations Act. It also applies, for example, to the appointment of members of the management boards of the new NHS foundation trusts as they are selected by a board of governors. Present NHS trusts appointed by the Minister are already covered. In future the equivalent in the foundation trusts will be covered but under Clause 2, not Clause 1. Essentially, my noble friend is perfectly honourably criticising Clause 1 for not being Clause 2. I hope that with that explanation he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

If the unitary authorities are not covered&#151;and I take the point that the Explanatory Notes say that they are because all local authorities are included&#151;they most certainly should be.

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50113-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The suspicions of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, are entirely correct. I am sympathetic to this amendment, because there could be a question asked as to whether there was some exclusion of a type of authority. I have checked this carefully, and I am assured that unitary authorities are a subset, if you like, of the existing list. Therefore, all authorities in English, Welsh and Scottish local government are fully included.
</p>

<a name="50113-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>While the term &quot;unitary authority&quot; is often used, it is not a separate category of local authority. It simply describes an authority that is exercising in its area all the principal local government functions, such as housing, education and social services. The unitary authority could be either a county council, because of the coterminosity of its boundaries, or it could be a district council. If it is a district council, it has county council functions conferred by order, and the same is true if it is a county council. We are following here the descriptive practice of local government legislation which insists that unitary authorities can be either district councils or county councils. Therefore, no unit of local government is excluded from the purview of this legislation.

<p><a name="st_19"></a>The noble Lord said: We now get to the largest group of amendments that we are likely to consider during this part of the Bill; Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 21 and 22. This being Grand Committee, it is very unlikely that any amendments, except possibly Government ones, will be accepted. I put down this series of amendments in shorthand form. Clearly, Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 7 do not fit in very well with new Sections 15B and 15C, which would have to be reworked by better draftsmen than I. However, I am concerned here with the principle; namely that no publicly elected authority should be excluded from the Act. That is based on recommendation 44 of the Joint Committee&#039;s report, which can be found in paragraphs 257 to 262.

</p>

<a name="50113-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 22 aim to question which bodies will be considered public under this Bill and which Her Majesty&#039;s Government are going to exclude. I am well aware that the difference, according to the Government, between the bodies listed in the Bill and the two national bodies is that the latter make law, and that makes them distinct. However, there are two counter-arguments here, which have not been addressed. First, in a limited fashion local authorities do make law in the shape of bylaws, admittedly under national law. None the less, the laws that they make have the effect of controlling the electorate&#039;s behaviour, for example in car parking, blue badges, and in certain other respects.
</p>

<a name="50113-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Amendment No. 13 probes what acts it is intended that public authorities may conduct that if permitted will allow discrimination against disabled people, in the light of the statement in the Bill that new Section 21B(2) does not apply to an act of a prescribed description. The second is that governments, once elected, have office and post holders, and do control employees, even if they are not technically or legally employers. Surely, then, they should not be excluded from anti-discrimination legislation. We have had a little bit on that already, but it would be helpful to have a little more explanation.
</p>

<a name="50113-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>It is often said that governments do not make legislation binding themselves in modern times. That may be so&#151;but it was not always so. What about the Parliament Acts, especially the second one, under which this Government pass legislation that has failed to get agreement in both Houses? I am sorry, I should not have said &quot;this Government&quot;, as in fact that involves governments of both parties. I correct myself.

<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50113-34_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Ah, but it depends what you believe the standing of the second Parliament Act is, when you make that remark.
</p>

<a name="50113-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>What about the Executive not extending the period between elections beyond five years without the agreement of your Lordships&#039; House?

</p>

<a name="50113-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>New Clause 49 covers the activities of public authorities more widely than Clause 1 does, covering Ministers, local authorities, the police, NHS bodies and other government organisations, as the Joint Committee recognised. However, the Scottish Parliament itself is specifically excluded, as are persons,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;exercising functions in connection with  . . . the Scottish Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The same words are to be found in Clause 2 and are replicated in both places by applying to Westminster as well. The Government, whether in the shape of the Scottish Executive or not, need to control both, so they should be included under the coverage of the amended Act.
</p>

<a name="50113-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Similarly, new Clause 21C refers to Acts of the Scottish Parliament rather than the Parliament itself. It refers also to,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;a member of the Scottish Executive&quot;,</p>

<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50113-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Higgins, have tabled a series of amendments which the noble Lord, Lord   Skelmersdale, has introduced and described for us. Amendments to Clauses 2 and 3&#151;that is, Amendments Nos. 7, 9, 13, 21 and 22&#151;would remove a number of exemptions for bodies and acts of bodies from the provisions outlined in Clauses 2 and 3 which deal with discrimination by public authorities when carrying out their functions and places a duty on them to promote equality for disabled people. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, which relate to Clause 1, refer to the coverage of Members of Parliament in Westminster and Edinburgh and would provide rights under the DDA when Members are carrying out their official business.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I would like to begin by addressing those amendments which relate to Parliament. Amendment No. 7 would remove the exemptions granted to Parliament and persons exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament from the requirement not to discriminate in exercising functions of a public nature. Amendment No. 21 would remove from the Bill the exemptions from the general duty to promote equality that would be introduced by Clause   3, including the exemptions relating to Parliament and the Scottish Parliament. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would provide protection from discrimination for MPs and MSPs.

</p>

<a name="50113-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The Disability Rights Task Force in its 1999 report, <i>From Exclusion to Inclusion</i> looked at whether the Disability Discrimination Act should be extended to cover elected members including councillors, MPs, MSPs and Members of the Welsh Assembly. The task force was unequivocal in its recommendations. While it sought the protection of the law for local councillors, which my noble friend Lord Carter has just pressed me on and which we are delighted to see in the framework of the Bill. The task force recommended that internal procedures of Assemblies or Parliaments should be used to secure reasonable adjustments for their Members. The Government agree with that conclusion.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The inclusion of Members of Parliament within Clause 1 would undermine an important principle. That principle is that Parliament should have sole control over its own affairs and procedures; it is the principle of &quot;exclusive cognisance&quot;.

</p>

<a name="50113-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Contrary to this principle, the imposition of non-discrimination duties in relation to MPs would mean that issues surrounding the conduct of their official business could be determined by employment tribunals and, on appeal, the courts.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The same argument applies to the exemptions for Parliament from the new duties applied to public authorities. These very limited exemptions follow the pattern of the exemptions from equivalent provisions in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>If the DDA were extended to functions such as these, MPs here in Westminster who had been disciplined by the Speaker might expect to be able to challenge such sanctions in courts or tribunals. This would allow the courts to exercise control over parliamentary procedures in breach of the principle of &quot;exclusive cognisance&quot;
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Members of the Committee will wish to note that the Joint Committee which scrutinised the draft Bill considered this exemption and invited the Clerks to the Parliament to give written evidence. The Joint Committee did not, however, recommend that these exemptions should be removed from the Bill. So there has been no support from either the task force or the Joint Committee.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Nevertheless, while the Government believe that these exemptions are necessary, I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that Parliament should still choose to behave as if the exempted functions relating to Parliament were within the scope of the DDA in the same way as it voluntarily applies the provisions of other Acts. In other words, as far as possible it should bring itself within the spirit of the legislation without exposing Parliament to external jurisdictions. For example, it would be only right that noble Lords who are wheelchair users should be able, as they are today, to enter the Chamber, take part in debates, and so on.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Amendment No. 21 also refers to exemptions relating to national security. These are designed to ensure that information of a sensitive nature is not disclosed in proceedings under the DDA. I think that Members of the Committee would accept that need.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 9, 13 and 22 would remove the powers for the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulation certain public bodies which are not subject to the duty not to discriminate in Clause 2 and the new public sector duty in Clause 3. They would also remove the power that enables the Secretary of State to prescribe that certain acts are excluded from   the anti-discrimination provisions. There is no hidden agenda there; should the security services be   reorganised, for example, it would allow for a consequent adjustment to be made quickly and simply rather than needing primary legislation. That is the type of instance where such a regulatory power would be needed. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Scrutiny Committee are content with this regulation.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>With this explanation, which is essentially about the supremacy of Parliament to control its affairs while expecting it to exercise the spirit of the legislation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50113-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Yes, of course I will withdraw the amendment. However, I rather think that time has <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50113-35_para11"></a>

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is straightforward and seeks an assurance from the Government. The Joint Committee had a number of concerns because the provisions to protect disabled councillors against discrimination were confusing. That was particularly the case for reasonable adjustment where there was concern that it did not explicitly cover auxiliary aids. It was also felt not to be consistent with the wording of the employment provisions. The committee therefore recommended that the wording of new Section 15C followed the duty of employers to make reasonable adjustment.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>We were pleased that the Government have listened to our concerns and streamlined the reasonable adjustment duty of the Part 3 provisions. There is an inconsistency which we believe can be answered on the record by the Minister. The Government have retained a regulation-making power further to define the reasonable adjustment duty. This means that the Government could, if they wished, restrict the duty in the future.
</p>

<a name="50113-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The Disability Charities Consortium pointed out to me that since October 2004 the Government do not have this power in other areas of employment, including contract workers, officeholders and barristers. I should have thought that the barristers would be well able to look after themselves.

</p>

<a name="50113-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>&quot;Never&quot; is a dangerous word in politics. I have a hazy memory&#151;which I was trying to clear with a rapid question to my noble friend Lord Higgins&#151;of a politician in the 50s, well before my time, who said &quot;never&quot;. He was subsequently proved wrong and had to resign. While this is not a parallel situation as orders can be changed quickly in the light of experience, nevertheless the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and I would like to know how far the Government are proposing to go.

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50113-36_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is not exactly the question which I believe is at the core. Let me have a go at explaining exactly how the provision is meant to work. New Section 15C sets out the duty of an authority to make reasonable adjustments in relation to its disabled members and broadly follows the pattern of Part 2 of the Act which deals with employment and related matters.

</p>

<a name="50113-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>An authority will be under a duty to make an adjustment where a provision, criterion or practice it applies, or which is applied on its behalf, or a physical feature of premises which it occupies or controls, places a disabled member at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with non-disabled members in relation to the carrying-out of official business. An authority will then be under a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the provision, criterion, practice or physical feature from having that effect.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>New Section 15C(3) provides that the duty in subsection (2) does not apply if the authority could not reasonably be expected to know that the member has a disability and is likely to be affected in the way mentioned in subsection (1).
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>New Section 15C(4) enables the Secretary of State to make regulations elaborating on the duty to make adjustments should evidence emerge that it is not practicable to follow the general approach adopted for the rest of Part 2 of the DDA.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>There are no equivalent powers to those set out in new Section 15C(4) in the rest of Part 2 of the DDA. However, powers in almost identical terms to these existed in the DDA until 1 October 2004, but have now been repealed. Let me explain why.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>In 2003, the House debated and accepted the European regulations of 2003, which came into effect on 1 October 2004. Those regulations transpose the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

European Union Framework Directive. They effectively rewrote and replaced Part 2 of the DDA. There is no minimum size, for example, for a firm to be exempt from the workings of the DDA. They were hugely important changes. Regulations made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 permit of no further sub-delegation; therefore as part of that exercise all pre-existing powers were repealed and replaced as necessary with provision on the face of Part 2.

</p>

<a name="50113-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Should the need for modification of Part 2 arise on any matters within the scope of the Employment Framework Directive, this may be dealt with by further regulations made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The same cannot be done in relation to the new Sections 15A, 15B and 15C, which regulate a relationship falling outside the scope of the Employment Framework Directive. Therefore we need specific powers to make regulations and those powers have been taken.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Perhaps I may give example to show how this addresses the point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Skelmersdale. At present, Section 18B(1) of the Act sets out the factors to be taken into account when a person decides whether it is reasonable or not to make an adjustment. Such factors include the extent of financial and other resources available to make adjustments.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Section 18B(2) of the Act sets out the steps which a person may need to take in relation to a disabled person to comply with the duty to make reasonable adjustments. They might include allocating some of a disabled person&#039;s duties to another person. Section 18D(2) of the Act defines what is and what is not a physical feature. For example, it describes as a physical feature any feature arising from the design and construction of a building or premises.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>These factors, steps and definitions of physical features have worked well when applied to the relationship between employers and employees. Only time and experience will tell whether they work equally well in relation to the relationship between local councils and their members. We hope that they will and we have no reason to think that they will not. But if changes are required in future, Ministers will be able to make them through regulations with an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny, as conferred by the Delegated Powers Committee.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I hope that in response to that technical description&#151;the need arises because of the discrepancies between the EU directives and what we are seeking to do with councillors&#151;my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he is satisfied with what was, I am afraid, a rather long reply.

</p>

<a name="50113-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>There has been a European directive stating that staff should not lift patients. This is putting patients in intolerable positions when they go into hospital for diagnosis and treatment if suitable equipment is not available.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>The problem was brought to my notice first-hand when I fractured a leg in two places getting stuck in a door in your Lordships&#039; House about a year ago. I went to St Thomas&#039;s Hospital for an X-ray and a male nurse told me that he would have to get a hoist from one of the wards. It never came.

<a name="50113-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Eventually an Australian radiographer said that I had waited too long and the person who came with her got me on the X-ray table. There was no equipment which made this job easier in the accident and emergency department.

<a name="50113-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>One in five people in Britain are disabled in some way. This is no small matter. I could quote many cases where there have been huge difficulties for patients. Patients are brought to hospitals for all sorts of investigations and health screening such as cervical smears and prostate investigations. After an accident, it may be important to move a patient very carefully.
</p>

<a name="50113-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Some years ago, when I was on a regional health authority, I asked questions about facilities for disabled people when I could never find them mentioned on the agenda. Their needs seem often to be forgotten.

<a name="50113-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I fully understand that hospital and health workers in the community should not damage themselves by lifting heavy patients.

same access to diagnosis and treatment. If that access is impaired in any way due to inadequate equipment, the result is discrimination. Naturally, I fully support the   aims of the European directive and its protection of the health and safety of staff.

<a name="50113-36_para22"></a>

As chair of an NHS community trust, I was embarrassed and ashamed of facilities made available to people with major disabilities in access to a whole variety of services. Of course we all support the EU directive to protect healthcare workers and others when lifting. But disabled people are frequently left to have a mammograph to access other services if they are, for instance, using mental health services. That simply will not do.

<a name="50113-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   I, too, support the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. It is a profoundly important amendment. She mentioned the situation to the All-Party Disability Group last week and I was horrified to hear the evidence. It is condemnation of what is happening in British hospitals to disabled people and it is hard to believe.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Why have we not previously heard of this scandal&#151;because scandal it is? It is the old story of people suffering in silence and it simply is not good enough. We know what the situation is and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, has done the committee a great favour. I hope that my noble friend Lady Hollis will be able to respond constructively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50113-37_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not know whether what I am about to say will be regarded as responding constructively. The amendment would insert a new Section 21(2A) into the DDA requiring NHS hospital trusts to have regard to the provision of adequate equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of disabled people when considering their duty under Section 21 to make reasonable adjustment.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>No one could fail to sympathise with the examples mentioned today. I have taken careful advice and I must say that the amendment adds nothing to the current duty of the hospitals. It would not require them to make any adjustments that were not reasonable or to consider factors that they do not already consider. For example, it could be a matter of resources, which are one of the tests of reasonableness. In that case, it is not essentially different from the mother of a newborn premature baby who feels that she should have the right to an incubator in the local hospital but will have to travel 50 or 100 miles to get it because the hospital cannot justify the expense or provide the trained staff to do so. I am not saying that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those are identical examples, but the question of resources applies across the board in that situation too.

<a name="50113-37_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Under the new public sector duties, hospital trusts have further responsibilities in relation to the delivery of their functions, as well as a duty to promote equality of opportunity. Those will have a further positive impact on the delivery of health services to disabled people. However, I do not know whether, in the instance suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, a disabled person needing a mammograph or X-ray would need a different type of equipment that is so expensive that it might be organised on only a regional basis, so requiring travel. That seems not impossible.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>In that sense, although I entirely sympathise with what the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, said about a hoist&#151;that is completely unacceptable&#151;I gently suggest that the amendment would add nothing to the current duties, responsibilities and functions of hospitals. The amendment is not the right way of addressing the issue. However, the noble Baroness raised the matter yesterday at Starred Questions, so it has been raised beyond the all-party group. At Starred Questions, my noble friend Lord Warner was rightly concerned at the situation that she described. He is taking it away to have a look at it, which may be a more helpful and appropriate response than trying to lay a mandatory duty on hospitals to provide equipment, training and trained staff to handle it. That may not be appropriate in all situations, and is not reasonable. I expect her to get a response from my noble friend that I hope will obviate such situations occurring in future.

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50113-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   I thank all noble Lords who have spoken, including the Minister. However, we need more than sympathy. Sympathy is all very well, but there are people in our hospitals now probably sitting and waiting for treatment because there is not so simple a thing as a hoist or monkey pole above an X-ray table. Some such things are not very expensive. Today, I was interviewing for the Winston Churchill Fellowship in Kensington, and someone said to me that it was all very well the Chancellor of the Exchequer putting Africa in order, but that a neighbour of his had just had a stroke and had appalling problems in a hospital in Kent. People are beginning to realise the problem.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>It is not good enough for disabled people to suffer in silence. It is our duty in Parliament to do something about it. As the Minister said, the problem probably is resources. Why should disabled people come at the bottom of the list? That is what the Bill is all about. I will get together with the supporters of the amendment before the next stage. I will also try to have a word with the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and see whether we can have something constructive. I do not mind where it goes, but something has to be done. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>The noble Lord said: I am afraid that I find a new subsection of new Section 21B to be rather difficult to follow, and I hope that the Minister will be able to elucidate, especially as no light was thrown on it by looking at the Explanatory Notes. As I read it, Section 55 is all about victimisation&#151;where person A treats person B less favourably than he could other people in the same position as B, because the latter has done various objectionable things.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>However, I note from Section 55(3) that, where B is a disabled person or a person who has had a disability, the disability in question shall be disregarded in comparing his circumstances with those of any other person for the purposes of subsection (1)(a).

</p>

<a name="50113-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>We are still, of course, in the compass of public authorities here. I do not understand why special mention has to be made for them, when everyone is already covered by Section 55. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell me. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50113-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I accept that it is very difficult to work out some of the import of the provisions, because of the structure of the Bill and the interweaving with the DDA.

</p>

<a name="50113-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The amendment concerns the victimisation provisions of the DDA, as they would be amended by the Bill. Section 55 of the DDA defines victimisation. It sets out   that a person&#151;I shall call this person the &quot;first person&quot;&#151;unlawfully discriminates against another person if he treats that person less favourably because he or she has taken part in proceedings under the Act against the first person, or because the first person believes that he or she will take part in such proceedings. Unlike other forms of discrimination made unlawful by the DDA, victimisation is prohibited both in relation to disabled and non-disabled people.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The easiest way in which to illustrate the point is with an example. If one of my employees&#151;in fact, when I turn around and stare at them, I realise that they are not actually my employees, because they are civil servants&#151;but if one of them helped a disabled person to take me to court in connection with alleged discrimination, it would be unlawful for me to treat my employee less favourably as a result, irrespective of whether that person was disabled or not. That is the context in which it applies.
</p>

<a name="50113-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Amendment No. 10 would remove subsection (6) and would have the effect of removing a non-disabled person&#039;s right not to be victimised in connection with the exercise of public functions. This would mean that it would be lawful under the DDA for a public <br>&nbsp;<br>

authority to deny a discretionary grant to a non-disabled person because he had assisted a disabled person to bring a claim of disability discrimination against the public authority, for example. That seems an unlikely example, but it is not impossible.

</p>

<a name="50113-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>What we are seeking to do is to protect that situation uniquely here, in which a non-disabled person has aided a disabled person and to prevent that non-disabled person subsequently suffering discrimination. I hope that with that explanation, the noble Lord will not want to press the matter further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50113-37_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   No, of course I shall not press the matter further.

I do not understand the need for it.

<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="50113-37_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Sorry, I mean as regards public authorities. For example, if a police authority arrested someone who was disabled, a non-disabled person assisted that disabled person in whatever way and the police subsequently hassled the non-disabled person giving assistance, the provision replicates the duty&#151;they would not be able to do so. That is why we have included the reference to Section 55, because we are extending these powers to a new series of public authorities.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 20 in Clause   3 has been grouped with Amendment No. 11. Again, I hope that this is a quick question with a quick answer. However, one can never be entirely sure with the noble Baroness quite what sort of an answer one will get.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The policy intention of new Section 21B(7) is, according to the Explanatory Notes, that the rest of the Act takes precedence over Section 21B other than when appointments are made by a Minister or on recommendation or approval by a government department. That would apply during periods of direct rule in Northern Ireland. It also covers the National Assembly for Wales, or any part of the Scottish Administration, or when someone else directs the <br>&nbsp;<br>

employee, in which case any failure would fall to the fault of the director. These exclusions are logical given new subsections (2)(b) and (3).

</p>

<a name="50113-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>If the rest of the Act takes precedence, why make special provision in this way for public authorities? Again, this is slightly related to my last question, it seems a very difficult way to achieve the policy objective. Subsection (1) is only a catch-all subsection, which then goes on to have exclusions such as subsections (2) and (3). I really cannot see how that fulfils the policy intention of the Government. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50113-38_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In defence of the Government, just because a question is simple does not mean to say that it has a simple answer, despite the efforts of noble Lords sometimes to say &quot;I want a yes or no&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>These amendments would remove important provisions to prevent overlap, or double provision. In particular, Amendment No. 11 would remove new Section 21B(7)(b), which ensures that Section 21B, the new provision that requires reasonable adjustments and outlaws discrimination against disabled people when exercising public functions, does not apply when another provision of the DDA would have applied but for a provision made by or under the Act.

</p>

<a name="50113-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I think that it would be helpful to give an example here. Section 28C of the DDA places a duty of reasonable adjustment on schools. However, Section   28C(2) makes it clear that the duty of reasonable adjustment would not require schools to make adjustments to physical features of their premises or to provide auxiliary aids and services. The reason that there is this exemption to the reasonable adjustment duty is that provision is already made through other means. In respect of school premises, Sections 28D and 28E of the DDA place a duty on schools to plan strategically to improve accessibility, while auxiliary aids and services are provided through the special educational needs framework.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The effect of this amendment would be to require double provision in schools. They would have to provide auxiliary aids and services both in response to the DDA and in response to the special educational needs framework. It is not only unnecessary, but confusing. That is why we have those exemptions. I could go into further detail, but that may answer the concerns of the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50113-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Like the noble Lord, Lord   Carter, just now, I shall have to read that extremely carefully. It is not so long an explanation as he got.

</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment deals with an apparent double negative. Given that under proposed new Section 21B (7)(a),

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>&quot;anything&quot; surely means just that, including subsections (1) to (8). Why make special provision for Part 5, which covers public transport? In other words, in terms of this clause is not paragraph (c) of subsection (7) already covered by paragraph (a)? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50113-38_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The argument with regard to this amendment largely follows the one that we have just had on the last amendment. This is indeed a technical provision which is designed to ensure that the prohibition of discrimination in the exercise of public functions does not overlap with provisions elsewhere in the Act.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>In particular, Part 5 of the DDA allows the Secretary of State to make regulations setting accessibility standards for public transport vehicles such as rail and other public transport vehicles. Not all of these powers have yet been exercised. For example, Section 32 of the Act applies to taxi accessibility regulations, for which powers have not yet been exercised.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>If the amendment were accepted, the new provisions prohibiting discrimination in the exercise of public functions would apply in cases where powers under Part 5 of the Act had not yet been exercised. That would mean that a public authority that operated a public service vehicle, which was not within the scope of current PSV regulations, would be placed under a duty of reasonable adjustment in respect of those vehicles. The trouble is that that would undermine the general approach taken in Part 5 of the Act which seeks not to require piecemeal adjustments but rather that vehicles meet appropriate standards as set by the Secretary of State.

</p>

<a name="50113-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The approach to making vehicles accessible which is in Part 5 of the Act ensures that the access solutions are effective and sustainable and, most importantly, that they cover the needs of the widest range of disabled people. The Part 5 provisions are quite clear in specifying that not only must the vehicles meet the comfort and reasonable safety requirements in relation to wheelchair users, they must also meet the needs of disabled people generally. That is an important distinction enshrined in the Act. After all, some vehicles can be made suitable for a wheelchair user but may be very difficult for someone with walking difficulties to get in and out of. The issue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was identified during the passage of the DDA when Parliament sought assurances from the Government that we would press for higher access standards, for example, than were then currently available in taxi designs.
</p>

<a name="50113-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Our overall approach is to ensure that activities regulated by one part of the Act are not also regulated by other provisions. We are concerned that this technical amendment would make an obligation on public authorities for partial requirements on public transport providers in circumstances in which the DDA itself requires higher, wider and more comprehensive standards which we are seeking to preserve. For that reason, on technical grounds, we ask the noble Lord to recognise that the amendment would cause real difficulty in this area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="50113-38_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   One of the problems with the legislation is that sometimes it is not in the least bit apparent&#151;not only as far as the clause is concerned but also as far as the amendment is concerned&#151;precisely what its scope is. I would like to focus on one word that the Minister used. He said that the Government were against a &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach. Of course, that depends on how large the piece is. If the piece were to cover the whole of local authorities, the Act would be implemented faster in those areas&#151;for example on school buses or whatever&#151;that might be desirable. We do not necessarily need to wait for the whole of the implementation of Part 5 for the public sector to move a little faster. Is the Minister saying that any improvements in the public sector will have to wait until we do the whole lot?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="50113-38_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The danger is obvious. If we seek to make progress by incremental approaches to the issue, that might militate against the overall standards to which we are committed through the DDA, which are necessary for the widest possible provision. The answer to the position is that we need a standard approach for each vehicle&#151;not piecemeal&#151;but an approach that is comprehensive so that we meet the objectives and the standards of the DDA itself. Our anxiety about the amendment being agreed is that it would indeed potentially enforce upon public authorities a narrow and very limited advance which itself would militate against meeting the standards to which we are already committed.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;thought that that proviso might nullify many of the objectives or emasculate the effectiveness of Clause 2&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6 December 2004; col. 698.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>He has not changed his mind since Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I have huge respect for Sir Peter&#039;s views, as, I know, does the Minister. While I would like her to accept the amendment or bring in one of her own, I know that there is little chance of that, so I very much hope that she will be able to answer some questions and clarify what the new justification means in practice. The DRC says that this would enable it effectively to explain it in the code of practice that it will have to write. I hope that the Minister will give examples of how, and how often, the Government expect the provision to be used and thus, I hope, allay some fears.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>There seem to be three problems: where the line lies between functions and services; the fact that regulations under subsection (7) will have effect as a longstop so it may not be possible to effect redress retrospectively; and the fact that &quot;proportionate&quot; depends on two tests, neither of them truly objective.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>On the line between functions and services, let me say at once that I understand, as does Sir Peter, why the &quot;legitimate aim and proportionate&quot; proviso was introduced and that functions and services have to be treated differently. It just needs tightening and narrowing down, which is what Amendment No. 14 would do.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Clause 2 is so hugely to be welcomed that it would be more than disappointing if it did not live up to our expectations. Our fears centre on the activities of some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

local authorities whose attitudes and behaviour towards disabled people are not always ideal. We fear that sooner or later the proviso will be used to override disabled people&#039;s interests.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Several questions arise on the functions and services divide. Are the functions of planning and granting of planning permission by local authorities covered under Clause 2 as functions or as services? The process of planning a car park could be a function, whereas operating one is presumably a service. Pedestrianising an area could be held to be a function. Could its continuing existence be deemed a service? What about, for instance, congestion charging, park-and-ride schemes, establishing home zones, setting out nature trails, and any other activities involving highways, roads, footpaths and pavements? Are they covered as functions or as services?
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>On Second Reading, I raised the question in relation to footbridges over rivers in col. 697. The Minister referred at col. 709 to functions such as providing and maintaining them but said that there may be some exceptions which doubtless will be explored in Committee.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>If all these areas are not covered&#151;and these are only examples&#151;can the Government do anything to ensure that they are? Moreover, can the Government now do anything to avoid complications that will arise if it is not clear which problems should be tackled as functions and which as services?
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Paragraph 38 on page 8 of the Explanatory Notes refers to one justification. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;It is envisaged that a public authority will be able to rely on this justification only in relation to matters of public interest (for example, the detection of crime)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Two questions arise: what exactly is meant by &quot;matters of public interest&quot;, and why is this significant limitation not stated on the face of the Bill? It is very important that the Minister spells out the answers to these two questions.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Although the distinction between a function and a service is not always clear, it would seem that many of the problems associated with access relate to functions, not services. Add to that the fact that regulations made under subsection (7) would seem to act as a longstop after some treatment or failure to   comply has caused harm&#151;it may not be possible to effect redress retrospectively&#151;and I hope that the Minister and the Committee will understand why I am concerned about the &quot;legitimate aim and proportionate&quot; proviso on its own, unamended.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>As I said in col. 697 on Second Reading, Sir Peter&#039;s worries about subsection (5) stem from the fact that it depends on two estimates&#151;an assessment of the number helped and the number harmed if the action is taken to achieve the legitimate aim, and an assessment of the extent of injury caused by those harmed compared with the degree of benefit enjoyed by others.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Sir Peter Large writes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;The two assessments multiplied together result in a highly suspect subjective assessment of how far some had benefited from the authority&#039;s action and how much harm it had caused others. I cannot see how this can be defended on the grounds that it <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>&#039;provides an objective justification&#039;. How proportionate, for example, would the legitimate aim of pedestrianising a shopping centre be if it meant improvements for 500 fit pedestrians but forced 50 disabled people to shop elsewhere? Disabled people are in double jeopardy in all such assessments. They are always likely to be in a minority and the actual harm done to them is seldom anticipated and never fully recognised after it has taken place&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I hope that Sir Peter is being unnecessarily gloomy. I hope that he is proved wrong. I remind the Committee and the Minister that the Disability Rights Commission also said that it would welcome clarification of what the new justification means in practice to enable it to write the code of practice.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>It has to be said that Clause 2 is not exactly even-handed. Subsection (4)(c) allows discrimination if it is too expensive to avoid it. Are not resources always scarce? Subsection (4)(d) allows discrimination if,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;the treatment, or non-compliance with the duty, is necessary for the protection of rights and freedoms of other persons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The concept of legitimate aim and proportionate means comes into the equation only when the rights and freedoms of disabled people are being considered.
</p>

<a name="50113-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I very much hope that the Minister can set our minds at rest. Clause 2 could enable public bodies to do so much, and is hugely welcome in principle, but I fear that it may, as it stands, provide a loophole for some public bodies to do very little. I look forward to some clear and, I hope, encouraging and positive answers from the Minister. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="50113-39_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>My special interest in this amendment has to do with its source. It was in 1978, as the then and first Minister for Disabled People, that I appointed Peter&#151;now Sir   Peter&#151;Large to chair the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People (CORAD) to inquire into, and make recommendations on, discrimination on grounds of disability. There could have been no better choice for it was CORAD&#039;s report, of which this Bill is a lineal descendant, that first set out the compelling case for legislation.

<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>is probably its most attractive feature initially. That wording, if included in the Bill, would reinforce the central message of what we hope we are achieving; that is, only if there is no other way of achieving an aim will   people be permitted to discriminate. For all the reasons that have been stated, having such a provision on the face of the Bill would reinforce the aim that we are discussing.

</p>

<a name="50113-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I very much support the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth. I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord   Morris, is present. Our earlier deliberations had a certain feeling of not being official as the noble Lord was not present. I welcome the noble Lord back to the fold.

<a name="50113-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   I echo what my noble friend Lord Morris said about our great friend Peter Large, and, of course, what he said about my noble friend Lady Hollis and Maria Eagle. I mentioned them at Second Reading.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We cannot improve on the comprehensive and detailed presentation of the noble Baroness, Lady   Darcy de Knayth. However, I should like to make a further point. If the proposed new justification provision could provide wide scope for public bodies to justify discrimination, we should not accept it. If it could provide narrow scope for such discrimination it would be unacceptable, but for it to provide wide scope for discrimination would be the death of the object of this Bill. We all know that&#151;at least in my estimation&#151;public bodies all tend to make any excuse and clutch at any straw to save costs. If they think that this provision will be costly, they will grab that excuse at all costs. I hope that my noble friend will give her usual sympathetic consideration to the amendment.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>

<a name="column_GC81"></a>

arises given the problem of defining a service and a function. I believe that constitutes part of the problem. The Joint Committee stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;This issue is particularly important because there is no consensus about exactly what activities of public authorities are services and what are functions. The Local Government Association (LGA) thought that the difference between a service and a function was &#039;a grey area&#039;, and noted that local councils did not see a great deal of difference between the two concepts. The Minister agreed that there were some grey areas&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>We took legal advice as this is a legal point. If my memory serves me right, I am sure we were satisfied that we had the correct use of the term.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="50113-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Yes, but given the short debate we have just had, it seems that the question of Sir Peter Large, to whom we all very rightly pay tribute, concerns what exactly constitutes public interest. It seems to me that the words in the Explanatory Notes and the words in the Bill are quite different. The Bill refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>That may or may not be in the public interest, but it is certainly in the interest of the authority that is pursuing the particular course of action.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, may not have chosen exactly the right words, but I, for one, would certainly like to see the limitation that has been suggested; namely, that the justification is only in relation to matters of public interest in one way or another on the face of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord   Addington, is absolutely right. We do not want in any respect to undermine either the aims of the Act, or the amendment order, and the changes being made by this Bill. We want to make sure that the thing is as watertight as it possibly can be. I should have thought that some form of words in that respect are most definitely necessary here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="50113-40_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   I would like to add my support to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, because it would seem that both she and Sir   Peter Large have identified a loophole through which some public bodies&#151;and local authorities in particular&#151;will squeeze. Potentially the new justification provision could provide wide scope for public bodies to justify discrimination.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The main problem is that the assessment of whether treatment or a failure to comply with a duty under Section 5 depends on subjective judgments, as the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, has said. Sadly, disabled people are always likely to lose out in those judgments. I hope that my noble friend will be able to allay our fears.

I am very grateful that the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, gave me notice of the questions that she wished to raise. Therefore, I hope that I shall be able to answer them.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC82</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Behind this matter is the question of what we mean by &quot;proportionate&quot;. There seems to be a general belief here regarding &quot;proportionate&quot; being considered in some Benthamite sense as regards 500 versus 50, and the 50 always losing out. The example given by the noble Baroness concerned pedestrianisation. She asked whether the provision would always mean that minority rights would be overridden because you can claim that &quot;proportionate&quot; means that the majority will must always prevail. I had hoped that we had had a go at that at Second Reading, but clearly we did not do so sufficiently. No other body that I am aware of has raised this concern. &quot;Proportionate&quot; is a good term here. It does not relate to a balance of numbers but to whether there are proportionate means of achieving the aim of public policy. A pedestrianisation scheme, for example, would not be judged on the numbers affected&#151;500 for, 50 against, or whatever&#151;but on whether it achieved that public aim, taking into account the effect on the rights of disabled people and whether the way of going about it had the least detrimental effect on disabled people. That is the intent. There may very well be clashes of policy, of which I shall give examples. A clash may arise between the pressure exerted by the provisions of the DDA and another consideration, for example, the environment.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>I refer to the concept of &quot;proportionate&quot; with regard to pursuing a public interest policy. I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. If I may say so, by definition only decisions taken in the public interest would be legitimate aims of public bodies. That is the definition with which we are working. A local authority may have broader policy concerns; for example, an environmental concern to take traffic out of a city centre due to a desire to reduce pollution, increase pedestrian access and so on. You then have to decide whether the way in which that local authority is going about that is proportionate; that is, whether it has chosen a policy that is the most sensitive to the needs of disabled people, and the least detrimental to them.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>What you cannot say, obviously&#151;I think that everyone would agree with this&#151;is that the needs of disabled people will always trump all other legislation. That has been accepted in the case of listed buildings. However, one has to adopt a proportionate response. That proportionate response ensures that the needs of disabled people are not overlooked as opposed to the argument being advanced that they would be outvoted. The concept of proportionality comprises ensuring that those rights are considered and are protected when pursuing a different goal, for example, as I say, an environmental goal or the repair and rehabilitation of major listed buildings. That is the push behind the concept of proportionality. As I think the disability organisations have made clear, &quot;proportionate&quot; is a good and protective term, not, as has been suggested, a way of overriding the rights of minorities.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The second set of questions raised by the noble Baroness in particular concerned functions and services, and whether there was confusion in that regard. The underlying approach is the same for both. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It is important that bodies understand their duties and that they should broadly take the same approach for services and functions. The DRC will issue guidance. I agree that it is a difficult area. The matter is not immediately obvious even to those of us who have been involved in local government for many years. As I say, the DRC will issue guidance that I hope will address the questions that the noble Baroness raised.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>However, as regards the specific points of which she helpfully gave me notice, all the functions of public bodies will be covered unless explicitly excluded on the face of the Act. For example, planning and planning permissions are a function; operating a car park is a service; highways and pedestrianisation et cetera depend on the facts of the case, but Clause 2 ensures that all activities of public authorities are covered. The noble Baroness pressed me on what was meant by matters of public interest. New Section 21D(5) permits justification of less favourable treatment, or failure to make a reasonable adjustment, only if it is a proportionate means to meet a legitimate aim of a public authority. That phrase is built into EU law and means that the treatment must be in the public interest.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="50113-40_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I hope that I have allayed some of the fears about the concept of proportionality. As I say, it is used in the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, and is a well known principle of EU law and ECHR law, carefully designed to enable a court to assess the legality of government action.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Let me give another example, as opposed to the pedestrianisation one that we have explored fairly thoroughly this afternoon. It might be necessary for a law enforcement agency such as HM Revenue and Customs to stop a higher proportion of wheelchair users than other travellers coming through customs, if   it had information suggesting that particular passengers were likely to be concealing illegal drugs in the frames of wheelchairs on a certain day. On the other hand, it would clearly not be proportionate for a wheelchair user to find that the local police stopped him or her every time that he or she visited a local shopping centre.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I shall give another example. A blind juror might not be selected for a case if it was necessary to see the evidence. That would be less favourable treatment for a reason related to disability, but the overriding importance of administering justice fairly means that the less favourable treatment would be proportionate in that case.

</p>

<a name="50113-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>One further argument may be worth mentioning. Those of us with local or central government backgrounds will be familiar with the fact that there are often several different routes to achieving a particular policy outcome. For example, one might want a park and ride system or greater facilitation of the use of public transport, both ways of trying to keep cars out of a city centre. There may be very different ways of achieving that aim. It is rare that there is only one route to achieving a particular policy outcome.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The Government believe that the amendment would limit the justification defence too severely. The principle of proportionality is an accepted principle of administrative law that is designed to deal with a public authority having to choose between a number of courses of action. It has three key elements that the public authority must show. I hope that the first allays some of the concerns raised by the noble Lords, Lord   Addington and Lord Skelmersdale. The first element that an authority must show is a pressing policy need to show that there is a legitimate aim. The second is that the authority&#039;s action is causally related to achieving that aim. The third is that there was no other way to achieve the aim that had a less detrimental impact on the rights of disabled people.

</p>

<a name="50113-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>If we were to accept the amendment, no public authority that had a choice of two equally proportionate and legitimate courses of action would be able to use the justification&#151;even if the overall benefit of the action was generally accepted&#151;which would be perverse.
</p>

<a name="50113-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The matter is clearly of concern to Members of the Committee. That is a fairly full explanation on proportionality&#151;it is a good and well established issue that protects disabled people&#039;s interests so far as possible, but accepts that they may have to be overridden where essential and less favourable treatment is justified in particular circumstances, such as justice and courts of law&#151;and on the specific questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, and my noble friend Lord Carter, about functions and services. That issue is more apparent than real; we seek to respond in the same way to both issues. I hope that I have allayed her fears and, through that, those of her friend, Sir Peter Large, who is someone whom the entire Committee respects and whose views it takes very seriously.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17, put forward today by the noble Lords, Lord Carter, Lord Addington and Lord Adebowale and me, are our best attempt at a sensible package of measures to fill this policy gap. I know that Amendment No. 19 has been grouped with ours, for it addresses part of the same issue, but harassment is dealt with under Amendment No. 15 only. We have sought to address both the Government&#039;s conviction that it is not possible to mirror the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, and the conviction of most of the rest of us that dealing with harassment under the wording of this Bill would relate to employment only, and possibly to service provision and education; nothing more. That would be most unsatisfactory, and it would be well short of the Government&#039;s intention to tackle proactively the harassment of disabled people.

<a name="50113-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>For example, both Mencap and Mind have local experience of ill-informed nimbyism at its best&#151;or should I say at its worst. I have with me a recent example from Andover, where the local Mencap society encountered something more akin to a hostile mob rather than an informed debate on proposals to purchase a house for four people with learning disabilities. Public education can only do so much to promote common sense and common decency. The fact that nimbyism has gone on now for so many years seems to indicate that a number of prospective neighbours display a great deal less intelligence and dignity than the very people who they denigrate and vilify.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>It may be argued that this kind of policy gap in the public sector could be filled as part of the more general duty to promote equality of opportunity. The argument would go that if a disabled person cannot leave their home because they are likely to be a victim of harassment, the public authority is not promoting their equality of opportunity effectively. I would not be at all convinced by such an argument.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Recent research around the Race Relations (Amendment) Act shows that public bodies direct resources to meet their explicit duties first. Therefore, unless we make harassment a clear priority, very little will happen. It could also be argued that this policy gap is already filled by current legislation, namely the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the   Criminal Justice Act 2003. However, both laws are again reactive. Tackling the problem on a person-by-person basis would be to rely on the traditional model of anti-discrimination, which the Government have made clear is insufficient to drive forward positive changes in society. Indeed, that is the very point of the public sector duty.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Anecdotal evidence would also suggest that clear-up rates for cases of harassment, bullying or hate crimes against disabled people, and particularly people with a learning disability, are not good. Getting cases to court is proving extremely difficult. Mencap&#039;s <i>Living in Fear</i> report of 2000 found that in over half the cases bullying of a person with a learning disability continued well after the matter was reported. In the Andover example that I gave, I would expect the appropriate public bodies, most likely the local council and the police, to undertake early, pro-active intervention once they were aware of the problem. I would expect that to involve listening to residents&#039; concerns; tackling ignorance and prejudice; demonstrating that these types of housing projects are already happening very successfully in Andover and the rest of the country; ameliorating genuine worries and ensuring a safe and positive local environment in which disabled people can live and be active and respected members of the local community.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I assure your Lordships that I could give many more examples in a range of areas, and I am sure that many of your Lordships are aware of some too. I will refrain from doing so for the sake of brevity. I thank noble Lords for their patience, and I hope that the Minister <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will accept Amendment No. 15, or at least promise to come back with a government amendment that covers the same ground. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="50113-41_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   As I added my name to this amendment and also I am the lead name on Amendments Nos. 16 and 17, perhaps it would be helpful if I explained, as has been made clear, that we have taken the amendments together because obviously they cover the same area. Amendment No.   15 deals with harassment or hate crime, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, said. Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are alternative words to promote good relations, and Amendment No. 19 in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Higgins, reflects recommendation 40 of the Joint Committee, which was not accepted by the Government.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>First, I will deal with the hate crime issue. This amendment would extend the definition of harassment to a public sector duty. As it stands now, harassment is only unlawful in the area of employment, and is not explicitly covered in education, or goods or services. It does not extend to community relations. Obviously, these areas are important for disabled people if they are to enjoy their opportunities in freedom and safety.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The Disability Rights Commission strongly supports amendment of Clause 3 to ensure that the scope of the public duty is widened, to enable effective action against harassment of and violence against disabled people outside the workplace; a duty to eliminate harassment, which currently in the Bill applies only to harassment that is unlawful under the DDA, not to wider hate crime which affects, they claim, one in five disabled people and nine in 10 people with learning difficulties; inclusion of disabled people in community and cohesion initiatives; the promotion of general understanding and awareness of disability in the community; including respect for distinct communities such as the deaf community, and improving civic participation and combating social exclusion and deprivation.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said, two pieces of law attempt to tackle this issue reactively. We are pleased that the Government recognise in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that hate crimes against disabled people are a significant problem.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="50113-41_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50113-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The key questions for the Minister are as follows. If the general duty is not amended to fill what we feel is a gap, is the duty sufficient to give public authorities the power to act to tackle hate crimes and the causes of hate crimes against disabled people? For example, in a judicial review, could a public body argue that it did not believe that it had the power to tackle the issue under the Bill as currently worded? Does the duty legally require public bodies to tackle hate crimes and the causes of hate crimes? Does it make it clear that they should do something if there is a problem? Does the duty sufficiently prioritise and tackle the issue even if the public authority recognises that it could do something and is supposed to do something? In other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

words, could a public authority argue that it would have liked to do something but that there were a number of other important priorities? As I have said, there is doubt whether the duty is sufficient and whether it requires public bodies to tackle the issue proactively.

</p>

<a name="50113-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>As I have said, unlawful harassment under the Bill applies only to harassment that is unlawful under the DDA, and does not tackle the wider question of hate   crimes. Recent research on the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 shows that public bodies direct resources to meet their explicit duties first, with all other duties vulnerable to fluctuating will and competition from other priorities. We heard that from the noble Lord, Lord Rix.

</p>

<a name="50113-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 16 and 17, which are alternatives to each other. Amendment No. 16 strengthens the disability equality duties, requiring public authorities to take into account the effect of their actions on the social inclusion of disabled people. The intention behind the proposal for a duty to promote inclusion for disabled people is to place a duty on public authorities to assess their policies, practices and procedures for impact on a safe environment for disabled people; to take proactive steps to eliminate so far as they can the negative and stereotypical attitudes towards disable people, which may ultimately result in harassment, lack of opportunities and exclusion; to increase awareness and understanding among non-disabled people of the benefits and the positive action measures; and to take steps to encourage and enable disabled people to take part in civic participation.
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>To sum up, is the duty sufficient to give public authorities the power to tackle hate crimes and the cause of hate crimes? Does it legally require them to tackle hate crimes and the cause of hate crimes? Does it give sufficient priority to performing that duty?
</p>

<a name="50113-41_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>On the wording of the promotion of good relations, which the Joint Committee supported but the Government turned down for reasons which I still find hard to understand when I read them, we want to see an explicit duty which achieves the following key aims. It should tackle harassment and hate crimes against disabled people, and promote a positive attitude towards disabled people and the civic participation of disabled people. In conclusion, I quote the Minister at Second Reading, who said: &quot;My noble friend&quot;&#151;that was me&#151;

I first declare an interest as the chief executive of Turning Point, a charity which supports people with learning disabilities and those with mental health problems. Turning Point is also a member of the New Spirit Coalition, which has been campaigning on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para0"></a>

people or to promote positive attitudes towards disabled people. That is clear when one reads and thinks through the Bill. We know from the many campaigns through the years on race and disability that it is not enough to be reactive in making law on civil rights; we have to be proactive in making such laws.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>This Bill does not go far enough in its proactivity. That is despite the fact that disabled people experience significant discrimination and exclusion.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The recent report called <i>Hidden Lives</i> from Turning Point, my own organisation, examines the issue more deeply. It found that despite the principles and targets in <i>Valuing People</i>, the Human Rights Act and criminal legislation such as the Criminal Justice Act, people with a learning disability, for example, still suffer discrimination.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Service users have told us about the taunts and jibes that they face, about when they had been punched while waiting for a bus and about the sense of isolation that they felt. One man said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;They don&#039;t understand people with a learning disability. Sometimes it can upset you. It makes me feel cross, but there is nothing you can do, so I just ignore it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I have to say that the same quotes could have been made 10 or 15 years ago, and are still being made by members of my own race. We need to pay attention to such quotes in discussing the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>A support worker told us about how it affects the people she supports. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;The fear of discrimination and rejection makes it almost impossible for people to mix with others in the wider community&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>We also know that discrimination is not isolated to people with a learning disability. The sad fact is that a DRC survey found that a third of disabled people have experienced harassment in public due to their disability, and the Government&#039;s strategy unit found that disabled people have a much greater fear of crime than non-disabled people.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I also know from my work at Turning Point that people with mental health problems face terrible stigma. That was highlighted in the Social Exclusion Unit&#039;s report about mental health. That is why <i>Hidden Lives </i>recommended the explicit inclusion of a duty to promote good relations in the Bill. I am grateful for the work done to move from that idea to the workable amendments that we have before us today.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The sorts of things that I envisage public bodies will do to fulfil their duties would be simple yet effective ways to challenge attitudes and to tackle incidences of discrimination head on. It may include, for instance, awareness campaigns or work in schools to promote better understanding of disability issues. It would also include making sure that the police and social services work together to ensure that resources are available so people with a learning disability understand what constitutes harassment, are aware of their rights and are confident to speak out. The fact is that many people at present are not clear. One survey found that more than half of people with a learning disability do not know where to go for help if they are harassed or bullied.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC90</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I particularly like the concept of promoting civic participation in the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. That is something which Turning Point works to enhance for the people we support. I know that many other organisations are working with us in that regard. We have seen at first hand how it can change attitudes. One example is that of a woman called Clara, who has a profound and multiple learning disability, yet is a member of her local neighbourhood watch. She, who is curious by nature and likes hearing about her neighbours&#039; news, enjoys the meetings. But also, her representation at the meeting ensures that the other members have a better understanding of learning disability issues and respect her as an equal part of the group.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>However, as the <i>Hidden Lives</i> report found, all too often people with a learning disability are set apart from their communities. Many people with a learning disability do not have friendships outside service settings or participate in wider social networks. For some, the only place they visit during the day is the day centre. That is segregation from people who live in the same street and town, and it isolates people with a learning disability and other disabilities from society and new relationships. That reinforces prejudiced attitudes and limits opportunities and expectations.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Requiring public bodies to promote social inclusion and positive attitudes will challenge this existing culture and ensure opportunities are available to all disabled people. That will help to build cohesive communities where discrimination of disabled people is simply unacceptable and people have the opportunity to maximise their life chances.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Of course, there is a risk that the Government will view these amendments as unnecessary. They may argue that the public sector duty to promote equality in the Bill is sufficient and that it covers and encourages the sorts of activities I have described. But the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Rix, have made a persuasive argument for why that is not the case, and I for one wholeheartedly agree with them. Without a specific duty requiring public bodies to promote positive attitudes and inclusion, the important work of proactively challenging prevailing cultures and attitudes towards disability will simply not be done.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>In addition, as Lord Rix has so carefully explained, the duty to eliminate harassment applies to harassment only as defined in the Bill. As I understand it, that would not include the harassment and bullying that people have told me they experience on many occasions. That everyday harassment must be covered by the Bill. We have seen the success that can happen when government, individual and communities place a priority on tackling discrimination. We are succeeding in turning the tide of discrimination in respect of other social groups, including the one to which I belong. These amendments would ensure that the same profile and attention is given to tackling discrimination against disabled people and to promoting inclusion. I <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50113-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My amendment, Amendment No. 19, is grouped with this set of amendments, so perhaps I might be allowed to say a word.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I was particularly alarmed to discover, from a whole variety of sources, exactly the extent of harassment that is going on. The DRC, in its attitudes and awareness survey of 2003, said that 22 per cent of disabled respondents said that they had experienced harassment. Mencap&#039;s <i>Living in Fear </i>report has already been mentioned. The 2004 survey of disabled people in Scotland, carried out by the DRC in Scotland and Capability Scotland, said that almost half the participants in their survey had experienced verbal abuse, intimidation and/or physical attacks because of their disability. One in five respondents suffered an attack once a week or more. That is horrific.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Mayor of London&#039;s 2003 survey of disabled Londoners, entitled <i>Another Planet?</i>, found that 79 per cent of disabled people reported that they had experienced harassment. According to the same survey, 8 per cent of disabled people fell victim of violent crime in comparison to 4 per cent of non-disabled people. Disabled people were also four times more likely to be assaulted.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The only way in which we can get over this harassment is by proper education and understanding of the needs and realities of being disabled. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke at Second Reading of having had a short period of disablement herself, and I took very much to heart what she said. But imagine what it is like for someone like the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, or the noble Baronesses on the other side of the Chamber, who spend the greater part of their lives in wheelchairs. I do not know, because they have not yet told us, whether they have been subject to harassment from time to time. I would most certainly hope not. What we therefore need is for positive attitudes towards disabled people to be promoted. I am delighted that Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 have been tabled, because they are far better than my own amendment, Amendment No. 19, to which I do not now need to speak at all.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I note that, in the Government&#039;s original response, they argued that unlike other equality legislation the DDA grants rights only to disabled people, and the draft Bill already introduces a requirement on public authorities to promote equality. However, promoting equality does not go quite far enough, does it? In any case, the DDA does not grant rights only to disabled people; in a few days&#039; time, we will come to an amendment towards the end of the Marshalled List seeking to remove able-bodied people.
</p>

<a name="50113-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I agree with and took particular note of the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on social inclusion, at Second Reading. I am slightly surprised that the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>As has already been said, the problems of disabled people have been acquired at birth or by accident during some point in their life. They will need support. We are also fighting against stereotypes; anybody who is different from you is always slightly inferior.

It can be addressed only by providing information and making sure that people realise that these differences are not that great. Anyway, it is not something that the person has done&#151;it is just something that is. We must attack the problem and we will not do so by saying, &quot;We&#039;ll just make sure that nothing nasty happens to you&quot;. That is effectively how this provision could be interpreted.

This proactive duty is the main step forward ideologically in this Bill as opposed to the 1995 Act. I hope that the Minister will be in a position to tell the rest of her colleagues in the Government that this Committee thinks we should go an extra step. I invite the noble Baroness to take this very difficult step. Let us face it; we will have a very good champion if she does.

<a name="50113-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   We have had a long debate, and I shall be very brief. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and my noble friend Lord Carter on an excellent presentation. They certainly persuaded me, although I needed no persuading.

<a name="50113-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I have recently had experience of the effect of violence and harassment on two young people. They were devastated; they were hit and threatened with knives by thugs in the street. They were not disabled people, but strong young men. They were very disturbed indeed by their experience. So I can only imagine the effect of something similar on disabled people, especially those with a learning difficulty. We should take any opportunity there is of reducing this kind of hate crime and harassment. The amendments provide exactly that opportunity.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The one killer fact for me is this: if there is provision, as there is, in the race relations legislation, which deals with the concepts of hate and violence, we cannot possibly afford not to have such provision in the Bill. The message would then go out that hate and violence are banned in race relations legislation but are okay when it comes to disabled people. That message simply cannot go out, and I therefore hope that the amendments will be accepted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="50113-43_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As Members of the Committee suspected, I am not in a position to accept these amendments. I shall come back to that point later.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Two issues have been raised. The first is a description of and a call on the DDA to understand and seek to eliminate, as far as possible, issues of harassment. Some of the examples given by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, my noble friend Lord Carter and others have been quite shocking and an affront to our concept of decency. There is no disagreement about that.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>However, you cannot somehow turn a public body into a <i>de facto</i> police force, with powers to tackle individuals through the legal system, when an example of harassment has occurred. We have other and appropriate means for doing that&#151;namely, the Public Order Act 1986, which leads to police action against the offence of harassment. More recently, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 can deal with both a civil wrong and a criminal offence. Although my noble friend Lord Carter did not mention it, I am sure he is aware that under the DDA, disabled tenants are protected from harassment by a landlord or manager of the premises. So there are clear routes through the legal pathway. For racial harassment, however, that is not always the most obvious form of redress.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The question is whether one can appropriately require and expect our local authorities and public bodies to engage in an activity beyond that of the policing function to seek to overcome the causes of harassment and not just to control the activity. Most of the discussion today has been on that point.

</p>

<a name="50113-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Much of the discussion has suggested that because the Bill, unlike the equivalent race legislation, does not include a duty requiring public bodies to promote &quot;good relations&quot;, it is somehow weaker and fails, by implication, to take the issue of harassment of disabled people as seriously as, say, the harassment of people from our ethnic minority communities. We do not accept the argument that just because the corresponding race <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation has a duty to promote good relations between races and ethnic communities there should necessarily be a corresponding disability duty. There is no automatic correlation between the provisions required to drive equality for disabled people and those to drive equality on other grounds.

</p>

<a name="50113-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>We have heard some horrendous stories and examples. My honourable friend the Minister for Disabled People made it clear during the pre-legislative scrutiny that the Government were open to persuasion if evidence could be provided that the Bill was lacking in some respect. But we would need to be very clear about the circumstances that the current provisions fail to address, and how changes to the duty could remedy this in a way that was workable and made sense for the bodies concerned.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I do not think that the term &quot;good relations&quot; works as appropriately in the disability context as it does in the race context. There seems to me a clear difference between the experience of ethnic minority people living in identifiable communities with institutions such as places of worship, restaurants, shops, and so on, and the experience of disabled people living in the same communities as non-disabled people and using the same community institutions. There is a very real difference when it comes to building mutual understanding between white, Afro-Caribbean, Asian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities or between Asian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities and the Afro-Caribbean community. There is a need to explain and interpret communities to each other. That is not a similar equivalent responsibility within disability equality legislation.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I have listened carefully to the debate; I think a critique has been offered. I do not believe that the wording is correct and appropriate, or even, on reflection, whether &quot;social inclusion&quot; is. I would like to reflect on the arguments and see whether, in the light of what has been said today and in the light of further discussions, we can explore the issue further on Report. In the light of that undertaking, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="50113-43_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   Before the Minister sits down, that is the first time I have really understood the Government&#039;s argument about the use of the phrase &quot;good relations&quot;. I can accept the argument; I can see the difference between race relations and the rest. I am delighted to hear that the Minister is prepared to try and find a form of words which will meet our concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50113-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   I, too, was getting very worried until the Minister&#039;s last sentences, when she held out some hope. I shall not enter into an argument about whether the provisions should apply to black people or disabled people in restaurants or shops. I shall live in hope that the wording that will emerge from the Minister&#039;s office will be suitable.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>The provision would be quite simple if our amendment were accepted. Under the heading &quot;General duty&quot;, subsection (1) of new Section 49A would state that every public authority shall, in carrying out its functions, have due regard to the need to eliminate harassment. I <br>&nbsp;<br>

use the old-fashioned pronunciation of &quot;harassment&quot;. That seems quite simple; it would not put a tremendously onerous duty on local authorities. It just means that they have to consider other things under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50113-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I shall live in hope. I beg the Committee&#039;s pardon because I must now leave. I broke a tooth just before we sat down and I want to see if the noble Lord, Lord   Colwyn, is in the House. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50113-44_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel </b>   moved Amendment No. 18:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Page 8, line 9, at end insert&#151;</p>

&quot;(   )   the need to provide adequately trained and supported carers for disabled persons where this is necessary to promote equality of opportunity between disabled persons and other persons;

<br>
(   )   the need to provide adequately trained and supported carers for disabled persons where this is necessary to eliminate harassment that is unlawful under this Act;


<br>
(   )   the need to provide adequately trained and supported carers for disabled persons where this is necessary to eliminate discrimination that is unlawful under this Act; and


<br>
(   )   the need to provide adequately trained and supported carers for disabled persons where this is necessary to address the need to take account of a disabled person&#039;s disabilities.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_87"></a>The noble Earl said: The purpose of the amendment is to find out from the Government whether, if someone who has a disability and experiences unsatisfactory or inappropriate care, as a result of which he experiences harassment and discrimination or is unable to access education, obtain work or sustain employment, he would, under the clause, have a case to take forward. I move this amendment very tentatively, given my lack of specific knowledge in this area. I am slightly overawed, as I was on Second Reading, to be speaking in this company, given its depth of knowledge.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Some 68 per cent of children who are in local authority residential care, in children&#039;s homes, have a psychiatric disorder, according to the Office for National Statistics. So a large number of these children will have a disability, whether it is identified or not. I am talking about children in residential care, but I think that there is a wider point to be made.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I have met many of the practitioners working with these children and know that they are hugely committed. They do an immensely difficult task, yet broader society fails to recognise how difficult it is. Sixty per cent of these children have experienced abuse or neglect. A further 10 per cent experienced family breakdown before going into care. We also know that in this country there has been a long and very sad history of sexual abuse of children in residential care.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>In 1998, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the workforce had no relevant qualification for working with these children. They had such extreme needs, yet were being cared for by people who were simply not trained up to meet those needs.

</p>

<a name="50113-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The Government are taking action and I shall come to that. Reference has been made today to the Radio   4 &quot;Today&quot; programme and an item on residential care for children in Brighton. A large number of small, private providers appear not to be doing their job sufficiently well and the children are not being properly managed and contained in those institutions.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>In practice, there are difficulties. There are 20,000 children with disabilities in residential care. There are also many elderly people in care homes and it is disturbing to think of the quality of care which many of them receive. In the past, the response to the difficulty has been the closure of children&#039;s homes. In the 1980s, many children&#039;s homes were closed. The problem is that a group of children need residential care and it appears that a number of unscrupulous private providers, seeing the market opportunity, have put children in environments where staff are poorly trained. That, too, was documented in the recent Channel Four programme &quot;Dispatches&quot; on &quot;Profiting from kids in care&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Many elderly people whose faculties are declining and are suffering from disabilities are also cared for by people who are not adequately trained and supported to meet their needs. I recently listened to a report from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on mental health and elderly people and I was most stuck by the strong parallels, the lack of support for staff, the isolation of the homes and the inability to work with other services because staff are so poorly trained. That was all very familiar to me.

</p>

<a name="50113-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The professionalism of staff working in such an environment with looked-after children is beginning to improve with the introduction of a National Vocational Qualification for childcare for a large proportion of them. However, it is a basic qualification.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>On the continent, most children in care are not fostered but are in residential childcare. They are cared for by pedagogues and social educators who have two to three years professional training equivalent to that of teachers or nurses. I recently visited the Scottish Institute for Residential Childcare whose expert on continental childcare told me that he could not think of any history of sexual abuse of children in care on the continent.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>I also recently spoke with a German practitioner when he was visiting this country. He is a pedagogue, has worked in a children&#039;s home for two years and is a researcher at the University of Lunenburg. He was so surprised by the history and by the fact that a residential childcare worker is not allowed to share a car with a child in care because of concerns of further abuse. It was quite bizarre for him.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I hope that I am not straying too far off the subject. I suspect that I may be and I apologise if I am. But one wants to ensure that children and elderly and vulnerable people in residential care, or care in other settings, are not harassed within them or when they go out. We talked about the stigma of people with disabilities, the number of attacks made on them and difficulties in the workplace. Unless they are cared for <br>&nbsp;<br>

well in their home settings, they will not have the resilience and confidence to deal with the outside world.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I look forward to discovering from the Minister whether this group of children, and more generally those disabled people with carers, are caught by this clause. I want to emphasise the need for those working with disabled people always to encourage them to feel that they can participate and be involved and that their voices are important and are heard. We must ensure that carers have good interpersonal skills at a highly sophisticated level so that they can work with vulnerable people and those with disabilities. They must be effective practitioners, stand back from what they are doing and consider and develop their practice.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I apologise if I am off the mark. I do not intend to speak on any other amendments on the Bill and I apologise for the time I have taken now. I also apologise for not having given the Minister warning of the details of my concerns, but I look forward to her response. I beg to move.

<a name="50113-44_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   What are the safeguards for disabled people who have to rely on carers? There was a recent case of terrible abuse to disabled people living in a care home in Hull.

</p>

<a name="50113-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Secondly, why do we not take advantage of the good qualification of pedagogues? I have seen them in operation with disabled people and children in Germany and we might as well take advantage of Europe now that we are part of it. We have to put up with so many ridiculous regulations from Europe&#151;for instance, the registration of horses, with which I am involved&#151;but we do not take on the useful registration of people looking after disabled children and adults, as pedagogues do. I believe that there is a three-year training course, combining teacher, nurse and social worker.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50113-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The amendment would set out on the face of the Bill a duty on public bodies to have due regard to the need to provide adequately trained and supported carers where this would be necessary to eliminate discrimination and harassment, and to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I greatly respect the concern of the noble Earl, Lord   Listowel, about the wellbeing of children in residential care. However, he acknowledged that his contribution was on the wider issues&#151;I in no sense dispute much of what he said&#151;on the wellbeing of looked-after children. We need only look at the history of the past 10 of 15 years to see how too often society has failed most of its vulnerable children. There is no difference between us in that regard. However, the noble Earl seeks to do something different. He raised and registered his concerns, which I am sure that many Members of the Committee will share, and talked about the need of society to respond.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The Government&#039;s view is that the duty as drafted already requires bodies to give due regard to care need, the way it is delivered, the way in which it is delivered and who is delivering it. As part of that, they must also think about how carers are trained and supported.

<a name="50113-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>When a local authority has care for disabled children perhaps with mental health problems, physical disabilities or psychiatric conditions, it will be under a duty to promote equality for them as an intrinsic part of providing their care. That will apply to all aspects of their care and affect all aspects of their lives. That broader duty therefore is indeed enshrined in the Bill. However, the noble Earl will understand that DDA legislation is not the right place to start laying qualifications for the training of carers in residential homes. That is a matter for other departments, other consultation documents and other developments with local authorities and the like.
</p>

<a name="50113-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I assure the noble Earl that we recognise that by placing the duty to promote equality on local authorities within that context, the right way to pursue that may be through social services&#039; activity and so forth. The duty exists and will, I hope, make an appropriate contribution to ensuring that looked-after children has at least as effective a claim on the rights, responsibilities and resources of society as all other children.

<a name="50113-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Before the noble Earl responds, I want to ask the Minister a question. She is right in saying that the duty will appear in the amended Act. Such duties are often followed up by codes of practice issued by the Disability Rights Commission. Is it her understanding that the codes of practice will give suitable weight to the needs of staff working with looked-after children with mental health issues and other disabilities? Have the Government begun to look at the wider application of the public-sector duty to children, including looked-after children? If the Minister can confirm that they have, I am sure that that would help the noble Earl.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who raised a couple of points to which I failed to respond.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>Page 9, line 2, at end insert&#151;</p>

</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Regulations under subsection (1) shall ensure that a body responsible for a school&#151;

<br>
(a)   publishes a disability equality scheme that sets out how the body will fulfil its duties to eliminate unlawful discrimination against, and harassment of, disabled people, and promote equality of opportunity and positive attitudes and civic participation in relation to disabled pupils, disabled employees and disabled parents or guardians;


<br>
(b)   must demonstrate that they have taken the actions they have committed themselves to, and achieved the appropriate outcomes;


<br>
(c)   must report on their progress;


<br>
(d)   must review the scheme, within no more than three years, and make appropriate revisions to it where necessary.


<br>
(   )   The body responsible for a school is determined in accordance with Schedule 4A to the Act.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments are tabled to ensure that schools are placed under specific disability equality duties and that that is specified in regulations. In particular, they should publish a disability equality scheme. Amendment No. 27 tries to limit the additional bureaucracy that is placed on the scheme.
</p>

<a name="50113-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Our discussion on Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 19 covered much of the background to the belief that schools should be brought within the scope of the Bill and given additional duties to act within it. School is the first place where civil society takes an active part in the upbringing of children and if we get things right there we will enhance the opportunities for disabled people and get them together with non-disabled people.
</p>

<a name="50113-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>There has been much legislation on this subject. Indeed, I see many Members around the Committee who have been involved in Bills brought forward to improve the lot of disabled school children. Some of the ground-breaking work, especially under the previous government, occurred primarily as a result of the school-based approach. But still it is a little hit and miss, although I am sure that it will improve over time. An additional provision purely on the grounds of education, therefore, would not be inappropriate because we are taking things further than addressing only the needs of disabled pupils.
</p>

<a name="50113-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The amendment has also been tabled because certain groups are worried that schools are not covered by the Bill. Will the Ministers show us where schools are guaranteed to be in the main thrust of the changes? Apparently, universities and colleges are&#151;and the Government&#039;s programme states that if you want to participate in civil society, having employment is a good way forward. The Government have been encouraging that for a long time. If we can ensure that disabled school children will obtain the full benefit of the Bill and are at the forefront of its provisions, I shall be happy. It is not something that the Government have encouraged for a long time. If a group of people who will be even more dependent on getting good <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50113-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>I hope that the Government will be able to give me a full answer on that and allay my fears. If those groups outside are right, we effectively are making the Bill less good than it should be. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50113-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I read the amendment with interest. The lawyers will have seen the letter from the Special Educational Consortium that sets out the problem. When the Minister replies, it would be helpful if she could confirm that the Government have the power already in new Section 49D, which was mentioned by the noble Lord. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may by regulations impose on a public authority . . .  such duties as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for the purpose of ensuring the better performance by that authority of its duty under section 49A(1)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>That duty sets out the need to eliminate discrimination and harassment, and to promote equality of opportunity and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;the need to take steps to take account of disabled persons&#039; disabilities, even where that involves treating disabled persons more favourably than other persons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Then, in new Section 49E we have compliance notices and, in new Section 49F, the enforcement of compliance notices. All the powers are there. New Section 49D(5) states that anyone who makes regulations shall consult the Disability Rights Commission. The powers are there; the question is of when and how the Government use them. That is probably the point. Do we need to spell them out in detail as the noble Lord has done, or are they implicit? They cover all public authorities, not only education authorities. It will be interesting to see how the Minister can help us with the use of the regulation-making power.

<a name="50113-45_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Further to that, chapter 1 of part 4 of the Keeling schedule refers to schools. In considering the amendment, I found the Keeling schedule extremely useful, because it puts the whole matter together and in context. I notice that, under proposed new Section 28D on accessibility strategies and plans&#151;this is not in the Bill; I am talking about the Keeling schedule&#151;each local education authority must prepare, in relation to schools for which they are the responsible body, an accessibility strategy. Clearly that is not the issue here, but schools must also prepare further such strategies at such times as may be prescribed. That is very much covered by the issue here. In other words, specifically for schools, the DRC and the Government can insist that such strategies are produced, kept up to date, followed through and all the rest of it. I am not really sure that the amendment is necessary.

<a name="50113-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>So far as the details of the amendment are concerned, I want to ask the noble Lord, Lord Addington, to whom reports of progress must be made, as covered in proposed <br>&nbsp;<br>

new paragraph (c) in the amendment. Clearly, schools are reviewing themselves, but to whom must they demonstrate that they have taken the steps and actions that they said that they would?
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="50113-45_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   The answer is the Secretary of State or his office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="50113-45_spnew7"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   I also was concerned to support the amendment. I accept that there are powers around that can be used to achieve the objectives that I take it are behind the amendment. However, saying that they are around is not the same as being clear on how and whether they will be used. The purpose of the amendment, as I understand it, is particularly to probe that question.

</p>

<a name="50113-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in that the inclusion of schools in a very specific and direct way is crucial to the furthering of the objectives of the Bill. I was not quite as persuaded as evidently some others were by the Minister&#039;s comments on the previous amendment about the fact that one cannot make analogies between what happens to disabled people and to people in minority ethnic groups. However, it is certain and analogous in both cases that the promotion of good and positive attitudes is a crucial part of the role of schools.
</p>

<a name="50113-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I am very well aware that the argument is used that schools have so many duties put on them, have to report on so many things, and are subject to so many requirements to produce more paper that one should not include things that are extra without being very clear that they are necessary. However, in the instance of knowing what happens to children with disabilities if positive attitudes are not specifically required to be encouraged, if we are not to have the amendment, we need some very direct and positive assurances from the Minister if we are to feel confident that this key instrument in promoting the objectives of the Bill will be used.
</p>

<a name="50113-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I speak knowing that the Children&#039;s Society, among other bodies, thoroughly welcomes the Bill and feels that it is excellent that is being brought forward. It would regard any failure on the subject as a matter of serious concern.

<a name="50113-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   From these Benches, I thank the right reverend Prelate for his support. He put his finger on the key requirement. As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, mentioned the Special Educational Consortium, I thought that I would quote its views briefly. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;At the Second Reading of the  . . . Bill, Government Ministers were equivocal about how far it was intended for the Public Duty to apply to schools  . . . It is of the utmost importance to make clear, unequivocally, that schools have a duty to  . . . ensure that they promote equality for disabled pupils in everything they do&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The consortium makes it clear that it strongly supports the amendment tabled by my noble friend and me. The Disability Rights Commission states that it strongly <br>&nbsp;<br>

backs the amendment, as does the Children&#039;s Society, as the right reverend Prelate said. This is an occasion when, unequivocally, the amendment or something very like is the way to do things.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="50113-46_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I would like to come back on another point. I was remiss in not thanking the Minister at the beginning of the debate today for the Keeling print of the Bill, which was enormously helpful, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said. That print shows, at proposed new section 28M on page 100, that&#151;it is a role for the Secretary of State and the National Assembly&#151;if the appropriate authority is satisfied, whether on a complaint or otherwise, that the responsible body has acted or is preparing to act unreasonably in the discharge of a duty imposed by or under proposed new Sections 28D or 28E, or has failed to discharge a duty imposed by or under either of those sections, it may give the body such directions as in the discharge of the duty appear to it expedient. All the   powers are clearly there if the Government are prepared to use them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="50113-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. Amendments Nos. 23 and 27 would require the Government to place specific duties under the duty to promote equality in schools. Before I turn to the detail, I want to make a couple of broader remarks. To some extent, we are touching on the issue that we raised on Amendment No. 11, which was overlap. Schools have an extensive range of existing duties, under both disability law and education law. Those duties are significant and designed, for example, to ensure that disabled people are not discriminated against, and that schools plan to increase access to education for disabled pupils. Indeed, those duties go further than duties on other bodies. For example, schools already need to produce accessibility plans.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The recent Ofsted report,<i> Special educational needs and disability&#151;Towards inclusive schools</i>, found that the revised inclusion framework that we introduced through the Special Education Needs and Disability Act 2001 had contributed to a growing awareness of the benefits of inclusion and to some improvements in practice. The visits to the schools for the survey finished in November 2003, six months after schools&#039; first accessibility plans were due to be published. It is therefore good news that 50 per cent of schools had already published their plans. The report went on to highlight the need for additional progress and to bed down that strategy, which is being pursued.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>We are also developing, with the Disability Rights Commission, education experts and other disability organisations, a resource bank to help schools to make reasonable adjustments to their policies and practice to prevent discrimination against disabled pupils. As noble Lords will be aware, our consultation document, <i>Delivering equality for disabled people</i>, set out our proposals for using the powers to impose specific duties that would be granted by new Section 49D. We will respond to that consultation in due course.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50113-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>My noble friend Lord Carter is absolutely right. In the education sector, our priority is clear. We must ensure that SENDA and other existing measures bed down. We need to decide whether applying the full specific duties to schools is appropriate in that context. However, even if we decided that it was not appropriate to put the full weight of specific duties on schools, we are keeping the matter under constant review. As my noble friend rightly identified, new Section 49D would allow us to oppose further duties at a later date if that were necessary to achieve the outcomes for disabled children and teachers that we all want&#151;in other words, if the SENDA moves do not deliver what we all want, hope and expect them to do.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was right. Section 28D of the DDA, which was inserted by SENDA, requires schools to draw up accessibility plans and gives powers to the Secretary of State to prescribe further plans that schools must draw up.

</p>

<a name="50113-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>With those reassurances, I hope that Members of the Committee will accept that we seek to bed SENDA down and avoid overlap provision. There are strong responsibilities placed on schools to meet their needs and promote equality for disabled children, but we have additional and further powers to amplify that if, in practice after we have bedded SENDA down, those powers are clearly seen to be needed. In that case, we can return to the issue then. I hope that the Committee feels that the Government are responding appropriately and are making education central to the matter, whether at school or adult level. Discrimination, whether on medical or social models, is as much about mindset as about physical or mental capacity. That is why education needs to be at the centre of our concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="50113-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Could the noble Baroness clarify which kinds of school are covered by existing powers? Do they cover city academies, fully private schools, and private special schools that provide largely for pupils paid for out of the public purse? Where is the line drawn in this complicated collection of styles of school that we now have?
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="50113-46_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale </b>   moved Amendment No. 24:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>Page 11, leave out lines 14 to 23.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are quite simple and not nearly as dramatic as the Marshalled List in conjunction with the Bill might perhaps tempt some noble Lords and observers to think. Clearly, if subsection (3) on the page 11 is left out, there is no point in having subsection (4), so we can dispense with the second amendment very easily indeed.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The first amendment covers a very simple point. While there is clearly no point in having compliance notices unless they are enforced, it is equally clear that the courts are the right people to enforce them. There were long discussions on the last Bill with which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, the Minister and myself were concerned&#151;the Pensions Bill&#151;on the matter of compliance notices.

</p>

<a name="50113-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The problem in this Bill is that public authorities are given three months to respond to the compliance notice issued by the Disability Rights Commission, which is a thundering long time. I agree that that is the maximum, but these things tend to take up the maximum time in my experience. The three months given in the Bill is more than generous. If the response is inadequate in the view of the Disability Rights Commission, it may then take the matter to the courts for them to decide. The trouble is that there is no limit to the time that the courts may take, but it would be unusual for the courts to complete their review of the matter in less than another three months. That is a likely minimum of six months during which time the specified duty is not being conducted and discrimination is therefore continuing.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I believe that the process will take far too long. The intention of the amendments is to ask the Minister&#151;I do not think that we can add anything useful to the Bill&#151;what she can do to speed up the process from the first failure of a duty to its resolution by the courts. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="50113-46_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The answer is that I do not know. I do not know whether there is anything that can be done to speed up the process. This is clearly a probing amendment. I was prepared to defend the need for the DRC&#039;s three months to get engaged and the way that the court processes work. However, the noble Lord understands that perfectly well and has described it perfectly adequately and accurately, so I do not need to go through all that material. The noble Lord is clearly concerned about whether the process that we have constructed is too elongated and drawn out and justice for the individual gets lost in the process.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I will take further advice on this matter but, as it stands, what we have done is model this procedure broadly on the lines of the CRE. The CRE has never <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

had to proceed beyond the issuing of a compliance notice. In other words, the CRE&#039;s compliance notices have stuck and it has not had to go through to the second stage which indeed would elongate the process by going through to a court action. That is because the length of time for the CRE, which I understand is equivalent to the one proposed here, allows it to mediate, teach, explain, persuade and, if necessary&#151;bluntly&#151;to hassle and bully people into compliance. That is why we have the three-month period.
</p>

<a name="50113-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I will check with the DRC that it feels that the time-scale is appropriate as modelled on the race relations Acts. In our judgment it seems to be, but that is based on the supposition that the time-scale is successful and court action does not need to follow. If I am wrong then we should reflect again, but I am happy to have the noble Lord on side to see expeditious justice.

However, I remember, although I cannot pin it down at the moment, that the DRC quite regularly supports or initiates court cases in the field of disability. I made a speech months ago on exactly that subject. If that is going on already outwith the Bill, it is likely that there will be a need for the occasional court case because of the Bill. That is what I am concerned about. However, as I said, I am grateful to the Minister for saying that she will consider the matter. As I said earlier, I do not think that this is the subject for an amendment to the Bill but it is something that we should watch very carefully indeed.

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="50113-47_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke </b>   moved Amendment No. 26:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>After Clause 3, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
   &quot;DISABLED PERSONS&#039; RIGHTS TO INDEPENDENT LIVING

<br>
   Persons with disabilities are to be entitled to the same choice, control and freedom as any other citizen, at home, at work, in education and as a member of the community.&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this new clause is to propose enforceable rights to independent living for disabled people. We have come a long way in the past 30 years or so from a patronising, pitying attitude to disabled people, but without full rights to independent living we fall well short of our goals. In my view, that is one of the highest priorities for the next Parliament. I understand that, at present, it is the subject of an intensive programme of work by the Disability Rights Commission and I very much hope that the Government takes that on board. I shall listen very carefully indeed to the response of my noble friend Lady Hollis.

</p>

<a name="50113-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The concept of independent living sounds very general, but it contains a range of very definite specifics. Some of those are taken forward in the Bill through new transport rights, the extent of the DDA&#039;s public functions and the public sector duty to promote <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC106"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disability equality. If the splendid amendments about disabled tenants and leaseholders proposed by my noble friends Lady Wilkins and Lady Darcy de Knayth, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, are eventually accepted they would add enormously to independent living.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The concept arises through our failure to provide independence for disabled people. Schools, jobs, leisure and all the things that we take for granted are beyond reach, as vast numbers of disabled people know to their cost. It is remarkably sad that so many of our citizens are deprived of so many basic rights.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Independent living means disabled people having the same choice, control and freedom as any other citizen. It means providing practical assistance based on their own choices and aspirations. Now is the time to move decisively on this. We need to guarantee that disabled people can grow up with their families, go to neighbourhood schools, use the same buses, get jobs commensurate with their abilities and have equal access to the same services and establishments and social life, culture and leisure.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>It may be argued that we have made some progress, with community care and direct payments, and indeed we have. But there are many defects. For example, the DRC calculates that direct payments are particularly low for people with learning difficulties and mental health service users, with take up of only 10 per cent and 2 per cent of all direct payment recipients respectively.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The essential point is that full rights to independent living must be properly financed and carefully planned. With that, we can release human talents and potentialities that would benefit not only disabled people themselves, but the whole of our society. That is a marvellous goal and we will not be satisfied until we have achieved it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="50113-47_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I added my name to this amendment because I certainly agree with the principle. However, I made the point that disabled people are people first and disabled second. Therefore, it goes without saying that any rights and duties that are attached to able-bodied people should also be attached to disabled people. I am fairly confident&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that, when general duties, controls and freedoms are legislated for in the whole panoply of civil and criminal law, disabled people are covered just as much as the able-bodied. However, in principle I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="50113-47_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   It only remains for me to say that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, is right in this matter and that the House should support him.

As always, the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, speaks with enormous authority and experience on this issue. We can all agree with the amendment, but it is what is known in the trade as a declaratory clause and I am sure that the Minister has a note from the draftsman saying that it is not necessary or something of that nature.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50113-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I also wonder whether the amendment is in the right place in the Bill because it comes after Clause 3 in the section relating to public authorities and refers to rights that should apply to disabled people in all contexts, not only public authorities. The right place for the amendment&#151;and it would be excellent if the Minister would accept it&#151;is a declaratory clause right at the front of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>

<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="50113-47_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The notion that the Minister has a civil service in her pocket should not be regarded as an appropriate statement for any of us to make.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>As my noble friend said, the amendment as worded is not necessary: the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale is exactly right. There is currently nothing in law that prevents disabled people from being entitled to the same choice, control and freedom as any other citizen. In that sense, the amendment is redundant. There is no law that says X, Y or Z applies to everyone except disabled people. However, that is not the issue, as I am sure my noble friend Lord Ashley would agree. The crucial matter is that disabled people have the opportunity to make use of existing rights. In other words, the rights must not be merely declaratory, but deliverable.

</p>

<a name="50113-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Too often, the barriers that people face are too great, which is what the DDA aims to tackle. By making discrimination against disabled people unlawful, it ensures that they can have greater choice, control and freedom in their lives. As Committee Members know, the DDA outlaws discrimination against disabled people in a range of situations including employment, education and the provision of goods, facilities and services. Requiring providers of hospital services to examine their policies and procedures, as we discussed earlier, or service providers to adapt or remove steps to a cinema or church to make access possible for wheelchair users is already within the DDA.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>However, the current duties go only so far, which is why, through Clause 3 in the draft Bill, we are placing new duties on public authorities in the exercise of functions and requiring them not only to dismantle barriers but to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. Those public authorities will have specific duties to make reasonable adjustments to the way that they fulfil their functions. More than that, they will have to consult disabled people on their priorities when developing policies and methods of delivery. They will then have to prioritise actions and reporting arrangements to reflect the priorities <br>&nbsp;<br>

expressed by disabled people. Those new duties are aimed at ensuring that disabled people&#039;s needs are not considered as separate issues but are mainstreamed in all that public authorities do. The new duties should be transforming.

</p>

<a name="50113-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>As my noble friend described today, I am aware that the Campaign for Independent Living sets out a number of aims, the &quot;seven pillars of independent living&quot;, covering accessible housing; education; employment opportunities; provision of advocacy services; community care; access to information; and provision of welfare benefits, including direct payments.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I do not want to take up the Committee&#039;s time in listing all the activities under way in government, or how far this Government and, indeed, previous governments have moved in this direction. However, I can assure the Committee that the Government are working hard to improve services and facilities for disabled people in all of these areas.

</p>

<a name="50113-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Finally, I would like to highlight in particular the review being undertaken by the Prime Minister&#039;s Strategy Unit to examine how to improve the life chances of disabled people. The Strategy Unit review started a year ago, and an interim analytical report was published in June this year. I understand that the unit will publish its final report shortly. I am happy to do my best to ensure that all Members of your Lordships&#039; Committee receive a copy when it does. That report will set out the Government&#039;s long-term vision for disabled people and I would expect its recommendations to aim at significantly improving outcomes for them.
</p>

<a name="50113-47_para15"></a>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>The noble Lord said: We come to a series of amendments on the section that is concerned with important transport issues. I wish to make two preliminary points. First, a number of these amendments are probing amendments. However, one or two anguished phone calls were made to us during the Recess from people who did not fully understand that if one said that one wanted to leave something out, one did not mean that one wanted to leave it out! Consequently, I stress that a number of them are probing amendments, although some of them are not.

<a name="50113-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The second general point that I ought to make is that the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on this Bill makes something of an onslaught on Clause 6(3). That has been backed up by no less than the chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, who also finds a number of these provisions somewhat doubtful or, indeed, objectionable. Perhaps the most appropriate spot to deal with that would be during discussion of Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Carter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="50113-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I believe there is a letter in circulation which states that the Government are accepting the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

However, I can confirm that what he has just said is accurate and that will therefore help us with subsequent developments on this part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="50113-48_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Before we go any further, may I point out that my noble friend has not yet finished moving his amendment and that our deliberations would proceed more quickly if we allowed him to do so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="50113-48_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I was merely making the point that for the avoidance of doubt&#151;as I think is the normal legal jargon&#151;it would be appropriate to deal with those issues when we discuss the relevant amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, rather than when discussing the amendment that I shall now finish moving.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Amendment No. 28 concerns a somewhat different point. It is concerned with the definition of a &quot;railway&quot;. One would have thought that a railway scarcely needed to be defined. However, Clause 6(1) amends the definition of &quot;rail vehicle&quot; that appeared in the 1995 Act. As I understand it, what now appears as an alternative to the wording in the 1995 Act effectively duplicates or replicates Section 46(6)(a) of the 1995 Act, but it does not do so as far as the following section in that definitional part of the 1995 Act is concerned. Consequently, the part of the definition which stated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;first brought into use, or belonging to a class of vehicle first brought into use, after 31 December 1998&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>will no longer appear in the legislation if we go along with the clause as drafted. Therefore, my question is a rather simple one: why do the Government want to remove that? Obviously, the 1995 Act already referred to vehicles that were somewhat old. They are even older now, so I am not clear why the Government are making this change.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>More generally, I am not absolutely clear just how wide this definition now is. It is obviously very important that it should cover all rail vehicles. Am I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC110"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC110</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

right in thinking that it includes Tube trains, which presumably are rail vehicles? Does it include something which will be familiar to all those who have attended party conferences in Blackpool; namely, Blackpool trams? Has there been consultation on that? I hope that the Minister can clarify precisely what the intention is with regard to this definitional problem. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50113-48_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I should like to ask the Minister what is a prescribed system in this case. I think that I know what a railway is and what a tramway is, but if he could help me as regards what a prescribed system is, I would be very grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="50113-48_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   First of all, I owe the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, an apology for intervening in his speech before he had finished moving the amendment. I was following the very bad example of my former Chief Whip. This is not the first time that I have been led astray in that way. However, I apologise for that.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The noble Lord is right that the matter of the orders and how we deal with the statutory instrument issues can be discussed on a later amendment. However, I wanted to indicate that I believe we have a positive response regarding the committee&#039;s deliberations that will help subsequent discussions on later amendments.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I am not surprised that the noble Lord was slightly discomforted over the Christmas Recess because, subtle as he is in tabling amendments which exclude things that were never intended to be excluded, he may be just a little too subtle for people outside Parliament. Not surprisingly, they were struck with horror at the impact that the amendment would have upon our proposals, should it be carried. The provision in the Bill would enable us to deliver two of the key recommendations of the Disability Rights Task Force which were fully supported by the Joint Scrutiny Committee and command extensive support right across the disability organisations.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Subsection (1) to Clause 6 may appear to be a minor tinkering with the definition of a &quot;rail vehicle&quot;, but the implications are profound. By replacing the definition of a &quot;rail vehicle&quot; in Section 46(6) of the Disability Discrimination Act with one which does not limit it to vehicles brought into use after a specified date, this subsection would allow us not only to make regulations to set an &quot;end date&quot; for compliance with rail vehicle accessibility regulations, but also to apply those regulations to rail vehicles when they are refurbished.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>On both those counts, we have been pressed extensively to make progress, and we need to change the definition to be able to effect the outcome. If we did accept the amendment, it would be lawful for all rail vehicles brought into use before 1999 to remain non-compliant, which is exactly the opposite of the objective which I know we all share.
</p>

<a name="50113-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>It will be possible for the Government to set an end date by which time such vehicles must comply with rail vehicle accessibility regulations. Our proposals will bring obvious benefits to disabled passengers by <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50113-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>During the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill, we made it clear that having carried out initial consultation, we would consult during the passage of the Bill on draft regulations that would set out our final proposals. We realised that that was unlikely to happen during the early stages of the Bill&#039;s progress. When we decided to announce the key elements of our proposals before Second Reading so that the House could be clear about how we intended to use the regulation-making power, we said that the end date that we propose is 2020. I recognise that there is a very strong campaign for the date of 2017&#151;and, of course, the Joint Committee also emphasised that date.

<a name="50113-49_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </b>   I do not know whether my question falls under these amendments, but it is an extraordinary situation. Disabled people in wheelchairs have ramps at stations to get them on and off the train. Sometimes, in an emergency, the train stops and people have to get off&#151;it has happened to me twice. Could the trains carry ramps? That would make it much easier in the circumstance when the train stops and people have to get off.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Recently, when my husband was in intensive care, I had to get off at an unmanned station, and the guard said that the ramp was locked up, so due to health and safety regulations I could not get off. I had some ramps in my car and I got the person who brought my car to the station to use the ramps. I told the guard to go up to the other end of the train and make himself scarce. A young doctor, another guard and the person who came to fetch me got me off the train. If the train had been carrying the ramps, there would have been no problem. They could be strapped on, because there are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC112"></a>

only two seats on each train that are acceptable. Those small things would make a huge difference, and they are not expensive.

<a name="50113-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, I recognise the force of her point. She will recognise that by the very broad definition which we are seeking to achieve for railways, I could not give her an assurance that we could insist on ramps being carried by every conceivable rail vehicle that we describe in the framework of this provision. Of course, some trains do carry ramps. The noble Baroness is absolutely right that it is an obvious additional facility for the disabled, which is to be welcomed. She will also recognise that there are certain vehicles under this category where that would be very difficult indeed to achieve. Therefore, we would have to deal with it with some understanding of the problems of the definition.

<p><a name="st_142"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the amendment that the Minister was so keen to comment on. It is arguable that in some respects the drafting is not perfect, but it includes the magic number 2017. This is an important amendment, which has had widespread comment, not least in the Joint Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. It is extremely important that the railway industry should have a clear deadline by which it is required to comply with the requirements regarding accessibility of rail vehicles; I hope that the Government can go along with that view. Whether where the amendment is at the moment is the best place for it is open to consideration, but one of the advantages of dealing with the matter in Grand Committee is that we can rehearse the arguments before we come to a view as to where an amendment should be made in the Bill and what it should say, should we wish&#151;as I think we will if we cannot persuade the Government&#151;to vote on it.

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>As I understand it, the Government have in mind 2020. The Joint Committee&#151;the noble Lord, Lord   Carter, will correct me if I am wrong&#151;came down in favour of 2017, with exemptions for one or two items to 2025. The year 2017 would be the same as the bus deadline, and there is some case for consistency there. There has been a great deal of discussion on the matter, back in the Disability Rights Task Force in 1999, the DTI in 2003 and the Joint Committee in 2004. Clearly, we are about to reach the point where we make decisions on the matter, and there seems to be a strong case for 2017. The crucial issue is the costs, and to what extent the date is practical.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>It was pointed out in one of the other reports that the calculation of costs in the impact assessment is virtually double what it was being said last year on bringing the date forwards. No doubt the Minister can give us a clear assessment of the extent to which the costs of compliance will be increased if the date is earlier rather than later, both with regard to refurbishments, to which he referred, and new rolling stock.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and others will have points to make on this. As I said, it is an important point. I do not fully share the views of some of those outside who say that if we do not have a firm date, there is a danger that it will be put back later, whereas if it is in the Bill it will be more difficult to subsequently change it without primary legislation. Nonetheless, the case for clarity is considerable. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="50113-49_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   I have total sympathy with the amendment and one of the reasons why it was mentioned, although I realise that we might have moved on slightly from this. The simple reason is that when the first Bill came through, very long run-in times were granted, which led to initial panic, then people thought that it was tomorrow&#039;s problem, they started to think in the medium term or long term, and total inactivity was the result. That is why the point made by the noble Lord about having a definite time period has its strengths. It also has weaknesses, in the fact that everyone will immediately put things off until they have to do them, in the hope that someone else&#039;s budget will be the one that is cut. Probably that is a good reason why 2025 would have been such a disaster. Despite such a long run-in time, if you put it off for long enough you cannot do anything. That is one of the things that goes on here.

Having targets that are achievable within the time scale is a great way of preventing slip. Have we got anywhere on that, and has some thought been given to it?

</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="50113-49_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is quite right. Recommendation 28 was that the Committee&#039;s analysis of the evidence we have received, together with the Department for Transport&#039;s own data, led us to suggest an end date of the end of 2017. We concluded that this, together with a limited exemption system, which would itself expire in 2025, would be an appropriate compromise between the needs of disabled people and the industry&#039;s current replacement programmes. As my noble friend the Minister said, the final proposal of the end date would be included in the draft regulations, which we plan to consult when they are introduced. The Government have now proposed an end date of 2020.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>There are two aspects to this: one is the end date itself, 2017 or 2020; and the other is exemptions. Recently, I chaired a substantial conference on this Bill and transport, and there was an official there from the Department for Transport responsible for inclusion and mobility. I took the opportunity to ask her how robust the exemption procedure would be in 2020. I was assured that it would be robust, that they did not see that many rail vehicles would be exempt, except perhaps heritage vehicles and so on. I began to think that it would not be a bad result if we get to 2020 with very few rail vehicles exempt. That is not a bad compromise on the 2017 that we wanted, although that will mean for three years that a disabled person travelling by bus or coach will have an accessible vehicle and then might have to move on to a train without the same degree of accessibility. However, we can discuss that.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>I am tempted to say that a railway carriage was driven through the arguments of the Department for Transport, rather than a coach and horses, when I saw only recently the correspondence between my noble friend Lord Hunt of King&#039;s Heath, the Chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. He had written to the Chairman of the Delegated Powers Committee, and they had recommended that the exemption orders under Section 47 of the 1995 Act should continue to be statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure, and not Orders in Council. We have heard from the Minister that, as always, the recommendation of that Committee has been accepted.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Then one reads the previous correspondence between the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and my honourable friend Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Transport. There is a long letter about exemptions and the way in which they were working. The last letter from my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, is pretty strong stuff. It says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;the cumulative effect of so many exemptions seemed to be contrary to the Government&#039;s policy objective, under both the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the draft bill, of <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC115"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC115</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>improving transport facilities for the disabled. Our 18th Report (HL Paper 163, Session 2003&#150;04) drew further exemption orders to the special attention of the House on the ground that two of the Government&#039;s policy objectives appeared to be in conflict. By putting or keeping non-compliant rail vehicles in service, these exemptions achieve the objective of avoiding delay to the travelling public but, we believe, they may do so to the detriment of the objective of improving access for the disabled&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>This is extremely important. If we are going to accept the Government&#039;s argument that it should be 2020 on the grounds of cost&#151;which we might if the argument were persuasive&#151;that would be on the basis only of a really robust exemptions procedure. We do not want to be left in 2020 with a large number of rail vehicles still exempt.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>In 2020, 2,080 vehicles will still be non-compliant. In 2017, the figure will be 4,256. If we agree to 2017, 4,256 vehicles would still be outstanding, and that figure would halve by 2020. That is a significant change. Fifty per cent more rail vehicles will become compliant.
</p>

<a name="50113-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>All this stands or falls by the quality and the robustness of the exemptions procedure. If we are to accept 2020, we need to be convinced that the exemptions procedure will be really strong. I hope that the department will be able to deal with the very strong criticisms that have been made in the letter to the chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee.

It makes the point about considerably fewer vehicles having to be refurbished if we wait the extra three years. Some 4,355 will need to be replaced in 2017 or only 2,200 in 2020. That is a big difference.

<a name="50113-50_para1"></a>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I suppose that might be the case. I do not know what the run-through is, though no doubt the Minister can explain it to me.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   There is a table in our report that is quite helpful. In 2013, the number will be 6,269; in 2017, the figure will be 4,256; in 2020, it will be 2,080; in 2025, the original year that the Government suggested, it would only have been 69. There is obviously a trade-off between numbers and time, but those are the figures that we were provided with on the Joint Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Let me begin by emphasising that those figures were given accurately to my noble friend and the Joint Committee. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for his contribution. He is right in saying that there is a trade-off with regard to compliance. I shall try to answer the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, with regard to the rate at which vehicles are replaced, which obviously affects the whole issue of compliance.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I recognise the strength of feeling about the question of clarity on an end date. We are all as one on the desirability of a clear definition of when compliance has to be largely met. However, I may differ from the Committee on the extent to which that needs to be in the Bill. What the Committee will recognise is that the Government have entered into the debate in the best possible faith and with the recognition that there has been very intense pressure for the suggested date of 2017. Our initial response, as the Committee will recall, was to propose 2025.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Our proposal now to work towards 2020 is the compromise that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, mentioned with regard to the question of costs. The costs are almost doubled as between the amount needing to be spent in 2020 and 2017. We are talking about a difference of between more than &#163;300 million and just over &#163;150 million, so it will be recognised that we are not talking about negligible sums. Therefore, it is quite proper that the Government should consider the question of serious costs for the railway industry.

</p>

<a name="50113-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>I emphasise, to reassure the Committee, that the exemption provisions in the DDA, which would be amended by this Bill, are not used lightly by the Secretary of State. Each case is considered on its merits. Key stakeholders, including the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, are consulted, and the decision is based on all the factors. Where exemptions are granted they are generally time limited and may contain other conditions which the Secretary of State considers appropriate. The amendment would restrict the Government&#039;s ability to make exemptions beyond 2017.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>We are well aware of the strength of feeling behind that proposal, but it should be recognised that the end date of 2020 not only has the merits of saving the rail   industry a very substantial cost, but brings the requirements for rail vehicles into line with those for coaches, which are in many cases providing broadly similar longer distance services. It might be helpful if I follow my noble friend Lord Carter into a statement of costs. If 2017 were chosen&#151;I believe that my noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC117"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

friend quoted this figure&#151;4,355 rail vehicles would need to be replaced before their normal life expiry at a total additional cost of &#163;353 million. Those are the figures to which the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, kindly referred, and which I re-emphasise for the record. Based on our preferred date of 2020, 2,200 vehicles would be affected at a total cost of &#163;169.7 million.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   Just in case there is any confusion, those are updated figures. The figures that we had are probably a year or more out of date.
</p>




<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I understand that my noble friend is in that position&#151;it behoves me to be as accurate as I can in the present circumstances. It also helps to explain that aspect which the noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned, about what seemed to be increased costs. Inevitably, as we have pursued over time with great intensity the necessary evaluation of potential costs, we have been able to produce more rigorous figures, which reflect our best estimates on that position.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>On balance, we believe that our proposal will command the broad support of the community. It will be recognised that inevitably there is a compromise with regard to choice of date. However, if we failed to propose any date at all, the Government would be open to considerable criticism. We recognise that there is a necessity on the issue of compliance and that the date is of great significance in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The amendment would have an unfortunate impact on other aspects of the rail system, which would not be helpful. It would certainly mean great problems for the heritage rail industry, where we would lose the capacity for those necessary exemptions. However, I know that the noble Lord moved the amendment in the spirit of recognising that there would be a need for flexibility in that regard. However, equally, he will expect me to seek to identify that the amendment would have some unfortunate consequences of that nature if it were pressed, which I am sure that it will not be.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Very considerable progress has been made on these issues. These are serious and major costs for a major industry, and a great deal of progress has been made. The Government have moved from the position that we adopted on the date of 2025. I hope that therefore it will be recognised on all sides of the Committee that we are making progress with regard to a very important aspect of compliance across the whole range of the rail industry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   Has any thought been given to progress targets, measuring how far we should have got in making the rail stock compliant in the time frame of 2020?
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We are dictated to rather more by the nature of the industry and the time at which rolling stock reaches the end of its natural life than just mere aspiration.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   We were told at considerable length, and it was one of the arguments that we have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not heard for the end date of 2020, that 15 years is the normal refurbishment time for a train. Perhaps if we could hear how many trains should be refurbished by whatever point, we could put that down as a target. That would at least keep people on their toes. Interim targets have been used in the very different industry of broadcasting to achieve things such as audio description. That was seen to be a good thing. A target that fits in with the engineering schedule would be very reassuring to have to ensure that compliance will happen on time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="50113-50_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I believe that it will be recognised that when we have a date to which the industry will be gearing itself, as rolling stock becomes out of date and new rolling stock comes on stream, there will be the determination to move towards compliance. The fact that I am reflecting to the noble Lord is that the rate at which rolling stock goes out of date and is necessarily replaced is governed by the economics of the industry and also by the nature of the composition of the rolling stock that we have at present.
</p>

<a name="50113-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The noble Lord may have in mind some flow chart to show the rate at which the changes will be effected, but there would not be a consistent flow chart in those terms. What it would reflect is the nature of the rolling stock that we already have and when it goes out of use. The noble Lord must recognise that we cannot address the matter with the kind of precision that I believe he was driving towards in his questions.

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We are grateful that we are making progress on an important issue, on which there seems to be a degree of flexibility on the Government&#039;s part. One aspect that we have not fully considered is the question of the competition between the various parts of the transport system. The requirement on the bus companies will come into operation in 2017, so if we go for an end date of 2020 for the railways, things are not exactly in line. The Minister referred to coaches&#151;I suppose that he was distinguishing between buses and coaches. Though that is a fairly subtle distinction, the coaches are more in competition with the railways than buses are and there may be a case for having the two in line. I imagine that the normal lifespan of a coach is probably significantly less than that of a normal railway carriage.
</p>

<a name="50113-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>I understand that quite a number of the requirements to meet the standards set down for slam-shut doors on trains have still not been met. Perhaps we may return to that matter under a later amendment. What is emerging very clearly is that, if there is a deal on 2020, we have to be absolutely sure about the enforcement and monitoring side of things. But subject to that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50113-51_para1"></a>

<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Lord said: If my understanding is correct that the Government are accepting the proposals of the Delegated Powers Committee, I do not propose to move Amendments Nos. 30 and 31. I do not believe that I need to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   No! If that is so, I believe that we need rather more implication than we have had. I do not believe that that is an appropriate way in which to proceed. The Delegated Powers Committee makes recommendations, in very strong critical terms of the Government. Indeed, the chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee also did so. Instead of in the course of debates in this Committee replying to the various points made, because the function of the regulatory committee is to help this Committee in its deliberations, we are told that there has been some concession&#151;we know not what. The amendment under which we were going to debate the matter in detail is suddenly not moved, and we do not know what the answer is. We will really not know what the situation is if we proceed like this.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   The whole or main purpose of Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 was to remove the blanket exemption by Order in Council and suggest that it should be replaced by the procedure in the 1995 Act, which is the negative resolution procedure. We have heard from the Minister that the Government are going to do that; they are going to remove the Order in Council proposal and revert to the negative resolution procedure, which will enable them to deal with heritage vehicles, and so on. That was the proposal that I was going to make on the basis of the undertaking that the Minister gave. There is no need for me to make it, because he has accepted it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Viscount Ullswater): </b>  Perhaps the noble Lord should move the amendment, so that we can get back into order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   The amendment would ensure that the blanket exemption for heritage railways will be enacted through statutory instrument. That will ensure that an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny will apply to the exemptions procedure. The report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee said that they recommended that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;exemption orders under section 47 of the 1995 Act should continue to be statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50113-51_para2"></a>

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I do not wish to delay the Committee longer, but both the Regulatory Reform Committee and the chairman of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee took very strong exception to the way in which the Government proposed to act. They argued in simple terms that the arrangement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<b>13 Jan 2005 : Column GC120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whereby a Minister could act not by order but by diktat, effectively, was not satisfactory because we did not get the parliamentary scrutiny required.
</p>

<a name="50113-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>If the noble Lord is right in what his amendment does, no doubt in the light of the earlier exchanges the Government can simply accept it and we will then all know where we stand. I am not sure whether that is what the Minister will do, but it is at least worth examining the arguments that the Regulatory Reform Committee put forward, which were that the Government gave two reasons. The first was that the provision was not consistent with Section 43 of the 1995 Act, so their argument that it was helpful in that respect was wrong. The second was that the current procedure was a burden, in terms of both cost and time.
</p>

<a name="50113-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>If the Government believed that last week, they clearly would not accept the amendment this week. I am not the least clear about the question of costs of time. We are suddenly told that to have a negative instrument procedure would result in an increase in cost compared with the Minister acting by diktat. Somehow that would save the railway industry expense, we are told, but I am not clear how. If that argument was made before, why is it no longer valid?

</p>

<a name="50113-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The argument is also made in terms of time. Given that we are talking about whether everything should happen by 2020, the amount of time taken up by the statutory instrument procedure is unbelievably trivial. The noble Baroness laughs; she is right. We are talking about six weeks as against 20 years, and we are suddenly told that that was a pressing reason why the Government thought that they could avoid parliamentary scrutiny. If the Minister is going to accept the amendment, I hope that he will tell us so. If he is not going to do so, I hope that he will tell us why and, in particular, why the Government have changed their mind.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="50113-51_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I shall ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment; I would have preferred it had he not moved it. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is somewhat unchivalrously looking a gift horse in the mouth. The Government have recognised the strength of the argument put forward by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the issue. We accept the arguments that have been put forward. The action will need to be taken with great precision.
</p>

<a name="50113-51_para6"></a>

That will also be the occasion for the noble Lord, Lord   Higgins, to challenge the Government yet again on our competence. I suppose that we just had five minutes of ritual comment on that but, on this occasion, the Government are on the side of the angels, if I can define the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee as being angelic; I certainly can the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee.

<p><a name="wa_st_7"></a>
<a name="50113w01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   Orphans and vulnerable children are a high priority for DfID. We are particularly concerned with support for children who are affected by AIDS or infected with HIV in Africa, where the situation in the worst affected countries is reaching crisis level, but are also concerned to step up our work in Asia.

<a name="50113w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>DFID has endorsed the UNICEF <i>Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Living in a World with HIV and AIDS</i>. This sets out comprehensive guidance for countries to use in developing national policies and programmes to respond to the needs of vulnerable children, including orphans, street children and those at risk from drugs, prostitution, trafficking and HIV and AIDS. It therefore provides a good basis for discussing policy with partner governments.

<a name="50113w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>In 2004, we saw significant progress in a number of African middle-income countries in developing comprehensive, costed national action plans to address the needs of orphans and other vulnerable children. These are Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, which are among the worst AIDS-affected countries in the world and the number of vulnerable children is growing alarmingly. DfID will be stepping up its support to these countries through multilateral channels and UNICEF in particular. DfID will also be providing support to Botswana to assist in developing and implementing its national action plan.
