Anderson of Swansea:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
this Bill be now read a second time. It comes to us from the other
place with unanimous all-party support, as seen by the list of sponsors
and speeches made in support, including from Front-Bench spokesmen. It
is good that a number of your Lordships want to participate in the
debate, and I look forward in particular to the maiden speech of my
noble friend Lord Morris of Handsworth.</p><p><a name="06101348000009"></a>I pay tribute in particular to my right
honourable friend the Father of the House, the Member for Swansea,
West, who based his Private Member's Bill on a precedent in Scottish
legislation suggested to him by the Liberal Democrat Member for
Teignbridge. It is not easy successfully to steer a Private
Member&#146;s Bill into law and he clearly expended a great deal of
time and effort on the Bill. The Bill was modified during debate,
partly because the legal basis in Scotland is different, so that it
could not simply be transposed, and in response to government concerns.
The Bill received its Third Reading on 14 July.</p><p><a name="06101348000010"></a>The Bill responds to a very effective
campaign led by the Fire Brigades Union, the ambulance workers and the
<I>Manchester Evening News</I>. I need hardly add that it is welcomed
by the emergency services. It was significant that in the debates in
the other place, Members from different parts of the country gave
examples of the obstruction of fire engines or ambulances on their way
to deal with emergencies&#151;for example, pipes being cut to impede
water supplies. Your Lordships would be appalled by some of the
examples given. Perhaps the most lurid was that in a multi-floor
building, a hole was made in the floor and covered with a mat, like a
bear trap, so that firemen coming in were in danger of plummeting to
the floor below.</p><p><a name="06101348000011"></a>There was
general consensus that there is indeed a lacuna in the law which the
Bill would remedy and that our emergency workers need protection from a
variety of troublemakers and vandals when on their way to deal with
emergencies. On 14 July, on Third Reading in the other place, the
Father of the House said that two simple principles lay behind the
Bill. He said:</p><ul><a name="06101348000329"></a>&#147;First,
people who risk their lives to save others should not be obstructed,
and should be free to undertake their rescue work without obstruction
and attack by yobs and idiots. Secondly, people who need to be rescued
in an emergency because they are in danger should not face additional
danger because of the mindless activity of a minority of
idiots.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 14/7/06; col.

of the Bill. As now amended, it will create an offence of obstructing
an emergency worker responding to emergency circumstances&#151;Clause
1(1). Emergency workers are defined as firefighters, ambulance workers,
those transporting blood, organs or medical equipment, coastguards and
lifeboat crews. It will cover firefighters whether they are employed by
local authorities or others, such as the British Airports Authority or
the armed services. It will cover ambulance workers, including air
ambulances, volunteers and those working under contract for the health
service. The Secretary of State will have the power to add or delete
people or categories of people in the list of emergency workers. It
will also createan offence of obstructing someone assisting an
emergency worker who is responding to an emergency. The offence
&#147;without reasonable excuse obstructs&#148; is the same as that
in Clause 1(1).</p><p><a name="06101348000013"></a>Emergency
circumstances are defined as circumstances that are &#147;present or
imminent&#148; and
that,</p><ul><a name="06101348000336"></a>&#147;are causing or
are likely to
cause&#148;,</ul><a name="06101348000313"></a>death,<ul><a name="06101348000337"></a>&#147;serious
harm to the
environment&#148;,</ul><a name="06101348000314"></a>or,<ul><a name="06101348000338"></a>&#147;serious
harm to any building or other
property&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000315"></a>The
maximum penalty will be a fine of up to &#163;5,000; that
is,<ul><a name="06101348000339"></a>&#147;a fine not
exceeding level 5&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101348000014"></a>I
shall discuss some of the anxieties that were expressed in the debates
in the other place, which I hope will allay some of the concerns in
this House. The first was assault. This was originally part of the
Bill, but was omitted in response to the Home Office&#146;s concern
that it was already covered by existing legislation and that it was
wrong to overcomplicate the law if we could deal adequately with the
problem under existing law.</p><p><a name="06101348000015"></a>There was serious debate on the
categories to be extended. The procedure in Clause 5 gives power to
modify by order. Mountain rescue teams, for example, are not mentioned
specifically, but there is some uncertainty about the interpretation
and whether they are included. It would be helpful to know whether the
Government believe that they are covered by the
&#147;assisting&#148; provision in the Bill. Otherwise, they are
clearly good candidates for Ministers to consider. My noble friend Lord
Clark of Windermere has taken a special interest in this.</p><p><a name="06101348000016"></a>The offence of obstructing persons
assisting emergency workers applies to voluntary organisations and
individuals when they are assisting emergency workers who are
responding to emergency circumstances. St John Ambulance personnel will
therefore be covered by the offence when they assist personnel employed
by a National Health Service body to provide ambulance services or
personnel who are providing these services pursuant to arrangements
made by, or at the request of, a National Health Service
body.</p><p><a name="06101348000017"></a>There was considerable
debate about the nature of the sentence, particularly for assault.
Clearly everyone

Council will still consider making this an aggravated offence when
dealing with people serving the public. I understand that no further
advice has yet been received from the Sentencing Guidelines Council.
Perhaps the Minister will tell us when such advice is
expected.</p><p><a name="06101348000018"></a>Defences were
initially listed <I>seriatim</I> as in the Scottish Act, but it was
cumbersome. The best legal advice was that the well tried formula
&#147;without reasonable excuse&#148; was the appropriate solution,
as it allows the sentencing authority to consider all circumstances,
including, for example, if the obstruction was unintentional and for
acceptable purposes.</p><p><a name="06101348000019"></a>I note
briefly that Wales&#151;for &#147;Wales&#148;, read
&#147;England&#148;&#151;is covered by the criminal provisions,
but it is clear that the Welsh Assembly Government will be properly
consulted on any extension of categories or persons. In the case of
Northern Ireland, the appropriate authorities were consulted during the
passage of the Bill. Northern Ireland already has legislation that
covers the obstruction of police and firefighters, so the legislation
there is more limited and covers ambulance workers, coastguards,
lifeboat crews, and those transporting blood or organs. The definitions
in the Bill ensure that these services are covered in Northern Ireland.
Clause 5 again provides that any order adding or removing categories of
workers relating to Northern Ireland will be made only with the consent
of the Northern Ireland department concerned, or perhaps even
Stormont.</p><p><a name="06101348000020"></a>Finally, I concede
that the Bill is only part of the solution to a social problem. It
needs to be assisted by education in schools and generally with the
assistance of trade unions as part of the respect agenda. On14
July 2006, the Member of Parliament for Bolton South East referred to
an initiative in Bolton by the emergency services through a programme
called Crucial Crew. This is held in a large building and is attended
by all the emergency services where emergencies are simulated for the
benefit of primary school children. Again, the Member of Parliament for
Worsley referred to a 13-week community scheme run by the fire services
and the Prince&#146;s Trust. The Greater Manchester Fire Service has
a young firefighter scheme that focuses on boys and young
men.</p><p><a name="06101348000021"></a>I emphasise to your
Lordships that we are near the end of the Session. The timetable is
tight, so any amendments passed could jeopardise the Bill, but I remind
your Lordships of the flexibility of the Bill incorporated in the
extension to other categories in Clause 5. I therefore hope that your
Lordships will respond in that spirit. It is a limited but worthwhile
measure to deal with unacceptable behaviour. I commend the Bill to the
House.</p><p><a name="06101348000022"></a>Moved, That the Bill be
now read a second time.&#151;(<I>Lord Anderson of
Swansea.</I>)</p><h5><a name="06101348000347"></a>11.16

kindness and support that I have received from all sections of the
House. This includes all those who work so diligently to support the
activities of this House.</p><p><a name="06101348000024"></a>I
have received a great deal of advice, on which I have reflected. I can
inform your Lordships that I am now much better informed, but none the
wiser. This morning, I am not sure whether I am blessed or cursed, but
I have the full weight of the Trades Union Congress behind me. I am
told that I should avoid being controversial. I readily accept this
advice for two reasons: first, I am never
controversial&#151;controversy comes only when others fail to agree
with me; secondly, I believe that the matter before this House this
morning engenders unity, not
controversy.</p><p><a name="06101348000025"></a>Like the noble
Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, I too have followed the debate on this
issue in another place, and I feel sure that there is no controversy
about the fundamental aims of the Bill. We all agree that workers
attending an emergency have the right not to be impeded or assaulted.
Yet, sadly, assaults in many forms do occur on a regular basis. It is
to be regretted that there are no reliable national statistics
recording these assaults. In the West Midlands, however&#151;an area
with which I have a close association&#151;the fire service records
64 incidents that occurred between 1 January and 20 September this
year. Bricks, bottles and even a machete have been thrown at fire
crews. Various explosive materials have been thrown on to fires. The
path of fire engines has been blocked. Threatening behaviour has
sometimes included knives.</p><p><a name="06101348000026"></a>How
on earth have we ended up with a society in which emergency workers
become the target of abuse and attack while carrying out their duties
as public servants? These attacks are not only a danger to the
emergency workers, but also to the people they seek to help. Why are
our public servants victims, attacked and obstructed while serving the
community? I suggest one cause; we as a society have systematically
devalued our public services and disrespected our public servants for
years, and we are now paying a very heavy
price.</p><p><a name="06101348000027"></a>While I support the Bill
in principle, I would ask a number of questions, which I hope my noble
friend will address. First, are there not a range of laws in place
which would allow for the arrest and prosecution of anyone involved in
violent, threatening behaviour, criminal damage, hoax telephone calls
and so on? Why are these laws not properly enforced? Where do they fall
short? Secondly, if existing laws are not being properly enforced, what
measures should be made or taken to ensure that they are? Finally,
would the proposed law make it even harder to secure a prosecution by
raising the burden of proof needed?</p><p><a name="06101348000028"></a>I would suggest that one additional
matter needs attention. I note from the debate in the other place that
the Manchester fire service has estimated that there have been 200
attacks or attempts to obstruct emergency workers, yet government
statistics suggest that there have been only nine incidents for the
same period. I would urge the Minister to ensure that there 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_467"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 467</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is a systematic collection of national statistics to identify and
publicise the scale of the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101348000029"></a>It has been pointed out
that many of these incidents, although not all, are in areas of social
deprivation. It has also been argued that many of the perpetrators are
young. But poverty, social deprivation and age can never be an excuse
for crime. I was brought up in a small, rural community, a village, in
Jamaica. As it happens, my father was a part-time police officer. The
villagers shared collective responsibility for all aspects of community
life, which included the right of every adult to discipline the
children in that village. They also had a duty to protect all the
children. Never would a villager have failed to support and protect
those people who gave their time as public servants. So, if in the 21st
century we cannot get universal support for the work of our emergency
workers, the law has a duty to protect
them.</p><h5><a name="06101348000348"></a>11.22

Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My Lords, it falls to me
to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, on his
maiden speech. Although I now speak at a geographical distance from
him, I hope that I may still refer to him as an old friend. He is, of
course, one of the great trade unionists of today and his call for more
statistics, I noted particularly, was very welcome on this grave
matter. I know that the House will look forward to seeing him on his
feet many times.</p><p><a name="06101348000031"></a>I wish to make
three brief points. If I make them more slowly than has been my
customary practice, because of a recent visual impairment, I hope that
your Lordships will be patient with me. This Bill, which we may say is
born of the Fire Brigades Union and other unions, was introduced in the
other place by the Father of the House, the right honourable Member for
Swansea West, Alan Williams, and supported by the Member for Cambridge,
whom I have known in earlier ivory tower days as a student and
colleague. The Father of the House said that the Bill addressed two
straightforward
issues:</p><ul><a name="06101348000330"></a>&#147;First, people
who risk their lives to save others should not be
obstructed...Secondly, people who need to be rescued in emergency
because they are in danger should not face additional danger because of
the mindless activity of a minority of
idiots&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 14/7/06; col.
1595.]</ul><a name="06101348000316"></a>The Bill manifestly
plugs certain gaps in our law&#151;even in the truncated form that it
comes to us after consultation with the Home Office, which is a grave
matter. The Father of the other place is to be congratulated on having
emerged after such consultation with any Bill at all, let alone what we
have today.<p><a name="06101348000032"></a>The Labour Party
manifesto stated
that,</p><ul><a name="06101348000340"></a>&#147;we will
introduce tougher sentences for carrying replica guns, for those
involved in serious knife crimes
and&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101348000317"></a>this is
important&#151;<ul><a name="06101348000341"></a>&#147;for
those convicted of assaulting workers serving the
public&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000318"></a>The Bill
does not deal with assaults. I comment only that it is questionable
whether the Government are right in saying, as many of their
spokespersons have, 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_468"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that matters of assault can be left to sentencing and the advice of the
Sentencing Guidelines Council.
<p><a name="06101348000033"></a>My first substantive point arises on
Clause 1. Although the Secretary of State, under Clause 5, can amend
Clause 1 by order to modify the range of persons covered by the Bill,
is it clear that the range of persons already covered should not be
wider? Previous debates have raised issues concerning, for example, the
mountain rescue services, which may not operate a vehicle as is
required under Clause 1(2)(f)(ii), and social workers who sometimes
find themselves gravely obstructed in their duties, which are certainly
seen as emergencies to the impoverished families they
serve.</p><p><a name="06101348000034"></a><a name="spnew_3"></a><b><a name="_spnew3"></a><a name="06101348000369"></a>Lord
Burnett:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord mentioned the
mountain rescue service. Perhaps I may put a plea down for an
organisation with which I have connection; namely, the Dartmoor Rescue
Group.</p><p><a name="06101348000035"></a><a name="spnew_4"></a><b><a name="06101348000370"></a>Lord
Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My Lords, I look forward
to the noble Lord raising that point, which is appropriate to
Committee. I shall continue with my Second Reading speech, in which I
mentioned social workers, who might be considered.</p><p><a name="06101348000036"></a>My second substantial point refers to
Clause 1(2)(b), which covers a person subject
to,</p><ul><a name="06101348000342"></a>&#147;duties as an
employee or as a servant of the
Crown&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000319"></a>The words
&#147;employee&#148; and &#147;servant&#148; have of course
recently been considered by judicial interpretation in distinguishing
subordinate or dependent workers as employees from independent
contractors, self-employed persons or autonomous workers, especially
since the important decision in the Ready Mixed Concrete (South East)
Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance case in 1968. Beyond
the terms &#147;employees&#148; and &#147;servants&#148; are
other agents, agency-supplied workers, temporary staff and so on, some
of whom are employees and some of whom are certainly not. Many
government departments hide behind the cloak of the Crown, but as the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond, said only the day
before yesterday in your Lordships&#146; Judicial Committee, in the
case of Jameel v Wall Street Journal
Europe:<ul><a name="06101348000331"></a>&#147;These days,
the dividing line between governmental and non-governmental
organisations is increasingly difficult to draw. The power wielded by
the major multi-national corporations is enormous and
growing&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000320"></a>That was a
most important judgment for the Judicial Committee. Today the
outsourcing of work, from building work to call centres, makes the
dividing line between the Crown, government and corporation workers
more and more difficult. Perhaps the Minister would comment on the
phrase used to describe employees, &#147;servants of the
Crown&#148;. To make what is perhaps a Committee comment, I say that
one should consider the word &#147;workers&#148; instead of those
heavily constrained words.<p><a name="06101348000037"></a>My
third point is regarding the words &#147;without reasonable
excuse&#148;, which are fundamental to Clauses 1 and 2. Someone who
obstructs without reasonable excuse is liable. As I apprehended, this
phrase was 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_469"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consolidated into the Bill in Standing Committee C of the other place.
But what exactly do the words mean? Not everyone shares the confidence
of government Ministers who have said more than once that it is a clear
phrase. Perhaps the Minister will guide us on what limits the Home
Office foresees the courts putting on &#147;without reasonable
excuse&#148;. I shall give one example which, to my knowledge, has
often arisen. When a local authority uses its powers to spray humps or
what are euphemistically called speed cushions around its roads in a
way that obstructs fire and rescue service vehicles, ambulance and many
other emergency vehicles, does it have a reasonable excuse to do so
even if it was found that its action had not been preceded by proper
consultation in the neighbourhood? The Minister may not wish to answer
that today, but it is a point to which he ought to refer at a later
stage if he cannot say anything
now.</p><p><a name="06101348000038"></a>Such issues do not detract
from the virtues of this highly innovative and important Bill to
protect workers in major services about which the noble Lord, Lord
Morris, spoke so eloquently. In that respect, despite my three
substantive points, I welcome the Bill most vigorously and trust that
the Government will see to it that it is on the statute book before the
next Queen&#146;s Speech, for who knows how much time the measures
proposed in that speech will
take?</p><h5><a name="06101348000349"></a>11.33

Addington:</b> My Lords, this is one of those Bills
which, when you look at it, you think, &#147;Why do we need
it?&#148;. Surely all the activities we are trying to legislate
against here are covered. However, when you go into the thinking behind
it, you realise that the Bill is not designed to create a new offence
but to seal cracks in the process of defending people who are going
about their lawful and essential business. Once you are in that mindset
it becomes very obvious that we should support this measure. One or two
points have been raised, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Morris,
in his excellent maiden speech&#151;I congratulate him on
it&#151;who said that keeping adequate records might have drawn us
towards addressing this problem much sooner. The background list of
ambushes and attacks on fire service workers covers three pages of the
briefing I received. If those cases alone had been brought to the
attention of the Government, I cannot help but feel that the issue
could have been dealt with among the dozens of Home Office Bills coming
before us&#151;or is it just one continuous Bill? I am never sure; at
times it feels like a stream of consciousness from the department. Many
other things are grafted on to
Bills.</p><p><a name="06101348000040"></a>Having said that, those
in another place who have worked hard to get this measure through
deserve credit. I am glad that my honourable friend the Member for
Teignbridge was involved in it. When we spoke to him, it was a point of
distinct paternal pride to him that he had managed to take the Bill
forward. Looking at the matters addressed here, I can say that my
honourable friend certainly can take pride init. I am not a
lawyer, so my naivety may be 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_470"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understandable, but the Bill seems focused not on assaults, but on acts
of obstruction that prevent people getting to a certain point. That is
worryingly clear. My noble friend on the Benches behind me made the
point that the Bill provides that the groups covered can be broadened
if that is deemed necessary. It was also pointed out that mountain
rescue teams are probably not going to be ambushed by large numbers of
youths in the rundown parts of inner cities, by sheer accident of
geography. However, if the groups covered can be expanded, I suggest
that this Bill may well become a valuable
asset.</p><p><a name="06101348000041"></a>We must also remember
that a piece of legislation is only as valid as the amount of energy
that goes into enforcing it.

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> My Lords, before I
turn to the matter under debate, it gives me the greatest pleasure on
behalf of these Benches to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Morris of
Handsworth, on his quite excellent maiden speech. I have not had the
pleasure of meeting the noble Lord except in passing in the Corridor,
so I know him only through his public persona. But his speech seemed to
reflect the qualities I associate with him&#151;rational, well
informed and professional, with just a hint of avuncularity. A glance
at his CV shows how much he has to contribute to debates in your
Lordships&#146; House&#151;his early years in Jamaica, his work in
the heartland of British manufacturing industry in the West Midlands,
his work for the trades union movement and, finally, his string of
high-level public appointments in a wide range of fields.</p><p><a name="06101348000047"></a>I hope the House will forgive me if I add
one brief personal note. According to the noble Lord&#146;s CV,
between 1963 and 1973 he was a shop steward at a Black Country
manufacturing business called Hardy Spicer. In the early part of that
decade I was at university, and in the summer of 1964, with a group of
friends, I drove a Land Rover out from the United Kingdom through the
Middle East&#151;a journey one could not dream of undertaking today
without getting shot, probably several times over. In those days, few
made-up roads existed and it was tough going even for a Land Rover.
Noble Lords may not be aware, but the transmission system of the Land
Rover depended then&#151;it may still do so&#151;on what I believe 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_471"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 471</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is called a constant velocity joint, made by Hardy Spicer. It never let
us down. So, these many years later, may I take this opportunity to
thank the noble Lord and his colleagues at Hardy Spicer for having
helped me get safely back to the UK. I am sure I speak for all Members
of the House when I say how much we look forward to hearing from him
again.</p><p><a name="06101348000048"></a>I turn to the Bill and
thank the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, for introducing it
today. The statistics given of assaults on NHS staff, ambulance workers
and fire fighters, as well as on the police, make truly horrific
reading. It beggars belief that there are people in this country who
set out to injure and obstruct those who are engaged in emergency work
and the saving of life. Therefore, we on these Benches support the
approach behind the Bill. We wish it well and do not intend to table
any amendments.</p><p><a name="06101348000049"></a>But there are
issues, some of which have been raised by noble Lords, on which
clarification from the noble Lord and the Government would be useful to
the House and to the country. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, will forgive me if, in the spirit of gentle inquiry, I
probe a little about his and, indeed, the Government&#146;s thinking.
I had the opportunity to raise with him on the telephone some of the
points that I wish to raise today. In large measure, this arises
because the Bill was so very extensively amended during its passage
through the other place. Some of its original objectives seem to have
been dropped and other aspects broadened. This is reflected in the fact
that the Title of the Bill is not the same as it was at the outset of
its passage through
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06101348000050"></a>First, am I right
that the Bill is now only concerned with &#147;obstruction&#148; or
&#147;hindering&#148; of emergency workers and not
&#147;assault&#148; on them? I accept, as someone said in the other
place, that half a Bill is better than no Bill at all, but the most
horrific of the incidents about which I and, no doubt, other noble
Lords have been briefed&#151;and truly appalling they are&#151;are
concerned not with the less serious issue of obstruction but with the
much more serious one of often cold-blooded, premeditated assaults on
emergency workers. The briefing referred to by the noble Lords, Lord
Anderson and Lord Addington, from the Fire Brigades Union makes
sobering reading.</p><p><a name="06101348000051"></a>I understand
that this narrowing came about because of negotiations between Mr Alan
Williams, the MP for Swansea West and sponsor of the Bill in the other
place, and the Home Office. Is this narrowing because the Government
believe that there really are adequate existing powers to deal with the
problem of assaults on emergency workers? If that is the case and it is
the Government&#146;s position, then how come we have reached the
truly grim position we find ourselves in today? Is it only down to lack
of will and
enforcement?</p><p><a name="06101348000052"></a>Secondly, does it
mean that, so far as assaults on emergency workers are concerned, there
are to be first, second and third levels of protection? At the first
level are the police&#151;protected, as I understand it, by Section
59 of the Police Act 1996; at the second 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>level are the groups listed in Clause 1(2)(a) to (f) of the
Bill&#151;presumably the courts will be inclined to take more
seriously assaults on such people; and, at the third level are all
those who undertake emergency functions but are not so listed. Some
clarification of these categories would be helpful to the
House.</p><p><a name="06101348000053"></a>As a subset of this, it
would be helpful to have a little further explanation of what
protection against obstruction, if any, the Bill will provide to those
emergency workers who are not listed. There has been reference to St
John&#146;s Ambulance but there are other individual
groups&#151;such as social workers engaged in sectioning people,
which can be quite controversial&#151;and it would be useful to know
if such people will have any protection under the provisions of this
legislation.</p><p><a name="06101348000054"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, referred in this regard to the role of the Sentencing
Guidelines Council. I hope we will have further official comment on
this from the Minister. In Committee, Fiona Mactaggart, the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Home Office,
said:</p><ul><a name="06101348000332"></a>&#147;The council gives
us a tool to be used in any area where an aggravated factor exists in
respect of a particular offence. Given that we have such a tool, it is
wrong not to use it for the whole range of aggravating factors,
including one already acknowledged in an initial guideline involving
people who are serving the public. The sentencing guidelines
formulation on violent crime that is due to be made available shortly
will deal with assault, and I hope that it will not only deal clearly
with someone who is serving the public, but specifically highlight
emergency workers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons
Standing Committee C, 26/4/06; col.
7.]</ul><a name="06101348000321"></a>That was on the 26 April;
it is now 13 October. As the Minister in the other place said the
guideline would be made available shortly, I hope that we will have
some further news on that.
<p><a name="06101348000055"></a>Perhaps I may now turn briefly to the
issue of &#147;specificity&#148;. As the Minister has heard me say
at the outset of many of the debates we have had, I am not a lawyer.
But during the Committee stages of other Bills when Members of the
House attempt to get more precision and clarity into legislation, we
are often warned that our efforts may have the reverse effect of that
which we intend. If a Bill becomes too specific, too precise, the
courts lose the ability to consider some cases as they fall just
outside these more precise definitions. The House would welcome a
reassurance that this pretty specific and precise piece of legislation
will avoid this particular elephant
trap.</p><p><a name="06101348000056"></a>I have another specific
question. Here I follow the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Morris
of Handsworth. Of course I understand the appalling nature of these
crimes and we agree that we must act early and make every effort to
stamp them out. But are the Government really convinced that there are
not adequate powers in existing statutes to deal with the obstruction
or hindering of emergency workers? At first glance to a non-lawyer,
given the panoply of statute law available, it seems surprising that
there are not. If the problem is one of enforcement, passing the Bill
will have no effect&#151;in fact, rather the reverse, since every law
disregarded increases, at least at the margin, public mistrust and
disregard of the law as whole.</p>



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_473"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101348000057"></a>I have one final teasing question for the
Minister. His party&#146;s manifesto for the 2005 general election
promised that,</p><ul><a name="06101348000343"></a>&#147;we
will introducer tougher sentences...for those convicted of
assaulting workers serving the
public&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000322"></a>Is this it?
Do the Government now believe that they have fulfilled their manifesto
promise? If so, it is a surely unusual route to fulfil a manifesto
commitment through a Private Member&#146;s Bill. If they have not
fulfilled it, when we can we expect the necessary legislation, and what
form is it expected to
take?<p><a name="06101348000058"></a>No one reading the
statistics can fail to be moved by the level, apparently increasing
year by year, of attacks on emergency workers. Of course we support the
purpose behind the Bill and we wish it a swift progress to the statute
book. But the shedding of a little light on the detail would, I
believe, be welcomed by the House and the
country.</p><h5><a name="06101348000351"></a>11.52

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I, too, add my
thanks to my noble friend Lord Anderson for sponsoring this important
Bill which comes to us in good order from another place after some
penetrating and, I am pleased to say, highly constructive debate. Like
other noble Lords, I add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord
Morris of Handsworth on his delicately phrased and uncontroversial
maiden speech. For many years, I have been an admirer from afar of my
noble friend for his work as a trade union leader and as a powerful
advocate for the rights of workers. It is with some humility that I
stand at the Dispatch Box and welcome him to our debates. I am sure he
will make many telling contributions, not least to advance and defend
the interests of those who work for us and provide important and
valuable public services. I am sure that, along with all Members of
your Lordships' House, we on the government Benches will listen very
carefully to the important and wise words of my noble friend in our
deliberations.</p><p><a name="06101348000060"></a>We all agree
that any violent or obstructive behaviour directed against workers
responding to emergency situations is unacceptable. Emergency workers
are putting themselves in the front line in dangerous situations for
the sake of their communities, and they should not face additional and
avoidable dangers. It is unacceptable, whether those dangers are
brought about by malice or by those who are thoughtless and have not
considered the consequences of what they are embarking on.</p><p><a name="06101348000061"></a>I repeat the assurances that the
Government have already given. We are committed to ensuring that
emergency workers can go about their business without being impeded,
obstructed or subjected to violence or abuse. We now have a Bill that
is very clear and simple. It will be easy to understand, and easy for
the courts, the police and prosecutors to use, and we are proud to
support it.</p><p><a name="06101348000062"></a>The Bill will be a
significant part of the legal protection for all emergency workers. It
deals with deliberate acts of obstruction against those responding to
blue-light emergencies. It will also 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_474"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide a good basis and a bedrock for further work. As part of the
respect agenda, we are committed to ensuring that people and
communities treat those who help them with the respect they fully
deserve. This Bill will be an important addition to that agenda.
</p><p><a name="06101348000063"></a>The Bill will target those who
obstruct emergency workers responding to emergency and life-threatening
situations. Those are situations where there is an immediate and real
risk of serious injury, or worse, and there may be only a few minutes
to respond to that situation. In those circumstances, impeding or
obstructing workers becomes particularly dangerous. Obstruction not
only puts at risk the emergency workers but also risks the lives and
safety of the public they serve.</p><p><a name="06101348000064"></a>There is no offence of obstruction at the
moment for ambulance workers or coastguards, so this will be new for
them. The Bill will also introduce a clearer and simplified obstruction
offence for firefighters and increase the available maximum fine from
&#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000.</p><p><a name="06101348000065"></a>The Bill rightly concentrates on services
that may be involved in responding to emergency situations, where
urgency is imperative. Those are the situations where we need to deal
with obstruction in particular. The police, ambulance, and fire and
rescue services may be involved in emergencies, and so may the
coastguards and lifeboat crews. There may be others.</p><p><a name="06101348000066"></a>The police already have their own
obstruction offence, and we do not need to duplicate it here. But the
Bill includes all the other emergency workers I have just mentioned. It
includes volunteers and those working under contract providing an
ambulance service for the Health Service, including air ambulances. It
also includes all fire and rescue services, whether they are working
for local authorities, at airports, as members of the forces or for
private companies.</p><p><a name="06101348000067"></a>The Bill also
includes those who are transporting blood, organs or emergency
equipment working on behalf of an NHS body and responding to emergency
situations. Those carrying blood, organs and medical equipment to an
emergency are in a similar position to the emergency services. Any
delay could be dangerous. So I am pleased that, for the sake of
clarity, such emergency workers have been included in the
offence.</p><p><a name="06101348000068"></a>The Bill deals with
obstruction, so we need to confine the categories of worker that it
covers to those dealing with urgent cases, where delay and obstruction
can have serious consequences. The Bill is particularly important for
workers who may be isolated and not able to call on colleagues for
support or ask for someone to take over if they are obstructed or
delayed&#151;in other words, blue-light workers. Other workers may,
of course, face threats and violence, but if there is violence or a
genuine threat of violence, the offender will be committing an offence
of assault in any event and can be dealt with by the police and the
courts. We do not want to complicate the Bill unnecessarily by adding
categories of workers when the Bill will add nothing to their
protection.</p><p><a name="06101348000069"></a>In previous debates,
and earlier today, the question of mountain rescue teams and those
involved in 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_475"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rescues in remote areas has been raised. They would certainly come under
the category of &#147;emergency workers&#148;. But we have not
heard of any case where a mountain rescue worker has been obstructed or
impeded, so I am not sure there is a problem which we would solve by
adding them to the list of emergency workers. If we found that there
was a problem, we would be happy to consider adding mountain rescue
teams and others to the list by order. We have that flexibility built
in.</p><p><a name="06101348000070"></a>At the moment, I do not
think the case has been made for including other categories of
emergency worker in the offence of obstruction. But we should remember
that if we want to add categories of worker, we can do so in the
future. Parliament will have a chance to consider any proposed
additions or modifications to the list. This is an important clause. It
will mean that not only can we add new categories of emergency worker
but we can quickly update the categories if required. We may need to
make a change because one of the services currently covered has changed
its name or has been reorganised, for example. We should be able to
achieve that reasonably
easily.</p><p><a name="06101348000071"></a>I know that many people
have been keen to see an offence of assaulting an emergency worker,
similar to the one that exists in Scotland. It has been referred to
extensively in our debate by my noble friend Lord Morris, by my noble
friend Lord Anderson in proposing the measure, and by the noble Lord,
Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts.</p><p><a name="06101348000072"></a>The criminal law and administrative
arrangements in Scotland are very different. For example, it has no
Sentencing Guidelines Council to give statutory guidance on the
seriousness with which such offences should be viewed. I will return to
the role of the Sentencing Guidelines Council later. For England and
Wales, a separate offence of assault would be redundant and would only
complicate the statute book unnecessarily. It would not give any
additional protection for emergency
workers.</p><p><a name="06101348000073"></a>There are already
comprehensive measures under the current law for dealing with attacks
and violence in a wide range of circumstances. Offences range from
common assault, through actual bodily harm, where the injuries are more
than superficial, to grievous bodily harm, which can be very serious
indeed. There is protection from harassment and, of course, offences of
criminal damage where essential equipment is at stake. Penalties range
from a maximum of six months&#146; imprisonment or a fine of up to
&#163;5,000 for common assault to a maximum of life imprisonment for
grievous bodily harm with intent. That is why the current Bill
concentrates rightly on
obstruction.</p><p><a name="06101348000074"></a>There is a specific
offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. It
is common sense that other emergency workers should enjoy the same
legal protection as police officers when they are in the same position.
That is the case particularly when firefighters, ambulance workers and
the police might be attending the same incident and working side by
side. Although the police are dealt with in a separate offence, we
should remember that assault on 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_476"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a police officer carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison. This
is the same as the maximum penalty for common assault, so there is
indeed the same legal protection for everyone, as there should be.
</p><p><a name="06101348000075"></a>We have no evidence to suggest
that a specific offence of assaulting an emergency worker would
encourage the courts to give tougher sentences. Indeed, a specific
offence of assault might be more difficult to prove than the more
general offence of common assault, because you have to prove the extra
elements of the offence. If you had a specific offence of assaulting an
emergency worker, for instance, you would have to prove not only that
the accused committed an assault but that the assault was against an
emergency worker, the worker was responding to an emergency and the
offender knew that the person was an emergency worker. All those extra
elements would have to kick in and apply. For common assault, you need
only to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender committed the
assault. That makes the general offence easier for the courts and the
prosecutors to deal
with.</p><p><a name="06101348000076"></a>Emergency workers are
important to us all. If there were a specific offence of assault for
them, a large number of at-risk groups might demand the extra
protection that they thought a specific offence would offer. Public
sector workers such as teachers or transport workers, for example,
might ask for a specific offence. Different assault offences for
different groups of people and different circumstances would become a
potential recipe for confusion and would not give those groups more
protection than they currently have under the law. We would not support
that.</p><p><a name="06101348000077"></a>The real issue is not
whether we need a new offence covering assault; it is to ensure
appropriate sentencing for offences where emergency workers are
involved. Sentencing must reflect the seriousness of an assault on an
emergency worker. That is why the role of the Sentencing Guidelines
Council is so important.</p><p><a name="06101348000078"></a>Robust
guidelines are already issued by the council and more are under
consultation. These guidelines make two things clear: first, that it is
an aggravating factor in any offence if the victim is serving the
public; and, secondly, that the courts must take into account the harm
or potential harm that the offence might do. We are all clear that any
offence against an emergency worker has the potential for widespread
and significant harm. The courts must take those aggravating factors
into account.</p><p><a name="06101348000079"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, made it clear that this Bill should not be seen in
isolation. There is a huge programme of work to tackle violence,
disorder and disrespect, and the Bill will complement it. In
particular, it will complement the Government&#146;s respect agenda,
which addresses the problem of disrespect in our society and its
destructive and corrosive consequences. The Respect Action Plan was
published in January. It set out the Government&#146;s goals and
reiterated that we need to tackle anti-social behaviour by addressing
disrespect in every walk of life. This includes disrespect towards
emergency workers, who are, above all, serving their
communities.</p>



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_477"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101348000080"></a>Offences against emergency workers are
often committed by young people. The respect plan makes clear the
critical role of schools and parents in tackling disrespectful
behaviour by children. We also want to ensure that young people are
active and learn how to make a positive impact as individuals in our
society, so we tackle this behaviour before it escalates to the level
where it needs to be dealt with by the criminal
law.</p><p><a name="06101348000081"></a>The National Health Service
and fire service are tackling the root causes of disorder, disrespect
and violence against their employees. They are working closely with the
police to ensure that even low-level violence is treated seriously if
it is against NHS workers and that offences are prosecuted. Rigorous
enforcement of the current law is a good deterrent. It also makes staff
feel safer and more confident in the conduct of their job.</p><p><a name="06101348000082"></a>Recent statistics released by the
National Health Service show that assaults on National Health Service
staff in acute hospitals are down. That is in direct relation to the
strenuous efforts that have been made to ensure that assaults on NHS
staff are properly dealt with and properly prosecuted. Similarly,
assaults on ambulance workers have been significantly reduced. So this
approach is beginning to bear fruit; it is
working.</p><p><a name="06101348000083"></a>The fire and rescue
services have also introduced measures to deal with attacks on
firefighters. The Chief Fire Officers' Association has set up a
taskand finish group to look at all matters relating to
assaults on firefighters with a view to making recommendations and
producing best practice. I understand that this report is due to be
made available to the service soon. So there is a lot that is being
undertaken, and there is a lot more that wecan
do.</p><p><a name="06101348000084"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords
for bringing the Bill to us. Increasing dangers are faced by emergency
workers and the Bill will fill a gap which helps us to tackle them. We
need to make sure that, in addition to this change, we make the best
use of the other mechanisms and powers available to us to tackle the
dangers as part of what I have identified as a wider programme. In
particular, we need to allow the Sentencing Guidelines Council to do
the job of ensuring consistency across sentencing, and we should not
underestimate the value of the non-legislative measures to which I have
made reference. The shortcomings that we have identified in the system
are shortcomings in enforcement, not shortcomings in the law. Dealing
with such shortcomings is not as simple as making changes in the law,
but I have outlined ways in which we are working with others to make it
easier to tackle the sort of behaviour which makes emergencies worse
than they need to be. That is why we are anxious to achieve practical
benefits through this approach. The creation of the new offence of
obstruction will be an important and valuable step, but it is not the
whole story, as we have heard in this debate&#151;it is an anchor for
the other measures that I have outlined.</p>

raised during the debate. I shall try to respond to as many of them as
I can in the time that I have. I have made reference already to the
sentencing guidelines. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, asked me when
they might be produced. Overarching principles have already been issued
by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. These specifically include as a
factor to be regarded as causing particularly serious harm,</p><ul><a name="06101348000344"></a>&#147;offences committed against
those working in the public sector or providing a service to the
public&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000323"></a>The council
is considering further, specific guidelines for offences of violence,
which are likely to have similar
criteria.<p><a name="06101348000086"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Wedderburn, asked whether the Government were committed to consulting
on mandatory minimum sentences for assaults on public workers as well.
I think that I have already dealt with this question. We will
concentrate greatly on advice that is given to us, particularly from
the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the Sentencing Advisory Panel,
which has also consulted on sentencing for assaults and other violent
offences, including issues such as the use of weapons and victims who
servethe public. It is also considering the results of the
consultation and will make a recommendation to the Sentencing
Guidelines Council for appropriate
guidelines.</p><p><a name="06101348000087"></a>It may be worth
drawing to the attention of your Lordships' House that the Government
have tabled changes to the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which will be
debated on Monday. We are increasing the maximum sentence for
possession of a bladed instrument from two to four years&#151;so
clearly we see these issues as very serious
indeed.</p><p><a name="06101348000088"></a><a name="spnew_10"></a><b><a name="06101348000376"></a>Lord

Mactaggart said in the other place on 8 April. We do not seem to have
made much progress if we are just repeating those words and have not
had anything definitive. The way the Minister spoke in the other place

notes coming into the Chamber, I spotted the point that the noble Lord

we pursue vigorously so that we get some better, more definitive
answers in the course of our further
deliberations.</p><p><a name="06101348000090"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Wedderburn, in his usual forensic way, made reference to employees
and servants of the Crown and contractors. I shall consider very
carefully the point that the noble Lord raised, but I am not sure that
there is in fact a gap with regard to the provision of fire and rescue
services. Clause 1(2)(a) and (b) covers employees of 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_479"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the fire and rescue authorities, employees of other bodies and Crown
servants whose duties cover extinguishing fires. So I am not convinced
that there are independent contractors carrying out those services.
However, I shall look into the issue further. Of course, the
order-making power in Clause 5 could be used to plug any gap that might
exist. I hope that that gives the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, some
comfort. I shall certainly carry out some further
inquiries.</p><p><a name="06101348000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Morris, pointed out that a large number of appropriate offences are
already in existence to deal with violence, threats of violence and
damage. Assaults on public service workers are taken seriously by the
prosecuting authorities and we will work with the Crown Prosecution
Service to ensure cases of assault or obstruction of emergency workers
are rigorously pursued. It is certainly worth drawing the attention of
noble Lords to the British Crime Survey, which provides some valuable
data on threats of violence and physical assaults on workers. In
particular, it provides more information on different categories of
public service workers who are the victims of assaults. I have some
data here that I am more than happy to share with the noble Lord
outside the Chamber. It would be rather complex to go through them in
the debate today.</p><p><a name="06101348000092"></a>It may be
worth saying, too, that courts take assaults on police officers very
seriously. My study of crime statistics says that some 5,700
convictions were achieved in the last year for which I have figures for
assaults against police officers. It is right that other service
workers enjoy similar protection, which is why the Government are
inclined to be as persistent as they are on this issue. We take it very
seriously indeed.</p><p><a name="06101348000093"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Morris, raised the issue of burdens of proof. I assure him
that the offence does not raise the burden of proof, which is as always
on the prosecution. The standard is the normal standard&#151;beyond
reasonable doubt. One reason why the Bill does not cover assault is to
avoid making assault more difficult to prove, as I said in my opening
comments. Common assault will be available without proof that the
victim is an emergency worker and is responding to emergency
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101348000094"></a>I think that I
have covered the main points raised in my concluding comments and my
general commentary on the Bill. It goes without saying that we want to
see the Bill on the statute book. We are conscious of the tightness of
the parliamentary timetable at this time of year. I am sure that, given
the good will that the Bill has received from all quarters in your
Lordships' House today, it will find its way on to the statute
book.</p><p><a name="06101348000095"></a><a name="spnew_12"></a><b><a name="06101348000378"></a>Lord

members, who I know would all wish me to thank
them.</p><p><a name="06101348000105"></a>On the publication of this
report there was a gratifying amount of public interest, which is
perhaps not surprising because it was a topical issue in a summer of
regional hosepipe bans, warnings in certain areas of water shortages
and interest as always in water leakage rates and the profits of water
companies, as well as a concern about house building proposals in water
shortage areas. All that helped to give the report some media
exposure&#151;rather more, perhaps, than one normally expects for a
Select Committee report.</p><p><a name="06101348000106"></a>For
those who have read the 150 pages of the report, however&#151;and the
immediate response from the media meant that they would not have had an
opportunity to do so&#151;it will be evident that instant solutions,
as favoured in at least some parts of the media, are unrealistic. Many
people immediately jumped to the conclusion that a national water grid
may be the solution to all our problems, or desalination plants. They
look for unrealistic levels of reduction of water leakage rates, and
there is always a cry for universal water metering. All those aspects
of the topic may well be relevant in certain areas, but they are not by
themselves quick fixes.</p><p><a name="06101348000107"></a>The
realistic timescale for water resource development is up to 25 years.
We saw that as we travelled around and looked at water transfer schemes
and some of the planning requirements to get these schemes and the
required infrastructure into place. Our planning system in this
country, perhaps rightly, is drawn out and
protracted&#151;convoluted, some would say&#151;so that when you
are building a water transfer scheme, or perhaps even a water treatment
plant or a new reservoir, the process will take a long time and will
require an awful lot of consultation. The period I mentioned of 25
years is perfectly realistic.</p><p><a name="06101348000108"></a>The problem is that 25 years does not
match the reality of regional planning strategies. You cannot expect a
Government to be able to put all their plans in place and stick to them
for 25 years. That is just not the way Governments work. Then there is
the further complication of predicting the nature and impact of
European Union legislation. What has already come our
way&#151;including the habitats directive, the water framework
directive and the priority substance directive, to name just
three&#151;might well impact to a certain degree, or heavily, on
water management regulation. In other words, the water companies have
to respond to these legislative changes.</p><p><a name="06101348000109"></a>The water companies are now required by
Ofwat, I think rightly, to produce water resource plans showing how
each company plans to maintain security of supply over the next 25
years. That is much to be encouraged, but inevitably this long-term
planning is made more problematic if the assumptions on which they are
operating change, and indeed if there is inadequate transparency and
consultation, or if the criteria operated by the regulatory authorities
for funding, for example, are not fully understood or spelt out. The
water 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_482"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>companies have a grievance that in many ways the lack of transparency in
inclusiveness and consultation has been inadequate.</p><p><a name="06101348000110"></a>In many respects the problems were much
worse before the privatisation of water in 1989, and thatwas
caused by chronic underinvestment in capital expenditure. By the 1980s,
due to successive Governments putting a cap on public expenditure,
investment had fallen to between a quarter and a half of what it had
been only 10 years before. Not surprisingly, despite the recent much
increased investment under the new regime, we find ourselves trying to
catch up. The position is complicated, of course, by droughts, which
appear to be becoming more common&#151;perhaps that is an aspect of
climate change, though that is not clear&#151;and by this lack of
investment.</p><p><a name="06101348000111"></a>Our report returns
time and again to what we see as a lack of transparency and openness
and of sharing agreed methodology for forecasting demand. There has
been a failure, I suspect, of both the Government and the regulators to
work successfully together in forecasting water demand and making clear
the optimal water policies, as well as a failure to follow best
practice in sharing their developing regional water strategies with the
water industry.</p><p><a name="06101348000112"></a>Anyone who has
read Appendix 4 of our report&#151;the comments of Professor McDonald
on the Government&#146;s response to the Barker review of housing
supply&#151;or indeed the Government&#146;s response to our report,
and the paragraphs that specifically refer to these issues, will
recognise that, whatever you make of the various cases that we put
forward and that Professor McDonald tries to elaborate, the Government
response is opaque, to say the least. It is not at all clear what
methodology the Government have adopted in trying to determine the
water requirements to meet the increased targets for housing supply.
The very fact that we felt it was clear that the Minister himself, when
he gave evidence, had not fully grasped the implications of these
figures demonstrates that whatever we have here, we have not got
inclusiveness, transparency and openness.</p><p><a name="06101348000113"></a>I was disappointed, therefore, with the
Government&#146;s response to our recommendations in paragraphs 428
to 430. On this occasion, frankly, it would have been more honest for
the Government to acknowledge that the consultation process, as I have
already said, will be complicated due to the different timescales
involved, and to put their hands up and say, &#147;Look, this has not
been an exercise in best practice in consultation&#148;. Having made
that point, however, I recognise that the Government are making belated
attempts to improve the sharing of information and their projections,
and there has been some real progress over the past 18 months to two
years.</p><p><a name="06101348000114"></a>The revised housing
growth plans have still not adequately been factored into the water
companies&#146; long-term plans, though. I am talking here only of
those areas with increased housing requirements, which happen also to
be the drier areas. There is much to do to catch up, and the
Environment Agency, 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_483"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ofwat, the Government and the water companies all have to engage in this
long-term planning with some degree of urgency.</p><p><a name="06101348000115"></a>On pages 26 to 28 we refer to the
&#147;twin-track&#148; approach. The term
&#147;twin-track&#148; should be fairly obvious&#151;you try to
reconcile resource development with demand management. The problem is
that there are very different interpretations of what that means in
practice. We give the Government&#146;s interpretation: their
twin-track approach for water supply requires demand management
options, such as fostering behavioural change, use of new technologies
and controlling leakage, to be fully deployed before new supply side
measures are adopted. That is not twin-track&#151;it is
consecutive&#151;and that is the problem. You can understand the
Environment Agency&#151;whose job it is, after all, to protect the
environment&#151;wanting to be satisfied, before you put in new
reservoirs or new infrastructure, that all other options have been
exhausted. You go through this great process and end up finding that
you are way behind the curve in terms of time management because of
this approach, which is instinctive in Government, that &#147;we
won&#146;t allow anything until we are quite sure that every other
alternative has been explored&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101348000116"></a>The record of supply management in recent
years, with the winter drought and the added complication of climate
change, has been inadequate. We are probably now seeing the evidence of
the drought orders and the hosepipe bans. It may be only a one-in-30
event, but nevertheless I think the country instinctively feels that we
have been inadequate in planning our water resource
development.</p><p><a name="06101348000117"></a>We draw attention
to the fact that as you increase your infrastructure, and indeed the
indebtedness of the companies, the cost of water goes up; that is
inevitable. It is also inevitable that if these problems are to be
addressed, the cost of water will continue to go up. That raises the
problem of affordability, which is an increasingly serious issue for
low-income households. If we move to greater acceptance of metering,
which I suggest is desirable in principle, that will increase the bills
for larger households still further.</p><p><a name="06101348000118"></a>As we set out in the report, there are
regulations for vulnerable groups, but frankly they are not working.
They are not adequately assisting low-income families. We give the
figure of 9,217 successful applicants throughout England and Wales
throughout 2004-05. That clearly demonstrates what we were advised by
the Consumer Council for Water and others: that the system is just too
bureaucratic and opaque, and it is not working. Again, the Government
response was inadequate in this respect. I simply say that if this
system is not working, and we clearly do not want too complicated a
scheme, let us just ask someone to go back and rethink the whole
exercise.</p><p><a name="06101348000119"></a>The other issue with
paying bills is not those who cannot afford, but those who will not. We
draw attention to the quite remarkable figures of outstanding debt.
South East Water, for example, gave us a figure of &#163;15 million
at the end of the 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_484"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 484</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>financial year on a turnover of &#163;100 million. A lot of those
people have a good credit rating, but since the Water Industry Act
1999, the Government&#151;for all the right, but I suspect rather
misguided, intentions&#151;made it illegal to disconnect for health
and safety reasons. In Australia we saw a rather more robust approach
to these &#147;won&#146;t payers&#148; comprising partial
disconnection and a tamper-proof device. I again earnestly ask the
Government to help the water industry and, indeed other consumers, who
pay surcharges to meet the costs of the non-payers, to reconsider the
use of tamper-proof
devices.</p><p><a name="06101348000120"></a>Water meters are
clearly helpful in making people understand and &#147;buy
into&#148; the issues involved in water consumption. If you cannot
see your meter and do not know what your consumption is, it is very
difficult to engage adequately in that process. As we spell out in our
report, smart meters and new more detailed bills systems will help
people in that regard. I was slightly surprised by Ofwat&#146;s
rather negative response that smart meters could be effective only if
meters were read more frequently than is currently the case. I am not
convinced about that. But however long it will take to introduce these
measures&#151;it will not happen overnight&#151;we must all agree
that the more information you can give the consumer, the more helpful
it will be. We should urge that to be undertaken. Perhaps remote
reading will be introduced
soon.</p><p><a name="06101348000121"></a>All debate about water
comes back quickly to leakages. Understandably, the average member of
the public is outraged at seeing water leaking out of water company
pipes. They are no so outraged at their own leakages occurring between
the meter and the house, but when they see water pouring down the road
they question how on earth they can take seriously requests to use
water responsibly. However, if you look at the figures, you will see
that some water companies have respectable records on leaks. In some
areas leakage rates have improved to an acceptable level, but not in
all. Thank goodness that Ofwat has got much tougher with two or three
of the worst offenders. However, one of the concepts that the public do
not understand is that of the economiclevel of leakage. I am
delighted that the Minister,Mr Pearson, has now asked Ofwat to
rethink the matter. Ofwat says that an economic level of leakage
includes other areas of sustainable consumption, but that is not the
perception. The Minister is absolutely right to say that this can be
made much simpler. People would then understand how leakage
ratesare set.</p><p><a name="06101348000122"></a>I give
another example of why you must have inclusiveness and transparency. We
suggested in the report that regional boards should be set up. After
all, they will be required under the water framework directive, which
stipulates water catchment management plans, which will involve, among
others, land managers and farmers. You need to engage people at all
levels of debate. Leakage or, indeed, investment in infrastructure are
other examples of that. Perhaps the idea of statutory regional boards,
which we saw as a consultation exercise between the Environment Agency,
Ofwat, the Government, consumers and others, including the Consumer 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_485"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 485</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council for Water, was seen as yet another layer of bureaucracy. That is
certainly not what we intend. All we want to do is to make it
compulsory for everyone to be consulted and not in any way to take away
Ofwat or the Environment Agency&#146;s statutory responsibilities. I
say again that we have a lot more to learn about what we mean by
transparency and consultation in terms of sustainable development. It
is part of the formula which I am not sure is entirely
understood.</p><p><a name="06101348000123"></a>I have spoken for
too long. I should have liked to say a little more about the national
grid, desalination and the recycling of storm water. As regards the
recycling of storm water, we heard much from the Government about the
Northstone development on Ministry of Defence land. That initiative is
likely to reduce consumption by 50 per cent. However, it is not
mentioned in the Government&#146;s response. I hope that the Minister
will tell us whether that is still on target. I should be interested
also to hear the Minister comment on the priority substances directive,
which could impose heavy costs on the water industry. That is the fault
not of the European Commission but of the European Parliament, which
tried to prove its green credentials. Has that been firmly kicked into
touch? I believe that Defra is doing a good job on that, but I should
like the Minister to respond to that
point.</p><p><a name="06101348000124"></a>I hope that other members
of the committee will fill the gaps in my speech. I have rushed through
and not perhaps done adequate service to some parts of the report.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to commend it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101348000125"></a>Moved, That this House

the supply of water, dealing with used water, dangers associated with
water and what to do about those matters, including all the
governmental and public dimensions of these issues. While the document
urges changes in personal habits at, for example, paragraph 8.36, it
does not come out with a strong statement, which we might begin
with&#151;that, currently, use of clean water is profligate. Probably
less than 5 per cent of the water that we use is needed for drinking.
The rest is used for many other purposes, which do not require such
clean water. I recall that when the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was a
Minister he talked about sharing a bath with a
friend.</p><p><a name="06101348000128"></a><a name="spnew_17"></a><b><a name="_spnew10"></a><a name="06101348000383"></a>Lord

Hunt of Chesterton:</b> My Lords, it was of the noble
Lord&#146;s vintage, was it not? Nevertheless, our use of water in
the UK is still less than that in the United States and I believe that
it is less than it was in ancient Rome. However, the problem with
ancient Rome was that they did not have any taps. It is important that
when we consider this policy, and as we want to encourage
responsibility for the matter to be taken at local and national level,
we should think about international figures. I am disappointed that we
do not have them here. Perhaps the Government could help us in that
respect, at least with regard to the European
dimension.</p><p><a name="06101348000130"></a>The document
discusses the use of grey water and new schemes to push that through,
which are very important. However, it is not clear who will be
responsible for those. I believe that in a British way, as it were, a
series of agencies and organisations will be involved, some of which
will be stimulated by individual bodies. I endorse the important
developments at BedZED, a local housing scheme referred to in the
report. Some local authorities have also developed extraordinary
innovations in the use of water and water technology. Woking comes to
mind as a city that realised the importance of the economical use of
water connected to energy. It is also interesting to note that a number
of United States companies are working with local authorities and local
water boards in Britain. I heard at a seminar in the United States that
those companies find it a lot easier to deal with UK bureaucracy than
United States bureaucracy. We should congratulate ourselves on
that.</p><p><a name="06101348000131"></a>The other important way in
which we shall get new developments and reduce use of water is through
Government. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, referred to the Ministry of
Defence&#146;s innovation. It has now ceased to be socialism but has
apparently become standard policy that the Government should introduce
innovation through their procurement policy. Given the enormous
government schemes for hospitals, prisons, barracks and housing, all
these new and much more efficient methods should not only be introduced
but enable British industry to become world standard with regard to
such developments.</p><p><a name="06101348000132"></a>The report
emphasises the need to have more water resources as well as protecting
the environment and the issue of climate change. As someone who studies
that matter, I confirm that the report&#146;s modelling predictions
on the rise in global and regional temperature and temperature changes
between day and night are reasonably accurate. The historical record is
accurate. However, precipitation modelling is extremely difficult. One
of the reasons for that concerns gradients of pressure. It is always
more difficult to predict a gradient than an absolute value. In the
summer the UK has continental air, but in the winter we have
south-westerly air streams. The waters around the UK are getting
warmer, which might cause a slight increase in rainfall. On the other
hand, the dryer continent will reduce
that.</p><p><a name="06101348000133"></a>Another feature
highlighted by the report is that when the precipitation comes in such
situations, 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_487"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which might be associated with dust in the atmosphere, we may experience
much stronger bursts of rain. That is extremely difficult to deal with
in terms of flooding, agricultural run-off and so on. The conclusion is
that there is a level of uncertainty regarding the precipitation
aspects of climate change. Therefore, we need risk analysis by all
organisations that deal with the various aspects that affect them; we
need continual monitoring and continual public information.</p><p><a name="06101348000134"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the
variation of rainfall in the UK is astonishing. In Devon, which I know
well, it is 24 inches a year on the coast; three miles inland it is 44
inches and a further three miles in the figure is 77 inches. Such areas
will experience great variations with climate change. It is important
to encourage organisations, people, farmers, monks and everyone who
measures rainfall to continue to do that and inform us so that we can
observe the patterns.</p><p><a name="06101348000135"></a>The
committee concluded that there was no universal panacea for
transporting water from one area of the UK to another, despite the
media interest, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, mentioned, but we
need to keep that under review. Maybe our canals and rivers need to be
used more effectively in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06101348000136"></a>The report pointed out
that we need a holistic approach to water. That is important and is
also the view of the Environment Agency. We need to consider not only
water resources, but the danger of flooding and rising sea levels. We
also have to keep in mind that one of the biggest dangers to London
would be if the large reservoirs at Heathrow were put at risk. That
point was made by experts who were concerned about water in
London&#151;and perhaps I may advertise a book from the House of
Lords Library, <I>London&#146;s Environment</I>, in which
London&#146;s water system is covered effectively.</p><p><a name="06101348000137"></a>Coastal planning, urban planning and the
ecology of our countryside is intimately connected to our water
resources, the environment, leisure activities and the growth of such
areas. One complex issue pointed out by the report is that there is no
democratic body that can handle such matters. The report stresses that,
because the future position will be unlike the past, there must be an
important democratic dimension to those discussions. We probably do not
need new bodies, but we need the bodies that are dealing with such
issues to be open and informative about what is going on. I endorse the
fact that schools and other community bodies need to be involved.
Schoolchildren need to learn much more about how to use water and our
profligate use of
water.</p><p><a name="06101348000138"></a>Finally, particularly as
this is a Science and Technology Committee report, I endorse the
comments that research is essential, both for policy and for designing
water systems&#151;especially holistic systems in which the
universities involved in such research, supported by the Natural
Environment Research Council and the Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology&#146;s laboratories, play an important role. They are
undertaking complex research and advising Government and perhaps it
should be emphasised that those bodies need to have a public
role.</p>

NERC looks carefully at the proposed efficiency measures, focusing CEH

important also to look at our European colleagues. I often go as a
visiting professor to the Netherlands, where more work is being done
than anywhere else in Europe by computer simulation, and where
demonstrations of excellent systems show local government how flooding
and other water-resource issues are changing. I very much endorse this
report. I hope that the Government will take it seriously and, most
importantly, find the funds in Defra&#146;s research and applications
budgets to take these issues
forward.</p><h5><a name="06101348000354"></a>12.45

Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the
committee on its report and the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, on his
introduction, which covered many facets of water resources. The House
will not be surprised if I approach this matter from the perspective of
being a Member hailing from and who lives in Wales. I am anxious to
contribute because water plays a great part in my life&#151;in the
streams and rivers, which seem to flow like life itself.</p><p><a name="06101348000142"></a>There are many reservoirs, too, not far
from where I live. They have resulted in loss of communities, people
and farmhouses&#151;even Shelley&#146;s house was drowned. Massive
reservoirs were constructed in the Elan valley, Tryweryn&#151;in
spite of great opposition&#151;and Lake Vyrnwy. There were victories
also&#151;the Senni valley was not dammed and drowned, although
reservoirs have been built successfully, including Claerwen at the top
of the Elan valley, the Usk and Llyn Briane.</p><p><a name="06101348000143"></a>A lot of buffeting is going on in Wales
in relation to water. It is a big political issue which causes loss of
community, loss of environment, loss of the best land, loss of culture,
and disruption of river ecologies and river flows. It should not be
forgotten that water flows from Wales down the River Dee, the Severn
and the Wye and from many reservoirs. I do not understand why, for some
reason, no evidence was taken from Wales for this report. I can
understand that reticence, due to devolution and other factors.
However, the Government of Wales Act 2006, recently passed by this
House, gives the Secretary of State over-arching powers in relation to
water quality in Wales, as well as England, and he may intervene. The
Welsh Assembly Government have very little power and accountability in
that respect, which was a sore point when the Bill was being
considered.</p><p><a name="06101348000144"></a>The impact of
privatisation was a major factor. I took part in the debates on the
then Water Bill in 1989. We had 208 hours of debate in Committee and
532 amendments, of which only two were accepted. I attempted to put
down a marker for not-for-profit companies; 25 per cent of water supply
at that time came from such companies, but I was told by the
Minister&#151;then the Member for Folkestone&#151;that that was not
possible.</p>



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_489"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101348000145"></a>That has been done in the past five years
by Glas Cymru, the over-arching company that supplies capital for Dwr
Cymru Welsh Water. It is interesting that Glas Cymru&#146;s
chairman&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Burns&#151;is a colleague of the
noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher. He has been successful in helping to
bring about much more investment as a result of Dwr Cymru surpluses,
and I believe that there is a schism between the necessity of water
companies to ensure that their shareholders have sufficient return and
ensuring that the infrastructure receives sufficient
investment.</p><p><a name="06101348000146"></a>For those reasons,
I was doubtful at the time of the Water Bill about the privatisation of
water. However, I would not deny, as the noble Earl said, that there
has been greater investment as a result of privatisation. Some factors
have certainly caused me concern, such as inadequate compensatory river
flows on river systems and the effect that that has on ecologies. I
will not go into the details of the sale of the century of public
assets in 1989; suffice it to say that they were valued at &#163;27
billion but sold at &#163;7.5 billion. However, that is all history
now and we have to go on from here, and this report assists us greatly
in ensuring that we can have a better management system.</p><p><a name="06101348000147"></a>I will just point out the following facts
that were given in a recent BBC &#147;Panorama&#148; programme on
water. Leaks account for 5 billion litres per day; indeed, 20 per cent
of water in all the companies is lost through leaks. One should look at
this in the context of the four most profitable companies, whose
profitability totals &#163;1.7 billion. Perhaps I should refer to
not-for-profit companies again, but the lack of investment has resulted
in the continuation of a lot of leaks, which is not satisfactory. The
report addresses that problem. I believe that we must not waste this
water and I am pleased that the report does not propose a water grid,
because until we do something about the leakage problem we will not be
using our resources properly. A massive amount of water is being lost
and that problem needs to be addressed immediately. I just mention in
passing that Dwr Cymru has halved the amount of leaks in the past five
years, since it has been a not-for-profit
company.</p><p><a name="06101348000148"></a>The report&#146;s
executive summary addresses strategy, regulation, metering, the social
impact, and research and development. I agree with the summary word for
word about the strategy. On regulation, the report proposes boards for
river areas, for example. That is all right as long as the boards are
accountable, but I am not sure whether the proposal would ensure that.
My other concern relates to the proposal that the remits of the Energy
Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust be extended to cover water
efficiency. I should like to know more about how that can be achieved,
as I am not sure how it could be.</p><p><a name="06101348000149"></a>The statement in the summary about
leakage is good and I fully endorse the conclusion on
metering&#151;it is easier for companies to impose meters in the
driest parts of the county. The social factors and the affordability
question are thoroughly addressed. The proposals to follow the State of
Victoria in Australia on disconnections are controversial because of
the social impact. There 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_490"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be a mix-up between those who can afford to pay but do not and
those who genuinely cannot pay. That needs to be sorted
out.</p><p><a name="06101348000150"></a>Research and development is
very important. According to my observation of the climate in the first
nine months of this year&#151;I have checked this with the Met
Office&#151;we in south Wales have had far less rainfall than normal.
As in the whole of southern Britain, that reduction is very serious. We
have had only 82 per cent of our usual rainfall. The impact of climate
change is crucial for the planning process, which we must take into
account. The report contains pointers in the right direction but, as it
says, we have a long way to go to co-ordinate planning and to produce
quality water efficiently and in sufficient quantities for an
increasing population. That issue, especially in the context of housing
in the south-east, needs serious
attention.</p><h5><a name="06101348000355"></a>12.55

Crisp:</b> My Lords, I am very pleased to have the
opportunity to make this maiden speech on an issue of such importance
and one that ties in with a whole range of my interests, including the
environment, science and, of course, health. I may also mention
international development, not purely because water and the disposal of
waste are matters of life and, all too often, death in the developing
world, but because we are joined together due to climate change. There
is a further international dimension, which I will come back to in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06101348000152"></a>In making this maiden
speech, I also take the opportunity to say thank you for the welcome
and friendliness that I have received from all parts of your
Lordships&#146; House, as well as from the officers of the House and
all the staff. It is very good to have one&#146;s simple and ignorant
questions answered with such tact and friendliness and very nice to be
welcomed at the door of the Chamber in such a friendly
manner.</p><p><a name="06101348000153"></a>In researching this
speech, I also had the opportunity to make use of the Library for the
first time. I asked the staff about previous times when water
management was an issue of national importance. I am not going to talk
about sewers and Bazalgette, despite the obvious health interest, but
in the information that I was given I was struck by the fact that the
drainage of the fens took over 1,000 years, caused economic and
environmental damage as well as benefits and was highly contentious. I
was given an extract from the 1911 edition of <I>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</I>, which said that the drainage of Whitham fen was finally
concluded,</p><ul><a name="06101348000345"></a>&#147;although
not without much rioting and lawlessness&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000324"></a>I imagine that we can learn something
from history, but perhaps the main point here is to urge all parties
that we should make progress as quickly as possible with the least
economic and ecological damage and with the least
contention. <p><a name="06101348000154"></a>Let me make three
points about this excellent report, which I think will stand the test
of time in drawing out the important questions and pointing to the
important directions to be taken over the next few years. The first
point has already been made and concerns transparency and the
importance of 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>engaging people, as there are many parties here, including the public. I
was pleased to hear what was said about the economic level of leakage
and the changes that have been made. Although what has been done may be
a useful technical measure, I imagine that this sounds to some parts of
the public like a rather slippery way of describing waste. Of course,
the public are also involved in connection with the point that the
noble Lord made about profligacy in the use of water. Many parties need
to be brought together for us to have a coherent picture of what we are
trying to achieve, and as yet that has not happened&#151;the story is
not yet told.</p><p><a name="06101348000155"></a>My second point,
which the report makes strongly, concerns the fact that there are many
official parties, each with their own purposes, with some overlap and
with some conflicting incentives. There needs to be change if we are to
see decisions made in the longer term about what is needed. As the
report says, there is a great need for a much more holistic
approach.</p><p><a name="06101348000156"></a>All of that brings me
to my final point. As I read the report, I was struck by two things.
The first is the level of innovation. There is an enormous amount of
innovation, whether in recycling, the handling of waste or the
technology of the materials that are used. That relates to my
international point. This issue affects everybody around the
world&#151;in some parts more than perhaps here&#151;and there is a
question about whether we in Britain are learning from what works
elsewhere in the world and whether we are hearing and understanding
those lessons. It seems to me that over the next five years, let us
say, we will see some significant changes. We will see more innovation.
Some of the standing conditions that the report talks about may have
shifted. We may have seen the weather getting worse in the way referred
to earlier by a noble Lord. But we may also see the balance of the
economy and the environment change over this period so that decisions
may be different.</p><p><a name="06101348000157"></a>My first
observation on the report is the level of innovation and how fast it is
moving. But my second observation is the inability to make the
long-term decisions. We do not have the framework, as the report
describes, to make the long-term decisions that are needed. In
commending and congratulating the noble Earl and Members of the Select
Committee on providing such a good, wide-ranging report, I come to my
final conclusion that while the report sets out all those issues, the
challenge is for all parties, not just for government, to determine how
to make use of the innovation that we see everywhere and how to make
the decisions that are needed so that there is not a long period of
economic and environmental damage and a great deal of
contention.</p><h5><a name="06101348000356"></a>1.01

and those of your Lordships' House, to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, on
his maiden speech. The noble Lord has had a distinguished career in the
National Health Service, and he has a wealth of knowledge and expertise
that will benefit us all. As chief executive of the NHS, he managed the
first half of a 10-year plan. Sometimes we lose perspective of 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_492"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the sheer size of the NHS and the job involved. At one point, it
employed 3 million people&#151;the biggest employer in Europe; some
60 million potential customers; the largest civilian IT project in the
world; and an accumulative five-year budget, approaching &#163;0.5
trillion, which is bigger than the GDP of most medium-sized countries.
Your Lordships&#146; House will be a better place with the noble
Lord, Lord Crisp, among us, and we welcome
him.</p><p><a name="06101348000159"></a>I, too, express my thanks
to the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for the inspired way in which he
chaired this sub-committee. He did what a good chairman should
do&#151;he defined the project right from the start, kept his eye on
the ball and pulled us back when we were straying from the point. I
very much enjoyed being part of his team, and I believe that we have
produced a magnificent report.</p><p><a name="06101348000160"></a>I
also thank two other people&#151;Professor Ashley for his knowledge,
his incisiveness and his skill in formulating this report, and Tom
Wilson, our Clerk, who kept us all in good order and who played a
crucial role in developing the topic as we
progressed.</p><p><a name="06101348000161"></a>We certainty got our
timing spot on. We reported to your Lordships&#146; House just before
the Summer Recess; at a time when water and drought were on
everyone&#146;s mind. Here in the south east we were banned from
watering our gardens and from washing our cars. It appears that we were
only days away from additional powers being granted to several water
companies.</p><p><a name="06101348000162"></a>Like many other
noble Lords, I, too, had to suffer the indignity of being ribbed and
teased by foreign friends who simply could not believe that London had
a water problem. And to be frank, I still cannot believe it. My family
has a house in Umbria in Italy. We have a large garden and a swimming
pool that evaporates throughout the summer. The summers are hot; the
rain is infrequent; yet our property is irrigated and the squirters go
on every other night. Our water comes from the mains and a well, and
there is not even a hint of a water usage
ban.</p><p><a name="06101348000163"></a>The Select Committee spent
a week in another hot country&#151;Australia. We saw a nation versed
in water conservation where from childhood everyone understands that
water is a precious commodity. But even after six years of drought in
the Sydney region, people are still permitted to water their gardens,
albeit between 10 pm and 4 am. There they succeed, even in that arid
climate, in making their beautiful gardens look like gardens in
Surrey.</p><p><a name="06101348000164"></a>So when my friends tease
me, I am shamefaced to admit that in my city&#151;the greatest city
in Europe&#151;with its reputation for grey skies and constant rain,
we face a major crisis in our water supply. I ask myself why? Is it
because it does not rain enough? Well, that has to be partially true.
Is it because of climate change? Well, that, too, has some relevance.
Is it because of regulation and government interference? Well, it would
be nice to say yes to that, but it cannot really be the answer. Or is
it because of mismanagement? Of course, the sad reply is yes, it
is.</p><p><a name="06101348000165"></a>The title of this report
refers to water management, but my interest has been in water managers.
We visited some brilliant water companies. Yorkshire

it has twice been awarded the prize for the number one public utility
in the country&#151;and it shows. Water leakage in the Yorkshire
region has been reduced dramatically. If you travel around Yorkshire
you do not see road-works caused by burst water mains. And why not?
Because there the company deals with such incidents on an emergency
basis. That is somewhat different from the chaos that happens in this
capital city.</p><p><a name="06101348000166"></a>We visited Yarra
Valley Water in Melbourne, which is right at the cutting edge of using
and reusing water, where office buildings have their own reprocessing
units, and townships where grey water is recycled to provide a stunning
environment. The Melbourne water authorities should be studied by all
UK water utilities. Finally, we visited Sydney Water where drought has
become a permanent way of life, yet where people have learnt to live
successfully with it and to adapt to the problem.</p><p><a name="06101348000167"></a>The Australians showed us how they
recycle water and how they have persuaded their population to install
new and efficient shower-heads and dual flush toilets, and encouraged
almost universal use of rain butts to collect roof and garden run-off.
Australia makes every drop of water
count.</p><p><a name="06101348000168"></a>There is a common thread
that draws together each of these successful Australian and British
water authorities. Unsurprisingly, it is good
management&#151;business managers who have clear vision, precise
guidelines and a determined focus on meeting their targets. How lucky
they are, and how unlucky are we who live in London and the south
east.</p><p><a name="06101348000169"></a>I am by nature an
inveterate capitalist and a serial entrepreneur to boot. I understand
how business works. I understand very clearly the relationship between
risk and reward. In my days, I have enjoyed some reasonable successes,
but I have also suffered some pretty painful failures. I know the rules
of the game. But Thames Water, and some of the other water companies in
the south of the country, leave me speechless. They seem to play by
different rules. The worse the service gets, the more they are
rewarded. They under-invest. They have the highest percentage of
leakages in the UK. They are slow to fix burst water mains and a third
of the water simply disappears. Yet I and millions like me have been
banned from watering our gardens. They have achieved record profits and
they pay their top management outrageous salaries; yet I and millions
like me have to pay inflated bills to compensate for their
mismanagement. They are now up for sale and private equity companies
are circling them like vultures, offering their shareholders billions
upon billions; yet I and millions like me have been made to feel like
criminals if we use a hose to wash our
cars.</p><p><a name="06101348000170"></a>Thames Water is a
shambles. And do not let any of us fall for the bleating about its
legacy of ancient pipes and sewers. Its inability to repair emergency
leaks with any sense of urgency is ample testimony of a company that is
badly managed and oblivious to its customers&#146; requirements. What
is the solution? Perhaps competition. We should be able to buy our

from other electricity
companies.</p><p><a name="06101348000171"></a>Having ranted about
Thames Water, may I be permitted to raise one hobbyhorse not quite on
the theme of water management, but not quite off it either? I am just
about to come to the end of my stint on your Lordships&#146; Select
Committee on Science and Technology. I have loved every minute of it
and I thank your Lordships for appointing me. I have served on at least
six Select Committees. I believe that this Select Committee has done
some magnificent work. We have called on the very highest level of
witnesses and have travelled far and wide in our investigations. We
have produced excellent work, which we have submitted to your
Lordships&#146; House.</p><p><a name="06101348000172"></a>But
what happens after our submissions? The reports go off to government
and we wait for a reply, which eventually comes. In my experience, in
every case, the Government&#146;s reply has been underwhelming
and&#151;dare I say?&#151;grudging. Or at least that is how it
feels. Take this particular report: we have been staggered by the poor
quality of the Government&#146;s unenthusiastic response. This highly
talented sub-committee has prepared an excellent report on an important
subject. We have made a series of well-reasoned recommendations, and
what is the response? Nothing&#151;nothing that we did not know, and
nothing that we had not
considered.</p><p><a name="06101348000173"></a>Would it not be
wonderful, just for once, if they were to say, &#147;We think the
committee has made a valid point and would like to pursue it
further&#148;? To me, it feels like the departments regard the Select
Committee investigations as a total pain in the neck: an intrusion and
an inconvenience, interfering with the very busy and, I am sure,
important schedule of the officials
concerned.</p><p><a name="06101348000174"></a>This report on water
management was a clear case in point: an uninspired response to an
excellent report. This House deserves better.</p><h5><a name="06101348000357"></a>1.10

Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, my first obligation this
afternoon is to declare an interest. I am a farmer in north Essex. I
have an abstraction licence which I use to fill a reservoir which holds
12 million gallons of water. I have no rivers on the farm. In a normal
summer, no water leaves my farm. My average annual rainfall is a shade
over 18 inches. When I built that reservoir more than 40 years ago, it
took just over three weeks to fill it in an area where, anywhere else
in the world, the rainfall would make it semi-desert. This somewhat
colours my views on the
problems.</p><p><a name="06101348000176"></a>I am immensely
grateful to my noble friend for introducing this report, and to the
committee for all its work. It has highlighted issues, raising the
scale of topicality and significance over the past few years. One
difficulty which we must all face and deal with today is that there is
and always will be a conflict between good water management and the
environment. I seriously suggest that we also need to bear in mind that
the United Kingdom environment in its widest sense is certainly not
natural, and has not been for many centuries. It has been created by
man, and we must recognise that. I am afraid that we must 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_495"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be able to go on adapting the environment as necessary, to deal both
with the changing circumstances of the nation and a particular aspect
which very much affects us in the south east: population
growth.</p><p><a name="06101348000177"></a>Of course, population
growth does not affect only the south east. When I was a boy the
populationof this country was about 45 million and now it
is60 million: 30 per cent higher. You cannot service people
without producing the resources they require. That puts greater
pressure on the natural environment, a risk we must face. To mention an
unmentionable subject, the population issue is not just one of a United
Kingdom context, but a global context. It will have to climb rapidly up
the ladder of topicality. To go back to global warming, there will be
no solution to that problem unless we manage to get our global
population numbers under control. That has all sorts of political and
religious connotations, which are not appropriate here. It is, however,
appropriate to remind ourselves of that background.</p><p><a name="06101348000178"></a>The corollary of having no population
policy is that we have an obligation to make the resources available if
it can be done. It can be done. The difficulty we have had for a number
of years is whether there is sufficient intention to overcome the
difficulties I have outlined in this conflict between the environmental
interest and the resource implications of growing population
numbers.</p><p><a name="06101348000179"></a>I highlight that from
a slightly different perspective, because it is not exclusively our
problem. We have heard about the European water directive, and we have
European conservation directives. To bring the water and global warming
issues together, part of the global warming issues, from a UK
perspective, could be solved by getting hold of much more green
electricity. We could get a large chunk of that from the Severn
estuary, which has such environmental protection from Brussels that it
would very difficult to get a barrage across it. At some point, we and
other countries will find ourselves asking the Brussels Commission
whether its priority is to bring global warming under control or to
&#147;preserve the environment&#148;&#151;particularly knowing
that if we unleash rising sea levels on these coastal areas, they, in
turn, will destroy the existing environment as we know it. That is
another dilemma we must face.</p><p><a name="06101348000180"></a>I
found an issue in the report slightly odd. The Consumer Council for
Water made a comment tothe effect that water customers were
paying for the demand created by society. I found myself saying,
&#147;Hang on, what is the difference between water customers and
society?&#148;. We are society. I do not know anybody who does not
use water, so I did not understand that rather strange comment. One
cannot help but feel that that sort of attitude pressures people. I am
not sure whether there is any evidence that society, as is apparently
predicted, is concerned about the costs of water and prefers the low
prices of today to the possible high cost of ensuring supplies for the
future. Yet it is clear that there is a concern in the
committee&#146;s report that the water regulators have been driven by
a priority for the current low prices at the expense of future water
security. I was not sure

it was the latter. That is all very well but, at some point, we will
have to be much more positive about the need to serve
society.</p><p><a name="06101348000181"></a>The next question is
whether we manage our water well. Reading the Government&#146;s
response to the report, as far as I can make out, all is for the best
in the best of all possible worlds; it was very complacent indeed. It
makes clear the depth, complexity and length of the consultation
process required to do anything in water management. This must be
tackled with great urgency. I am aware that the Government are looking
at the planning process in other fields, but they must also consider it
in this context. One must seriously ask whether a 20-year process to
take you from the conception to the construction of a major water
facility is reasonable. I cannot help wondering, slightly cynically,
whether we shall have a 20-year consultation on how we must improve the
planning system, because that is also highly controversial.</p><p><a name="06101348000182"></a>The answer to the question of whether we
manage our water well in this country has to be, &#147;No, we
don&#146;t&#148;. We use only about 10 per cent of the
precipitation that we receive. There are lands in other parts of the
world that use a vastly higher percentage of their available water.
Unlike everybody who wishes to knock Thames Water, I wish to pay it one
important compliment. I acknowledge that it has all sorts of
deficiencies, but it must have about the best water cleaning process in
the world because the water we use in London is recycled five times
between Teddington weir and Beckton. The reports on Essex and Australia
mention the yuck factor, which means that when water is recycled, it is
necessary to put it back in the river to make it acceptable to the
people who consume it. I have not heard anybody in London complain
about the yuck factor of drinking recycled water. I suspect that that
may well be because the vast majority of people do not know it is being
done, which is a serious compliment to the system that makes it
possible. It also makes me wonder how many of the obstacles that we
have to put in the way of progress through this immensely complex and
sophisticated consultation process are, in effect, purely psychological
barriers. I feel that the Government in particular and we politicians
in general need to be much more robust about the need to promote
essential infrastructure that will make life worth living for our
successors.</p><p><a name="06101348000183"></a>I was delighted to
get to the final pages of the report for one reason; it reported on a
visit to my region. There is a ray of sunshine; some really serious
work is being undertaken on river basin transfer. Essex is one of the
driest counties in the country, if not the driest. We had no water
shortage this year because 30 years ago a river basin transfer scheme
was put in place. That facility can be made available everywhere, if
need be. It is not a question of building a national water main or of
transferring all the water for certain individuals to certain places,
as the Minister once said, but of producing a system that can take care
of the marginal deficiencies in particular areas. That is what we are
talking about, and that can be done. The Government must look

future.</p><h5><a name="06101348000358"></a>1.23

Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, it was a privilege
to serve on this committee under the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. I thank
our Clerk and our special adviser for their excellent work. Those who
served on this committee saw this report as a sequel to earlier reports
that we produced on energy efficiency and renewable energy because the
key issue in this report and the earlier reports was security of
supply. As the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said, it seems madness that
in a country renowned for its rainfall there should be any question
about security of supply in relation to water. The report makes clear
that, at the moment, there is no issue in relation to northern or
western areas of the UK, but, as this summer has shown with its
hosepipe pans and drought orders, there is a serious issue in the south
and east of the country where water resources are already stretched to
the limit.</p><p><a name="06101348000185"></a>We spell out the
main co-ordinates of the problem in Chapter 4 of the report. Over the
next 25 years, the population of England and Wales&#151;not that of
the United Kingdom as a whole&#151;is expected to rise by7
million people, from 53 million to 60 million. Those people are
expected to settle disproportionatelyin the south and east,
where the jobs are. The average consumption of water in this country is
already150 litres per day per person. Although the report
states that there is some flexibility about the figure, it is
nevertheless an average of 150 litres per day per person and rising.
Today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I>, which is celebrating the fact that the
United States now has a population of over 300 million, notes that
average water consumption in the United States is 350 litres per person
per day, which is almost 2.5 times what we consume. As we get richer,
we use more water: we take more baths; we wash more clothes more
frequently; we spend more money on the plants in our gardens; and we
want to water them more frequently. Also, as we get richer, we tend to
break down into nuclear households. As Professor Adrian McDonald points
out in his interesting appendix, although larger households
proportionately do not increase their demand for water&#151;obviously
larger households demand more&#151;the break-up of households into
small units increases the demand for water.</p><p><a name="06101348000186"></a>If we look 25 years ahead, a population
increaseof 7 million will mean that we will need an
extra1,000 million litres of water per day. The tables on page
44 show that that is roughly the total consumption of the north-west of
England: it means a whole new region. That population will
disproportionately be settling in the south and east. The maps on pages
56 and 57 of the report make clear that in the south and east of
England present levels of demand for surface water and ground water are
unsustainable. We are abstracting more from the rivers and aquifers in
the dry months than we are putting back in the rainy months. Climate
change is not going to make this problem any easier because we 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_498"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shall have more dry months in the summer and more heavy storms in the
winter and what fills the aquifers is the steady drip, drip, drip of
what was a typical rainy day in Britain.</p><p><a name="06101348000187"></a>If we think that we have got problems,
other countries have problems too. On Tuesday, the <I>Guardian</I>
published an article by George Monbiot, in which he
states:</p><ul><a name="06101348000333"></a>&#147;In India, for
example, some 250 cubic kilometres (a cubic kilometre is a billion
cubic metres or a trillion litres) are extracted for irrigation every
year, of which about 150 are replaced by the rain. &#145;Two hundred
million people [are] facing a waterless future. The groundwater boom is
turning to bust and, for some, the green revolution is
over&#146;.</ul><ul><a name="06101348000334"></a>&#147;In
China, 100 million people live on crops grown with underground water
that is not being refilled: water tables are falling fast all over the
north China plain&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000188"></a>Therefore, it is not just a problem
that we face. <p><a name="06101348000189"></a>It is a problem
that the Government have not made any easier for us, as the noble Earl,
Lord Selborne, mentioned. It became very clear in our discussions that
the Government embarked on their sustainable communities plan in 2003
and then took up Kate Barker&#146;s suggestions for further housing
increases in new housing development in the south east of some 200,000
units a year without due consultation with either the Environment
Agency or the water companies. Although, as the noble Earl mentioned,
things have improved and much more consultation is now going on, there
is still a long way to go before we have the openness and the
consultation that is really necessary. It seems from the Government's
response mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that there is
still far too much complacency.</p><p><a name="06101348000190"></a>Our report endorses the broad strategy
that has emerged in both government and the Environment Agency and
Ofwat, which is termed the twin-tack approach, although, as we point
out, people have slightly different interpretations of what twin-track
means. Essentially it means that we have to work on both supply and
demand at the same time&#151;at least we feel very strongly that it
must be at the same time. On the supply side that means building new
reservoirs or extending old ones, transferring waters from one river
basin to another&#151;the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Dixon-Smith; and we were very impressed indeed by the work undertaken
by Anglian Water in this respect&#151;and tackling leakage. It
possibly involves in the future desalination plants, although we were
doubtful about whether that was really justified at the moment.
Incidentally, we should bear in mind that the leakage from Thames
Water&#151;1,050 million litres per day&#151;is just about what we
need for that7 million rise in population.</p><p><a name="06101348000191"></a>All these issues, including leakage,
require capital expenditure. One of the key issues that came out of our
investigations was that in order to finance capital expenditure the
water companies have to borrow, and if they are going to borrow they
must have enough resources to pay for that borrowing. There was clear
tension with Ofwat about whether they were being given enough leeway to
raise the money they needed to raise the investment they needed. To
some degree 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_499"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the constant plea from the water companies was that they were not
getting enough money for those investments.</p><p><a name="06101348000192"></a>I slightly share the view taken by the
noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, that&#151;as Mandy Rice-Davies put
it&#151;&#147;They would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;.
The <I>Evening Standard</I> noted when our report was published that
the four water companies with the largest percentage of
leakage&#151;and that is over 25 per cent of their water
supply&#151;leaking out of the system, were also those with the
largest profits. If you are a regulator there is a very nice question
on how far you go in terms of allowing extra profits when you have a
monopoly supplier; and domestic water supply is a monopoly at the
moment. I think we were sometimes a little too kind to the water
companies in our report. </p><p><a name="06101348000193"></a>Ofwat
have a very real issue in balancing the two questions. We clearly need
to make more investment. The companies must have enough money to make
that investment. But how do you squeeze those companies to ensure that
they are not putting that money into the pockets of their shareholders
or into the pockets of their management? That is a nice question. It is
not easy to answer, but I have some sympathy with Ofwat in terms of
squeezing the companies.</p><p><a name="06101348000194"></a>It is
encouraging that in their responses both Ofwat and the Government have
accepted the points we made about the need to look to the future. I am
extremely pleased about that. More generally, and this comes through
our report, the whole governance and planning framework of the industry
lacks coherence, is much too complicated and from the consumer&#146;s
point of view it needs to be simplified. I know that we are perhaps
suggesting another layer of bureaucracy, but at least in a sense it
links to the consumer more directly in terms of linking the area they
live with the supply of water.</p><p><a name="06101348000195"></a>I will talk a little about the issues on
the supply side. The key issue is metering. As the noble Earl
mentioned, metering is not a panacea for everything. At the moment only
28 per cent of households in the country are metered. That is lower
than elsewhere. Those who do not have meters are charged a lump sum
every year. That lump sum is somewhat arbitrary because it is based on
the old pre-1989&#151;is it?&#151;rateable values of those houses,
which get increasingly out of line with the use of water that
necessarily comes out of that. The more we can extend metering the
better because people pay the price. If you pay a lump sum you say
&#147;I might as well use everything&#148;, but if you pay a price
then you look at what you are paying. It is important for us to try to
push forward metering as far as we can.</p><p><a name="06101348000196"></a>But we need smart metering. We do not
want a meter stuck somewhere down in the front garden where you cannot
see it. You need to be able to look at a meter in your house, just as
we argued with electricity and gas, so you can see how much you are
consuming at that time and how much you have consumed over the past day
or so. We want smart billing that will show people how much they use in
comparison with previous years and how much others of the same sized
household use. Figure 5 on page 79 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_500"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gives a very telling example of what a smart bill might look like. We
need smart tariffs. We recommend the rising block tariffs, although we
must be careful about suggesting that those who use more water should
pay more it you do not at the same time catch large
households.</p><p><a name="06101348000197"></a>We also need to
look at the demand side for water. Of those 150 litres only 10 per cent
is required for drinking or for preparing food that we eat&#151;for
potable uses; 25 per cent goes down the lavatory, which is why
dual-flush systems are important. Others have told me that there are
siphon systems, which use, instead of the seven litres that you flush
down the lavatory, only something like two litres. So it is vitally
important for us to try to develop ways to economise on the water we
use. Thirty-three per cent of water goes on personal washing. Here
there is the whole question that power showers do not actually save
anything over baths. Can we develop showers, and other countries have
managed to do this, which are more efficient? Twenty per cent goes on
clothes and dish washing. Modern machines can be much less efficient,
but why do the Government suggest that it is impossible to have some
kind of scheme that labels these machines just as we have with energy
efficiency? They seem to suggest that it is impossible; that we will
have to start from scratch. We already have a very good scheme on
energy efficiency.</p><p><a name="06101348000198"></a>In terms of
garden use, why cannot we do like the Australians and make far more use
of rain water? The example we quote from Australia shows that above all
where there is a will there is a way. Sadly, what emerges from the
Government and Ofwat&#146;s response to our recommendations is that
we have yet to find the will. As the energy sector has shown already so
clearly, once awareness is raised people respond to incentives and,
indeed, often to community pressures. At present, both the Government
and Ofwat seem to be far too complacent about the potential risks of
water shortage and not prepared to take the necessary lead in raising
awareness.</p><h5><a name="06101348000359"></a>1.39

noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for the excellent way in which he chaired
the committee. It was indeed a great pleasure to be a member of such a
committee with such efficiency being projected. In addition, I pay
tribute to the Clerk of the inquiry, Tom Wilson, who gave a very
effective summary and report of the complex deliberations involved in
the inquiry. We were very fortunate to have the expert advice of
Professor Ashley, whose experience in water matters is very extensive
and appropriate to the study.</p><p><a name="06101348000200"></a>I
also take this opportunity to say welcome to my noble friend Lord

opportunity of seeing him in operation when he can be a little more
controversial on some topics for which I am sure that he has deep
feeling.</p><p><a name="06101348000201"></a>I became involved in
the problems of water management when I chaired the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution from 1986 to 1988. The topic was water purity.
Many of the problems 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_501"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discussed by the committee were very similar to those that we
encountered in the present study. It is pleasing to see how much has
been accomplished in this area during the past 20 years, but some of
the difficulties identified 20 years ago are still with us, especially
problems associated with diffuse sources of water pollution from both
agriculture and urban
sources.</p><p><a name="06101348000202"></a>The major development
in the water industry was privatisation in 1989, which, as has been
discussed by the noble Earl, has led to a great increase in investment
in the water industry&#151;which, I may say, has been necessary. The
present report indicates that one of the significant problems now
facing the water industry is water shortage, which appears to have
occurred in many parts of the country. However, that is mainly a
localised problem and must be dealt with on a local rather than a
national basis. The problem of water shortage is often associated with
specific areas of the country and may vary from year to year. The
variation in location may be attributed to a variety of factors,
including rainfall, geological effects and population density and
growth.</p><p><a name="06101348000203"></a>The south-east is of
particular concern as that area is under stress for water supply
and&#151;as has been said by several Members&#151;is attracting a
projected growth of the order of about a million new homes. That
position has been further accentuated by a decrease in the average
household size and an increased usage of water-intensive appliances in
the household, as well as the leakage problem, which we have discussed.
In a recent report by University College in London, it was estimated
that, by 2006, 38 per cent of UK housing will be single occupancy. On
average, a decrease in occupancy from two to one increases the water
demand per capita by 40 per cent. So, within a static population, there
will be a significant increase in water
demand.</p><p><a name="06101348000204"></a>I now refer to the
latest statistics, which appeared yesterday, on population growth
during the next 25 years. The population growth for London will be
roughly 20 per cent. It is interesting to note that the density of
population in England is 383 people per square kilometre, while the
corresponding figure for Europe is 117. That accentuates the London
problem. It is also important to recognise that rainfall&#151;I
understand the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about the dangers
of interpolation of rainfall data&#151;is projected to fall by 60 per
cent by 2080.</p><p><a name="06101348000205"></a>The recent
analysis of water requirements carried out by the Government for
additional houses, which are mainly to be built in the south-east of
England, does not appear to include some of those points. I remind the
House that the analysis noted that the extra increase of 200,000
houses, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, just referred, would
increase demand by only 0.1 per cent because they would not be occupied
by &#147;new people&#148;. That appears to ignore the effect of the
increase in the population, its relocation and the decrease in the size
of house occupancy.</p><p><a name="06101348000206"></a>The
reticence of the Government directly to involve water companies in the
housing developments is difficult to understand and is certainly
counter to 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_502"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 502</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all advice offered by external bodies, as we heard in our discussion. A
worrying feature of any water-management problem is the general
public&#146;s view that there is a constant supply of water, when the
English and Welsh have less water per person per year than do most
residents of Mediterranean countries. Although many parts of the
country are suffering from water shortages, this is not true for the
whole country, and it is sometimes difficult to enthuse the public
about a problem that is so variable, often localised and very often
seasonal.</p><p><a name="06101348000207"></a>The water demand in
England and Wales is expected to increase by 12 per cent by 2030, and
will place further pressure on water companies. In part, to solve this
water crisis, companies, particularly in the south-east, are projected
to build five new reservoirs and extend three of the existing ones in
the next 25 years. There is also a plan to build two desalination
plants, but, as the noble Earl has remarked, this is more
controversial. Building these, however, would lead to only a 6 per cent
increase in water availability&#151;still leaving us with this
balance of 6 per cent to be found. As we discuss in the report, it is
clear that efforts must be made to lower water consumption, and, as
approximately half is consumed in the domestic sphere, the use of
water-efficient fixtures and fittings in homes, the reuse of water and
the metering of water supplies must be given top priority in any
government measures to deal with this problem.</p><p><a name="06101348000208"></a>It is interesting to note that, in the
OECD area, only two countries&#151;Ireland and the UK&#151;do not
go in for universal metering. I find that very surprising. In a section
on water problems in a recent Sustainable Development Commission
review, which was authored by Professor Anne Power of University
College&#151;it is interesting to note that a large number of reviews
on water are now appearing&#151;attention was drawn to the fact that
the bulk of the consideration on saving in water is applied to new
buildings, with little research or policy activity on water consumption
in existing buildings. As new buildings are roughly only 5 per cent of
the total build, a major problem lies with the older
stock.</p><p><a name="06101348000209"></a>The article claims that
savings in water usage of about 30 per cent may be achieved in old
houses. It points out, for example, that kitchens and bathrooms are
refitted every seven to 15 years. These rooms contain the majority of
water-consuming appliances, and some form of regulation on
water-efficient replacements could reduce water-usage considerably. The
use of such appliances could be encouraged by fiscal incentives such as
reduced rates of VAT on efficient fittings and appliances. Some form of
labelling indicating the water efficiency of appliances, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Sharp, suggested, should also be implemented. As she
pointed out, such a system applies to energy but, for some reason that
I find incomprehensible, it does not apply to water as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06101348000210"></a>It is pleasing to note
that the water industry has instituted a new independent body called
Waterwise, which will offer advice on water conservation and
efficiency. The main emphasis on savings in water 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_503"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consumption in buildings is currently being directed at the domestic
scene, and although it is true that it accounts for 50 per cent of
water consumption, significant savings can also be made in the
industrial sector. Demand by industry for water has decreased in most
parts of the UK because of the decline in industrial activity, and
certain companies have recognised the economics of limiting water
usage. Similarly, there has been a decrease in agriculture&#146;s
demands for water. There is still, however, a big opportunity for
saving water in both these areas. A recent report by Envirowise, an
organisation that is designed to provide industry and business with
advice on environmental matters&#151;the Government very much had a
hand in building this up&#151;indicates that industry as a whole,
which accounts for a third of the water used in the UK, is using three
times more than it actually needs. We are talking about a vast amount
of water here. They are clearly in favour of metering water
supplies.</p><p><a name="06101348000211"></a>I agree in general
terms with the sentiment expressed in particular by the noble Lord,
Lord Mitchell, that the government reply to the report is rather
negative. With the exception of the metering problem, which admittedly
they now seem to be taking on board, they do not appear to have given
very favourable responses to the bulk of the
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06101348000212"></a>Finally, I turn
to another point. I am concerned about what appears to be the attitude
of Defra, at least as it is expressed in the environmental press, to
the next development in water management. This is the one proposed by
the European Union in the Water Framework Directive. The directive
requires member states to achieve good ecological status in all water
bodies by 2015 and is based on a river basin analysis of water
management focusing on the delivery of an integrated approach between
the various water management priorities. It is not a new concept for
water management and, indeed, was a suggestion put forward by the royal
commission in the 1980s, based on the deliberations of the then
National Rivers Authority for management of water distribution on an
integrated river basin management or catchment system. To me that is a
much more logical way of looking at water
problems.</p><p><a name="06101348000213"></a>The directive permits
member states to adopt alternative objectives that may delay
improvement until 2027. A guidance publication on river basin planning
issued this September by Defra states that the agency should make full
use of this alternative in the directive&#151;that is, delay until
2027. But the European Commission has warned the Environment Agency and
the water industry not to rely on receiving extensions allowing more
time to meet the directive. The completion date should be viewed as
2015 rather than 2027 other than for exceptional problems. There is no
doubt that the directive poses some large problems, but it is important
that the Government should attempt to attain completion on the
projected timescale and are not seen to be dragging their feet on the
date for completion by encouraging the Environment Agency to consider
delaying until 2027.</p>

Howie of Troon:</b> My Lords, I join in the
congratulations which have been heaped on the heads of the noble Earl,
Lord Selborne, our Clerk and our adviser, as well as my colleagues on
the committee. I especially enjoyed the speech made by my noble friend
Lord Mitchell a short time ago. I am delighted to see such a
self-confessed unrepentant capitalist sitting on this side of the
House. Our party has perhaps moved further than I had thought since I
joined it around 50 years ago. I also enjoyed his company on our visit
to Australia last February. It was the height of the Australian summer
so I took my lightest clothing because I expected great heat. During
the week we were there, it rained every day except one&#151;not
heavily, but it rained. That may have explained the gardens, which so
impressed my noble friend.</p><p><a name="06101348000215"></a>This
is a good report and I endorse almost all of it, but I am going to
depart from the general mood of the debate by mildly dissenting on two
or possibly three items. Again, I dissent mildly because I think the
report is good. First, I make a pedantic point, which may come from my
being a lapsed Presbyterian. We harp on about drought. We do not have a
drought in this country. You have droughts in places like the Kalahari
desert or in Oklahoma in the late 1930s. What we have is a serious
water shortage in some parts of country and adequate supplies in
others. For instance, 10 or so days ago I was on the Island of Mull,
where they do not have a water shortage. I am told that the soft
highland rain makes your hair curl; it does not seem to work.
&#147;Drought&#148; excites journalists, but they over-estimate its
effects and so perhaps we should talk about &#147;water
shortages&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101348000216"></a>I mildly
dissent from the committee in that I think we were unduly dismissive of
the possibilities of a water grid. People have been pushing water
around for domestic and commercial purposes for centuries. For
instance, Hammurabi, who invented my profession of civil engineering in
Mesopotamia in the 7th century BC, built dams, water canals and so on
in order to drive water for Babylon and Baghdad, which were then the
greatest cities in the world. So there is no technical problem about
building a pipeline, which would probably be combined with tunnel and
canal. Fifty-odd years ago, when I was a young civil engineer in
Glasgow, I designed a pipeline to bring water to a tin mine in Malaya,
as it then was. So if I could handle it, I am quite sure almost anyone
else could. The water in southern California comes from the Rocky
Mountains in Nevada, hundreds of miles
away.</p><p><a name="06101348000217"></a>People tell us that water
is heavy stuff&#151;which it is; I think a cubic metre of water
weighs about a tonne&#151;and that when it has to be pumped it
requires energy and so on. Oil is not as heavy as water&#151;it
floats on water because it is lighter&#151;but it is pumped and piped
from Alaska to the northern mid-west states in the United states, and
from Russia to western Europe. So the feasibility of a water grid as a
technical exercise is perfectly within the capabilities of the
construction industry that we have in this country.</p>

but the Environment Agency does not like very much of this kind. We are
not surprised that the Environment Agency does not like it; perhaps we
should pay less heed to what it
says.</p><p><a name="06101348000219"></a>The other item with which
I dissent&#151;albeit mildly&#151;is that I think we were far too
dismissive of the possibilities of desalination. I believe there are
half-a-dozen schemes under consideration in this country and we know
that there are at least 30 or so in Saudi Arabia which have been in
operation for quite a long time. It seems to me that in the cases of
both the grid and desalination we were over-impressed by thoughts of
their effect on the environment, on energy use and on CO2
emissions.</p><p><a name="06101348000220"></a>I agree entirely
with what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said about the environment
in his extremely interesting contribution to the debate. We have to
remember that this country&#146;s contribution to global
CO2 emissions is 2 per cent. Theoretically, if we could get
rid of the whole of that, it would do two things: it would wreck our
economy and make very little difference to global emissions worldwide.
It is true that increased emissions would result from producing a
pipeline or a desalination station, but they would be very small
compared with the global problem. At a time when the Government are
hoping to reduce our contribution to global emissions from2
per cent to perhaps 1.5 per cent&#151;that is not a target but an
estimate of what they are likely to achieve&#151;it would not matter
terribly if they achieved 1.6 per cent rather than 1.5 per cent. That
would be the likely effect of the increase resulting from
desalination.</p><p><a name="06101348000221"></a>I think we were
too timid there, but that did not prevent us producing a thoroughly
worthwhile report, which deserved a much better response from the
Government than it got.</p><h5><a name="06101348000361"></a>2.1

Oxburgh:</b> My Lords, I, too, begin by recognising
the contribution of our special adviser, Professor Richard Ashley, and
our Clerk, Tom Wilson. I pay particular tribute to our chairman, the
noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for the good humour and dexterity with which
he guided our deliberations. I also congratulate my noble friend Lord
Crisp on his eloquent and, if I may say so, highly apposite maiden
speech.</p><p><a name="06101348000223"></a>In the 18th and 19th
centuries, civil engineering was responsible for enormous health
improvements in our cities. Clean supplies of fresh water and the
disposal of sewage in closed sewers simply transformed public health.
The engineers of the day did this so successfully that for nearly a
century it was easy for us to forget the enormity of their
achievements. Over the intervening years, we have taken this
infrastructure and the abundance of water that it provided so much for
granted that we have failed to make the investment in maintenance and
renewal that common sense would have dictated.</p><p><a name="06101348000224"></a>In recent decades, three factors have
rather sharply drawn it to our attention that we have been living in a
fool&#146;s paradise. First, and most obviously, the 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Victorian water mains and sewers that had been so well constructed that
we unconsciously assumed that they would last for ever began to fail.
Secondly, a succession of summer droughts and low-rainfall winters in
the south-east made it all too apparent that the abundant rainfall that
we had taken for granted could not be relied on. Indeed, this may well
be the beginning of a drying trend associated, as various noble Lords
have pointed out, with a change in climate. Finally, there has been an
increase in the level of personal water use and, in the south,
increased water demand from a growing population in a part of the
country that is already
water-stressed.</p><p><a name="06101348000225"></a>Together, these
considerations mean that not only do we have a water infrastructure
that is failing through historic lack of investment but it is rapidly
becoming inadequate in the south-east because of changes in climate and
increases in water demand. Available water resources are finite, and if
we draw on them too heavily we risk lasting damage to the
environment.</p><p><a name="06101348000226"></a>I have sketched
this picture to make it clear that we are entering, in the 21st
century, uncharted territory. For that reason, it is particularly
unfortunate that, as we point out in our report, water companies have
great difficulty in finding money to pay for research programmes which
would help them to do their job better and deal with new and unfamiliar
situations.</p><p><a name="06101348000227"></a>In recent years, the
annual expenditure by water companies on research and development has
been around &#163;20 million. That figure may be compared with an
annual turnover of around &#163;7 billion and, for that matter, the
annual total of unpaid water bills of around &#163;1 billion. Our
committee regarded this level of research expenditure as inadequate.
That view was shared by some of the companies, which drew attention to
the pressure from the regulator to keep down near-term water prices to
consumers. Frankly, this is a false economy. Some research is carried
out by water companies, but most is carried out or commissioned by UK
Water Industry Research, funded jointly by the companies. This is a
very satisfactory approach, but it seems that programmes are limited by
both the overall level of funding and uncertainty about its
continuity.</p><p><a name="06101348000228"></a>It is worth
considering some of the areas in which research can bring substantial
benefits. Given that management and containment of leaks is one of the
major challenges facing the industry, high on the list should be
technologies for remotely inspecting pipework, the detection of leaks
and lining of pipes. Work in areas such as these can be undertaken in
collaboration with universities or industrial partners.</p><p><a name="06101348000229"></a>One of the most obvious approaches to
water shortages is to make better use of the water that we have. This
can involve purification and re-use of water. The committee visited one
public building, in Melbourne, which, by employing this technology,
would use only one one-tenth of the normal consumption for a building
of this size.</p><p><a name="06101348000230"></a>Water purification
technologies have been around for many years, but the challenge is to
treat large volumes quickly and cost-effectively. This whole area is
being transformed by the development of 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_507"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>membranes that can be tailored to remove particular chemical species
from the water that passes through. The other challenge is to do this
at minimum energy cost. This means that the membrane must be able to
pass permitted species easily, without high pumping pressures. These
same technologies can be used to purify salt or brackish water. These
are all areas of active and important
research.</p><p><a name="06101348000231"></a>Water networks tend to
be both extensive and complex and may receive water from a variety of
sources. For reasons of both public health and security, it is
important for water to be tested regularly to see whether it contains
chemical impurities or pathogenic organisms. It is now becoming
possible to carry out such tests remotely and for the results to be
sent by telemetry to water management centres, where action may be
taken quickly to respond to any problem.</p><p><a name="06101348000232"></a>Developments such as those which I have
described have the potential, along with many others, to make water
supplies safer, more reliable and, in the long term, they are likely to
save expense, as shown by work carried out by Yorkshire Water. It is
very important that water companies have access to these technologies.
However, to do so cost effectively, they must be able to act as
intelligent customers. That means having in-house expertise to
recognise and evaluate new developments and to see how they may be best
adapted to their particular needs. This can be done by working closely
with UK Water Industry Research and with other external bodies, but it
costs money.</p><p><a name="06101348000233"></a>I am afraid that
the replies of both the Government and of Ofwat suggest that neither
properly appreciates either the practical difficulties in setting up
and conducting research, the importance of continuity, or the
importance of research to an industry such as the water industry,
facing the challenges that it does today. Expenditure on research
should be seen as an investment for the future rather than as an
in-year cost.</p><p><a name="06101348000234"></a>Regardless of
whether the funding mechanism for research suggested in our report is
the most appropriate, it is essential that the industry should have
every incentive to innovate. The fiscal regime within which the
companies operate should be designed to encourage research in a
positive way and to ensure that research projects can continue
overat least two funding periods; that is, over at
least10 years. Given the time that it takes to set up a
project properly, the present regime makes it virtually impossible to
consider projects that extend beyond two or, at the most, three years.
It would be helpful for Ofwat to consult the Government&#146;s
director-general for research and innovation, or the Chief Scientific
Adviser, on appropriate means to ensure that the funding structure for
research is appropriate for the water challenges that lie ahead. I hope
that they will do
so.</p><h5><a name="06101348000362"></a>2.10

<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>found themselves considering an issue that was as much a matter of
public knowledge and understanding as it was of science and technology.
The Government need urgently to show stronger leadership in informing
the people about the critical issues of water management. As many
people have said, there is no fundamental shortage of waterin
this country but there are problems of storage, distribution and
inefficiency of use. The understanding of the public is poor by
international and European standards. This ignorance leads to waste and
to the inability of people to participate effectively in the debate
about which of the alternative solutions to adopt. Indeed, it seems
that it is almost the Government&#146;s policy to minimise consumer
participation.</p><p><a name="06101348000236"></a>As we have all
said, the sub-committee was fortunate in its chairman, the noble Earl,
Lord Selborne, whose extensive knowledge of the subject, so apparent in
his excellent opening speech, and his outstanding skills as a chairman,
enabled us to get to the roots of the problem and to come up with
constructive recommendations. I also compliment our specialist adviser,
Professor Richard Ashley, whose international expertise was especially
valuable, and our Clerk, Tom Wilson, with the assistance of Michael
Collon and our specialist assistant,Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, on
their efficient organisation of the meetings and visits and their clear
and accurate drafting of the report. I also compliment all noble Lords
who have spoken, and especially the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, for his
eloquent maiden speech.</p><p><a name="06101348000237"></a>I shall
concentrate on the related issues of public understanding, metering and
billing, all of which have been mentioned already several times but
which I nevertheless feel will bear repetition. The majority of
consumers believe that our supply shortages can be rectified simply by
having the water companies mend the leaks in the distribution system
but, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and others have said, the
problems are much more complex than this suggests. However, I support
strongly the cry of the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, for improved
management in some of our water companies and the introduction of
increased competition. I also disagree with the water companies&#146;
claim that the reduction of leakage below what has been called the
&#147;economic level&#148; of leakage would lead only to an
unacceptable increase in cost and that it is better to increase supply.
We think that that is simplistic and does not adequately take into
account environmental issues.</p><p><a name="06101348000238"></a>As
our chairman has already said, we recommend that Ofwat replace the
concept of an economical level of leakage with a broader concept of a
sustainable level of leakage. As we have said, that would take into
account but place more emphasis on the environmental and social
consequences than on cost and providing additional supply. It would
lead to lower levels of leakage and go a long way to persuading the
public that the water companies are behaving responsible. In turn, more
people would be inclined to support the companies&#146; request to
provide additional supply through building new reservoirs or 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_509"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>desalination plants. This is a critical matter of long-range planning on
which we feel there is insufficient attention.</p><p><a name="06101348000239"></a>There is also the issue of the
contribution that people can make themselves to conserving water. As
with electricity, a large number of people have little idea of how much
water they use or of the relative importance of the different ways in
which they use it. Much of that ignorance is a consequence of
inadequate, or a complete absence of, metering.</p><p><a name="06101348000240"></a>Our systems of monitoring water usage and
billing are primitive&#151;years out of date by the standards of best
practice in the western world. As we have said in the report and
mentioned today, we saw much more intelligent and advanced methods
being practised in Australia, quite coincidentally in Melbourne, where
I happen to have spent most of my youth. Residents of Melbourne receive
a water bill that outlines in detail their present and past usage of
water, and how much it is costing them. If they do not pay their bill,
the suppliers have the right to limit their supply&#151;not
disconnect them&#151;by placing a constriction in their supply pipe.
It is interesting to reflect that in those days long ago when I grew up
in Melbourne, there was little concern about water supply. But
Australians have realised that their modern way of life, their
prosperity and climate change together place demands upon the water
supply that are many times more severe than they were in the first half
of the 20th century.</p><p><a name="06101348000241"></a>Things
have changed dramatically, and it is well past the time when we should
have realised that our case is similar and modified our behaviour. We
are in the bizarre situation where people will pay as much for a litre
of bottled water as they will for a litre of petrol, and yet a
significant minority of the same people refuse to pay their water bills
when the water, in most cases, is of the same quality and purity as
that of the bottled variety, and yet costs one-thousandth as much.
Never has public ignorance been more expensive to the public.</p><p><a name="06101348000242"></a>The Government should ensure that systems
are put in place that better inform people of the genuinely high
quality of tap water and, more importantly, of their responsibilities
to use this precious substance sparingly. Meters should be provided for
everyone, not the diminutive 28 per cent who have them at present, and
the meters should be both accessible and prominent. Consumers should be
provided with bills that show their usage and how it relates to the
consumption of others, and to their previous usage.</p><p><a name="06101348000243"></a>Of all the countries in the world,
Britain should not be precipitating itself into a water crisis. The
problems can all be solved by modifying our behaviour, and, in a few
cases, carefully planned increases in supply. But we have to act now
and be proactive and creative, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has
just said. It was extremely disappointing that the Government&#146;s
response to our report was largely a defensive reiteration of the
status
quo.</p>

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, from these
Benches I warmly thank the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and members of
the committee for giving us the opportunity to debate these important
issues of water, which we have debated less in your Lordships&#146;
House in the last few years than the issue of energy, yet water is
absolutely vital.</p><p><a name="06101348000245"></a>Noble Lords
have spoken mostly today of the demand-end of water&#151;what comes
out of the pipe and consumers use&#151;but of course that is just the
end of the process. It is important that we look at water management as
applying to the whole natural hydrological process. Rain falls on
ground that is compacted, tarmacked and polluted. It runs off too fast,
causing flooding and taking the pollution with it, so the groundwater
becomes polluted and there is a lack of refill for the aquifers, on
which my noble friend Lady Sharp spoke. However, there is a different
way. If we have the soil in the right condition, do not cover the
ground with tarmac&#151;something the Government started to address
through the sustainable urban drainage programme&#151;and have
absorbent, vegetation-rich soil, the rain can run slowly into streams
or groundwater, any pollution begins to be naturally filtered out and
we have a very different system.</p><p><a name="06101348000246"></a>It was with that natural hydrological
cycle in mind that I read the report. Having a close relationship with
that cycle comprises the perfect solution that we are looking for. The
noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said that there must not be disagreement over
these water-management issues. Those were wise words. I very much
enjoyed his speech and I look forward to hearing from him
again.</p><p><a name="06101348000247"></a>It was striking that
those who gave evidence saw one mechanism as the tool for solving many
of the problems. I refer to the water industry, the water companies,
environmental NGOs, government agencies and the European Commission. I
make no apology for quoting the comments of different bodies, as that
will prove the extent of their agreement on the solution to the
problem. Pamela Taylor of Water UK, representing the industry,
said:</p><ul><a name="06101348000335"></a>&#147;We have been
disappointed that too many organisations who ought to be playing a
major part in the Water Framework Directive are too far behind the pace
in England and Wales. In Scotland we are seeing better
strides...there is...a feeling that the Water Framework
Directive brings problems. It does not; the problems are already there.
What the Water Framework Directive does...is provide the tools for
addressing those problems...the slower we are to implement the
Water Framework Directive, the more we will be dependent on end of pipe
solutions, the more that will cost society, the more it will cost our
customers, and the less successful we will be because they are not
sustainable
options&#148;.</ul><a name="06101348000325"></a>That is the
industry&#146;s view. Your Lordships might think that it would be
very different from that of others. Dr Alastair Burn, head of water and
wetlands at English Nature, states that,
<ul><a name="06101348000346"></a>&#147;the Water Framework Directive
provides the pre-eminent mechanism to tackle things at the
catchment-wide level...it offers the opportunity for a much more
holistic approach, if implemented properly&#148;.</ul>

measure is being implemented too slowly. English Nature is frustrated
because it is not being implemented properly. Devon Wildlife Trust
wrote to me&#151;this is not from the evidence but is its comment on
the report, which it very much appreciated&#151;stating that the
water framework directive should be the benchmark for all discussions
about water, not merely a bit player. I could mention other
quotes. <p><a name="06101348000248"></a>The Water Act 2003
gave the Government an opportunity to implement the water framework
directive properly, but they did not take that opportunity. They are
implementing it in a piecemeal way and very slowly. I thoroughly agree
with the forceful comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lewis of Newnham, on
the matter although, unfortunately, he did not have time to go into it
thoroughly. It is much more expensive to fix the problems later than to
solve them through the water framework directive. The measure
concentrates on natural rather than heavy engineering solutions. The
noble Lord, Lord Howie, referred to water grids and desalination
plants. I refer to flood defences. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, referred to heavy engineering solutions. Those served us well
in the 19th century when sewerage systems and flood defences that we
would recognise today were introduced. Modern thinking on these matters
embraces the filtration systems that he so eloquently discussed, a far
softer approach of managed retreat for coastal systems and, as I said,
soil and wet woodland systems that absorb flood water. It is important
for the Minister to ensure that the water framework directive is
implemented in this country in such a way that it is very much part of
the process that I am
discussing.</p><p><a name="06101348000249"></a>I am sure that other
Members who have spoken in this debate will have received a brief from
the National Farmers&#146; Union on these issues. I was perturbed by
its comment that it felt very much excluded from UK TAG, the technical
advisory group that is advising the Government on how the process
should be implemented. The NFU feels it will be excluded until the
group has reached its conclusions, when of course it will be consulted,
along with the rest of us, local authorities and whoever.</p><p><a name="06101348000250"></a>That is the wrong way round. We should
not have a closed-door process. It is very much a matter of involving
as many stakeholders and interested parties as possible as early as
possible. When the Minister replies, I am sure that he will say that
the Environment Agency is creating the liaison panels for the river
basins. Of course it is, but those are made up of only 10 people per
region of England and among them are all the usual suspects&#151;the
Environment Agency and so on&#151;and the process has not been
widened out one bit. I must declare an interest. My husband is chair of
his local flood defence committee and a member of one of the liaison
panels; I hope he does not take my last comment as a criticism, and he
was not aware that I was going to make it. However, we need to widen
out the process and ensure that it is as inclusive as
possible.</p><p><a name="06101348000251"></a>The frustration that

coalition of groups, including conservation groups, the RSPB, angling
and consumer organisations, will shortly launch a water manifesto. It
recognises that the water framework directive represents a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to address long-term threats to our
freshwater resources and environment, and that more focus should be
paid on what society wants as the outcome for the WFD. The groups say
that they want solutions that produce the best possible outcome for
society, the economy and the environment as a whole, and not just the
aquatic environment. Every time the Government seem to address the
water framework directive, they imply that it is just about the aquatic
environment. A gentle criticism of the Select Committee&#146;s report
is that not until page 90 does it properly address the water framework
directive, although I note that the chairman, in his questioning of
witnesses, states that the WFD is critical in setting the agenda for
the entire discussion about water, so I know that he is aware of that
issue.</p><p><a name="06101348000252"></a>It is imperative that the
Government get a grip on this, not because it is a European directive,
nor because we have to do what it says&#151;although we will pay
dearly if we do not bring our water environment up to a good standard
financially&#151;but because it makes common sense in every way to
work with the directive as the means to solve all the problems. We
would want to do that even if the directive was not there. I look
forward to a more positive reply than we had in the Government&#146;s
response to this issue, which, in common with other noble Lords, I
found extremely
disappointing.</p><h5><a name="06101348000364"></a>2.28

Byford:</b> My Lords, before I start to speak on the
topic of the debate, I congratulate the Science and Technology
Committee&#151;in particular, its chairman, my noble friend Lord
Selborne&#151;on this excellent report. It is not only a sizeable and
solid work of great merit but also the committee&#146;s eighth report
in this Session. The level of commitment and application that that
represents fills me with admiration. I am delighted that many other
noble Lords who were members of the committee have taken part in the
debate. I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, on his
excellent maiden speech and we look forward to hearing him shortly in
many other debates.</p><p><a name="06101348000254"></a>As was made
clear when my noble friend set the scene for the report, there are many
aspects to this issue. The report highlighted the difficulties and made
definite suggestions. There is no clear line of responsibility; there
is a lack of accountability. There is also a lack of funding and a lack
of resource development. The report considered ways in which we could
look in greater depth at water efficiency. It looked at bills and
affordability, and at housing and planning. In particular, it
considered the ODPM&#146;s failure to take water seriously enough. I
believe that that issue is essential. If you are planning millions of
new houses, the number one key must be where the

houses more energy efficient in their use of water.</p><p><a name="06101348000255"></a>Noble Lords have touched on climate
change. The issue is not just climate change <I>per se</I>; in
different areas, things are changing in different ways. Scotland and
the west remain wetter. In the east, my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith
and I both have problems, because there is a great shortage of water.
Those who farm in the east certainly have different problems from those
who farm on the west side.</p><p><a name="06101348000256"></a>Households, businesses and agriculture
all have an effect on the future of our wildlife and biodiversity. Many
noble Lords have said that the Government&#146;s response to this
very worthwhile report is at best disappointing and at worst
complacent. I do not envy the Minister on this and would not like to be
in his shoes when he
responds.</p><p><a name="06101348000257"></a>The water framework
directive has been mentioned. When we took through the Water Act in
2003&#151;it was before the Minister took up his new post&#151;we
had long debates on the best use of water. The noble Baroness, Lady
Farrington, will well remember our exchanges. We talked about the
individual contributions that we can make. When we turn on the tap to
brush our teeth, why leave it running? Why not switch it off? There are
many different ways in which we as individuals, business and society
can preserve our scarce and precious water.</p><p><a name="06101348000258"></a>Water is a commodity that we have taken
for granted. It is like when we go into a room and just switch on a
light. Water is not always there and has to be used wisely. Somebody
said to me the other day, &#147;But rain is free; water is
free&#148;. I said to them, &#147;My goodness. Think of how we use
our rainwater. It is clearly not free and we must preserve
it&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101348000259"></a>I was concerned
that, as some noble Lords have mentioned, the report suggests that
regional boards should be set up in addition to what is already there.
I have great reservations about that, as I cannot help feeling that
such boards would simply be expensive devices for removing
responsibility for making difficult decisions from those who are or
should be paid to make them. Surely Ofwat is competent to decide on the
balance in any area of the four elements: resource development; leakage
reduction; network renewal; and demand management. Waterwise should
also be there to help and encourage the public to have a better
understanding of their
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06101348000260"></a>The Water Act
was passed in 2003 and my question to the Minister is when we will have
any of the regulations that should have come out of it. To date, I do
not think that we have had any. That is another example of words but no
action, when we certainly need action.</p><p><a name="06101348000261"></a>On those who pay and those who do not pay
for their water, I divide the issue into two. I understand that 40 per
cent of the don&#146;t-pays could afford to pay, which leaves only a
small number of people who cannot afford to pay. There has been
&#163;490 million of uncollected revenue in the past 12 months.
Surely we 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be able to introduce a system in which we can assess who cannot
afford to pay and who can afford to pay. The Government might think
about the example that is given of where water is restricted for those
who could pay but refuse to
pay.</p><p><a name="06101348000262"></a>I am quite
appalled&#151;I mentioned this when we took the Water Bill through
before it became an Act&#151;that the CAB, for example, when it sees
people with debt problems, puts the water bill a long way down the
list. Water will never be cut off. I am not suggesting that it should
be, but why should it be so low down in priorities when other things
are paid, which may include mobile phones, the lack of which would not
be life threatening by any stretch of the imagination? There are ways
of looking at that issue, including partial disconnection and smart
meters. We have meters on our
property.</p><p><a name="06101348000263"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, clearly said that we are moving to a situation where we shall
have more floods and droughts. The climate certainly seems to be moving
in that way. Some areas have to cope with flooding while other areas
try to ensure that there is sufficient water for our needs. Long-term
planning is certainly
needed.</p><p><a name="06101348000264"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Mitchell, may sit on that side of the Chamber, but I totally reiterate
his reflection of the Government&#146;s response to this excellent
report. I cannot think of anybody who has not said that the Government
could or should be doing more. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith
referred to the conflict between water use and the environment, which
is key in some of our areas, and we have to look at that
carefully.</p><p><a name="06101348000265"></a>I, too, had briefings
from the National Farmers&#146; Union, which is well aware of its
responsibilities. I declare again that I am a farmer and am reliant on
water. We do not irrigate, but we are reliant on water. Farmers&#146;
use of water is only 2 per cent of the total, which is something about
which the public are not aware. I am pleased, and congratulate the
Government that on 11 October Defra announced that its proposed capital
grant scheme will be under way to deliver catchment sensitive farming
delivery initiatives. While the budget of &#163;5 million for those
works remains, the CSFO will be undertaking preparatory work for the
launch of the scheme in April 2007. I understand that applicants will
have until 30 September to apply and four months until the end of
January 2008 to complete these works. These are very useful practical
initiatives and they are indeed welcome. Is the Minister confident that
in the &#163;200 million reduction that Defra has to find this will
not be yet another scheme that will be threatened? We would like to
have clarity on that.</p><p><a name="06101348000266"></a>From our
discussions today and the excellent contributions, we are all agreed.
We know that we as individuals have a great role to play in trying to
use our water in a sensible and conservatory manner. In our neck of the
woods we have water butts and try to collect rainwater to use on the
gardens. I cannot think why more people do not do that because plants
do better from rainwater than from tap water. But that is a minor
issue.</p>



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101348000267"></a>On demand management, we need to build
more water efficiency into our new homes. I know that that is
happening. We also need to encourage the white goods manufacturers to
develop new ways for our appliances that are less water intensive, and
also, as other noble Lords have done, stress the importance of
labelling.</p><p><a name="06101348000268"></a>We need better water
supply. Water companies and planning authorities should work more
closely together so that where new homes are built they will ensure
that the available water resource is there and supports the
infrastructure. It is only recently that the Government have said that
the Environment Agency should be part of any new developments when
undertaking basic research on that. Perhaps the Minister will confirm
that, but I think I read that recently, and it has to be
welcomed.</p><p><a name="06101348000269"></a>In the south-east,
there should be investigations on the scope for better interconnection
between local supply networks. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith
referred to that. Essex has an exchange and drawing off of its
neighbouring system, which is immensely important. Again, the flood
risk management must be part of a new management and resource
system.</p><p><a name="06101348000270"></a>We have spoken about
agriculture and its role only briefly, and then in terms of pollution,
of which the industry is well aware. We have spoken of business and
industry itself, and their responsibilities. Along with raising
consumer awareness, I would like to try to take this message not only
to every family in the country, but also into our schools. It is in our
schools that we can try to give the next generation a greater
understanding of their responsibility in the better use of
water.</p><p><a name="06101348000271"></a>It is a good and
important report. I am, again, grateful to all noble Lords who took
part. They have given the Government a great challenge. Is it not an
issue we can keep talking about; some action must happen. When the
Minister responds, he must give us answers to the questions
posed.</p><h5><a name="06101348000365"></a>2.40

Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Lord Rooker):</b> My Lords, in beginning my response
on behalf of the Government, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Crisp,
on his maiden speech. It is no mean thing. It is some five years since
I gave mine and, listening to two maiden speeches today, I was thinking
back to those days. I took lots of advice as well&#151;in a slightly
different situation, it is true. Once it is over, however, you feel a
lot better about it, and it gives you that extra confidence to get
stuck in. That is to be welcomed, and the noble Lord is certainly a
welcome addition to this House with his vast life
experience.</p><p><a name="06101348000273"></a>I have a set piece I
want to do, and I will do my best to respond to individual comments. I
must say, however, as part of the history and themes, two comments were
noteworthy. One was from the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, who was the only
one to mention that we have basically been dining out on the Victorians
for so long, in the way that he did. We have been living on a legacy,
with an endemic lack of investment and infrastructure in this country
over 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decades. The other was the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Broers,
who has probably forgotten that he once gave me a little tour of some
of the research work in Cambridge&#151;before I got the sack through
John Smith having come up with a different way of funding higher
education&#151;for which I was ever grateful. He mentioned the public
understanding of both science and infrastructure and how things work:
where your food comes from, how water comes out of the tap or the fact
that the lights come on when you flick the switch. That is absolutely
crucial and something we are lacking in this country. There is a lot of
work to be done there.</p><p><a name="06101348000274"></a>There
has been a general lack of welcome to the Government&#146;s response
to the report, which I reject. Nevertheless, a lot of positive points
have been made. There is no question that it has been a very useful
debate for the Government. The issues raised in the report need
answering in a practical way with action, rather than just ministerial
Statements. It is important, because the report will stand the test of
time for a while. There is no question that it is a comprehensive
report. I pay tribute to the chairmanship of the noble Earl, Lord
Selborne, and his introductory speech. We have made our formal
response, which is in the public domain on the Select
Committee&#146;s website.</p><p><a name="06101348000275"></a>When the sub-committee began its inquiry
in July last year, the drought in the south east had entered its ninth
month. The droughts continued up to and beyond the publication of the
report on 6 June. We are now planning for the possibility of a third
dry winter and the drought stretching into next year, using the tools
that the Government have put in place. The overarching view of the
Select Committee&#146;s recommendations, expressed in its report, is
that the existing system of water management is dispersed and unclear.
We consider that assessment unfounded, and that the water management
measures we have introduced will secure a sustainable use of water both
now and in the future.</p><p><a name="06101348000276"></a>A bit of
history, now, for which I apologise, but it is important to get these
things on the record. Since 1997, one of the Government&#146;s
priorities has been to establish a transparent and coherent regulatory
system that promotes and supports the sustainable use of water in the
short, medium and long term.</p><p><a name="06101348000277"></a>We
have, and continue to put in place, measures to ensure that companies
plan adequately for drought and for long-term water resources needs.
The provisions of the Water Act 2003 have facilitated a range of
important changes to further the sustainable use of water resources,
including modernising the abstraction licensing system, making water
company drought plans and water resource managementplans a
statutory requirement and promoting water conservation. The Act has
strengthened the voiceof water consumers through the creation
of the Consumer Council for Water, introduced improvements to the
regulatory system and increased the opportunity for competition in the
supply of water.</p><p><a name="06101348000278"></a>In October
2005, it became a statutory duty for water companies to prepare and
maintain drought 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_517"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plans. The first set of statutory plans has been submitted to the
Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales. In response to
the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, it will be for other
people to answer why the committee did not visit or mention Wales. We
do not yet know whether we will have a third dry winter. The Met Office
winter outlook shows an even chance of wetter or drier-than-average
conditions&#151;that is called hedging your bets&#151;which makes
the provision of drought plans of critical importance in planning for
the various possible rainfall scenarios. Drought plans detail how water
companies intend to balance their duty to maintain public water
supplies with the need to avoid or minimise any potential damage to the
environment.</p><p><a name="06101348000279"></a>Water resources
management plans will become a statutory requirement in April 2007. The
plans describe how each company aims to achieve a sustainable
supply-demand balance for the public water supply over a 25-year
period, take account of the best available projections for planned new
house build and consider the implications of climate change. An
important consequence of making drought and water resource management
plans a statutory requirement is that water companies will now have to
complete a public consultation on their draft plans and respond to any
representation received before publishing their final plans.</p><p><a name="06101348000280"></a>We established the Water Saving Group
last year, fulfilling a government manifesto commitment. The group
brings government, regulators and the industry together to promote the
efficient use of water in households. It meets every six months to
drive progress on its ambitious action plan, consisting of five work
streams to be completed within two years. Each work stream is led by a
different organisation, with Defra additionally having a co-ordination
role. Good progress is being made. Important research on
customers&#146; perceptions and attitudes to water and its use was
commissioned this summer by the Consumer Council for Water, and its
findings will underpin the group&#146;s future work. Waterwise is
undertaking projects to fill identified gaps in the evidence base on
water-demand management, including pilot projects with water companies.
The Environment Agency is working on a definition of water-stressed
areas and on targets and benchmarks for water efficiency. Ofwat is
developing a good practice register of water efficiency projects and is
looking at the possibility of providing incentives to developers to
install water-efficient devices by linking the infrastructure charges
that developers pay to buildings&#146; level of water efficiency.
Defra is leading on work on the policy and regulatory
framework.</p><p><a name="06101348000281"></a>A water meeting was
held by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for
the Environment on 1 June with representatives from across the water
industry to discuss the provision of water resources over the short,
medium and long term. A further meeting is planned for early December
to review progress on the issues discussed at the meeting. There was
unanimous agreement at the water meeting that a national water grid was
not 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_518"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>feasible due to its disproportionate and unjustifiable cost for the
environment and for water bills compared with its possible benefits.
That view was endorsed in the Environment Agency report, <I>Do we need
large-scale water transfers for south east England?</I>, which was
published in September. It estimated that to build five pipelines
carrying 1,100 megalitres of water per day from the northern Pennines
to London would cost up to &#163;15 billion, with a unit cost of
&#163;8 million to &#163;14 million per megalitre per day of supply
capacity. That is at least four times the unit cost of building new
reservoirs to increase supplies locally. So, like the
committee&#151;unlike my noble friend Lord Howie&#151;we agree that
a national grid is not viable. My noble friend mentioned oil, but oil
is pumped and is of course much more valuable than water, and the
economics are very different. I have expressed a personal
view&#151;</p><p><a name="06101348000282"></a><a name="spnew_31"></a><b><a name="06101348000397"></a>Lord
Howie of Troon:</b> My Lords, surely water is as
important as
oil.</p><p><a name="06101348000283"></a><a name="spnew_32"></a><b><a name="06101348000398"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am not saying that it is any
less important than oil, but that comparison is not viable in economic
terms. I was about to say that I had expressed a personal view before
from this Dispatch Box. There is no question that the population and
resources in this country are spread very unevenly. There is something
immoral about taking a resource from other areas of the country to the
south-east. Rather than build a water grid, it would be much better to
move the population and centres of government and reconfigure the
country more fairly to where there are resources. Water is just as much
an economic resource to the north, the Midlands, the north-west, the
north-east Scotland and Wales as, indeed, London is the engine of the
economy. The economics do not make sense
anyway.</p><p><a name="06101348000284"></a>The committee raised the
issue of affordability. The Government take affordability seriously and
recognise that some customers, not always with the lowest incomes, may
find it difficult to pay bills. The regulations on vulnerable groups
help people who might otherwise be afraid to limit their use of water,
possibly compromising on health and the health of others. I was
reminding officials today that in the late 1970s or early 1980s I took
myself off&#151;MPs get invited to all kinds of things&#151;to a
lecture at Guy&#146;s Hospital about public health. A scientist
showed us grids of all the great diseases that kill millions of people
and showed how over the years the number of people killed was falling.
Then he put on the grid the point at which we found a cure, and we
found that cure almost before we had eradicated the diseases. The one
common factor of eradicating most diseases was a wholesome supply of
clean water. Public health was the key. Frankly, any Government who
seek to compromise that are heading for trouble. Therefore, we have to
take this issue incredibly seriously, notwithstanding that we cannot
have freeloaders not paying for water. I fully accept that, but public
health is a crucial factor.</p><p><a name="06101348000285"></a>The
vulnerable groups regulations aim to strike a delicate balance, giving
assistance to people who not 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only need essential use of water but who also receive income-related
benefits or tax credits. We are always looking at ways to address
affordability, and we are following up the recommendations of a 2004
review on water affordability.</p><p><a name="06101348000286"></a>A
pilot study in the south-west is looking at how benefit entitlement
checks, switching to meters and water efficiency measures could help
low-income households with their water bills. Another project is
looking at the distributional effects of a range of tariffs, including
social tariffs on
customers.</p><p><a name="06101348000287"></a>Revenue owed to water
companies has increased in line&#151;they are high figures and I
accept what has been given here today and what is in the
report&#151;with the general growth of consumer debt. It is not just
a water issue. Nevertheless, we are dealing with water today. There are
big variations in debt levels in different companies, some of which
have a similar customer base. It is clear, then, that some water
companies deal with debt more effectively than others, and we are keen
to see that debt is well managed throughout the industry. There are
good practices to be learnt. We can identify those and then share them
around.</p><p><a name="06101348000288"></a>Ofwat and the Consumer
Council for Water are working together with the companies to ensure
that their debt management approaches are tailored to collect
outstanding revenues effectively. Using disconnections as a way of
enforcing payment was discussed during the 1999 review on water
charging. At that time the Government concluded that the prohibition of
disconnections was vital to protect public health and hygiene, for the
reasons I have just given. Devices which reduce the flow of water to a
trickle were banned at the same time, as they posed a similar risk to
health.</p><p><a name="06101348000289"></a>The Government are
pursuing a number of initiatives to improve water efficiency. I have
looked at the report. I would be misleading the House if I said I had
read every word, but I looked at the visits the committee made. It is
very important that visits are made. A visit to Sandwell local
authority in the West Midlands would have paid great dividends. When I
was a Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, my
experience with some of its projects for grey water and getting
economic efficiency inside old houses to modern standards was that it
is second to no other local authority in the country. In fact,
Professor Dalton, the scientific adviser for Defra, will make a visit
in the near future.</p><p><a name="06101348000290"></a>Initiatives
include the market transformation programme, considering technologies
that could reduce water consumption by things mentioned in the report
and in the debate today&#151;harvesting rain water and reusing grey
water for baths and showers. A project was started this year to develop
the necessary evidence, economic base, feasibility, and performance and
quality standards for water and a policy action plan and impact
scenarios. We must determine that to make it viable. You have to
explain to people that it is worth doing. One reason that people
understand that it is worth doing is that it saves them money. People
need the pound sign over their so-called free good. Water is not a free
good. Next week, I will be 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_520"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introducing to this House the water regulations for Northern Ireland,
where there are no water charges, no water rates and everyone thinks
that it is free rain. There is modernisation still to be done. We need
to know the cost, but we also need to consider the best use of rain
water and grey water
technologies.</p><p><a name="06101348000291"></a>Defra and the
Department for Communities and Local Government&#151;formerly the
ODPM, which has been much slagged off during this debate, a point I
shall return to in a moment&#151;are to undertake a joint
consultation on options for further regulation to secure improved water
efficiency in homes and buildings. In addition, the new code for
sustainable housing, which is to be introduced later this year, will
include a commitment to secure water efficiency savings. I understand
that that will all included in the energy part of the home information
packs to be introduced next
year.</p><p><a name="06101348000292"></a>I am trying to address the
committee's key concerns, including product labelling, which has come
up in the debate. The introduction of a mandatory EU labelling scheme
for all household water-using products, similar to that for the
energy-efficiency labelling scheme, with which I think many people are
now familiar would, we think, be complicated. The situation with water
and energy is not comparable. The fact that all energy users are
metered, together with the higher cost of energy than water, means that
the uptake of water-efficient projects would notbe comparable
with energy-efficient projects. A mandatory EU labelling scheme would
require agreement by EU states to a new directive. That may not be
straightforward, as the difference in water availability in different
member states means that the cost/benefit case is different in each
case. It will be difficult to get a decision
there.</p><p><a name="06101348000293"></a>The Government are
considering the feasibility of a voluntary labelling scheme and
evaluating the costs and benefits of such a scheme to develop the
evidence base. Focus groups with retailers, consumers and specifiers
took place this summer and the report will be published later this
year. The research that the Consumer Council for Water undertook this

useful information on the way
forward.</p><p><a name="06101348000294"></a>There has been much
mention of leakage&#151;not as much as I thought there would be, but
there is an underlying assumption that this issue must be dealt with.
The figures are quite appalling. To reduce leakage across the water
supply system, the Government extended Ofwat&#146;s powers to act
against companies that do not meet their performance standards. We are
concerned that the current framework for setting leakage targets has
neither the understanding nor the confidence of the public and does not
take proper account of the full range of costs and benefits, especially
environmental and social costs.</p><p><a name="06101348000295"></a>We would prefer a methodology for setting
leakage targets that is fit for purpose and can be explained to
customers in a way that attracts credibility and confidence. That goes
back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Broers: if there is no
understanding by the public&#151;the consumers&#151;of the issue
because it 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_521"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does not matter what the Government do or what exhortations are made, we
will not get the change in behaviour that we so urgently require. A
review of the methodology for setting leakage targets is now under way,
led by Ofwat in conjunction with Defra, the National Assembly for
Wales, the Environment Agency and the Consumer Council for
Water.</p><p><a name="06101348000296"></a>Water metering stands at
a pathetic 28 per cent. I have freely declare an interest. I asked
earlier this year whether I could have a meter in both my homes. I must
say for Thames Water&#151;much maligned&#151;that the time taken
between the knock on the front door and the guy driving away, including
everythingto be done, paperwork and the lot, was less
than10 minutes. I cannot knock that taking less
than10 minutes. I have still to hear from Severn Trent,
though, I must say. So Thames Water is not all bad, although we
understand that those who need to drive around London cannot do so
because their long-delayed attempts to fix leaks are causing chaos
elsewhere. I certainly note the criticisms. As the noble Lord, Lord
Dixon-Smith, said, it has a second-to-none performance in getting clean
water to come out of the taps, bearing in mind the number of times it
has been used. We must be balanced about the issues.
</p><p><a name="06101348000297"></a>Nevertheless,
28 per cent is pretty poor. The water companies have plans to lift that
to 47 per cent by 2014, which is not that far away, and to
two-thirds&#151;66 per cent&#151;by 2029. They have a range of
plans for doing that, including using their existing power to require
customers who moves to another house to have a meter when they apply
for a water supplier as a tenant or owner-occupier, even if nothing has
changed in the house except the customer. New dwellings have meters,
which is our problem: we have housing stock of 25 million houses, but
we build and replace only 150,000 to 180,000 a year. That is pathetic.
We will wait forever for meters, whether for energy or for water.
However, 2 million houses are marketed each year in England, of which
about 1.5 million are actually sold, so there is potential there if the
water companies can use their
powers.</p><p><a name="06101348000298"></a>I have already used up
my time, for which I apologise, because I have a whole sheaf of issues
to cover and I will have to be the worst nightmare for civil servants
as a Minister and reply to Members in a <I>billet doux</I>. There is,
however, one point that I must put on the record. I take none of this
personally, but, as I have said before, I invite any Committee, whether
of this House or the other House, to hold an inquiry on the sustainable
communities plan. The myths about this plan that are perpetuated in
almost all debates&#151;whether on housing, the energy supply, the
infrastructure, or water, which we have had again today&#151;are
massive. Unless they are rebutted, they will keep being repeated.
First, the plan did not come out of nowhere in 2003. The four growth
areas of the south-east were identified as far back as 2000-01. There
was consultation along the line. The communities plan is a vision
document; it does not set out where developments will be. All
developments are subject to the normal planning laws. The water
companies have five-year plans, which they look at 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_522"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each year, and a 25-year distribution-requirement plan. The water
companies and the Environment Agency are fully engaged. None of them
can say that the communities plan was a surprise. I fully admit that
some areas of the country were asleep, even after it was published.
They said that they did not understand what was planned in the growth
areas.</p><p><a name="06101348000299"></a>I fully accept that there
is sometimes some confusion in the public prints&#151;this is
mentioned in the report&#151;about the figure of 200,000, which
happens to be used in two different contexts. There are not 200,000
more homes in the south-east, but an extra 1.1 million, because 900,000
were already delineated in the plan, although they do not have specific
planning permission because they are for particular locations. Everyone
already knew about them. The communities plan came along with the aim
of lifting that vision over the specified period to1.1 million
homes&#151;an extra 200,000 homes. Kate Barker said quite separately
that the replacement and rebuilding programme in the country was
pathetic. It always has been; every home in this country must last for
an average of 1,000 years. Even to say that shows how stupid it is. In
Germany and France, average homes are recycled about every 100 years;
here, it is every 1,000 years. It is barmy even to say it, but that is
the reality of the number of demolitions of old dwellings and the
number of new dwellings in this country. We do need an uplift in our
output. Kate Barker used the figure of 200,000, which has sometimes got
into the lexicon as 200,000 homes for the south-east, but she was
talking about England as a whole. It was a national figure for annual
production.</p><p><a name="06101348000300"></a>There are many
issues involving the planning system, the 25-year water-infrastructure
plans, Ofwat&#146;s five-yearly price reviews, the water companies,
the Environment Agency and individual planning applications. Ashford
was a case in point. It is one of the four growth areas, albeit the
smallest. There was a real problem with the water supply both in and
out of Ashford, but it has been settled to everyone&#146;s
satisfaction. It slowed nothing down, and was a surprise to no
one.</p><p><a name="06101348000301"></a>The water companies, the
Environment Agency and the builders are more than happy with the
outcome. They are on course to deliver a visionary international city,
if we can get the trains stopping and starting there again. It was
dealt with adequately in the context of the Sustainable Communities
Plan. It is not as though a plan was imposed for all these houses which
no one knew about and then it was realised that there was not enough
water. That was not the case. All those issues were known to a greater
or lesser degree. Anyone who said, &#147;It was a surprise: we did
not know about it&#148;, frankly was not doing their job, which
applies equally to everyone, whether they were in the water companies,
the Environment Agency or anywhere else. There was a full
discussion.</p><p><a name="06101348000302"></a>The communities plan
arrived almost three years after the growth areas were set out in the
2001 plan. We were putting a greater vision on the flesh and making the
point&#151;on page 47&#151;that none of this growth would take
place unless the infrastructure was 



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>13 Oct 2006 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>put in. Nor was it just physical infrastructure: it was social
infrastructure, including police stations and doctors&#146;
surgeries&#151;I agree that these all use water&#151;as well as
housing, roads and the odd prison or two, which are also part of the
social infrastructure and have to be mentioned. It would not take place
unless the infrastructure was there. It is not a question of forcing
growth irrespective of the supply of electricity, water, further
utilities and other issues. It is set out for anyone to read.</p><p><a name="06101348000303"></a>I have said to this House and to
committees elsewhere that if they want to do an inquiry into the
Sustainable Communities Plan, they should do it, but they should read
it first. Now I will give way to the noble
Baroness.</p><p><a name="06101348000304"></a><a name="spnew_33"></a><b><a name="06101348000399"></a>Baroness
Byford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister.
My question follows what he was saying: At what stage&#151;is it
before there is any concept of it?&#151;in the planning of big, new
housing complexes are those organisations to which he referred
involved? Is it before the planning is completed and when it is just an
idea at the back of someone&#146;s mind? He is right. There is great
confusion and I would be glad for some
clarity.</p><p><a name="06101348000305"></a><a name="spnew_34"></a><b><a name="06101348000400"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, there need not be confusion,
but I will not go into great detail. Delivery vehicles have been set up
in all the growth areas, some of which are statutory, like the
development corporations, while others are voluntary, sometimes led by
the local authority and involving all the players. All of the four
particular growth areas have to go through a public examination when
they have decided where, broadly, growth will take place. So there is a
full examination in public by independent inspectors who do not come
from the department. The department has to give its evidence to the
public examination. There is a full, transparent and open
process.</p><p><a name="06101348000306"></a>When a planning
application for an individual site is submitted by a developer, whether
it is the development corporation or an individual developer, the
normal planning process kicks in, whether that is done by the local
authority, or, in the case of a statutory body, the statutory
development corporation. There are no shortcuts in the normal planning
process. Moreover, along with full planning consideration, long-term
discussions are going on into a 25-year scenario for the growth areas.
But these myths come about and are borne about by some people&#151;I
do not say anyone in this House&#151;who basically do not want the
houses built in the first place. That is what it is really about: not
accommodating houses for local people so that their children and
grandchildren have to disappear to other regions of the country. That
is because most of the growth in the south-east comes from indigenous
growth.</p>

I am fairly confident that action is being taken and we can make
