<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Butler of Brockwell </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How they propose to ensure that changes in National Health Service funding do not adversely affect provision of medical services in universities.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, the new contract for general medical services has been negotiated between the NHS Confederation and the General Practitioners Committee of the BMA. It will provide practices on most campuses, with the same method of funding and earning opportunities that will be available to all general medical services practices. A minimum practice income guarantee for basic general medical services will be available to prevent financial instability.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Butler of Brockwell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer. Is he aware that the proposed capitation rates for young people do not make adequate allowance for the special needs of university students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time and who, as a matter of fact, make greater demands on their GPs than is the norm for their age group? In particular, the capitation rates make inadequate provision for the Government's other admirable initiatives on health, mental health, sex education and the prevention of drug abuse. Will the Minister please give an undertaking that the capitation rates are adjusted to make adequate allowance for the needs of university students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the new formula for general practice remuneration has been designed to address historic inequalities in funding primary care. The contract, and the basis of the contract, was voted on by GPs themselves. Some 79 per cent of the GPs who voted accepted the new contract basis, and that was based on a 70 per cent turnout. So we are not at this point in the business of introducing new changes into the format of the contract. It will, however, be kept under review.
<P>

<a name="40115-01_para0"></a>Under the new arrangements, primary care trusts have been given a duty to ensure that they can enter into specialist contracts&#151;in areas of high student population, for example. If there was a particular need for sexual health, mental health or substance abuse services, the PCT would make specialist contract arrangements for those services.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a patient of the Imperial College health centre. I asked a Question on this subject on 8 May last year and the Answer I was given concerned the minimum practice income guarantee. I have now looked into the matter further, and it turns out that this will be based on statistics data gathered for three quarters of a year. This will include the summer months, when the academic practices are quieter and GPs and their staff tend to go on leave to fit in with the efficiency of the practice. More seriously, there will be an adverse effect on patient number records: students who leave will come off the list in July and replacement students will not return to augment the list until November. This will create a very artificial situation. In addition, capitation will be greatly reduced by all those months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Question!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, the Minister talks about opportunities for earning money from services such as sexual health. Westminster primary care trust has already said that it cannot possibly do that as it will not have enough funds, so that option is not available. Will the Minister tell me what specific measures he will take to deal with this unique situation and to see that the strange situation of capitation is taken into consideration in the present negotiations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I think I have made it clear that we are not revisiting the basis of this contract, which has been negotiated over 18 months between the NHS Confederation and the BMA's General Practitioners Committee. I can see that the noble Baroness is concerned about this, but her Question was quite long, so I hope I may be allowed a couple of sentences to reply. The new contract is meant to rebalance remuneration so that those GPs with the highest workloads and the highest prevalence of illness in their practices are suitably remunerated. As I said, the system will be kept under review. It is down to PCTs to contract for specialist services. It is worth reminding the noble Baroness that PCTs now have at their disposal 75 per cent of NHS expenditure for commissioning particular services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </B>   My Lords, may I, in declaring an interest as chief executive of Universities UK, reinforce the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell? I appreciate that the situation will be kept under review, but it is worth remembering that the turnover rates among students on campus in GP practices is 25 per cent to 30 per cent, whereas the average for most areas is 10 to 15 per cent. I hope that this can be taken into account, because there is real concern that this will have an impact on the staffing of medical centres.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the system will be kept under review by an independent UK-based group of experts. But there is no getting away from the fact that we have revamped this contract so that doctors who have the <P>


<a name="column_675"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 675</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>heaviest workloads with the highest prevalence of illness are reimbursed accordingly. With the full co-operation of the profession, we are remedying historical anomalies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give us assurances on the mental health issues? Many PCTs already find it quite difficult to meet the demands in their areas for support for mental health problems. Students under stress often raise new problems. Can we be assured that they will be given the long-term support that they need?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, it is down to the PCTs at the local level to assess the medical needs of their communities and enter into the contracts that meet those needs. That will include mental health. As I said, there is now a duty on PCTs to do that work and ensure that doctors and services are appropriately geared up for those particular service needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Butler of Brockwell: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that it is not an adequate answer to say that the great majority of GPs have supported the contract, because this is a specialist need in special circumstances? I should like to underline the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, that it is also a cop-out to say that the primary care trusts will provide for this. They simply do not have the money to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I gently say to the noble Lord that the Government are increasing NHS expenditure by 7 per cent in real terms over a five-year period. That is an unprecedented historical high. It is simply not true that there are not the resources in the NHS to buy the services that are needed. As I have said on several occasions, it is down to the people at the local level to meet the service needs of their particular area with the resources available. The contract was negotiated with the profession over 18 months. It takes account of the needs of doctors who work in university areas, and the profession has overwhelmingly supported this contract.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is a lot of concern about this question? He said that the contract is continuously under review&#151;as is everything else. Will he give us a time span&#151;and review it again in six months?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, we have already agreed with the profession to carry out a review in October after six months' experience of the new contract.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, the first stage of the bid&#151;the applicant questionnaire&#151;was delivered to the International Olympic Committee to meet today's deadline of 15 January. The Government will continue to work closely with all others involved to develop the outline proposals in the questionnaire.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, a year ago there was unanimous support in a debate in this Chamber urging the Government to support a London Olympic bid in 2012. Will the Minister convey congratulations from these Benches and, I am sure, from across the House, to the bid committee on their success in meeting this week's IOC deadline with professionalism, commitment and dedication? Will the Government match that commitment today by announcing that the direction of the tax take on the proposed Olympic lottery game will go to the London Olympics and will not, as proposed, be pocketed by the Chancellor for other purposes? Will the Government also announce the launch of an Olympic sports lottery game this summer at the time of the Athens games to maximise revenue both for our able-bodied and disabled sporting organisations, which is permitted by the International Olympic Committee?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040115/text/40115-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, for his opening comments. I will indeed convey those congratulations. Indeed, I hope that he will have an opportunity to do that himself when he is present with others at the launch of the application.
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para0"></a>On his further points, he will know that it was decided that there should be a Treasury take of 12 per cent on the National Lottery under his government, in 1994. It was intended to be revenue neutral&#151;to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue from other taxable activities from which lottery money had been diverted.
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para1"></a>On the point about the start of the specific Olympic lottery, he will know that the International Olympic Committee does not permit a lottery of this kind for the benefit of the bid to be started before a candidate has been chosen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister assure us on behalf of the Government that the whole of Whitehall&#151;indeed, the whole of the London government structure&#151;is fully co-ordinated and involved in preparing for this bid? Furthermore, will he assure us that he will study the process as it proceeds so that we can build a model for future cross-government and local government co-operation that could be used for any future bids for games or cultural events? That would ensure that we would have another substantial gain from the process of bidding for the Olympics.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly give the assurance that there has been a cross-Whitehall group to provide advice and assistance to London 2012. <P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 677</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I can go further&#151;there have been a series of meetings between senior representatives of the Government, the Mayor of London, the British Olympic Association and London 2012. This has been an example of good co-operation. Developing a model for the future is certainly an interesting idea. However, it is our intention to win this application and not to have to enter another Olympic application for several years after 2012.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I return to the Answer that the Minister kindly gave me, and ask him to reconsider both answers. First, with a hypothecated game, which requires separate primary legislation, as the legislation is going through another place and will come to this House, would he not agree that it is perfectly possible to ensure that the tax take goes directly to the games? Indeed, our Benches would support that if an amendment to the Bill were tabled. We believe that it is essential, and that the public who bought tickets would wish that to be the case.
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para2"></a>Secondly, we will be calling for a game to be launched this summer, at the time of the Athens games, under the legislation that the Government are bringing to Parliament. Does the Minister accept that, as long as the game is not exclusively for the purposes of the London 2012 bid but is for Olympic sports and disabled sporting organisations, it can be launched at the time of the Athens Olympics this summer with the full backing of the IOC?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am tempted to give the same answers to the same questions. On the issue of the Treasury take, it ought to be said that it would be a difficult precedent to sustain if we were to say that one section of the good causes that benefit from the lottery should be affected by the 12 per cent Treasury take and other parts should not. There would be a good deal of indignation on that score.
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para3"></a>The same answer applies to the noble Lord's second question. I believe that he is saying that we might start to collect money for Olympic-related purposes, and I agree with him that the International Olympic Committee would probably accept that interpretation. However, what would happen if we did not win, for example? What would be the reaction of those who expect to benefit from the other good causes, which have a good deal of support in this House and in the country?

<P>

<a name="40115-02_para4"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>


<a name="column_678"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 678</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para5"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government how many professorial appointments are currently vacant in United Kingdom medical schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the Government do not collect the information that the noble Lord has requested. However, we are aware that the Council of Heads of Medical Schools is undertaking a UK-wide survey of the number of posts and vacancies, which will be published soon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the Minister will know the outcome of that survey, which shows 84 vacancies among professorships in medical schools in the UK. He will also be aware of the recent report in the Times that medical schools are short of some 80 professors. That is the equivalent of one in 10 of the professorships in the 24 British medical schools. The percentage of vacancies among senior lecturers and so on is even higher. What is the explanation for that? How do the Government account for those vacancies, and what will be the effect on the training of medical students who have increased by substantial numbers since 1998?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I do not have officially the information that the noble Lord has cited. The council carrying out the survey is an independent body, and it is for the council to put the information in the public arena. I understand that the figure that he has cited has some familiarity to me, but it is not the formal figure that the council has put in the public arena.
<P>

<a name="40115-02_para6"></a>It is worth reminding the noble Lord that, as he said, the medical school student intake has risen from just over 5,000 in 1997&#150;98 to more than 6,700 in 2002&#150;03. The money for that has come from the Higher Education Funding Council. When institutions have bid for that money to increase their student intake, they have all given assurances that they can recruit the staff necessary to carry out their obligations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Turnberg: </B>   My Lords, is not the problem a reflection of the fact that clinical academic medicine is no longer such an attractive proposition, and that for many it is becoming very unattractive? Is it not also the case that the report from the Academy of Medical Sciences, of which I happen to be vice-president, will go some way to remedying some of those problems, if the proposals are taken up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. There have been some long-standing problems with regard to clinical medicine but, under this Government, the National Clinician Scientist Award Scheme was introduced in response to the Saville report to tackle disincentives in this area. Sixty-five awards have been made on a five-year personal basis to stimulate recruitment in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, how will the new fee arrangements proposed by the Government affect medical students? Given that clinical medicine is no longer such an attractive profession and that the <P>


<a name="column_679"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 679</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>report in the Times indicated that the problem arises because clinical academics are moving into work for the NHS, surely the problem will be exacerbated if students have accumulated a very large debt over the many years that they have to train.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the Government's position on the future of higher education is set out in the White Paper and will be pursued through the Higher Education Bill. Department of Health Ministers have made it clear that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students undertaking medical training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, the Government gave an assurance that they would ensure parity between clinical academics and NHS consultant posts. How far have they got with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I understand that there is parity. It is worth bearing in mind that the BMA announced, on 12 January, that an overall majority of clinical academics voted for the new contract for consultants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell us how much a professor of medicine gets paid? Could he tell us how much the Government supply to individuals to bring them up and to make them take the appointment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, those are matters for individual universities. I shall make some inquiries about the average figure and write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. I understand exactly what she has said, but does she agree that it is in the public interest of the inhabitants of both our nations if the due process of law is applied by the United States courts to fill what our English Court of Appeal has described as the "legal black hole" that now exists in relation to the detainees in Guantanamo? Does she also agree that the concept of the due process of law is deep-rooted in our Anglo-American legal heritage, and that it is very important in terms of the wider interests of diplomacy that we demonstrate to the wider world that we apply that process on both sides of the Atlantic, even to suspected terrorists or people designated as enemy combatants?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the Government always espouse the importance of the rule of law, no matter which country we are talking about. As we have previously discussed in your Lordships' House, one major difficulty about the Guantanamo Bay detainees has been the question of their status. We discussed this on 15 October, and the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, said that it was a difficult situation that needed to be resolved. The question now before the United States Supreme Court is a matter of United States constitutional law. The Supreme Court of the United States must decide by due process what is right on this question of jurisdiction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, if, as is rumoured, some of these detainees who are British nationals are returned to this country, the Minister will agree, like all of us, that they could not conceivably be held without charges. Has the Minister heard the suggestion in some legal circles that some of these detainees, by taking up arms against this country as British nationals, could be charged with the ancient crime of treason? Treason can be committed on foreign soil, as all precedents in the law courts here prove. Either way, will she assure us that the appropriate authorities are finding out now, in anticipation of this move, what the alleged crimes of these British nationals are, and are preparing the ground before these individuals arrive back here and, as a result of no charges, are immediately released? That would raise serious questions for terrorism and public security.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I have heard a number of suggestions about what might be done. Some of those suggestions are fanciful; others are serious. The noble Lord is right to draw our attention to the issue of security. There are important issues concerning the fair trial, if it was to take place, of any of the Guantanamo Bay detainees. There are also important issues about security. In discussing this question, it is wrong for us to focus entirely on one of <P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those sets of issues and to ignore the important issues that the noble Lord has raised. I am grateful to him for doing that.
<P>

<a name="40115-03_para0"></a>I expect that he will be anticipating the answer that the question of any charges is clearly not an issue for Her Majesty's Government. I am sure that the appropriate authorities will look at a whole range of issues, but that is not a question that is for me or for any of my colleagues as Ministers to decide. In this country we have the appropriate separation of powers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, negotiations have been going on for months between Her Majesty's Ministers and the American authorities. Will the Minister say whether the Government have yet succeeded in obtaining evidence against the British citizens and former residents, which might enable them to be charged with crimes? Have the Government obtained the intelligence from the American authorities that would enable proper precautions to be taken in this country when these people are returned to this country, which I hope will be soon?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the individuals involved have been detained for a long time&#151;about two years. The two-year point passed just a few days ago. However, we have not been in negotiations for those two years; we have been in negotiations since the designations were made over Mr Abassi and Mr Begg earlier this year. I want to stress to the noble Lord that at no point have those negotiations been about the evidence. They have been about trying to secure a fair trial. The question of evidence is not a matter that would be appropriate for the Government to be negotiating on. As the noble Lord would expect, I am not able to discuss matters of intelligence from the Dispatch Box. I remind him that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, when asked in an interview with Sir David Frost on 11 January 2003 about the length of time that it has taken, said that he hoped that one way or another the issue would be resolved in the next few weeks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I must declare that I am one of the 175 Members of both Houses on whose behalf my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill is acting. Is the Minister aware that the USA has applied its environmental protection laws to the base at Guantanamo Bay, with the result that the rights of endangered species of lizard are protected by American law, while the rights of prisoners, so far, are not? More importantly perhaps, what is the Government's view on the extent to which the circumstances at Guantanamo Bay comply with American obligations under international law, particularly under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the USA is a party?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord goes to the heart of the issue. I understand why he raised the fact that the United States has applied environmental law, and I take his point about the juxtaposition of lizards on the one hand and human beings on the other. This goes to the heart of <P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 682</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the issue that is going before the Supreme Court. The question that the noble Lord asked about the application of American law elsewhere, in relation to Guantanamo Bay, is the question of jurisdiction and where the legal writ runs. I am not an extremely able and clever lawyer like the noble Lord. But even I can see that the point in the noble Lord's question is highly prejudicial to the overall point that is now going before the Supreme Court and which the noble Lord and many able parliamentarians will be a party to arguing before the Supreme Court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm a claim made in yesterday's Financial Times by a director of Amnesty International that many of the Guantanamo Bay detainees were not captured in Afghanistan, but were seized in countries as far apart as Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Gambia and Pakistan, and therefore are not, strictly speaking, enemy combatants. If that is so, do any of the British detainees fall into that category?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, that goes back to the whole question of what we mean by an "unlawful combatant". An "unlawful combatant" need not necessarily be someone captured on the field of combat, it may be someone in a supporting role. I do not wish to get into this difficult question, which has not been resolved, about the definition of what we mean by "unlawful combatant". The noble Lord is right; a number of individuals have been detained in a variety of circumstances and some have claimed that the ways in which they were detained were unlawful, and some have claimed that the ways in which they were detained meant that they were mistreated. I am aware of a range of issues that are claimed by those who are detained in Guantanamo Bay.

<a name="40115-03_para7"></a>Clause 1 [Transfer to Secretary of State of functions relating to Judicial Appointments Commission]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 5, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Lord Chancellor"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-03_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40115-03_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I understand that the expression "Secretary of State" in Clause 1 is intended to mean Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. I should be most grateful if the Minister would confirm that when he replies. We have no objection to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs having these new responsibilities set out in Clause 1, as long as the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs is also the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor is constitutionally the member of the Cabinet responsible for the selection of the judiciary. He is also the head of the judiciary.
<P>

<a name="40115-03_para10"></a>However, we are aware from various statements in your Lordships' House and from observations made in the press that there is an intention to remove the Lord Chancellor from his current constitutional responsibilities and replace him by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.
<P>

<a name="40115-03_para11"></a>That is only an intention; we do not know whether it will come about. Even if it does, we do not know what will be the scope of the constitutional responsibilities of the new Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs with respect to the selection of judges. In those circumstances, we believe that our amendment to replace "Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs" by "Lord Chancellor" in Clause 1 is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40115-03_para12"></a>I have one other question to ask the Minister on this clause. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the intention for the change in Clause 1 is to establish a Judicial Appointments Commission. Yet if your Lordships glance at the scope of the amendments to the 2002 Act in Schedule 1 to the Bill, you will see that they extend not only to Section 3(2)(b) of the 2002 Act, but also to Sections 5(3), 5(4), 5(6) and 5(7). That suggests that the Bill's scope is intended to apply not only to the appointment of the Judicial Appointments Commission but to the operation of the process of selecting judges in Northern Ireland once it is set up. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, signalled, I am accepting these amendments. As noble Lords know, we have indicated our intention to legislate in relation to the office of the Lord Chancellor and a Bill will be introduced before long. Meanwhile, we can see both the tact and the purity of continuing to refer to the Lord Chancellor while he is still in that position. It also has the slight advantage, from my perspective, that I do not need to argue different positions in Parliament on almost sequential days. So I am happy to accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para0"></a>As to the interesting and difficult question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the short answer is that, quite clearly, the Bill itself takes precedence over <P>


<a name="column_684"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I very much welcome the Government's decision to accept the amendments tabled in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Kingsland. I was unable to speak on Second Reading due to illness, but I should like to make a few short points at this stage.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para3"></a>I wonder whether it is possible to think of another example where a democratic government&#151;with all the facilities that implies, and with such extensive and expert advice as they have at their disposal&#151;have had the capacity to make such complete and utter blunders as this Government have done with two important pieces of social legislation. In my short experience in your Lordships' House I have seen a new Northern Ireland Police Bill brought back for revision within a three-year period, and I now find a new justice Bill returning within less than two years. That is bad enough, but in both cases such incompetence has followed a comprehensive review in the areas under consideration.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para4"></a>Worse is to come. It appears that such is the perversity of the Government that both revisions are bound only to compound the difficulties and mistakes. We already see the inadequacies of our policing legislation where crime in Northern Ireland is having an increasingly negative effect on our society. As I said, I realise that this is not a Second Reading debate. However, I think that I should make these general points now rather than doing so repeatedly throughout our consideration in Committee. I apologise and ask for your Lordships' leave.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para5"></a>In 2002, I cautioned against the idea of vesting in the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland any authority which until then had been within the bailiwick of the Lord Chancellor. I explained why it should not happen, I emphasised why it would fail, and I was right&#151;we have failure. I am a layman in this area, but the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton is not. Today he is entrusted with a matter of national and international import. Yet, on Second Reading of the 2002 Act, he cautioned:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Under the changes set out in the Bill, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, at the present time a unionist and a nationalist, who are two very active politicians, will have a very important part to play in appointments. They will also appoint the lay members of the Judicial Appointments Commission. There is <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_685"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 685</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>bound to be some concern that political considerations will come into play in making appointments".&#151;[Official Report, 3/5/02; col. 970.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-04_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40115-04_para7"></a>Bearing in mind the observation of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, I ask the Minister whether political appointees will not in turn be bound to make political appointments themselves. Any clause removing reference to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister should do so on the basis that, as the review advised, no commission should be set up prior to the devolution of criminal justice. The recent election has shown how more people are becoming disappointed with the way in which the Belfast agreement is being distorted by government. Let us not add further to that concern.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para8"></a>If devolution of criminal justice could not happen, for reasons beyond their control, when David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were in office, is it any more likely to happen when Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams are, in theory if not in fact, vested with the responsibility?
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, pointed out almost two years ago that the review had found 77 per cent of the population expressing confidence in the fairness of judges and magistrates. Was that not a thoroughly satisfactory position? Why tinker further with what works? When this question was posed previously in respect of Messrs Trimble and Mallon we were informed that the Government were not planning for failure. Well, why are they now planning for certain failure?
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para10"></a>I had intended to support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. Now, in accepting the concession that has been made, I reiterate an earlier point. It has not escaped me that although "Secretary of State" could in fact refer to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, many of us believed that it could have been intended to refer to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. That point is different from the one made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. "Secretary of State" is interchangeable, so let us cut out any duplicity and go unequivocally for "Lord Chancellor". I was about to say that I support the amendment. However, since a concession has been made, I shall not press the issue.

(a) in subsection (5)(a), for "five" substitute "six", and
<br>
(b) in subsection (5)(c), for "five" substitute "four"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-04_para38"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment returns to one of the old arguments that we debated in the 2002 Bill, now the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. Where the Government and ourselves are completely at odds over the Bill and some of the provisions it attempts to make is that we wish to keep the judicial processes in Northern Ireland depoliticised. It appears to me that Her Majesty's Government are determined to politicise them. That makes no sense.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para39"></a>As I mentioned at Second Reading, the Bill as drafted is totally irrelevant. One of the objectives that all parties should have is to maintain the peace process. As has been said on a number of occasions previously, by the Prime Minister and others, and my honourable friend David Lidington and myself, we have to restore the confidence of the Unionist electorate. The Bill does nothing to achieve that. That is well understood. It was well argued by me at Second Reading. I make no apology for repeating the argument today because it is vital to our discussions in Committee and throughout the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40115-04_para40"></a>As regards the amendments, although there is a case for a significant lay element in appointments of the judiciary to help transparency&#151;we accept that&#151;it is <P>


<a name="column_687"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 687</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>vital that judiciary should be seen to be in the majority. The risk of politicisation is not merely overt: it can be insidious. Only the judges are in a position to decide who should be chosen on merit. The balance at present is tipped strongly the wrong way and should be corrected. The fact that the Lord Chief Justice and five judges could be outvoted on this commission can make no sense if one has the objective of maintaining that the judicial system be depoliticised and clear of political influences. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I support the amendment. With the Committee's leave, I wish to speak to my Amendment No. 25. The two amendments are interrelated and could well have been grouped. I hope to save the Committee's time.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para0"></a>As initially with Clause 1, I regret that I am unable to support Clause 2. It is poorly thought out in terms of its practicality and its consequences. There are many areas in Northern Ireland where decisions which are reflective of the community are both desirable and essential. But there are also specialist areas where, unfortunately, it is not practicable. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para1"></a>An essential point I must make is that the commission will be tasked, quite nonsensically, with the appointment of every judicial office save that of four judges. The only exceptions are the Lord Chief Justice and the three Lords Justices of Appeal. Unbelievably, the 17 High Court judges are not treated as senior judicial figures within the terms of this legislation but are simply lumped together with 30 or so other categories which are listed in Schedule 1. What element of society that is permitted to be part of the lay element&#151;and which precludes those who have ever held judicial office or have been barristers or solicitors&#151;is able to make an informed judgment as to who may be best suited to be a High Court judge?
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para2"></a>By virtue of my 18 years in another place and over two years in your Lordships' House I might be considered to be reasonably informed about social and community matters. However, it would be presumptuous to suggest that I would have any tangible assets that would qualify me to appoint High Court judges. I understand why Amendment No. 23 seeks to go some way towards ensuring that professionals, as distinct from amateurs, form a significantly larger part of the commission.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para3"></a>My amendment seeks to deal in part with that requirement at new subsection (8)(b) of the 2002 Act that lay membership of the commission will be reflective of the community. I shall deal with that in some detail when we debate Clause 3.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para4"></a>At this stage I want to deal with the matter of competency&#151;something that is not ensured within the Bill. When the Minister spoke at Second Reading she said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Merit has been and will continue to be the overriding principle for judicial appointments".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1092.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-05_para5"></a>
In the light of new subsection (8)(b) I cannot be wrong in assuming that this is not to be the primary criterion for those who will make the judicial appointments. Surely that is inconsistent.
<P>


<a name="column_688"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 688</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para6"></a>I do not say that my amendment is better but I believe that it is more practical and realistic. We cannot expect people who are not appointed on merit to understand and implement the meritocratic system when it comes to the appointment of judicial persons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I support the amendment. I reserve, with sympathy, my position on the amendment spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. I say "with sympathy" because I fully understand, and was influenced by, the way in which he supported it. However, I want to hear what the noble Baroness will say in reply. I think that she faces a difficult task in this part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para7"></a>As we have been reminded, the Government insist, correctly, that merit shall be the overriding and dominant criterion for the appointment to the judiciary. That must be right. However, I believe that most people will have difficulty in seeing by what means lay members of an appointments commission can measure judicial merit. I suggest that judicial merit has to be assessed by reference to an informed knowledge and understanding of the record of a particular candidate. By that I do not mean the record in terms of political convenience to one politician or another but in terms of serving the rule of law in a manner that we expect of our judiciary; that is, impartially, without fear or favour and bringing high qualities of character and intellect to bear. For the life of me I see great difficulty, if I were a lay member, in assessing those qualities or, indeed, any of them. I can, however, see dangers of a public perception that lay members will be expected to bring political considerations to bear.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para8"></a>I very much hope that the noble Baroness will answer the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, on why High Court judges are included in this measure and not exempt from it, as are the Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal under the terms of the Bill. When I say "exempt" from it, I mean that they are excluded from what we are talking about at the moment. It seems to me that that distinction is important as the High Court judge will hear applications for judicial review regarding abuse of executive power. That is an immensely important development in our law brought about virtually exclusively by the judiciary and not by Parliament for reasons that we can well understand. All politicians expect, or at least hope, to be in government themselves and do not want to have tiresome judges looking at the way in which they have taken a decision. It is the High Court judge in Northern Ireland, as in England and Wales, to whom application is made for judicial review and who will decide those matters of great political importance, as they sometimes are. Therefore, I hope that the noble Baroness will explain why the High Court judge is to be subject to this method of appointment whereas the even more senior judges are not.

<a name="40115-05_para9"></a>Finally, the whole question of lay participation in an appointments commission is a very difficult one indeed if one is seeking to justify these reforms by reference to the need to improve public confidence in the judiciary.

<FONT SIZE=3>particularly confident in our surgeon in the knowledge that he had been chosen by a majority of lay people rather than by a majority of his fellow professionals. One can make the same point, perhaps even more vividly, when talking about the selection of airline pilots or the engineers who ensure that the maintenance is properly carried out. Therefore, there is considerable difficulty regarding the concept of the participation of lay people. I believe that that difficulty is confounded and made much worse by the proposal regarding equal numbers. For that reason I support the amendment moved by my noble friend.

<A NAME="40115-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, referred to his Amendment No. 25, with the leave of the Committee I shall speak to both at once, if the opposition Benches are comfortable with that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   Before the noble Lord does so, perhaps I may also speak to Amendment No. 25. I wish to make two brief points on Amendment No. 25. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that this would be, and could be, a useful amendment if the Minister cannot see his way to giving way on Amendment No. 23. It is a rather small safeguard but it is something in the form of a safeguard which would perhaps help public confidence in the way that my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew pointed out. The clause as it stands gives neither public confidence nor clarification in any shape or form and will certainly not support the merit principle. At this stage of the Bill I seek some form of amendment from the Government to put those problems right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I turn first to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. He spoke of the importance of depoliticising judicial appointments. The Government could not agree more. As the noble Lord will be well aware, that has been at the heart of the proposals on which we have consulted with regard to England and Wales. I do not wish to stray into that further.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para10"></a>The establishment of a Judicial Appointments Commission for Northern Ireland is part of such a process. At present judicial appointments in Northern Ireland are made by a politician&#151;the Lord Chancellor. He does a particularly good job regarding that process. Nevertheless, those appointments are made by a politician through a process that, while I do not think for a second anyone necessarily says is corrupt or flawed, is opaque. It is not transparent and it is not apparent how that process is carried out. That goes to the heart of why&#151;touching on one of the questions that have been raised&#151;we think that it is right to bring the Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill to the House at this time. We see that there is a need, justification and merit in establishing a Judicial Appointments Commission for Northern Ireland in advance of whenever devolution may be restored as it has fundamentally important benefits to deliver. I say no more now but shall touch on that later, if need be.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para11"></a>I turn to the question that the noble Lord raised regarding the argument that the judiciary should be in a majority on such a body. As I am sure the Committee will recall, the arithmetic of the commission, as established by the 2002 Act, provides for six judicial members, one of whom is a lay magistrate, and two professional lawyers&#151;a barrister and a solicitor. So, effectively, out of a total membership of 13, including the chairman, it has eight judicial professional members and five lay ones. That does not exactly meet the preference that the noble Lord expressed&#151;he would have preferred a majority of the judiciary&#151;nevertheless eight out of the 13 members of the commission will be deeply seasoned in the law, legal processes and legal systems. Therefore, there will be no lack of depth of understanding of the importance of the judicial process and the skills that might be required to fulfil office as a judge in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para12"></a>The further argument was made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and others that the lay members have no function at all, or they should have a function only if they are expert in some way in legal processes. I believe that that short changes the role of the commission. If one casts one's mind back to the functions of the commission, one sees that they certainly include making recommendations or decisions on judicial appointments. However, they go wider than that. Over a period of time&#151;perhaps we shall discuss this later&#151;the members of the commission consider how they can try to widen the diversity within the judiciary subject&#151;as it always must be&#151;to the fundamental prior test of merit. They also try to ensure that in all parts of our society, certainly not least in Northern Ireland, the public have confidence in the judiciary. That is crucial. I shall not for a second argue that the members of the judiciary in Northern Ireland are seen as anything other than talented, incorruptible and brave in terms of how they have coped during the past 20 or 30 years. However, they are not necessarily always regarded as being in touch with, or understanding, ordinary society, as is the case in England and Wales. That is one of the reasons for appointing lay members to the Judicial Appointments Commission.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para13"></a>Anyone who has sat on a board or a committee knows that it is very difficult to compartmentalise individual members of a board vis-a-vis certain functions. In certain decisions it is undoubtedly the case that certain people on a board have a particular weight because of the depth of their knowledge, their experience and their ability to marshal arguments and evidence. On some decisions one would expect, without in any way implying that one should fetter it through legislation, the judicial members, the lawyers, to be very powerful indeed in their expression of the importance of certain criteria and whether certain candidates meet those criteria.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para14"></a>In other areas the lay members could be expected to have a powerful contribution to make. So I do not think that there is a need to specify or limit that in legislation. If anything, the arithmetical balance, as expressed in the 2002 Act leans powerfully towards&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;professional lawyers or the <P>


<a name="column_691"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 691</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judiciary. I make no issue of that, whatever. But it is necessary to move forward now on making that change, because there are important issues to address in terms of confidence, diversity and not necessarily waiting until devolution has been restored. In other words, the Government have a position on the merit of judicial appointment commissions across the United Kingdom, notwithstanding where we are on devolution.
<P>

<a name="40115-05_para15"></a>The short answer to why we allow the Judicial Appointments Commission to appoint high court judges is that we were minded, as we indicated in the 2002 Act, to accept recommendation 81 of the review body. We felt that had merit. I will shortly be reminded if it is the case that I have probably not necessarily given satisfaction in my general comments, but have sought to address most of the specific issues that can be answered now. For those reasons it is right to establish the Judicial Appointments Commission now. Its balance is as right as it can be and there is no need to limit the specific roles of membership; given my points about balance and about how commissions, committees or boards work in practice, whereby certain members have particular influence on certain issues, as is right and proper. For those reasons I hope that I have at least given pause for thought to the committee on the two amendments.

<A NAME="40115-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   Returning almost to the beginning of the Minister's remarks, I wish that I was a shorthand writer, because I would not be groping for the noun he used when he said that the judiciary&#151;and he paid it a graceful and well-deserved compliment&#151;was not always seen as being in touch with ordinary, I think he said, "people", although it might have been "life", "society" or "standards". I cannot remember. But the sense was that a significant proportion of people in Northern Ireland did not find the judiciary in touch. Where is the evidence for that? Northern Ireland is a community of around 1.6 million, extending over six counties; and the judges have been educated almost entirely in maintained schools there, not private schools. They live cheek-jowl with the people whose cases come before them. I would be surprised if there were any significant evidence to support that statement. Could the Minister help?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am pleased that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, recognised that I have great respect and some, if limited, direct experience of, the judiciary in Northern Ireland in my current role as the Courts Minister. We are talking about perception, not necessarily always about reality. My evidence came from the Criminal Justice Review of March 2000, when in a survey of Northern Ireland's population, 66 per cent thought that the judges were out of touch with ordinary people's thought. There is no great shock there; one would obtain similar figures if the same question were asked in England and Wales. It does not automatically mean that it is true. I am just making the point that there is an issue of confidence. <P>


<a name="column_692"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 692</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>When reasons for such views were explored, people thought that judges came from a particular social class&#151;they may have been wrong&#151;and were therefore seen as isolated from the community and unable to understand ordinary lives. We shall return to those issues in other Bills.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para0"></a>There may not always be proof and substance in all those allegations. The argument over why it matters is that judges have to make difficult decisions at times; and the media and the popular press are perhaps over eager to criticise them, saying that they made wrong judgments in difficult cases. Therefore, it is a worry for society if too large a gulf opens between the public's perception of judges, who might be caricatured as being out of touch with reality, and the judgments. If those are put together there is a slight risk that the confidence of the public, particularly in the criminal justice system, is weakened. I shall not make too much of that. All I would say is that the Judicial Appointments Commission is one contribution towards ensuring that the process of selecting judges is, and over a period of time the composition of the judiciary is seen to become, more reflective of society&#151;particularly regarding gender, where the differences are greatest, both in England and Wales and Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I am quite astonished at the suggestion from the Minister that somehow in the Bill we are talking about make-believe and not about reality. I think he used the term "talking about perceptions". In other words, we are talking about make-believe rather than reality. I have lived for well in excess of 60 years in Northern Ireland. Whatever may be the perception of the judiciary in other parts of the United Kingdom, in Northern Ireland we are a small parochial community. The judges come from no particular stratum of society. In fact, society in Northern Ireland is not stratified in the way that it is, perhaps, in England. So there is not a particular question of detachment from the judiciary. It is a pity that we are looking at what can only be interpreted by people like myself as a levelling down. Instead of enhancing the confidence of the community in the way in which the judiciary is appointed, we are seeking to call into question something that should not be and are therefore undermining the confidence of our community.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para1"></a>The reality over 30 difficult years of dealing on a daily basis&#151;on an hourly basis&#151;with terrorism is that throughout that period the judiciary was seen to be even-handed to the point of what some might have claimed to be liberalism, under the circumstances. I am not at all convinced by the comments that I have heard. I am certainly not convinced by the argument that the Lord Chancellor is a political figure. I accept that he is someone with special status in judicial matters. We do ourselves no service by somehow decrying something that had 77 per cent acceptance from the community in Northern Ireland. That was an amazing initial finding for Northern Ireland because so often people almost want to have a reason to differ with what is seen as the establishment, the administration, or one tradition or <P>


<a name="column_693"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 693</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another. The figure of 77 per cent was mentioned, yet we are seeking to tweak it and to level down. That is not in the best interests of justice, nor is it in the best interests of the people I know in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para2"></a>We shall not have a degree of latitude from the Government on this matter and I give notice at this stage that I shall find it difficult not to oppose the Question that the clause shall stand part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. He said that 66 per cent of the population had expressed the view that judges were out of touch. I suggest to him&#151;and he half made the point&#151;that if a survey showed that 44 per cent of the English population felt that judges were totally in touch, he would be a happy man and so would the Lord Chancellor. That is not an unrealistic figure for a community of this kind.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para3"></a>The noble Lord made the argument for transparency, but I never suggested that there was none. At the outset of my brief remarks, I clearly accepted that a lay membership to the commission, if we must have one, would help transparency. However, the Government's number one objective, and ours, is the merit principle, but the Minister did not make a sound argument for that. Indeed, my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew tore to pieces his argument in relation to maintaining the merit principle. As I have said and as was said to me by a certain person who shall remain nameless, commissions will make political decisions and end up appointing the wrong person or people.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para4"></a>I shall not divide the Committee today. It is useful to explore these arguments. Although I doubt it, I hope that the Government will look again at Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 and see how we can strengthen the merit argument in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, made it clear that, as it stands, it will not encourage or give confidence to the population in Northern Ireland. This is a political Bill&#151;certainly the first part of it&#151;it is not a justice Bill and it will play no part in restoring the confidence of the Unionist population.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para5"></a>In relation to the quality and merit of the current judiciary, it has done a wonderful job for more than 30 years. I believe that the majority of High Court judges come from the Roman Catholic persuasion. That is not to say that they are nationalists or republicans because they would not own up to being either, which is the strength of it.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para6"></a>To suggest that the Lord Chancellor, when appointing judges, is a politician makes a mockery of the whole state of affairs. We all know and understand that the Lord Chancellor has three clear-cut roles which have existed for a long time; legislative, Cabinet and judicial. Until today&#151;I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, is continuing in this vein&#151;he has steadfastly maintained the wearing of those three separate and clear hats. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-06_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40115-06_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment refers to the subsection which limits the period for which a judge can serve on the Judicial Appointments Commission to a maximum of 10 years. In the 2002 Act, the period which judges may serve is not limited but that of the lay members is.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para13"></a>I am not happy about that for a number of reasons. Many High Court judges in Northern Ireland sit on the Bench for sometimes 20 years and more. That is true of high fliers whose ability to serve on the JAC is of the greatest importance. Secondly, there are only eight High Court judges in Northern Ireland, plus three Lord Justices and the Lord Chief Justice. That makes a total of 12. Given that some of them serve for more than 20 years, if we begin to restrict the period for which the senior judges may serve on the JAC, we will, from a practical point of view, be at risk of running into trouble.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para14"></a>I do not see why it is necessary to limit the period to 10 years. I have heard of no such argument and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I can see the argument for lay members because there is a large pool of people to be called upon, a large part of the Province, different groupings and so forth. I can see that turning that membership around over time has considerable benefit. However, if there are only eight High Court judges, I can see no benefit in the change.
<P>

<a name="40115-06_para15"></a>I am concerned by another matter. As I read the Bill, the Lord Chief Justice, who is to chair the Joint Advisory Commission, appears to be caught by the provision. If so, he may have already served 10 years, or a substantial part of it, even before his appointment to that post. Are we going to have the Lord Chief Justice barred from chairing the commission because he has already served his 10 years? There appear to be a number of issues of practical and administrative concern, if nothing else. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall not speak at excessive length. There are three points. The first is the argument of equivalence. That did not seem to us to be a good reason for not having a commonality between judicial and lay members in terms of eligibility to serve on the commission.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para0"></a>The second argument&#151;I am groping for the best adjective to use&#151;is about variety or turnaround. A judge being able to serve a five-year term and then another five-year term, either abutting each other or with a gap between them, gives him the opportunity to make a powerful contribution to the Judicial Appointments Commission. Experience shows that there is benefit in such bodies having some refreshment <P>


<a name="column_695"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 695</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and turnaround. One does not want them to become completely fossilised around one set of members to the exclusion of others.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para1"></a>The third argument is that while the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is right, as often, the pool is not limitless, but other people would be able to contribute on a JAC and therefore there is benefit in having some turnaround.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para2"></a>My final point&#151;noble Lords may tease me about it, as it goes slightly against some of the other points that I have just made&#151;is that, on promotion to another tier of the judiciary, a person can have another opportunity to enter the judicial appointments commission, at least conceptually. Whether they would want to do so, I do not know, and whether it would seem appropriate or not, I do not know. But at least that may be a slight comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.

I hope that, in not opposing the Question whether Clause 2 shall stand part, the Government will reconsider whether there can be a compromise in terms of Amendment No. 23.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-07_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40115-07_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: When I spoke on Clause 2, I indicated my concern about the term "reflective of the community". In Clause 3 we have a reiteration of the principle that appointments should be&#151;must be&#151;made solely on the basis of merit. That particular qualification or condition is then watered down by being made subject to being "reflective of the community".
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para9"></a>Such is the situation in Northern Ireland that the judiciary is not reflective of the community in one area&#151;that of gender. So the judicial element cannot meet the requirement of subsections (9) and 3(10). If that is the case, I shall give your Lordships an example of how ridiculous this can become. If the judicial element cannot be reflective of the community, neither can the lay element, because the commission as a whole will then be looked at to see how it can be made reflective of the community. Virtually all the judicial element is male. To match that, all the lay element will have to be female. That is not reflective of the community.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para10"></a>Perhaps I may give an example of how this has created a problem for me in terms of district police partnerships. I am chairman elect of a district police partnership and we found ourselves&#151;a number of councillors of every persuasion&#151;sitting round a table and selecting the lay members. We were in total agreement&#151;nationalist and Unionist, Protestant and Catholic&#151;because in my council we work as a team, irrespective of politics or religion. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, will bear me out on that matter. Having reached a decision on which we were all agreed, the police board decided that because Sinn Fein within the council was not participating in the district police partnerships and, therefore, under the d'Hondt system, Unionists had a majority among the elected members, then, among the non-elected members, seven out of eight should be Roman Catholic.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, knows my area particularly well. If you take an area such as that covered by Dungannon and South Tyrone borough council, you will find that seven Catholics and one Protestant is hardly reflective of the community, but that is what is being presented to the people out there. They know who their councillors are. They know that their councillors get on with the business. They know we do what we have to do. The same can be applied to the judiciary in this specific case: people getting on and doing what they have to do, irrespective of colour, class or creed. They will not understand if I concur with the direction by the police board&#151;and I have not done so&#151;and I believe that if the police board was right the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would have over-ruled me during the past year when I have refused to form the district police partnership in Dungannon and South Tyrone.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para12"></a>I recount that situation to your Lordships because it is important in terms of the judiciary that we do not find that, instead of something that is representative <P>


<a name="column_697"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and based on a meritocracy, we have something which is tweaked, fiddled and cheated over in order to get something that has little meaning and little relevance to the ordinary person on the street&#151;the consumer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   In rising to support the amendment, may I enlarge upon what the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said about gender? If you are determined to have a judiciary that is reflective of the community, then clearly you must work towards a state of affairs in which 50 or probably 51 per cent of the judiciary are women. Accordingly, all judicial vacancies over the next few years must be filled exclusively by women in order to attain that end. I also wonder how age would be affected. Would you have to have judges ranging in age evenly from 18 to 80? I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   I feel compelled to support some of the reservations that have just been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. Your Lordships will be aware that over many years I have had reservations about the appointment of judges in Northern Ireland. It would be entirely dishonest to say that there was not a very high political element in the appointment of judges in Northern Ireland. I have repeated in your Lordships' House and in Committee the details of a particular case in which I was involved, although I do not want to go into that again.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para13"></a>However, what do I think of the commission? It was said by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that the commission would have to be reflective of the community in Northern Ireland. That is an impossibility. In view of the changed political circumstances in Northern Ireland since the most recent Assembly elections, it would be necessary for Sinn Fein and the DUP to have persons appointed to the commission, and all kinds of objections would be raised.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para14"></a>I believe it is significant that the Minister said that the Government want to get this legislation through in advance of devolution being restored to the Assembly. But that would be a very dangerous attitude to take because people in Northern Ireland, and in particular Sinn Fein and the SDLP, have repeatedly put forward their ideas for reforming the police, the judiciary and the criminal justice system. Those are the three main elements which they have put forward in all their submissions.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para15"></a>In view of the changed political circumstances, I ask the Minister whether it is advisable to rush this Bill on to the statute book. If there is to be devolution and if, as I predict, Sinn Fein and the DUP will want to be represented, they will say that this legislation was rushed through this House while they had the support of people in Northern Ireland who elected them and that they are more reflective of the community in Northern Ireland than are Members of your Lordships' House. I believe it is hard to disagree with that argument.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para16"></a>I turn to the appointment of the lay members of the commission. Anyone from Northern Ireland will recognise that every person in Northern Ireland has a <P>


<a name="column_698"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 698</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>political opinion, whether they are nationalists or Unionists. No one in Northern Ireland is picked for any position on the grounds that he has no political opinions. When the members of the commission are appointed, they will have political opinions. Indeed, that will be the reason for their appointment because they represent nationalists or Unionists. Therefore, there will be a continuation of discrimination on one side or the other.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para17"></a>I believe that over the past 10 or 20 years&#151;in fact, since direct rule in 1972&#151;dramatic changes have taken place in the appointment of judges. Prior to that, a certain section of the community&#151;namely, the Catholics and nationalists&#151;had no high opinion on the appointment of judges. As I said, I have illustrated a particular case time and again in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para18"></a>Until the recent changes, the Lord Chancellor had responsibility for appointing judges in Northern Ireland. There was one case&#151;I do not want to go into it now in detail&#151;in which the Government of Northern Ireland made a recommendation to the Lord Chancellor. That amounted to political interference with the Lord Chancellor taking a role in the appointment of judges. Therefore, one cannot say that the commission will be set up with the lay members having no political opinions.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para19"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said that Northern Ireland judges were well known and that they lived cheek by jowl with the community in which they served. That is totally untrue. One should talk to any of the policemen in Northern Ireland who drive the judges around in cars and stand with them when they go to social functions. Although this may sometimes be exaggerated, it is said that judges in Northern Ireland dare not go into a supermarket on their own without the support of a policeman. They could not walk the streets in certain areas of Belfast, particularly in nationalist areas but, in some cases, Unionist areas as well. They are not living cheek by jowl with the community in which they serve on the judiciary. So it would be dishonest to say that the judges know the people with whom they deal and on whom they will pass decisions one way or another.
<P>

<a name="40115-07_para20"></a>Therefore, the Government are not faced with an easy task. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, when he said that it is an absolute impossibility to appoint members to the commission who are totally neutral and yet reflective of the community. That is the reality of Northern Ireland. Does the Minister believe that he has held adequate discussions with the political representatives in Northern Ireland? Does he not feel that it would be injudicious to push through this legislation in advance of devolution being restored to the Northern Ireland Assembly? Once the Assembly is elected, it will want to express opinions on the criminal justice Bill. Therefore, it may be right for the Minister to hold back before discussions are held with the newly elected political parties, which have thought about such political change in Northern Ireland since the Assembly elections.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   This has been an important and interesting debate. Perhaps I may start by returning to the essential elements of Clause 3. The first limb of it&#151;subsection (8)&#151;contains the absolutely crucial wording:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The selection of a person to be appointed, or recommended for appointment, to a listed judicial office . . .  must be made solely on the basis of merit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-07_para21"></a>
In response to an earlier discussion that we had, I am genuinely racking my brains to think how on earth one could make that clearer or stronger. However, it seems to me that that point must be met. It cannot be compromised; it cannot be balanced; it must be met. Merit is and must always be the test.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040115/text/40115-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   With respect, will the Minister look at the next two words? However clear that is, it is "subject to". Those words cannot be ignored, and I should be disappointed if the Minister were to ignore them as though that were not the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall defer to the noble Lord if I am wrong, but I understand "subject to" to mean that what follows must take a subsidiary position to what has just been stated.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para0"></a>The next limb of Clause 3 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Commission must engage in a programme of action designed to secure, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that appointments to listed judicial offices are such that those holding such offices are reflective of the community".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-08_para1"></a>
The final part of the clause states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Commission must, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, secure that a range of persons reflective of the community . . .  is available for consideration by the Commission".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-08_para2"></a>
It seems to me that the draftsmanship and the policy behind that is right because it is saying that the appointment of our judiciary on merit must never be compromised. However, it is also saying that, while that is paramount, if one can still seek to address some of the issues that are apparent in terms of the diversity of the judiciary, it is desirable as a position of policy to try to do so.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para3"></a>I turn to why I and the Government believe that that matters. We touched on this issue in a debate in September on a Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. It was suggested then that there were three essential arguments why diversity matters. If one does not take the position that women are more stupid than men&#151;which I do not believe anyone in this House is likely to&#151;one has to ask the question why it is there are so few women in the judiciary. In Northern Ireland 87 per cent of the judiciary are men. Therefore if it is a fact&#151;and it is not dissimilar in England and Wales&#151;one is led to question what it is about the system that leads to that result. That is not to say that people making these appointments are sexist or biased. I have no view or knowledge to that effect. However, something leads to a judiciary with that kind of composition.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para4"></a>Why does it matter? It matters on three grounds. First, let us go back to the point of confidence. If one believes women have as much brain-power and <P>


<a name="column_700"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 700</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>character as men, we are likely to be missing talent as a consequence of the process that leads to these results. So the first argument is one of talent.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para5"></a>The second one is fairness. If there are such talented women and the system is not consciously designed to disadvantage them, it must mean that there is something about the process that leads to talented women not being able to get into positions when they would like to do so. The third one is the point of confidence. I shall not repeat what I said on that.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para6"></a>Those are the arguments about why diversity matters, but diversity has to be seen within the context of not compromising merit. One may say that it is impossible to do it; that diversity cannot be addressed without compromising merit. That has not been my experience and I do not believe it has been the experience in British public policy over the past 20 years when a range of private and public sector organisations have tried to uphold the principle of appointing the best person for a role or a job and also to question why the system seemed to lead to either bias in terms of gender or ethnicity.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para7"></a>While nobody claims perfection, there has been an enormous amount of learnt experience about how one sometimes has to look at the nature of processes and adjust them to ensure that people have an opportunity to compete on a fair basis and then be judged on merit. In essence, that is what the Judicial Appointments Commission is being asked to do&#151;in part, to make decisions or recommendations; in part to get information about what is happening in the system, but in part also to explore impediments that lead to these results. It is not being asked to go around pointing fingers and saying that Ministers or the senior judiciary are biased; it will try to see if there is something in the nature of the system that leads to these results. If that is the case, then we need to stimulate a debate in society about what can be done to change it. That would be a debate as much within the Bar Council or the Law Society, as it would be within the processes that lead to immediate decisions. So that element of the work is much more longer term, but it will bring in a process over time that is more likely to lead to the opportunity for talented people to come forward and then, if they meet the merit test, to be appointed. I hope that answers the important question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Monson. We are not saying "the next X per cent", it can only be on merit and it is governed by "so far as is practicable".
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, in his Second Reading speech made some interesting historical references to what happened in the past. He was arguing that it would not be good to do this now and we should leave it until devolution took place&#151;I apologise to him if I do his arguments an injustice. We cannot wait because these issues of diversity, of transparency, matter and there is every reason for starting that process now, rather than finding reasons for putting it off. I have no idea when devolution will happen. I hope it will happen sooner rather than later if the tests that need to be in place for it to happen can be met. It might be sooner or it might be later. Either way, if the Judicial Appointments Commission, through doing its work, starts to lay the ground for deepening confidence, <P>


<a name="column_701"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 701</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increasing transparency and leading over time to more diversity, I would have thought that the Assembly would welcome that.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para9"></a>I apologise to the Committee if I have talked at too great length, but I have outlined the argumentation as to why we think that there is no risk in this. The legislation is properly balanced and is tightly conditional, subject to the supremacy of merit and so it should be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   The Minister has, as always, put his case extremely well. However, let me put another question to him. If merit is the only criterion which counts, why should there be a compulsory retirement age for judges? If a judge is as competent, alert and on the ball in their seventies as they were 20 years earlier, why should they be forced to retire?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Well, this is rash but not knowing the answer, I shall venture one or two reasons. Recognising, as I increasingly do, the benefits that age brings to wisdom, the judges already have a pretty high retirement age. Secondly, we are all at risk, as time goes by, of succumbing to the diseases of age. Therefore the risk of losing one's acuity does increase as one ages, particularly when one gets beyond 75. Thirdly, there is the argument that at times organisations do need space to allow people with talent to come through. So off the cuff, those would be my reflections.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I should have responded to the implied invitation of noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that I should confirm what he had to say about the way in which the council he has sat on for a very long time operates regardless of political or community differences. I very willingly do so. I also wish to ask the Minister whether he could explain the significance of the difference between "being reflective of" and "being representative of"? There has been a change to "reflective" from "representative". I am not sure what the intended significance of that may be.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para10"></a>Lastly, I should like to reply to the noble Lord, Lord Fitt who invited me to recant from my assertion that the judges knew their people because they had been at school with them and lived cheek by jowl. I do not think I have to recant from that solely because there are areas in which judges cannot proceed without protection officers. Perhaps that may be said to be throughout Northern Ireland. I do not believe that having lived in that community, man and boy, and having served as a solicitor or at the Bar before they became judges, they somehow become cocooned and a kind of amnesia falls so that they are unable to determine how people think and how they behave, simply by virtue of appointment to the Bench. I do not believe that I am called upon to recant from that. Of course they have difficulties but those are imposed upon them by what is still called the Emergency after 30 years.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para11"></a>Lastly, I hope the Minister will not endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, says about widespread political influence in the appointment of judges under the present system. I have only had experience of two Lord <P>


<a name="column_702"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 702</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Chancellors and am absolutely satisfied that the judges appointed at that time in Northern Ireland were appointed by reference to merit. It so happened&#151;and it was a felicitous happening&#151;that the High Court judges did and I believe still do contain a majority of those who come from the Catholic side of the community. That was regarded as fortuitous and it certainly was not the product of intention.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_time0"></a><H5>1 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   On the use of "reflective" rather than "representative", there are probably two reasons. First, if I recollect, we received some good arguments and advice on the matter and often, if not always, our ears are open to such arguments. The second argument, which is not just semantics, is that the word "representative" bears a slight risk that people will think that one is there to represent the community or that one is a delegate. That is exactly the reverse of what we would expect to be the case. The word "reflective", a softer term, avoids any risk in that respect, which is why we have been keen to use it.
<P>

<a name="40115-08_para12"></a>On the second point raised by the noble and learned Lord on political influence, I can speak with direct, firsthand experience of my relatively limited time in the Department for Constitutional Affairs. I am absolutely clear from that experience that both officials and the Lord Chancellor when operating in the mode of judicial appointment could not be more punctilious about the process, and issues of political affiliation or community affiliation would not be part of their consideration. They would make judgments on merit, as I am sure was the case when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, had strong interest in such issues.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   In over 20 years in the Palace of Westminster I have often felt that what one has to say as someone who comes from a small community or a small geographical area of the United Kingdom is not given the same degree of importance as that said by someone who comes from a larger geographical area. In this respect, I am disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has not taken up a single, solitary point that I made when I introduced the amendment. I know that that was not deliberate.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para0"></a>I listened to his general, clever, reasonable response and it was quite convincing. But sadly I do not live in a totally reasonably environment; I live in an environment where there is still an underlying suspicion, where there are differences between different religious traditions and differences between political parties. I was pleased that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, endorsed what I said about my district council area. The reason I told that story was because I wanted it understood that what we had achieved as elected representatives was undermined by well intentioned, but quite foolish, legislation pertaining to the independent element of district police partnerships. We are being driven back towards an entrenchment of religious or political considerations. The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, has very forcefully indicated that that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para1"></a>The situation is changing in Northern Ireland and I tend to agree more with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, about judges' ability to live cheek by <P>


<a name="column_703"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 703</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>jowl. Yes, of course, they have been under threat from terrorists. The fact that they have police guards&#151;the noble and learned Lord said that they go to the supermarkets, to rugby clubs, to soccer clubs and wherever else with their police guards&#151;indicates that they come from within our society and that they move back and forward within all aspects of that society. Moreover&#151;this is the more up-to-date position&#151;the chief constable is now in the process of trying to remove such guards from judges because he believes that our society is becoming more tolerant.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para2"></a>There are important issues that I believe need to be taken into consideration. I shall conclude with the point that I made earlier. In the district police partnership in Dungannon the independent element is being forced to be proxy for the absent Sinn Fein councillors. That is the reality. What does the system do to find proxies for absent Sinn Fein councillors? It says that if you are a Catholic you will do. None of my Catholic friends is a Sinn Fein supporter. A huge majority within the Catholic tradition disapproves of everything that Sinn Fein and the IRA stood for. Hence, that particular situation is discouraging and it is dismantling what we have attempted to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para3"></a>I would like the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to contemplate that and to contemplate whether, by putting in this unnecessary qualification "Subject to", he will improve by one jot, one iota, the situation that we should have, in which judges are appointed and the commission's attention is very firmly drawn to the fact that they should be appointed solely on the basis of merit. With no qualifications and no political compromise, let us see whether Northern Ireland can be allowed to work without continuously being dragged back to religion and politics on a day-to-day basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Does the noble Lord seek to withdraw the amendment or to press it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage. I take my lead from what other noble Lords have done so far.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 28:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 26, after "a" insert "continuing"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40115-09_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 28 is grouped with Amendment No. 29. They both concern, as did the previous amendment, Clause 3 which is entitled:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Duty of Commission to secure judiciary reflective of the community".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para7"></a>
The amendments are intended to probe further the definition of "reflective" and of the expression "continuing programme". I apologise if anything that I say is repetitious of what has been said in the previous debate.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para8"></a>I thank the Minister for the opportunity of talking to his civil servants before the Committee stage of the Bill. One topic that we discussed was the definition of "reflective". I am pleased to see that all four of the <P>


<a name="column_704"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 704</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord's civil servants in the Box are ladies. It may be said that the department has overachieved in terms of the definition.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para9"></a>On that occasion we discussed the department's view of the definition. Helpfully, my attention was drawn to the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, Schedule 2, paragraph 5, sub-paragraph (3). It concerns the annual report that the commission must make following its establishment. Sub-paragraph (3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The information to be included about any persons in an annual report must include information about their gender, age, ethnic origins and community background and the part of Northern Ireland (if any) with which they regard themselves as being most closely associated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40115-09_para11"></a>As the discussion continued with the Minister's advisers, it was clear to me that their view about the principal purpose of the word "reflective" was to put gender, age and ethnic origins as the three primary factors in determining the issues which should be considered by the Judicial Appointments Commission. I shall be most grateful if the Minister, in responding to my observations, will either confirm or develop that point in the context of paragraph 5(3).
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para12"></a>I turn to Clause 3 of the Bill. The Minister has already made it clear that the expression,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"solely on the basis of merit",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para13"></a>
contained in Clause 3 means just what it says. Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 are intended to re-emphasise that by making certain changes to subsections (9) and (10). It would be helpful to me, if not to other Members of the Committee, if I could quote those two subsections before making my observations. Subsection (9) states that, subject to the obligation to make appointments solely on the basis of merit,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Commission must engage in a programme of action designed to secure, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that appointments to listed judicial offices are such that those holding such offices are reflective of the community in Northern Ireland".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40115-09_para15"></a>Subsection (10) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As part of that programme of action the Commission must, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, secure that a range of persons reflective of the community in Northern Ireland is available for consideration by the Commission whenever it is required to select a person to be appointed, or recommended for appointment, to a listed judicial office".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40115-09_para17"></a>Clearly in the early stages of the commission's life it will be less easy to satisfy the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as far as reasonably practicable",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-09_para18"></a>
criteria in subsection (10) than after a successful continuing programme of action. So the logic of my amendment to subsection (10) really lies in the requirements of subsection (11).
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para19"></a>Amendment No. 29 seeks to emphasise that the programme undertaken by the commission should be open-ended, a continuing programme; it should not have a life of only two, three, four or even five years. If I am right in assuming that gender, age and ethnic origin are the key ingredients of "reflective", then clearly we shall need an open-ended programme.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para20"></a>I can deal with Amendment No. 29 briefly. It concerns the importance of laying these matters before your Lordships and another House every year for an appropriate debate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is absolutely correct that gender, ethnicity and age are extremely important. They do not necessarily all have exactly the same importance. If one is looking at the variance between what we think we have at present&#151;we do not really know&#151;and what the society is, the differential is greater on some than others. The gender issue is the clearest example. At one level, as far as we understand and it is perhaps easiest to spot, there are no ethnic minority members of the judiciary in Northern Ireland. On the other hand the proportion of the population from ethnic minority backgrounds in Northern Ireland is also very low. Hence my two points about the gap.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para21"></a>For reasons of experience there will always be a limit as to how far one can go with age. Nevertheless, it seems to us that that is an important criterion, as it seemed to this Chamber when it passed the 2002 Act. It is important to keep track of it, partly because it touches on a later point of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland; that if one is not bringing in appropriate people at the beginning of the process, one will not have appropriate people to choose from later on.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para22"></a>In terms of a continuing programme, while I do not accept the noble Lord's amendment, I certainly agree with his argument. He is fundamentally right that this sort of process of change does not happen overnight. My experience is that it is a 10, 15 or even 20-year programme of change. That is another reason for starting now rather than putting it off. It is not something that one can fix within two or three years. Therefore I totally agree with the noble Lord that the process should be continuing.
<P>

<a name="40115-09_para23"></a>I am being slightly churlish about not accepting the amendment but give the commitment that the process must be continuing. The statutory duty exists and it will continue until such time, if ever, Parliament rescinds it. So the nature of the legislation ensures that it is continuing. I was a little churlish about not accepting the amendment because we have not really started yet and there is not much of a programme at present to continue. We perhaps therefore need a different term from "continuing".

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, which is extremely helpful. The crucial issue that I wanted to emphasise is that we cannot have the third paragraph without the second paragraph. If we want to produce a range of candidates for a specific job, which is what appears from the text of the Bill, we have to have a programme of the sort suggested and it has to be long-term, otherwise we will never reach subparagraph (3). That is the crucial point that I wanted to emphasise.

<a name="40115-10_para0"></a>I talked about three specific criteria. I should not forget community background. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, has spoken to us. As far as one can judge&#151;we do not have accurate statistics on this&#151;the judiciary is not grossly disproportionate in its community backgrounds. Nevertheless, it is right and proper, for obvious reasons in Northern Ireland, to keep that under review and to try to ensure that there is nothing in the process that leads us in the wrong direction rather than in a better direction.

<P>

<a name="40115-10_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am most grateful to all noble Lords contributing to this debate, at a time that is so critical for the people of Sudan.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para8"></a>Since the National Islamic Front (NIF) Islamist regime took power by military coup in 1989 and declared military jihad against all who oppose it, the toll of human suffering, with 2 million dead and 5 million displaced, exceeds the combined toll of Rwanda, Somalia and former Yugoslavia. There is now a ray of hope with the peace talks, which need strong encouragement and urgent measures to resolve outstanding problems.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para9"></a>I shall focus primarily on the continuing violence and violations of human rights in Darfur and the unresolved status of the "marginalised areas". I wish first to refer to another concern: the imposition of Sharia law in the north and Khartoum in particular. If Khartoum remains the capital of Sudan, it must reflect the beliefs, traditions and culture of all Sudanese people. Many are deeply opposed to Sharia, which violates principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) such as equality before the law and freedom to choose and to change religion. Moreover, the NIF is implementing <P>


<a name="column_707"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 707</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>harsh Sharia punishments, such as sentencing Intisar Bakri Abdulgader, a 16 year-old Christian girl, to flogging with 100 lashes for adultery, while the man who forced her into this situation remains entirely free from any penalty. This sentence would violate the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para10"></a>I turn to the continuing conflict in Darfur, where the situation is so grave that senior UN officials have warned of an impending human catastrophe: Jan Egeland, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs declared that the humanitarian crisis in Darfur is probably the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"worst in the world today".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para11"></a>
All the evidence demonstrates that the destruction of the primarily African Muslim peoples, through deliberate attacks on civilians by Khartoum-backed Arab militias and deliberate denial of urgently needed humanitarian relief amounts to "ethnic cleansing". That phrase was used explicitly by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Mukesh Kapila, in a BBC radio interview on 18 December.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para12"></a>Although he was making the point that the many reports of ethnic cleansing cannot presently be confirmed because of Khartoum's denial of access to humanitarian relief and international observers, other UN officials and Sudan analysts have been explicitly speaking of the "systematic" denial of humanitarian relief, as well as the "systematic" nature of militia attacks on non-combatant civilians with the "organised" destruction of the Fur, Masseleit, and the Zaghawa tribal groups.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para13"></a>Also, a Channel 4 news report on 6 January alleged "ethnic cleansing", showing the first images taken inside Darfur, of ghost village after burnt ghost village, destroyed hospitals and mosques and blackened skeletons of burnt civilians. Old men, women and children, without food or possessions, stood stranded in the desert and testified to horrific and systematic attacks across the region. Pictures of Sudanese Government Antonov bombers flying overhead proved that those perpetrating the attacks are not merely northern tribes with a vendetta but the NIF Government.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para14"></a>The scale of that catastrophe is enormous: MSF estimates that there are about 750,000 displaced people in Darfur; and that in December 30,000 had fled into Chad, with another 3,000 fleeing last week. The NIF claims that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the [Sudanese] Government is firm on fully shouldering its responsibilities of protecting the lives and the property of citizens, and relief workers in Darfur",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para15"></a>
describes its substantial relief programmes. But all the evidence from NGOs, refugee testimonies and these first media reports belies its claim. Access by international NGOs is severely limited and their activities are very restricted. And there were reports of yet more aerial bombardment of civilians by the NIF <P>


<a name="column_708"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 708</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as recently as Monday of this week. Consideration should be given perhaps to indicting the NIF for crimes against humanity.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para16"></a>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Committee on Conscience concluded that Darfur has given new urgency to the committee's long-standing "genocide warning" for Sudan, which was previously focused on southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains. The committee indicated that its,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"warning was based on the following actions of the [military government] of Sudan: a divide-to-destroy strategy of pitting ethnic groups against each other, with enormous loss of civilian life; the use of mass starvation as a weapon of destruction; toleration of the enslavement of women and children by government-allied militias; the incessant bombing of hospitals, clinics, schools and other civilian and humanitarian targets; disruption and destabilization of the communities of those who flee the war zones to other parts of Sudan; and widespread persecution on account of race, ethnicity and religion".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para17"></a>
It concluded that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"taken individually, each of these actions is a disaster for the victims. Taken together, they threaten the physical destruction of entire groups".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40115-10_para19"></a>The International Crisis Group's most recent report declares that Khartoum-backed Arab militias in Darfur are attacking,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unprotected villages with no apparent link to the rebels other than their ethnic profile";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para20"></a>
and Amnesty International has warned that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the situation in Darfur is at risk of rapidly degenerating into a full-scale civil war where ethnicity is manipulated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para21"></a>
The conclusion is that there is compelling evidence that the Khartoum Government is "largely responsible" for the human rights and humanitarian crisis in Darfur. It is intolerable that the international community continues to allow what all evidence suggests is genocide. Therefore, the EU's recent call for a cease-fire, for the protection of civilians and for unimpeded humanitarian access is welcome.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para22"></a>However, urgent international action is also essential. Khartoum's claim of "national sovereignty" must not be allowed to conceal the desperate plight of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians or hinder access to them. One can only surmise that the failure of the international community to ensure humanitarian intervention derives from an unwillingness to disturb diplomatic initiatives involved with the peace talks. But that is a dangerous misunderstanding because, unless the international community shows its concern for the people of Darfur, and the peoples of the designated marginalised regions of Nuba Mountains, Abyei Province and Blue Nile, as well as other marginalised peoples, such as the Beia people of eastern Sudan, peace will be very partial and ultimately unsustainable.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para23"></a>All these people have suffered at the hands of the regime in Khartoum&#151;brutality, discrimination and a lack of representation and of a share of the national wealth. At present, they may reasonably conclude that the international vision of peace is focused only on Khartoum and the south. Unless all the people of Sudan have cause to believe that their interests&#151;indeed their physical and cultural survival&#151;are enshrined in any peace agreements, those agreements may not produce a lasting peace. The incentive to resort to armed <P>


<a name="column_709"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 709</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>insurrection could prove irresistible. And, if Khartoum sees that the international community is willing to ignore the massive humanitarian crisis in Darfur and to condone its denial of access to humanitarian aid, it may conclude that it can remain obdurate and achieve outcomes on its terms.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para24"></a>The United States, the other countries in the troika&#151;Norway and the UK&#151;as well as Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) countries, must look comprehensively at Sudan's problems if the goal is to secure a just and lasting peace.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para25"></a>Perhaps I may therefore conclude by asking the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government will urge: the NIF regime to open all parts of Sudan, especially the conflict-wracked regions of Darfur, to international humanitarian and human rights organisations; urge all involved in the peace talks to ensure that the wishes of all those living in the marginalised areas are taken fully into account in any decisions concerning their future status; ensure that any funds for reconstruction are conditional on full and transparent implementation of all aspects of the agreement; use their influence to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights, according to the UDHR and other international conventions, for all citizens of Sudan; and, finally, with regard to Darfur, work alongside other EU member states to facilitate the passing of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a comprehensive ceasefire, the convening of peace talks that include the presence of high-level international observers, an end to attacks on civilians, immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access, and the positioning of international monitors.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para26"></a>The people of Sudan believe that Britain is uniquely placed to help. They do not forget our historic relationship, which bequeathed many benefits but also a legacy of bitter conflicts, for which we carry an historic responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para27"></a>I look forward to hearing from the Minister how Her Majesty's Government will fulfil that responsibility at this critical juncture, helping Africa's largest nation to move forward from carnage and catastrophe to peace, justice and prosperity. The opportunity for this sea change has not been so propitious for decades; it is an opportunity that must not be lost.

I pay tribute to her for her untiring efforts on behalf of the people of Sudan and, as the House well knows, in many other parts of the world.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para28"></a>There are many issues that are matters of concern to all who want to see positive moves by the Sudanese authorities that could lead towards a less repressive set of policies being implemented by the Government of that country. This debate, short as it is, will, I am sure, note that there have been some encouraging breakthroughs in the peace talks that have taken place in Naivasha. At the same time, events in the country itself indicate that the Government of Sudan continue <P>


<a name="column_710"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 710</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with their policies of repression and the abuse of human rights. In fact, comment has been made that the peace talks are being used by the Sudanese Government as a means of avoiding the necessity of fighting a war on more than one front.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para29"></a>Human rights are still being abused; people living in northern Sudan continue to have their basic human rights violated. The right to a free press is still a long way from the people of Sudan. It had been the hope of many that press freedom would be a reality, following a decree by President al-Bashir last August. He had decreed that state censorship of newspapers should be lifted. That hope was soon dashed. Censorship, together with regular suspension of the right of some newspapers to publish, continues. Within days of the president's decree, the daily Al Alwan was suspended on 2 September. Originally banned until 24 September, a further ban was imposed two days later. It was eventually lifted on 16 October.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para30"></a>Similar censorship and banning of other newspapers has taken place. The Khartoum Monitor, an English-language daily, was suspended on 13 September, in direct defiance of an Appeal Court ruling that had quashed an earlier cancellation of that paper's licence. It was allowed to reappear later in October.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para31"></a>Five and a half weeks later, the paper was suspended again, the seventh time in two years. The allegations against the Khartoum Monitor were that it promoted slavery, worked against the peace process and worked against the Government. Other papers, including Al Azimah, have had suspensions and bans imposed on them by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para32"></a>Not only newspapers are affected by interference; the allegations that are so often made against the press have also been made against the independent television channel Al-Jazeera. It has been alleged that in December, representatives of the Sudanese national security forces visited its offices and informed staff of the Government's displeasure at some of its programmes. Later in the month, on 17 December, security operatives raided the agency's Khartoum offices and arrested Salih Adam Belo, a journalist, and his cameraman, Hamid Tirab. The security people also confiscated their equipment. Mr Belo was accused of transmitting programmes that were,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"stuffed with false information and poor, biased analyses, with pictures and scenes selected to serve its ends".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para33"></a><P>

<a name="40115-10_para34"></a>The National Security Authority, which arrested Mr Belo, has the power to detain people without charge or trial for up to nine months. The evidence cited against Mr Belo included accusations that he had transmitted programmes reporting on tuberculosis, landmine victims and events in the western Darfur region. Mr Belo was released from Kober prison on 24 December. He continues to undergo interrogation.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para35"></a>On 1 January, the security authorities are reported to have said to the Government in Khartoum that they wanted the licence that allows Al-Jazeera to have an office in the country revoked. Mr Belo is one of many courageous journalists who tried to collect and publish the facts about what is happening in their country.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para36"></a>There have been protests both locally and internationally. The German news agency, DPA, reported that Sudanese journalists organised a sit-in at the offices of Al Ayam and the Khartoum Monitor. They were protesting about the banning of newspapers. More than 30 journalists representing 17 newspapers have signed a statement that by taking the action they did, they hope to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"guarantee rights of expression and to enhance freedoms".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para37"></a>
They called for the lifting of the bans and for fair trials for the two papers.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para38"></a>There is insufficient time to mention other facts about this repression and the denial of people's rights to read or see what is happening in their country. I would, however, like to refer to one other area of concern&#151;the treatment of human rights defenders and trade unionists. The harassment of trade unionists and human rights defenders has also continued. On 21 December last year, the NSA arrested nine members of the General Trade Union Council at a peaceful meeting in a house at Shambat, Khartoum north. The men were interrogated about the activities of their organisation. They were released seven and a half hours later and ordered to report to the agency's offices the following morning at 11 o'clock. The following day, the men were not questioned but held until 6 p.m., and again ordered to report back the following day.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para39"></a>On 28 December, the NSA arrested Dr Madawi Ibrahim Adam, a human rights activist and consultant engineer at Lambda Engineering Company. He is also chairperson of the Sudan Social Development Organisation, a registered non-governmental organisation. Dr Adam was arrested at his home in Omdurman; security force operatives are said to have searched the house, seized documents and damaged the building. One of the documents seized was a tender for a project to develop water stations in southern Sudan.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para40"></a>Within Sudan, there are others, and other organisations, who want to express their concern about the treatment meted out to representatives of NGOs. Students and the Sudan Organisation Against Torture continue to highlight many of the abuses that are taking place.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para41"></a>I conclude by asking my noble friend the Minister to press our Government to let the Sudanese authorities know of the concern that many outside of Sudan have for the people of that country, who are looking forward to the day when free speech and the defence of basic human rights become a reality in Sudan.

Congratulations are due to all the negotiators, but it is also time to recognise the commitment of this Government and the valuable work put in by our FCO envoys and their staff who helped put the talks back on track last <P>


<a name="column_712"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 712</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>summer&#151;not, for once, overshadowed by the United States, whose pressure behind the scenes has also contributed. But it is not over yet.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para42"></a>The wealth-sharing agreement signed last week was another milestone, given the bitterness of the oil war in Upper Nile and the resulting internal divisions in the south. Oil revenues now amount to more than two-thirds of Sudan's export earnings, and a 50:50 split, supervised by a national commission of experts, will give the south a huge psychological advantage as well as an economic leap forward. However, we are not there yet. This is only the first stage and there are still substantive issues to resolve, not least control over oil in Abyei in Kordofan and the other disputed regions. Agreements in lakeside hotels in Kenya seem very far removed from the frontline in western Sudan. The Foreign Minister has suggested having a final signature in Africa&#151;contrary to what Senator Danforth is proposing&#151;which seems more appropriate than Washington.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para43"></a>In Darfur, the collapse of talks sponsored by the Chad President last month has brought further conflict. Two previous ceasefires have failed. According to Amnesty International, more than 200 people, mostly women and children, were reportedly killed this month, when scores of villages around Zalingei in west Darfur were again attacked by Government armed forces and Janjawid militias, including armed rebels from Chad. According to refugee accounts, the marauders came on horses and camels. Homes were burnt, livestock and possessions were looted and many children were abducted. Some 7,000 have been displaced in the latest raids, some crossing the Chad border and most now needing food and medical attention.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para44"></a>Since last April, more than 700,000 people have fled their homes, mostly to other towns in Darfur, while more than 90,000 have crossed the border to Chad. Our own DfID is supporting relief work through the NGOs. UN aid workers intend to move 15,000 refugees away from the frontier to protect them from cross-border attacks by Sudanese militia and aircraft. The picture is extremely complicated because the dominant ethnic group, the Zaghawa, straddle both sides of the border and have allegiance to different political parties.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para45"></a>The UN estimates that 3,000 have died in this conflict alone. Human rights agencies like Justice Africa and Anti-Slavery International fear a return to the pattern of civil war in Bahr el-Ghazal in which government-sponsored militia have carried out murderous raids and abductions over many years. As an ASI council member, I do hope the Government of Sudan recognise the strength of feeling on abductions, given all the detailed work done by their own committees with the Dinka people with the support of UNICEF and Save the Children.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para46"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, has already said, activists in Darfur and elsewhere, human rights workers and journalists are still being held in detention without charge and many have reported the use of torture.

<FONT SIZE=3>documented human rights violations are not a government who deserve international recognition as a party to the new peace agreement.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para47"></a>President al-Bashir is not yet behaving like a peacemaker. He has extended the emergency for a year and is seeking an internal military solution in Darfur just at a time when he has gained some international respect in peace talks with the south. By talking with different voices Khartoum will soon lose diplomatic credibility if it does not reopen talks with some mediator from outside, other than Chad which is already a party. At the very least, the GoS and the SPLM should jointly agree to find a solution to Darfur outside the IGAD peace process.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para48"></a>Will Her Majesty's Government join in international protests against the latest raids in Darfur this month, including the use of aircraft by the GoS? Will they urge both parties to the final agreement that it should contain a clause committing them to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Darfur? Does the Minister agree that it would be premature for the parties to sign before that is done?
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para49"></a>Colonel Garang says that peace is now irreversible, but many other critical issues are now being discussed such as the joint armed force and the release of POWs with demobilisation much further down the line. The UN is now to take on a monitoring task through the monitoring and protection teams and I assume that the UK will play some part in that.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para50"></a>Power-sharing arrangements under an interim national administration still have to be decided. Once signed, the peace deal is to remain in force during a six-year period when southern Sudan is at last able to enjoy a degree of autonomy. Like many risky diplomatic deals, this one is built on blocks that are not yet all in place. A successful agreement presupposes reconciliation in the south, which is not a foregone conclusion. The enthusiastic public reception given to the SPLA in Khartoum in November showed that it is ready for power, but a key question is the sharing of jobs in the interim administration and whether the SPLM can bring together the multitude of small parties and political factions from the past. In the north, the picture is not much clearer. The Umma and DUP parties are split and Hassan al-Turabi remains a wild card. His Popular National Congress is now drawing people away from the NIF-dominated National Congress.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para51"></a>Finally, the NGOs, especially those with expertise in human rights and democracy, will have an important role in building confidence in the new administration. The new peace agreement must bring with it a stronger legal framework, leading to a new atmosphere of openness and a greater involvement of civil society in national and local government, and in meeting&#151;above all&#151;the urgent reconstruction needs of the country.

<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Cox, for so consistently keeping events in Sudan before your Lordships' House. I am happy to join them in that tribute. I also join my noble friend in paying tribute to the role played by the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, in constantly and intelligently dealing with the peace process and keeping us informed of what is happening in Sudan. Recently, she will recall the Question from the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, about the situation in Darfur. Along with others, I asked supplementary questions about that and was grateful to the Minister for the reply that she gave on that occasion. I look forward to hearing what she has to say today about the continuing problems in Darfur.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para52"></a>Obviously we all welcome the progress made in the peace talks in Kenya, particularly the agreement on wealth sharing that was signed last week. That agreement has managed to cover a number of crucial areas, including the division of revenues, the management of oil resources, and the reconstruction of some of the areas devastated by the war. I wish to talk especially about the role of oil, in the past and future, in helping to facilitate that process of reconstruction.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para53"></a>The agreement seems to give the ravaged areas of southern Sudan, which I visited just over a year ago, a fair deal. Just as importantly, it gives hope to those people whose lives have been adversely affected by the exploitation of the oil fields. In particular, I welcome the provisions in the agreement that those people who have suffered are entitled to some form of compensation. That the Government of Sudan is required to take action in cases in which the exploitation has caused

We in the West bear a significant responsibility for financing a government that has practised genocide against its own people. During the past week I have written to the chairman of trustees of one of our most respected major British charities pointing out that their own complicity in the industry has been concurrent with running a disinvestment campaign. In 2000, the charity first asked shareholders and pension funds to consider disinvesting from oil companies operating in Sudan, because they were fuelling the war. It named British Petroleum, the largest minority shareholder in PetroChina, as an indirect investor.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para59"></a>Today, through the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan, the charity continues to urge,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shareholders, pension funds and institutional investors to divest from companies active in Sudan's oil extracting industry or trading in Nile Blend Crude, including indirect investors such as BP".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para60"></a>
Although the charity has called on others to disinvest, it has failed to do so itself. It talks much about "positive engagement", but it has failed to produce any example of engaging with these companies through its investments. Throughout the whole campaign, the charity has continued to hold shares in both BP and Shell through its own company pension fund. If its own arguments are correct, then it would have to accept that it is complicit in the killing of thousands of Sudanese Christians, animists, and those Muslims who remained in the south.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para61"></a>Despite repeated telephone calls following my letter, I am disappointed to say that I have not had a response from the charity in time for this debate. All of us&#151;especially charities running disinvestment campaigns&#151;need to consider carefully how we use funds. Charities, especially, have a duty to consider the churches and individuals who support them, and should know how their actions will appear to their supporters. On the positive side, oil interests will play a significant part in the shaping of the new Sudan. Those who have investments should, at the very minimum, use their leverage to engage companies in pressing for change.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para62"></a>There remain several outstanding issues on which companies, charities and those who invest in them could act in assisting the peace talks to find a way forward. One of those relates to the proposed system of power sharing, including the rotating presidency, and the quota of ministerial posts that will be given to the SPLA. It is important that the SPLA receives a fair deal here. In particular, it is worth noting that, at present, the NIF Government has numerous parallel systems that govern security and other areas of government, and these may hinder SPLA ministers from exercising any real power.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para63"></a>The relationship between the proposed tiers of government is another area that needs greater clarification and may require further safeguards. There are three tiers proposed for the interim period: national government, the authority governing southern Sudan, and the authorities governing the states and regions. How these different tiers will relate to each other has not yet been properly resolved. Another problematic issue regularly raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, is worth reiterating&#151;the issue of the future arrangements for the three marginalized areas&#151;namely, the Nuba Mountains, the Southern Blue Nile, which is also known as the Funj Region, and Abyei district. That is crucial. Although those areas do not form part of southern Sudan geographically, they share the same ethnicity. People from those areas have fought alongside the south and successive northern governments have consistently underdeveloped them. It is important that, in any final peace deal, the treatment that has taken place in the past is acknowledged and they are treated in the future with <P>


<a name="column_716"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 716</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fairness and justice. Companies with economic muscle should use it to insist that Khartoum takes that question, and the others that I have raised, seriously.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para64"></a>Those outstanding issues, together with past experience, help to explain why many southerners, while welcoming the progress made so far, continue to be very wary about the sincerity of the NIF. As one southern observer called Natalino Losuba Mana, who runs Norwegian People's Aid in the Yei county, says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No one is celebrating yet. We'll wait to see these promises of peace fulfilled rather than living in hope. We still feel we will make a very good agreement that will never get beyond paper".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para65"></a><P>

<a name="40115-10_para66"></a>To conclude, the Minister has said that Her Majesty's Government are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"committed to helping the Sudanese parties reach a comprehensive peace agreement".&#151;[Official Report, 6/11/03; col. 951.]
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para67"></a>
I welcome that approach and hope that our debate today will assist her and her advisers as they continue to help the peace talks to move forward.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I join in the congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, which all noble Lords have expressed, not only on returning to the question of Sudan in this House for the nth time, but also for the indefatigable and incredibly brave work that she does in Sudan itself.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para68"></a>A year ago, I said that the Government would have to be generous in reaching a compromise between the SPLA's demand for 60 per cent of the oil revenues and the offer of 10 per cent that was then on the table. As we have heard, they were so prepared, and the final deal of 50&#150;50 between north and south is a fair one, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, acknowledged. The extension to non-oil revenues is sensible too.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para69"></a>The establishment of a dual banking system, with an Islamic no-interest section in the north and a conventional section in the south will be a challenging project, because the Bank of Southern Sudan must be established in a vast territory that has had no banking facilities throughout the war. The common currency, the free movement of capital, and semi-independent fiscal regimes in north and south will create formidable difficulties in the management of the system, and the detailed regulations will need a great deal of input from both Islamic and conventional banking experts in the outside world.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para70"></a>Many issues are still outstanding that must be resolved, including the power sharing referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the status of the Nuba Mountains, the Southern Blue Nile and Abyei. I see that the first two of those territories are well on the way to a solution, but the situation in Abyei still poses formidable difficulties as it is home to a largely Dinka population, and a number of SPLA leaders were from that area of the country. However, President al-Bashir was adamant in a nationally televised speech last November that the 1956 boundary between north and south that is the legacy of independence was immutable.
<P>


<a name="column_717"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para71"></a>There are also security arrangements to be made, including the number and composition of the international ceasefire monitoring force, the relocation of belligerent troops, including particularly the repatriation of government of Sudan forces to the north, and the prevention of incursions in the area of the border between north and south. Details remain to be agreed of the referendum implementation mechanism for the vote on the self-determination of the south in five years' time.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para72"></a>Meanwhile, apart from the peace agreement between north and south, there are other problems, as noble Lords have mentioned. Notably, there is the crisis in Darfur where, as the International Crisis Group pointed out a month ago,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an end to the war in the south could become the catalyst for a new and bloody chapter in Darfur unless negotiations are broadened to include western rebels".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-10_para73"></a>
We must face the fact that there is in Darfur an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe, comparable in scale with what happened in Kosovo prior to the international intervention there. Noble Lords may need to reflect on the difference in treatment between Kosovo and Darfur, in the sense that there has been no call whatever, on behalf of the victims of the conflict, for the international community to go in and help.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para74"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said, 3,000 have been killed in that conflict from the outbreak in February 2003 to the end of the year. For those who have fled across the border into Chad, I have the figure of 95,000&#151;and 30,000 in December alone, according to UNHCR. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to be internally displaced in Darfur itself. Precise estimates are impossible because international humanitarian agencies are kept out, but Amnesty International says that it has received lists of hundreds of civilians killed and villages destroyed, as well as the actual names of children said to have been abducted by government-supported militia.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para75"></a>The picture given by refugees in Chad is the same. They told UNHCR that the militia attacked villages, first shooting people caught in the streets. Starting early in the morning, the militia raid village houses, stealing everything including livestock. One refugee from the village of Garuma was quoted in the UNHCR report as saying that on 2 January 150 militiamen arrived on horses and camels in his village. He fled with his pregnant wife and their five children and hid in the surrounding hills, where his wife gave birth one day after they had escaped. The militia set fire to the scrub around the hill and the family had to take refuge again on another small hillock. The entire population of his village&#151;about 2,000 people&#151;had gone into the surrounding countryside or moved to the nearby villages or crossed the border into Chad.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para76"></a>When I raised the matter of Darfur in the debate on 6 November, to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred, the Minister acknowledged the problem in Darfur and said that we would continue to press for unfettered access. She did not respond to the suggestion that the African Union should consider the wider implications of the conflict. However, there are now African voices, such as the respected Kenyan newspaper, The Nation, calling for the international community to <P>


<a name="column_718"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 718</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seek ways in which to address the crisis in the region. Chad is a poor country and its eastern region bordering the epicentre of the crisis in western Darfur is semi-arid. It simply cannot cope with a flood of destitute refugees, and Sudan should be told in no uncertain terms that its conduct towards civilians in Darfur is intolerable.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para77"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clarke, covered amply the serious problems of human rights. I am particularly concerned about the alleged rule of the Sharia that requires 100 lashes to be imposed on unmarried women who become pregnant after being raped. That includes two cases that have been taken up by our ambassador in Khartoum of teenage girls whose appeals against sentence are still awaited. As I wrote to Chris Mullin in November, we have to say plainly that such penalties are unacceptable. He replied a month ago that we would press for a response to the representations already made about those cases. It would not be sufficient for the girls' appeals to be granted on some technicality; it is the law of zina itself that is contrary to natural justice and should be repealed. I hope that we will not be deterred by false considerations of cultural sensitivity from saying so to the Sudanese Government.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para78"></a>There are also the numerous cases, to which the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, referred, of detention without trial, execution and attacks on freedom of the press. The Sudanese Foreign Minister, Mustapha Osman Ismail, says that he wants a final peace agreement with the south to be signed in Africa and not in Washington, as President Bush has suggested, to show that Africans can solve African problems. That is an excellent proposal. Why should not Khartoum demonstrate that Sudan can also deal with its other problems by simultaneously stopping the attacks in Darfur and ending cruel punishments, executions and arbitrary detentions? It might gain a reputation for itself not only for statesmanship in ending the north-south conflict but for a new initiative on human rights in the whole of Africa.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-10_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I warmly congratulate my noble friend Lady Cox on securing this timely debate on the situation in Sudan, and add my tributes for all the marvellous work that she does to those made by other noble Lords today. As I said before, and I will say again, it is especially important that we discuss the situation in Sudan regularly, because, as many of your Lordships have pointed out, it is extremely volatile and is subject to almost weekly change. There is no doubt that everyone is delighted by steps towards peace in a country that has been dominated by a civil war for the past 20 years. We welcome the agreement to share government revenues, particularly from oil, as we heard from the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, as well as the planned new authority in the south of the country.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para79"></a>The situation in Sudan has come a long way. We congratulate all those involved in bringing the agreement about. For the Islamist regime now to say that it is prepared to allow more freedom of religion and to let the south hold a referendum on succession in six years' time, <P>


<a name="column_719"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>along with power sharing, is a significant shift. However, there are still vital issues that, if left neglected, could undo all the progress made so far. I speak of the regions ignored by the agreement. First, the agreement fails to express clearly how the marginal areas of the Southern Blue Nile, the Nuba mountains and the Abyei will be governed, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. What steps are being taken to ensure that these area interests are represented and will come under the new authority? Of course, the most significant of ignored regions is Darfur, as mentioned by my noble friend Lady Cox, and most other noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para80"></a>Conflict in the three states of Darfur in western Sudan has brought a huge humanitarian crisis to the Chadian border. Fighting continues in this region, which is excluded from the agreement signed the other day. According to the UN World Food Programme, it has caused the displacement of around 1 million people, about 95,000 refugees, including up to 30,000 during December, who have fled fighting between the forces loyal to the government in Khartoum and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, as well as tribal and ethnic clashes.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para81"></a>The UN has recently launched an emergency appeal for 11 million dollars to cover the food needs of 60,000 of the most vulnerable Sudanese refugees. Will the Minister tell us what contribution HMG will make to this fund? What other support are they providing to try to prevent worsening of the humanitarian crisis? As well as the refugees in Chad, there are 1 million internally displaced people. Killings and damage to land contribute to this year's poor agricultural production, despite earlier promises of a satisfactory yield. The situation in the south of Darfur is apparently especially precarious due to the desert environment of the area.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para82"></a>On Monday 12 January, the UN reported that the needs of the Darfur region could not be met due to insecurity. A spokesman said that only 15 per cent of the people are in areas accessible by the UN. The prolific supply of small arms, increased banditry have led to a complete breakdown in law and order on the ground. Meanwhile, the UN Children's Fund has reported growing numbers of displaced children working as domestic labour, prostitutes and beggars. It has been reported too that the Sudanese Government are not fully protecting the lives and property of relief workers in the Darfur region, let alone its citizens. This will be the end of the tentative steps to peace in Sudan unless it is immediately addressed. I hope that the noble Baroness will tell us in winding up what Her Majesty's Government are planning to do about the continued problems in Darfur and its integration into the rest of Sudan.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para83"></a>Christian Aid, among other NGOs, has expressed a particular concern regarding the effective verification and monitoring of the agreement, including ceasefire arrangements. There are still unconfirmed reports of fighting in south Sudan, including attacks on the oil fields. Will the Minister tell the House what action or plans Her Majesty's Government are undertaking to <P>


<a name="column_720"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 720</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>support the monitoring of the situation, and what measures are in place to bring parties to account if they do so breach the agreements?
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para84"></a>Now that there is an agreement in at least part of Sudan, what measures are being taken to implement and support a thorough survey of the condition of the country? We are particularly worried that the devastating spread of HIV/AIDS, the displacement of large numbers of people, and the rape that tends to accompany warfare, will have created ideal conditions for the further rapid and widespread transmission of the virus. This support, as we have seen, can significantly affect a country's ability to get back on its feet.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para85"></a>I have touched on but some of the main points surrounding the situation in Sudan as a whole. Darfur continues to be a critical issue that cannot be ignored. It undermines the great steps forward taken in the current agreement, and places at risk the future development and reduction of poverty in the country as a whole.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-10_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for bringing the recent developments in Sudan to the attention of the House. I welcome her continued dedication to the plight of the Sudanese people, and I thank her for all the advice that she has given to the Government on this issue. It has been valuable to have this relationship with her.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para86"></a>The last time we discussed developments in Sudan, things were looking more positive than for some time before that. Excellent progress continues to be made on the peace talks in Naivasha between the Government and the SPLM. Both sides have now described the peace talks as irreversible, and we hope that they will continue to provide a framework agreement soon. Although problems persist in some areas&#151;and we have heard a great deal about that in the past 45 minutes&#151;there is, at last, a real chance for peace in Sudan, and a real chance to end the suffering of the Sudanese people.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para87"></a>It has been freely acknowledged around the House that as is so often the case in peace talks, we are investing heavily in this process, while at the same time acknowledging, as so many of your Lordships have, that there continue to be some terrible problems. There are problems around human rights, including, as my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead reminded us, press freedom, including some of the appalling punishments that your Lordships have described. There is also the enormously difficult situation in Darfur. The noble Baroness concentrated much of her address on the situation in Darfur, but she also rightly acknowledged that the peace process is going ahead, and that point was also acknowledged by my noble friend Lord Clarke.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para88"></a>On 7 January, the Government and the SPLM signed an agreement on wealth-sharing arrangements, which is an important factor in what we are discussing. That provides for the division of oil revenues, a point to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly drew our <P>


<a name="column_721"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 721</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>attention, the banking arrangements and the creation of a joint transition team to prepare budget estimates and raise funds for reconstruction. This is a significant step towards peace in Sudan. I would be happy to arrange a full briefing on this issue, if noble Lords have not yet had one.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para89"></a>I recognise the strength of the argument that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, put forward about disinvestment. I hope that he will agree that while we are making progress in this area, and while we may be pressing forward on the peace issues, now may not be the time to press the lobby on disinvestment. The oil in Sudan should be used for the benefit of all. It is the oil that may provide the platform for the improvement overall in the conditions in Sudan. I hope that the agreement signed on 7 January will allow us to give that greater reality on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para90"></a>The parties are continuing to talk about resolving the remaining issues on power-sharing in the three conflict areas of Southern Blue Nile, the Nuba Mountains and Abyei. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, reminded us of that point. There are important issues to be resolved here, and there must be a genuinely inclusive, democratic system of governance that respects the rights of all Sudanese people. That is the best way to ensure popular ownership of the peacekeeping arrangements and thus the sustainability of any future peace arrangements. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings&#151;who made some very forceful points on some of these areas of outstanding difficulties&#151;that those matters have not yet been resolved and are still under discussion. The points that she has made are very well taken in those continuing peace discussions.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para91"></a>Given the progress already made, the parties hope to have a framework agreement within weeks, and a comprehensive package within a few months. There is still work to be done on those issues. If we are able to get such a comprehensive package it will be a real achievement, one to which the United Kingdom will have made a significant contribution through our special representative for Sudan, Alan Goulty, and the joint Foreign Office/DfID Sudan Unit, as well as the embassy in Khartoum.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para92"></a>Many of your Lordships have played a crucial role in that, including the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I should also like to place on record ministerial thanks for all the work and commitment that officials in both the FCO and DfID have dedicated to this project in the past 18 months, a time when we have been in constant contact with all parties, offering support and advice.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para93"></a>Let us turn to the issue of United Kingdom financial assistance. As many of your Lordships said, ultimately it does not matter what is written on the piece of paper&#151;what really matters is how that piece of paper is implemented. Of course what is on the paper is important, but the real issue is what happens on the ground. Implementation is going to be even more difficult than negotiating the agreement. The support of the international community, as many of your Lordships have acknowledged, will be crucial to ensuring that the peace holds.
<P>


<a name="column_722"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 722</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para94"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, asked various questions on UK financial assistance. We have allocated 28 million to Sudan for 2003&#150;04. There are plans for a donor conference in Oslo once a comprehensive peace agreement is secured. We would expect our contribution to increase significantly in future years. We will of course need to co-ordinate carefully with the United Nations and other governments and non-governmental organisations working in Sudan. Co-operation and careful planning are the only way to ensure that Sudan gets maximum benefit from the external assistance that it receives.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para95"></a>Sudan will also need our help to meet the humanitarian, recovery and reintegration needs of its people. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, was absolutely right when he spoke about the importance of this implementation issue. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations has already carried out a scoping mission to plan for a UN peace support operation. We will continue to help with the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of combatants, and local level peace-building work.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para96"></a>There will also be an opportunity for Sudan to develop more effective systems of governance, particularly of justice and security, and in terms of public administration. That of course includes the development of the capacity of civil society in the fields of human and child rights, gender and legal awareness so that they are able to engage with donors as partners and critically engage with the government.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para97"></a>There will also be much work to be done with the Sudanese to develop and implement policies that really do benefit the poor people. The noble Lord used some compelling language about poverty in relation to the oil industry. We acknowledge that it is enormously important to address the poverty issue. Improved macroeconomic management will be key in that endeavour, as will resolution of Sudan's debt problems. Once an agreement has been signed, the UK will chair a support group of key international creditors and donors to help ensure timely co-ordinated action for clearance of debt arrears. I hope that that, too, is a piece of good news.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para98"></a>The relevant international agencies and financial institutions are planning joint assessment missions in both the north and the south to look at the requirements for development assistance. The Sudanese parties must obviously be fully involved in the process and feel full ownership of the outcomes of such a process.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para99"></a>Many noble Lords were very worried about the human rights issues. We continue to be very concerned indeed about the human rights position in the whole of Sudan, regardless of religious or ethnic background. The promotion of human rights through advocacy with the government and support for NGOs remains one of this Government's priorities.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para100"></a>I assure your Lordships that we raise the human rights issue on a regular basis, both bilaterally and as part of the EU/Sudan dialogue. Indeed, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development, Hilary Benn, discussed the human rights situation with the President of Sudan and others during his visit to <P>


<a name="column_723"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 723</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Khartoum on 10 December. He then raised the issue of the cross-amputation sentence on a 16 year-old boy who has been accused of armed robbery.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para101"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that we are also raising the sentence of flogging on the 16 year-old girl to whom he referred. The punishment has been postponed until 23 January. I am not clear at this juncture whether this is merely a postponement or whether it will be a rehearing of the sentence, which is indeed a savage and terrible one. I undertake to keep the noble Lord informed on that as he has made such a point of raising it with my honourable friend.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para102"></a>The question of Sharia law is a very difficult one; it raises a whole range of issues. We respect the view that Sharia law has some part to play. However, I am bound to say that we also share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that the application of these very extreme punishments is inconsistent with international human rights standards and with Sudan's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I hope that that gives him the explicit assurance that he seeks.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para103"></a>We have also raised the issues raised by my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead about the suppression of freedom of the press. Our ambassador in Khartoum spoke to the Minister of Justice about this matter on 22 December. We continue to press on that issue.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para104"></a>Similarly, we continue to press on the issue surrounding the recent report of arrests of political activists, supporters of NGOs and trades unionists. Our embassy in Khartoum has raised these issues with the Government in Sudan who have acknowledged our concerns and who have indeed undertaken to look into these matters and report back to us. I shall of course report back to the noble Lord on that.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para105"></a>We need to monitor all these issues very closely. We were disappointed that, despite our hard work and that of our EU partners, we did not win the vote on the UN Commission on Human Rights last year. It was lost, as many of your Lordships know, on 16 April 2003. The defeat meant the termination of the mandate of the special rapporteur. We now have to consider how to tackle this issue in 2004. I should also tell your Lordships very quickly that, last week, in the margins of the regional conference on democracy and human rights held in Sanaa, my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith was able to discuss some of these issues with the Sudanese Foreign Minister. I hope that that news also is welcome to your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para106"></a>I still have some time until the 1.30 p.m. restart time. With your Lordships' permission, perhaps I can take three or four more minutes to say something about what happened in Darfur. Many of your Lordships concentrated your remarks on the concerns that remain in Darfur. Your Lordships are right that the situation is very worrying. Insecurity in Darfur means that there is limited access, and so there is limited ability to assess the situation properly on the ground. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out, the requirements in all sectors&#151;food, water and <P>


<a name="column_724"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 724</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shelter&#151;are enormous. I think that the noble Lord used the word "catastrophic" at one point. These are real problems.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para107"></a>Civilian protection also is a major concern, with repeated reports of human rights abuses perpetrated by various factions, as described by your Lordships this afternoon. Against that background, the breakdown of the peace talks&#151;these are of course separate peace talks&#151;between the government and the Sudan Liberation Movement was a severe blow. All sides should know from bitter experience that a military solution is not in prospect and that peace and reconciliation is the only way forward to a brighter future for Darfur.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para108"></a>Our ambassador in Khartoum and the UK special representative speak to the Government of Sudan and the various Darfur movements on an almost daily basis. We are fully engaged; that is the point which I am very anxious to get over to your Lordships. Indeed, the special representative is in the region this week and has held discussions with the First Vice-President, among others.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para109"></a>By providing for a truly decentralised federal system, the overall Sudan peace agreement should help address some of the root causes of the conflict in Darfur. But in the immediate short-term a ceasefire must be re-established to allow unfettered humanitarian access. We have offered our good offices to all parties to help them reach a peaceful solution. We have also suggested, as many of your Lordships have, that there may be a role for the international community in assisting in the implementation of a peace deal.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para110"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, also raised points on unimpeded humanitarian access. It is absolutely vital that unimpeded access is given. That is another point that has been raised over and over again.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para111"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, wanted to know how we are monitoring these issues. In the past few days Her Majesty's Government have agreed to provide a temporary senior humanitarian affairs officer to assist the United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator and humanitarian agencies on the ground to strengthen the continuing United Nations and international crisis response. Therefore, we, in this country, are making another effort to put another person on the ground for the monitoring purposes which I acknowledge are enormously important. I assure the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that we have raised with the authorities the military and aerial bombardment to which he referred. We have protested about that; we have raised those points. I hope that I shall be able to report further on that.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para112"></a>We are also engaged with the EU heads of mission in Khartoum. We had discussions earlier this month. We and others in the EU have already pressed the Government of Sudan about Darfur and where it stands in the dialogue. Of course, we are pressing through the United Nations and the Secretary General's special envoy; and we are engaged with the United States.

<a name="40115-10_para113"></a>The Sudanese people know as well as any people anywhere how fragile and complicated peace building can be. It is all too easy for the perhaps disillusioned few to threaten the process. No one underestimates the difficulties that we face, in particular the difficulties in Darfur. But as noble Lords have acknowledged Sudan now has a real opportunity to bring to an end the suffering of its people. It is an opportunity which has to be seized.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para114"></a>It is crucial that everyone, in all parts of Sudan, get to appreciate what is at stake&#151;the real prizes of peace, security, stability and poverty reduction&#151;and that everyone in Sudan feels that they have a say and a stake in their country's future. It is the best way to ensure that any peace agreement holds good for the future.
<P>

<a name="40115-10_para115"></a>The price is great, not just for Sudan, but for the entire region. A peace agreement in Sudan brought about under African mediation and implemented in Africa by Africans would be further evidence that while the continent may have its problems, it also has its solutions.

<a name="40115-11_para2"></a>House again in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para3"></a>Clause 4 [Appointment of Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond </B>   moved Amendment No. 30:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 41, leave out from beginning to end of line 3 on page 3 and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(3) The Prime Minister shall make recommendations to Her Majesty concerning all appointments under subsection (1) or (2), based on recommendations made by the First and Deputy First Minister acting jointly, in such forms as the Prime Minister may specify."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-11_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: With regard to the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal, we believe that the published Bill has failed to meet the expectation raised in the updated implementation plan published by the Northern Ireland Office that the Prime Minister will appoint persons to these positions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"based on the recommendations of the First and Deputy First Minister".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-11_para6"></a>
Instead the Bill has diminished the role of the First and Deputy First Ministers by requiring the Prime Minister only to "consider" any recommendation for appointment made by the First and Deputy First Ministers. That falls short of the Criminal Justice Review recommendation on this point which the Government purported to accept without qualification in the first plan. The review has provided that responsibility for making recommendations for the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice and Lords <P>


<a name="column_726"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Justices of Appeal would lie with the Prime Minister, but on the basis of recommendations from the First and Deputy First Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para7"></a>The review recommendation appears to give greater weight to the recommendations of the First and Deputy First Ministers. Therefore, I ask the Minister why that wording was not incorporated in the Bill given that the same commitment had also been given in the updated implementation plan? Moreover, it seems only consistent with the transfer of judicial appointments from the expected to reserved category of the Northern Ireland Act that the First and Deputy First Ministers would, after devolution, have greater powers in relation to such appointments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Elton): </B>  If this amendment is carried, I shall be unable to call Amendment No. 31 for reason of pre-emption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have some inclination to support this amendment. However, I shall shortly move Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 33 and 34 which cover basically the same subject, as I understand it, although perhaps our arguments will be different. The points that the noble Baroness made in relation to previous documents, including the review, are all very relevant. I am a little surprised that there is no noble Lord on the Labour Back Benches to take part in this debate. However, that is not my business or the Government's. I support the noble Baroness's amendment, but I would not support it were she to press it as I wish to move my Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 33 and 34.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   This amendment seeks to require the Prime Minister to base his recommendations to Her Majesty on the most senior judicial appointments on the recommendations of the First and Deputy First Ministers. That is how we interpret the amendment's wording and intent.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para8"></a>Under Clause 4 the Prime Minister will be required to consider the recommendations of the First and Deputy First Ministers before he makes a recommendation to Her Majesty. The First and Deputy First Ministers' recommendations will have been made after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice whose views will be made known to the Prime Minister. Our interpretation at least of the subsequent clutch of amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was that they pointed in the other direction from that, but we may have misinterpreted what the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as to the substance of"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-11_para9"></a>
meant. Time will tell regarding that matter which we shall discuss later. If that were to be the case, I should suggest to the Committee that we are steering a middle course between the Prime Minister being no more than a postman&#151;which I believe is the thrust of the Liberal Democrat recommendation&#151;and how we interpret the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran; namely, that essentially the commission rather than the First and Deputy First Ministers makes the recommendation.
<P>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para10"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that the process as debated at Second Reading strikes a right and necessary balance by ensuring a central role for the First and Deputy First Ministers and the Prime Minister in a robust and fair procedure. The Prime Minister will, of course, take very seriously the recommendations of the two Ministers acting jointly. We must rely on him to act appropriately. One could not conceive of a Prime Minister lightly dismissing the recommendations of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. However, one would not need to be too Machiavellian in nature not to conceive of some circumstances in which he might wish to test, or have some further exploration or probing of, that process. In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I believe that the discretion that is available to him is exactly right. For those reasons&#151;while one would hope that we are always in a situation where he would be no more than a postman&#151;I do not think that it is wise to remove the possibility of him having some discretion and influence on the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   This is an interesting topic. I should be interested to know from the noble Baroness who will reply to the debate on her amendment what the grounds are for distinguishing between the situation in Northern Ireland in this regard and that in England and Wales. In England and Wales the appointment of the very senior judiciary is made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister to Her Majesty. If I have understood correctly the import of the noble Baroness's amendment, and as has just been said, so far as concerns Northern Ireland the Prime Minister would simply be a postman, in which case why have him or her there at all? Although one recognises that Northern Ireland is in many respects different from the rest of the United Kingdom, I do not think that there is a sufficient reason to distinguish between the constitutional arrangements in this regard. However, I should be interested to hear from the noble Baroness why she believes that there is sufficient reason so to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </B>   I take the point that has been made. I reiterate that the measure concerns the recommendations of the First and Deputy First Ministers, but the Bill has diminished their role. I shall consider very carefully what the Minister said. We may return to the matter on Report. In the mean time, I shall reflect on what the Minister said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   Will the noble Baroness tell the House whether the Minister's interpretation is correct&#151;if it is, mine was entirely wrong&#151;that the Liberal Democrat amendment views the Prime Minister solely as a postman?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </B>   No, indeed, we do not consider that that is the case. As I said, I shall reflect on what the Minister said. We may return to the matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(c) consult the Lord Chancellor"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-11_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is about the same subject: the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice. As the clause stands, as the Minister will appreciate having read the amendment, we are not happy. We have grouped the amendments because they all focus on Clause 4, which changes the arrangements for the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice and the Lords Justices of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para14"></a>It would be profitable as we are in Committee to have just one debate on the shortcomings of the clause. The amendments are grouped so that we can debate our concerns under one heading. I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 31 to 34 and focus on three main points. Essentially, we are not satisfied that the appointment of the most senior judicial officials in Northern Ireland, has the necessary degree of consultation between appropriate parties. In the Bill the chain of consultation is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para15"></a>Subsection (3) provides for the Prime Minister to ask the First and Deputy First Minister for a recommendation about the appointment "in such a form" as he may specify, which he must consider before he makes a recommendation to Her Majesty the Queen.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para16"></a>Subsection (4) provides for the First and Deputy First Ministers to be obliged to consult the Lord Chief Justice or the most senior Lord Justice of Appeal before making a recommendation to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para17"></a>Subsection (5) says that the Judicial Appointments Commission must advise the First and Deputy First Ministers on the procedure they should adopt in formulating a recommendation to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para18"></a>Our amendments seek to alter that change of consultation in three principal areas. First, consultation with the Lord Chancellor should be obligatory&#151;that follows the thesis that we have pursued throughout&#151;both for the Prime Minister; and under subsection (3); and the First and Deputy First Ministers in formulating their recommendations under subsection (4). Amendment No. 31 would require the Prime Minister to consult the Lord Chancellor under subsection (3)&#151;that is during his consideration of the recommendations put forward to him by the First and Deputy First Ministers. Amendment No. 32 would require the First and Deputy First Ministers to consult the Lord Chancellor as well as the Lord Chief Justice under subsection (4) before they make their recommendations to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para19"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland put forward the fundamental reasons why we think the Lord Chancellor, as the head of the judiciary and having taken the judicial oath, should be responsible for, or at least be part of the consultation process in, judicial appointments. That is, surely, nowhere more necessary than when consulting before the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Justices of Appeal.
<P>


<a name="column_729"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 729</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para20"></a>Our second major point is highlighted by Amendment No. 33. Subsection (5) currently has the Judicial Appointments Commission give advice to the First and Deputy First Ministers on the procedure which should be adopted when making a recommendation under subsection (3). We are bemused as to why they should only give advice on procedure and not on potential candidates themselves. Surely the whole point of the JAC is to make judicial appointments. It should know better than the First and Deputy First Ministers and say from a less political and more impartial basis who should be put forward as worthy recommendations for such senior judicial positions. Amendment No. 33 would have them give advice, not only on the procedure to adopt for recommendations but, on the substance&#151;perhaps on a short list of names of those who the Ministers consider to merit recommendation for the appointments.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para21"></a>Our third point follows that. We believe that there would be serious repercussions if the First and Deputy First Ministers put only one name forward to the Prime Minister under subsection 3(a). It would be hard for that not to be an overtly political decision, especially when currently the First and Deputy First Ministers are hardly likely to both support the same candidate. It might be a case, as happens in many other areas&#151;in that little country, in my little country&#151;of "your choice this time; my turn next time"&#151;orange today and green tomorrow. The political implications of that are more alarming when one bears in mind that the Prime Minister might reject the one name put forward. I hope that he would maintain that right. Therefore, we suggest that in Amendment No. 34 at least three names be put forward in the recommendation by the First and Deputy First Ministers under subsection (3)(a) from which the Prime Minister must choose one.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para22"></a>That proposal would be in accordance with established practice, at least as it was under the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The respective merits of the judges recommended were explained and a ranking offered. The Prime Minister is not obliged to choose any of them under the amendment, nor should he be as a matter of statute, although normally he might do so. But he needs to be well informed of their perceived respective strengths and possible weaknesses, not merely to know who is the first choice of the First and Deputy First Ministers. I hope that I have made myself clear. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I recognise the importance of the issues, the clause and the amendments. We have understood, as have our lawyers, that the thrust of the Liberal Democrat recommendation in the previous amendment left no discretion for the Prime Minister. I would be pleased to hear if that was not their intent, but that is the meaning of the words to us. As I have signalled, the Bill comes between two more extreme positions than that which we have adopted in this part of the Bill. It may be helpful if I put briefly on record the process as it would operate in practice. I am <P>


<a name="column_730"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 730</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggesting that, because I found it difficult and because in practice they work in reverse chronological order&#151;going backwards rather than forwards in time when being read.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para23"></a>The first part of the process is essential&#151;that before any vacancy arises the Judicial Appointments Commission would advise the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the procedure that they should adopt in formulating a recommendation to the Prime Minister on the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal. So the procedure would have to be set out. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister would have considered the advice of the commission and agreed, with the approval of the Prime Minister, the procedure that would be used. So, the commission would make recommendations to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister; they would consider a process; and that would then require the agreement of the Prime Minister, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister before there was a vacancy.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para24"></a>The agreed procedure would be essential to ensure the overall integrity, fairness and transparency of the recommendations. One would expect that it would cover issues such as criteria; whether the process would involve applications or expressions of interest; the type of evidence on which criteria would be measured; the stage at which the Lord Chief Justice would be consulted; and the time that the overall procedure would take. Essentially, the process by which recommendations are to emerge, and the process for testing candidates&#151;if that is not too formal a term&#151;would have been set up.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para25"></a>Assuming that a vacancy arose, the Prime Minister would require the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to make a recommendation to him in such form as the Prime Minister specified. That would allow the Prime Minister to ask for a single name, or perhaps two or three. The wording "in such form" would give discretion to the Prime Minister to decide on the number of names to be put forward and whether they were ranked. Again, we believe that the discretion provided by the Bill is right.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para26"></a>The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister then apply the procedure in reaching their recommendations. Before finalising them, they consult with the Lord Chief Justice and then submit their recommendations to the Prime Minister together with whatever views the Lord Chief Justice has expressed to them. Alternatively, the Lord Chief Justice may copy his views directly to the Prime Minister. As we signalled at Second Reading, we felt it right that there should be a direct route for advice from the Lord Chief Justice to the Prime Minister before he makes his decision.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para27"></a>The Prime Minister will then consider the recommendations and will no doubt have regard to the advice that the Lord Chief Justice gave to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. The Prime Minister will then make a recommendation to Her Majesty, who will make the appointment. I apologise for taking time to explain the procedure, but it is a fundamental issue of concern to the Committee. It is our interpretation of the meaning of the clause.
<P>


<a name="column_731"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 731</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para28"></a>I turn to the specifics. On consultation with the Lord Chancellor, the process will happen only when devolution has occurred. When devolution has taken place, the Lord Chancellor will not have a role with regard to Northern Ireland. No one can fetter the discretion of the Prime Minister&#151;if he wants to consult with the Lord Chancellor, the ways of government give him plenty of opportunity to do so. But it is wrong in principle to put that on the face of the Bill for the devolution reasons I have given, and perhaps it goes into more detail than is appropriate. It is possible for the Prime Minister to consult if he wants to do so.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para29"></a>I make a similar point with regard to the second issue about the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. They have to consult with the Lord Chief Justice, as well they should not least because his views will be communicated to the Prime Minister before the Prime Minister takes a view. We cannot see why they should not also consult with the Lord Chancellor for the reasons I have previously given. The Lord Chancellor does not have a role in the post-devolution world about which we are talking.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para30"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, then asked: why only advice on procedure and not on substance? The Judicial Appointments Commission will be giving advice to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on the process by which the selection will be run. I do not know what advice they will give&#151;who can?&#151;but clearly there must be the kind of procedures one would expect to see when senior and skilled appointments are put in place. There must be a fair process for indicating the people who can apply, clear criteria and clear processes for testing those criteria. That is the nature of their advice.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para31"></a>The process might or might not involve members of the Judicial Appointments Commission. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, says, they have great expertise in these issues, but it is left open to them what they advise and then the process the First Minister and Deputy First Minister agree. But of course the First Minister and Deputy First Minister can agree that process only if they agree it with the Prime Minister as well.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para32"></a>That may sound complex, but it is complex for a purpose. It tries to ensure that no one person has absolute power in this situation. We believe that is right. There are some health checks and balances on the process as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para33"></a>On the final point relating to the Prime Minister&#151;it would be the case if the amendment were carried&#151;the Prime Minister would have the choice of three names. The Bill as it stands allows the Prime Minister to ensure that that happens if he wants it to. Clause 4(3) includes the words "in such form". That means that if the Prime Minister decides as much, he can at the beginning of the process specify that he wants the best three candidates, ranked or unranked, with reasons. Therefore, as the Bill stands, he is at liberty. He may always want that; he may never want that; he might want two names; or he might want more. He should have discretion, which is the thrust of the argument put by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.
<P>


<a name="column_732"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 732</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para34"></a>The world changes and one cannot always envisage how and in what way. That discretion left with the Prime Minister may be wise and helpful. It allows him to do exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, wants, but does not specify that something must always be the case if he judges it to be otherwise. That is our clear view of how the process would work and our suggestion on how it would intercept with the objectives raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I respect those objectives.
<P>

<a name="40115-11_para35"></a>I believe that I have covered everything and perhaps a little more. The clause as debated on Second Reading reflects Recommendations 75 and 85 of the Criminal Justice Review. I hope that that explanation has been helpful.

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040115/text/40115-12.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   That was a helpful explanation of the Government's understanding of the effect of the procedure. As the Minister said, at first sight it is slightly confusing because it starts at the end and works back to the beginning.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para0"></a>Perhaps I may make a textual point. The Minister said that the Prime Minister may require the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Commission to specify one, two, three names or whatever. He says that that is achieved by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such form as the Prime Minister may specify".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-12_para1"></a>
I find that confusing because on reading the Bill I asked myself whether the Prime Minister would be able to specify that more than one recommendation should be made. He has told us that that is the intention and no doubt his advice is that that is achieved by the use of those words.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para2"></a>That is confusing and I wonder whether the provision ought not to be spelt out more explicitly. It could be done by inserting another subsection such as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whatever form the Prime Minister shall specify shall in any event relate to whether the candidate shall be alone or with one or two others".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-12_para3"></a>
But I am wondering whether it would not be better and safer for the Government to adopt the policy of requiring that in any event there shall be more than one candidate. That would remove from the Prime Minister the discretion to ask simply for a single candidate. My noble friend Lord Glentoran has touched upon the reasons that are peculiar to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para4"></a>There is much value in looking at the procedure adopted by the Church of England for the appointment of bishops. Lambeth sends two names to the Prime Minister and he can choose one or the other. They are listed in order of preference. He can say, "I don't like either of these. Try again". Under the settlement the Church achieved after a good deal of worry, it cannot send a single name.

<P>

leave it open to him to require one, two, three names or whatever. However, as this is an important issue I will treble check and will correspond with noble Lords. I have not received advice which puts doubt on that and signals a weakness, but it is critical.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para6"></a>Why not spell it out more clearly? If it is clear enough and the lawyers' advice is clear&#151;and I shall confirm that in writing&#151;there is no need to. Why not specify that there must always be two or three candidates? In essence, that sits on the delicate issue of how the Government are trying to work towards a devolved settlement. One would hope for a situation in which devolution works perfectly and that therefore the Prime Minister's role in the process would be minimal. There are good reasons for wishing that to be the case: the more that Northern Ireland is able to decide on its own affairs in ways that meet the tests of merit and probity that one would expect in a good society, the better. Therefore, there could be circumstances in which the Prime Minister was happy for one name to come forward.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para7"></a>There could be other circumstances when it was felt to be wiser to allow two or three names. In order to allow flexibility in seeing how devolution develops, it would be good to leave the element of discretion in the Bill as it currently is.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for those explanations. They were very helpful. I am afraid that my brain is such that I shall need to study his comments more carefully in Hansard next week, and I may wish to return to this matter.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para8"></a>I have one question for the noble Lord: what happens before devolution? I thought that the idea of introducing the Bill now was that most of what it contains can be implemented without devolution. The noble Lord said that "in such form" the Prime Minister may make a request, and so on. I have tabled an amendment to try to ensure that that does not happen and that such a provision is not enacted before devolution. But if that amendment were not agreed to, and were the Bill to be enacted before devolution, can the noble Lord explain what would happen?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Yes. I should have expressed myself more clearly. The Bill will be enacted before devolution. Were there to be a vacancy&#151;I hope and pray that that there is not to be one shortly&#151;it would not be possible for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to make a recommendation unless they were in place and devolution had occurred. That is what I was signalling. Unless they are in office and the Assembly has been reconvened and is functioning, there will be no one to fulfil the functions as set out in Clause 4.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I hate to go into detail, but this is the right time. If there is no First Minister and Deputy First Minister and no devolution, but a Judicial Appointments Commission is in place&#151;let us assume that there is a Lord Chancellor or that the Secretary of State at the constitutional department has taken the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>judicial oath&#151;perhaps we shall need to have something in Hansard on how the Government see these appointments taking place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Were there to be a vacancy for a Lord Chief Justice but devolution had not happened, the Lord Chancellor would make the appointment under the existing Act in the way that has just taken place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that, and I shall pursue that matter on Report, having read Hansard carefully. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40115-12_para10"></a>[Amendments Nos. 32 to 34 not moved.]
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para11"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 4 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I had not intended to pursue this issue until I heard the Minister clearly make a statement that although, before devolution, we were previously promised that the commission would not be formed&#151;it was not advised when the Criminal Justice Review took place. That is really too much. Within two years, the Government will go back on a promise made to this House when the 2002 Act was passed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I may have misunderstood the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, on that point. As I was seeking to signal, we are bringing forward the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Commission, so that these elements in the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice cannot take place until devolution has happened. In earlier parts of our discussion, I sought to set out why I thought that appointments to the Judicial Appointments Commission were in the interests of Northern Ireland in advance of devolution. That matter was dealt with before lunch. Under Clause 4, those do not operate unless devolution has taken place.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para12"></a>The provision in Clause 4 also brings the process making senior judicial appointments more closely into line with the Criminal Justice Review's recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that matter. If I misheard or misunderstood what he said to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I apologise. I am reassured by what he has just said and I am grateful.

<P>

<a name="40115-12_para16"></a>What is the motive behind this extraordinary change? It is not as though we have any evidence upon which to base it. Not only did the Act which the Government are now seeking to amend receive Royal Assent as recently as 2002; but we have as yet no experience whatever of its operation. In the absence of any convincing answer from the Minister, I am forced to conclude that the effect of the change will be to elevate political considerations as a factor in the dismissal of judges.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para17"></a>The 2002 Bill, already and inexplicably, removes the requirement of an address of both Houses of Parliament for the dismissal of newly appointed Northern Irish High Court judges&#151;a requirement that has existed for more than 400 years. At least, however, under the 2002 Act, the First and Second Ministers will not be able to dismiss such a judge "without the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice"&#151;a person himself only removable on an address of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para18"></a>Now, under the new Bill, the expression "without the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice" is to be replaced with the expression "except under consultation with the Lord Chief Justice". I ask the noble Lord the Minister: why on earth?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   Perhaps I may add my voice to that of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on this issue. Again, I point out that less than two years ago the Government took the view&#151;not blindly I hope, but with consideration&#151;that it was appropriate to secure the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice before a holder of a listed judicial office could be removed or suspended.
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para19"></a>Perhaps the Minister can say on how many occasions over the past 18 months the Lord Chief Justice has objected to, or refused to agree to, the removal or suspension of a holder of a listed judicial office. Has he displayed stubbornness and intransigence again and again? If the answer is no&#151;as I suspect it is&#151;then why is this clause in the Bill? If there have been, as I suspect, no such occasions of defiance or conflict as I have outlined, why are we here on this issue?
<P>

<a name="40115-12_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, makes a very important point. To reduce the place, position and responsibility of the Lord Chief Justice as blatantly as does this element within the Bill is to elevate the opportunity&#151;opportunities will, inevitably, be taken&#151;for political considerations to gain dominance. With all sincerity, I ask the Government to look very carefully at the implications and the dire potential consequences of this change.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   There can be very few issues more important to the rule of law than those surrounding the circumstances in which a senior judge can be removed. As has already been pointed out, that has been recognised in our constitutional arrangements for 400 years or more. To their credit, the Government <P>


<a name="column_736"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 736</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>patently recognised that in the 2002 Act. They stipulated not only that the recommendation of a tribunal to dismiss a judge and for a judge to be dismissed should be a matter of consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland; they also stipulated that it should not take place save with his agreement.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para0"></a>In these days of transparent and open government, it would be helpful to know on what basis of consultation with the then Lord Chief Justice that provision was included in that Bill, which was subsequently enacted. Was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell&#151;then, Sir Robert Carswell&#151;consulted and may the Committee know what his view about that was? Presumably, he concurred with the provision that his consent should be obtained. I believe that the Government argue that the Criminal Justice Review did not specify that that consent should be obtained. However, one assumes that it was thought necessary, and I should like to know why in 2002 it was felt that it should be obtained.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Amos, was kind enough to write to me&#151;for which I am very grateful&#151;following a speech that I made at Second Reading when I alluded to this matter. She was kind enough to say that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, the then Lord Chief Justice, had been consulted about this amendment, which simply requires consultation. She did not tell me what his view had been. It would be helpful to know whether his view has been obtained. She also went on to say that Sir Brian Kerr, his successor as Lord Chief Justice, was to be consulted, and I expect that, by now, he has been. Therefore, I should like to have a good deal more light thrown upon this matter. It seems very strange that the Government now consider it necessary to dilute the requirement for the consent of the Lord Chief Justice to be obtained. I join the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and also my noble friend Lord Kingsland in asking why.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_time0"></a><H5>3.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   As has been said, the clause removes the formal requirement for the Lord Chief Justice's agreement to the removal or suspension of a person from a listed judicial office. However, the Lord Chief Justice will be consulted on the removal. Clause 5 more closely reflects the recommendation of the Criminal Justice Review.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para2"></a>Perhaps I may set out why we do not believe that there is a risk or a weakness here in relation to the independence of the judiciary. First and fundamentally, the removal of a judicial office holder can only follow the recommendation of a judicial tribunal. Such a tribunal will be brought into existence either by, or in consultation with, the Lord Chief Justice. Therefore, at the start of the process, the Lord Chief Justice will be consulted or he himself may have convened the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para3"></a>As the Committee will recall from the 2002 Act, the membership of the tribunal consists of two judges and one lay person. The nature of the judge varies according to the nature of the office holder who is being considered for misconduct. The appointment of <P>


<a name="column_737"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 737</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the judge to the tribunal is recommended by the Lord Chief Justice. Therefore, the Lord Chief Justice has a very strong hand in setting up the tribunal and in its procedures, its terms of reference and its membership. At its simplest, there will always be two judges and one lay person on such a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para4"></a>No judge can be dismissed unless such a tribunal recommends dismissal. That is stated categorically in the legislation. Therefore, the process is effectively in the hands of appropriately senior members of the judiciary with a lay member also present.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para5"></a>The question of who chairs the tribunal varies according to the level of seniority of the judge whose conduct gave sufficient cause for concern that it required a tribunal to investigate the issue. However, it would always be chaired either by a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary&#151;a member of the Appellate Committee in this House&#151;or by the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal. One of those three would always chair any judicial tribunal set up to investigate what were thought to be sufficient allegations of misconduct to warrant the tribunal. It is fairly clear that we anticipate that the circumstances in which such tribunals would be needed would arise only rarely, but that does not mean that it is not crucial and appropriate to have them.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para6"></a>I now turn to the other questions that were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, rightly asked about the position of the Lord Chief Justice in such a situation. Like me, the noble Lord will have a chance to look at Hansard, but I hope that I explained the degree of judicial control over the tribunal process which leads to an investigation. The fundamental point is that a judge cannot be removed unless a tribunal so recommends. A tribunal will always be chaired by either the Lord Chief Justice himself, a judicial Member of the House of Lords or a Lord Justice of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para7"></a>The question of consultation with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, and Sir Brian Kerr is a difficult issue on which to go into full detail. However, I can give a categorical assurance that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, has been fully consulted on these issues and that Sir Brian Kerr has also recently been consulted by officials in the Northern Ireland court service. Therefore, they have been part of the process of considering this matter, although I am not necessarily putting or not putting their names to it. I shall leave that question suitably anonymous.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para8"></a>I hope that I have explained why it is right to have a process which is so strongly under the control of the judiciary yet which, nevertheless, has a lay element in it. We believe that the clause as set out in the Bill is an appropriate means for investigating allegations of judicial misconduct, should they occur.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I wonder whether he can explain one point. He referred to the need, or the possibility, of a Member of the House of Lords taking part in the final decision. <P>


<a name="column_738"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column 738</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, is that provision based on the assumption that there will always be Law Lords in your Lordships' House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   That is one of the perennial problems of having a sequence of proposals which, as yet, have not all been put in place. I believe that this issue finds expression in the 2002 Act, which refers to members of the Appellate Committee of this House. Should we reach the point where that is changed, clearly amendments will need to be made to part of that Act in order to substitute a "member of the supreme court", if that is the terminology that we use.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. He majored, if I may express it in that way, on the input that the Lord Chief Justice would have in the setting up, and manning, of the tribunal. What I do not recall hearing him say is why it is necessary to make this change now. He has explained that there has been consultation. I can understand that there may be reasons for that. However, he has not explained to us, so far as I can recall, why the Government think it necessary within so short a time to make this change so that the Lord Chief Justice's consent, on top of his other input, no longer has to be obtained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   For two reasons. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, being knowledgeable about Northern Ireland affairs, will have read the Hillsborough agreement as well as I have. More fundamentally, in many situations when a tribunal is set up, the Lord Chief Justice will already have been part of the process. So that situation is a circular one. When he is not part of the process, it will have been chaired by a member of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. In our view, one could hardly have a stronger test than that. And the final reason is that it brings us into line with the Criminal Justice Review report and if we think there is no strong reason not to do so, we do think that there is merit in doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Until 24 July 2002, when the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 came into force, all High Court judges in Northern Ireland were protected from dismissal by a requirement that it could only take place on an Address of both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament. This procedure was replaced in the 2002 Bill by an equivalent double lock procedure. For a dismissal to take place, first the tribunal, with a majority of judges, was required to recommend dismissal. The second part of the lock was that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland also had to give his or her approval.
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para9"></a>Thus the previous situation was the double lock of both Houses of Parliament. The new situation since July 2002 is the double lock of the tribunal and the Lord Chief Justice. The Government were entirely satisfied with that situation in the middle of 2002. They fought for it, they argued for it, they rationalised it. Now, less than two years later, the Government have decided to remove one of those two locks.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-13_para10"></a>I have listened to what the Minister said with interest and a degree of sympathy. However, I am forced to conclude that a reasonable person, observing what the Government are proposing and listening to what the Government have said in this debate, would conclude that the reason for the removal of the second part of the lock is wholly political. There seems absolutely no legal rationality whatsoever for doing what the Government have done. If that conclusion is right, it is a very serious matter. I shall not ask your Lordships' House to vote on this matter today but I shall certainly return to it at Report. I withdraw my objection to Clause 5 standing part of the Bill.

Except in one respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in the Grand Committee.

Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.

 "OBJECTIVE OF THE NDA
<br>
(1) The objective of the NDA is based upon general environmental principles that must be followed by any person or body in carrying out its functions under this Act.
<br>
(2) The general environmental principles are&#151;
<br>
(a) the health and safety of people and the environment must be protected from the harmful effects of radiation;
<br>
(b) the costs of pollution must be borne by the person or body responsible for causing the pollution; and
<br>
(c) that international best practice in radiation protection should be implemented.
<br>
(3) The NDA shall also ensure&#151;
<br>
(a) the creation of nuclear waste should be avoided or minimised;
<br>
(b) nuclear waste is concentrated and contained rather than diluted and dispersed throughout the environment;
<br>
(c) the most hazardous wastes are prioritised for conditioning to put them into a passively safe state; and
<br>
(d) there is no unnecessary transport of waste."

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-14_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 1 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 25 and 27. The amendment would lay down the general environmental conditions in which the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority should operate. It follows the recommendation made by the House of Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry that there ought to be an over-arching clause to start with.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para8"></a>If ever there were an activity that impinged on the environment, it is the activity proposed for the NDA. It is right that the Bill should begin with the environmental obligations. In their answer to the House of Commons Select Committee, which they have kindly sent to us, the Government indicated that some of the points were mentioned in Clause 9. We agree: they are mentioned in Clause 9, if not as fully as in the new clause. However, we consider that Clause 9 is not the appropriate place, and we have, therefore, suggested an amendment to Clause 9 that would bring the environmental obligations together in the new clause. We regard that as something of great importance, and we would be glad to hear the views of the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I did not speak at Second Reading, as there seemed to be a great many speakers who knew a lot more about the subject than I. However, I would like to say that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is right to put the question before the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para9"></a>Reassuring the public about the safety and environmental aspects of nuclear generation, in particular, needs a higher profile in this country from now on. Awareness of progress on decommissioning and waste disposal and the responsibilities of new agencies in respect of effectiveness and mode of working will help the public to come to terms with the longer-term future, which, as became clear at Second Reading, must include a major expansion of nuclear power. We will come to that matter with other amendments.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para10"></a>The amendment is about rebuilding confidence now. Subsection (2) of the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 1 is perhaps reiterating existing law, which makes that part of the amendment unnecessary. Existing environmental law and international agreements would have to be followed. It seems to me that subsections (1) and (3) of the proposed new clause should perhaps appear in the Bill. I do not know what the Government will say about that, but I would say to the noble Lord, with great respect, that that part of the amendment perhaps is not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I support my noble friend. In a matter of such importance as setting up a new body such as the NDA, it strengthens the Bill to have an objective clause at the beginning&#151;before even the constitution of the body is discussed&#151;so that it is clear to everyone exactly what the objective is. The phrases in the amendment tabled by my noble friend <P>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and me about the "polluter pays" principle and to the effect that international best practice should be followed strike me as particularly important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Just for clarification, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, a question. Subsection (2)(b) of the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 1 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) the costs of pollution must be borne by the person or body responsible for causing the pollution".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-14_para11"></a>
That is just the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has just spoken about. More than anything else, the NDA is to deal with all the legacy waste, and that is what we are talking about. There are still problems with Ministry of Defence nuclear waste; does the MoD have to pay for it? Will people be able to put their finger on who actually caused the waste? I believe that we are talking about legacies going back some 40 years. Is that right? We might not be able to indicate who they are.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I support the amendment. It is very important that the NDA starts with the blessing of everyone connected with the energy industry and, in particular, the general public. For those reasons, it is essential that any doubts or reservations are satisfactorily answered.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para12"></a>Decommissioning is not a new venture. We should not be afraid to defend the record of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and others. We should learn from the experience gained from its activities. It has been successful. Windscale, Harwell, Winfrith and Dounreay have all carried out decommissioning contracts. Those activities have not been without their problems, but it is to be hoped that the industry has learnt from them.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para13"></a>I make no apology for referring to these matters at this stage because they tie up with the proposed amendment. There must be a plan. Something from which the industry has suffered in the past has been an unnecessarily secretive attitude. Anything that we can do in the legislation being put through Parliament to make the industry more aware of that and to make it act in a more open fashion is obviously an advantage.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para14"></a>Public perception of the nuclear industry is that it produces vast quantities of highly radioactive waste material, which is dangerous and a threat to the environment. The reality is that the industry provides a very small quantity of highly radioactive waste and larger, but still modest, quantities of intermediate and low-level waste. Compared with other industries producing toxic waste, the nuclear industry is not exceptional in technical requirements for managing it. However, it is of paramount importance that the industry&#151;particularly the new NDA&#151;is seen to be open and honest in all that it does.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para15"></a>We must learn from the past. Twenty-five years ago, the nuclear industry enjoyed widespread support throughout the country. But, on a number of occasions, it was found to be less than frank and forthcoming with its own supporters, let alone the general public. It paid dearly for that. Nevertheless that confidence can be regained, but the industry must <P>


<a name="column_GC138"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>earn that confidence. I suggest that we should in this legislation spell out everything as clearly as possible. For that reason, I support the new clause.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para16"></a>Clause 1 made a start, but in that clause there are a number of references to Scotland, to which we shall have to return later. But I give advance warning to the Minister that we shall want answers to the relationship between, for example, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the First Minister and Scottish Ministers. Who will be the captain of the team? Where does the buck stop?
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para17"></a>Reading through the Bill, I find that the relationship between those various Ministers is not clearly defined. It is no use saying that this will be a joint effort or that will be a joint effort. At the end of the day, someone is responsible and someone has got to take responsibility. We shall want it spelt out more clearly who that person is.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para18"></a>Finally, concern has been expressed by some companies who see the possibility of the NDA becoming a competitor with them. Powergen, for example, is a little concerned to ensure that the Government's support for the restructuring of British Energy does not damage BE's competitors. If the NDA is to become a public sector operator of a nuclear power plant, for example, that must be very carefully considered.
<P>

<a name="40115-14_para19"></a>I raise those points in general because the new clause is in general terms. I wish to register my support for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  We are at the beginning of the Bill and, as the noble Lord, Lord Gray of Contin, said, we need clarity. The amendment raises a number of issues as to what should or should not be in the legislation. In effect, while we all recognise the environmental requirements of the NDA, the new clause more or less amounts to a mission statement laying down the objectives of the NDA and covers the "polluter pays" principle.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para0"></a>It is not appropriate to cover a mission statement in legislation. It will properly be for the NDA itself, once established, to determine how it will frame its objectives in line with legislation. It is also normal practice for public bodies. We are discussing one part of a range of public documents that the NDA will issue on how it intends to discharge its responsibilities. They will include, for example, the NDA strategy, the annual plan, the memoranda of understanding with the regulators and its management statement. Together, they will govern the NDA's relationship with others&#151;for example, with the regulators, with stakeholders and with government, whether at Westminster or Edinburgh.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para1"></a>A clause of this kind would be unusual. I can assure the Committee that issues of safety, security and environmental protection will be central to the NDA's activities. That is encapsulated in Clause 9(1), as the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, indicated.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para2"></a>Equally if not more importantly, everything that is done by the NDA must comply with all regulatory and other statutory requirements which are unaffected by <P>


<a name="column_GC139"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Bill. In particular, the environment agencies and the Health and Safety Executive have regulatory responsibilities and there could be some confusion if we imposed them in this rather general way on the NDA. In other words, we could be guilty of a lack of clarity if we imposed such responsibilities here rather than gaining in clarity and transparency as the noble Lord, Lord Gray, suggests we should. It is a more practical and effective way of ensuring appropriate action than a statement in the Bill of the general principles suggested in the amendment in relation to safety and environmental outcomes.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para3"></a>On the "polluter pays" principle in the suggested new subsection (2)(b) and the adoption of international best practice in subsection (2)(c), we have the same reservations. On the first, of course, the Government are committed to the "polluter pays" principle. However, in this sector we must recognise that, as a matter of public safety, the Government have often in the past stepped in&#151;and we may need to do so in future&#151;in extremis to ensure nuclear clean-up and, where necessary, meet the associated costs. That is already in practice the case with British Nuclear Fuels, for whose sites the NDA will take financial responsibility, and it could be required in other cases&#151;for example, British Energy&#151;in future. At least in initial circumstances, the NDA or the Government might, therefore, have to meet those costs rather than the prime polluter.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para4"></a>That said, Clause 5(3) and Clause 10(3) provide that the NDA can require private sector operators to meet the costs where it is involved in arranging the discharge of its responsibilities. Wherever possible, the Government and the NDA will seek to ensure that the private sector operator meets the cost of the clean-up, but that will not be appropriate in all circumstances. Indeed, there is an additional complication with MoD sites, as referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para5"></a>Proposed new subsection (2)(c) in the amendment on international best practice adds nothing to the way in which the Bill already envisages that the NDA will operate. It is already under a duty to ensure that persons with control of designated installations, facilities and sites adopt good practice. The NDA will not be able to discharge its functions, including research and providing advice to the Secretary of State, without itself being at the cutting edge of nuclear clean-up. As the public body with responsibility for clean-up, it will need to meet all the international obligations. Government policy is that the UK, in that area as in others, should be at the forefront of international best practice.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para6"></a>Proposed subsection (3) of Amendment No. 1, on the handling of radioactive waste, would constrain by statute what the NDA could do in dealing with radioactive material. The NDA is being set up to provide strategic direction, and to be the expert body on nuclear clean-up. We would expect it to be a major contributor to the development of government policy on such matters. Subsection (3) seems to constrain the NDA at the outset, which would be undesirable, not least in view of the very long-term nature of the NDA's task.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para7"></a>I am therefore not in favour of accepting the very general clause in the amendment. As I said, it restates the obvious in some ways and could lead to a lack of clarity on the duties of the NDA and the regulators under whose monitoring it will operate. I therefore hope that members of the Committee will not pursue it.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I have listened very carefully to what the Minister said, and have studied the report of the Select Committee in another place. I reiterate the thanks of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for our having been able to see the Government's response before it has been published in another place. That is rather exceptional, and I thank the official who organised that.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para8"></a>Having thought about the matter very carefully, I am inclined to come down in favour of the Minister's argument. There are elements in the proposed new clause that would constrain the NDA in what will be a very long-term exercise. It would be perfectly proper for the provisions to go into a mission statement, as the Minister said, which could be changed to meet changing circumstances. However, having studied the amendment and heard the arguments both in its favour and against it, I cannot support it.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para9"></a>What particularly worried me was the use of "avoided" in subsection (3) of the amendment. The NDA will be operating nuclear power stations for a good long while. Inevitably, they will produce more waste, albeit in small quantities. It seems very contradictory to start with the proposition that the NDA is to be constrained so far as possible to avoid any waste, while later in the Bill it is given the power to continue to operate Magnox stations in particular and no doubt other facilities. I have enormous respect for the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, who has huge experience in this field, but I cannot help feeling that the amendment is an attempt to give a wholly predominant place to environmental issues&#151;important though they are&#151;in the decommissioning process, which must be thoroughly cost-effective. With apologies to my noble friends, who indicated that they may be tempted to support such an amendment, I cannot support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I apologise to the Committee that I was a few minutes late in arriving. Further to the comments of my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, I, too, have reservations about the wording of the amendment. That does not mean that I do not follow its aim&#151;together we have debated many Bills on which we have tried to get greater clarification.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para10"></a>Will the Minister respond to recommendation two of the Trade and Industry Select Committee's report, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that a clear and unambiguous statement of the overarching principles within which the NDA will work would be a useful addition to the draft Bill. Such a statement would have most force if it were given in the main body of the Bill."?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-15_para11"></a>
Does he have anything further to say on that?
<P>


<a name="column_GC141"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, speaks again, and the Minister replies, it might be appropriate to say that, although I have listened very carefully to what my noble friends have said, the Front Bench supports what the Minister said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Select Committee in another place argued strongly for a mission statement. Both the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and I have seen the inappropriateness of a mission statement as such in the Bill. The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, comes too close to a mission statement for us to be able to accept it. I am not saying that we would not accept anything in that regard, but, by and large, the Bill already indicates clearly what the NDA should do. The amendment tends to go into wide generalities and to confuse the role of the NDA with that of the regulator.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I thank all members of the Committee who have participated in what is obviously a preliminary discussion before we get into the nitty-gritty of the Bill. Some have supported the amendment and others, including the Minister, have expressed reservations.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para12"></a>I will deal particularly with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, on the "polluter pays" principle. That principle is enshrined, and we are committed to it. Obviously, from time to time, there must be exceptions, but most previous nuclear waste problems have arisen from operations in public ownership, where the polluter is the public body. The case of British Energy is the one big exception, and there has been legislation to deal with it. The principle must apply but, like all major principles, circumstances sometimes mean that we must depart from it.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para13"></a>On the general argument about whether we should have such a clause at the start of the Bill, I still feel that we should. If the NDA is going to issue a mission statement, so be it&#151;it would be excellent, and all companies should do that. In view of the environmentally sensitive nature of its operations, we should have a say right at the start to remind the NDA of its environmental obligations.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para14"></a>A number of important points were made on the detail of the amendment. I would be happy to think again about it and consider whether, in some amended form, it can be brought forward once more at a later stage. However, I feel that any points that are made regarding the environment should be at the start of the Bill and not tucked away in Clause 9, as is done at the moment.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para15"></a>Having said all that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40115-15_para16"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="column_GC142"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I added my name at the last moment to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which are taken together, and I will start by offering the apologies of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, who had hoped to be here to speak to the amendments himself. Sadly, he is not well, and he asked me to move these in his place.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para2"></a>They can be dealt with quite briefly. The subsections in Clause 2 which refer to the setting up and the constitution of the NDA are, for the most part, perfectly reasonable and straightforward, until we come to the question of the relationship between the executive directors and the non-executive directors. I shall have occasion during the debates on the Bill to refer back to the House of Lords Select Committee, five years ago, on which I had the honour to serve, and from which an astonishing amount has been carried forward, even though it seems to have taken an incorrigibly long time.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para3"></a>One of the things that we recognised then, in recommending that there should be a commission to take this forward, was that the commission should have among its directors a wide range of skills and experience to serve. Although we did not attempt to make any suggestions as between executive and non-executive directors, it was implicit in our recommendations that the majority of the directors of the commission&#151;which had a different name from this but was the same sort of animal&#151;would have been non-executive directors. That was on the grounds that that is what such an operation calls for.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para4"></a>I entirely agree that it would be inappropriate that we should try to constrain the NDA according to "Higgs principles". That would not be right. At the same time, I also agree that there should be a majority of non-executive directors. However, the Bill goes further and attempts first of all to impose surprising limits on the constitution of the board.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para5"></a>The point of Amendment No. 2 is that the Bill gives the Government a wholly unnecessary power to make various changes. If ever there was a question of wanting to set up something that would have statutory authority from the beginning, it should be in the Bill. Subsection (7) says that the Secretary of State may make a direction to the NDA, and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the number of the executive members in addition to the chief executive&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) is not less than the minimum set by the direction; and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) does not exclude the maximum so set;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para8"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>and the direction must not set a maximum of more than three".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para9"></a>
That is astonishingly convoluted. In place of that, the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith would simply remove everything after "Where" and insert:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there are executive members in addition to the chief executive, the total number of executive members shall not be greater than three".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para10"></a>
What could be clearer than that? That fulfils exactly the intention of the provision. In the interests of simplicity, I strongly recommend that the words in the amendment should replace subsection (7).
<P>


<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para11"></a>The Committee may have a little difficulty finding Schedule 1; it is on page 130. It provides for quorums and states what will constitute a majority. It will require there to be a majority of the non-executive directors, which I support, but, again, it is a convoluted provision. The whole thing could be much simpler if, after "unless", we inserted the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is taken by a simple majority of the membership".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-16_para12"></a>
Other requirements could then make it clear that it must be a majority of the non-executive members as well.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para13"></a>Let me say at once that I support that provision. Having chaired a company and sat on a board with a large number of executive directors. I am well aware of the danger of the executives, who, after all, spend their entire career and whole life doing such work, having an influence that it is difficult for non-executive directors to override. So I do not quarrel with the intention; I merely suggest that it could be more simply expressed and that the wording of Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 would achieve that.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para14"></a>I hope that my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, who has experience in these matters, would have made much the same speech. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   The words in the schedule are somewhat complicated, and I thank my noble friend for trying to make it simple, using the words tabled by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith who, regrettably, is in hospital today and cannot be with us.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para15"></a>Obviously, we do not vote in Grand Committee&#151;we know the rules&#151;and it is always difficult at the beginning of the Bill for a Minister to accept what we say, but it would be so easy for him to accept the amendment, which is simple and only makes this convoluted provision somewhat easier to understand. I hope that he will. I recall from the days when I was involved in marketing that I was taught this silly phrase, which we used to have to write on the board: KISS, which stands for "Keep it simple, stupid". The amendment is one of the easiest ways for us to improve the Bill in a simple way that in no way affects its meaning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for the reasons stated by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. This paragraph is a convoluted way of saying, "Whatever path you take, you end up with three". We ought to stipulate three from the outset and be done with it. There is enough that is complicated in the Bill without complicating the simple issue of whether there are one, two or three executive members.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   It is interesting that it is proposed that, before appointing the chairman and non-executive members, the Secretary of State&#151;presumably, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#151;must consult Scottish Ministers. He must also do so before proposing the appointment of the <P>


<a name="column_GC144"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>chief executive. But there is no requirement, so far as I can see, for anyone to consult Scottish Ministers on the appointment of executive members. Why is that?
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para16"></a>That matters because the Government have clearly recognised the crucial importance for Scotland of the body and of its ability to work closely with Scottish local authorities and the Scottish Parliament, remembering that planning and environment are devolved matters. The Government have taken account of that; they have taken much account of Scottish matters in the Bill. I commend them for that. The working between the two Parliaments is evolving well. The Bill refers to Scottish Ministers&#151;which probably means the Minister responsible for the environment, although it may be the First Minister. The Scottish Executive must be happy that there is a balance which includes people who understand the circumstances of Scotland. That will give the people of Scotland confidence that the body, when operating in a non-devolved matter, understands the Scottish situation. It would be interesting if the Minister could give a reason for that. There may be a very good one. I do not know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I support the amendments, particularly the first one. As has been pointed out, the clause uses crazy language and is very convoluted. The second amendment is particularly important.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para17"></a>I have studied the text on page 130. It could give rise to a situation where several of the non-executive members of the NDA were abroad, ill, involved in traffic jams and so on and were not at a meeting. That would mean that the majority at the meeting could well turn out to be executive members. That would support the point made by my noble friend Lord Jenkin that the executive members would have to be calmed down a bit, although that is probably not the right word.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para18"></a>The problem is that sometimes there are strains between the non-executive directors and executive directors, and if there is a majority of non-executive directors, it should obviously be the non-executive directors who sway the decision. If it happened that for some reason two or three were missing, it could well be the other way round. So I commend Amendment No. 3.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful for the way in which the amendments have been moved. I express our wishes that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will soon be back with us to help in our deliberations on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para19"></a>In producing what has been referred to as a convoluted section of the clause, the Government are concerned that the NDA should be constituted in a way that is fit for purpose throughout its life, which is expected to be many decades. So there is a case for flexibility, given the perspective that it could last for a long time.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para20"></a>On the issue of membership, the Committee will recognise that the key principle we wish to establish&#151;which is set out in Clause 2(8)&#151;is that the non-executives will at all times be in the majority. That will enable the non-executive members effectively to challenge the executive management team and ensure that the NDA becomes a champion of openness and transparency.
<P>


<a name="column_GC145"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para21"></a>Within that framework, we consider that flexibility on the number of executive members is sensible. While we may all agree that three executive members ought to be the norm, in the early years the NDA will face a substantial challenge in establishing itself, and the systems and processes need to be in place for it to carry out its functions effectively. Our view is that, in those circumstances, there could be a case for four executive members to deal with the full range of responsibilities of the NDA at board level in the early period.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para22"></a>Over the longer term, the need for a large executive presence on the board may indeed be expected to decline. But while we want to leave individual appointments of executive members to the non-executives as a matter of the good use of public funds, it is entirely proper that the Secretary of State should retain an ability to determine the overall size of the board within the limits set out in subsection (1).
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para23"></a>I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, with regard to consultation that the non-executives will make these decisions on the board, not the Secretary of State. We have got proper consultation with Scottish Ministers when the Secretary of State is setting up the board, but the executive will be chosen by the non-executive members. It would not therefore be appropriate to write into the Bill a necessity for consultation with Scottish Ministers because the UK Minister will not at that point be directly involved in the choice of executive members.
<P>

<a name="40115-16_para24"></a>As to the question of the NDA's procedures, we have limited the statutory requirements to the minimum with the focus on ensuring that non-executives are able to control the strategic direction of the NDA, which I believe is the burden of the remarks of all noble Lords who spoke on the point. Provisions with regard to the NDA's rules of procedure are to be found in Schedule 1, a matter to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, referred.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   That was a sibilant slip, I am afraid, after all the years we have known each other.

<P>

<a name="40115-17_para0"></a>Subject to the requirement that such decisions must be taken when a majority of those present are non-executives, we wish the NDA to have the freedom to regulate its own proceedings. The principle is in place and the board must be expected to regulate its own proceedings. For example, there may be decisions on which the NDA decides that more than a simple majority would be appropriate because of the nature of the decision and the desire to demonstrate the extent to which there is support for such a decision on the board.

<a name="40115-17_para1"></a>As we all recognise, the NDA will last for very many years. We do not wish to impose unnecessary statutory constraints at the outset which might subsequently limit its ability to adapt to circumstances in the future. I recognise that noble Lords opposite have sought to clarify what is perhaps a little more convoluted in the measure than their amendments would indicate, but they will recognise that the terms of the Bill offer a degree of flexibility that we think appropriate for a body that is to last for a long time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Can the noble Lord clarify a point he made a little earlier? He pressed the case for flexibility and said that there may be occasions when it might be desirable to have up to four executive directors. However, my reading of Clause 2(7) is that the Secretary of State will be required to issue a direction with a maximum set at no more than three executives. How does "four" come into it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Clause 2(7) refers to the non-executive directors, but not to the chief executive, who would be the fourth member.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I thought that we were talking about the executive directors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We are talking about the group representing the management and executive of the NDA, which could comprise four members in total.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. Who could be more appropriate than a Deputy Chief Whip to talk about the management of a body such as this? He is good at managing all kinds of groups.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para2"></a>It would help if the Minister could give me some idea of how many directors will be appointed in the first instance. I recognise that he has made a case for flexibility, and there may be something in that, but Ministers must have some idea of the size of the initial board. I shall carrying on speaking while they consult on this. I do not want to revert to my earlier arguments because they will not be able to spend any money until the Bill has received its Second Reading in another place. However, I am sure that a great deal of thought is being put into identifying people. I certainly hope that that is the case because, if this body is to be up and running by April of next year, they will have to move fast.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para3"></a>Before we leave this matter, it would be helpful if we could be given an idea of the number of people Ministers are considering for appointment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We estimate that the total size of the body in the first instance will be between nine and 11 people. That will guarantee that the non-executives are in the majority. However, it will be some months before we shall consider moving towards a full complement. Further, it should be recognised that, over the many decades during which the body will establish its procedures and win the confidence of the wider public and all others concerned with its operations, while it might remain the same size, it may be that the number of executives reduces to the <P>


<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>minimum. However, the reason why we have asked for flexibility here is that it may be necessary, during the early stages, to have a slightly greater representation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I find that figure surprisingly low. The management will need a range of experience and expertise to play their part. It would not in the least distress me if it turned out that the number was three or four more than that. I know that it is fashionable to cut Cabinets and shadow Cabinets down to size, but we are dealing here with an operational body that will take some extremely important decisions. The whole thrust of the Bill is that the NDA itself will be in charge of its proceedings, subject to directives issued, from time to time, by the Minister. It would seem desirable that there should be enough people on it to ensure a broad range of experience.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para4"></a>If the Ministers present are thinking of the numbers that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, suggested, I would have to agree that there must be some flexibility. If they find, as I suspect that they might, that, as the work of the authority proceeds, they would like to have more, they should have the power to do that. That is an argument of some force.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para5"></a>I am less convinced on the question of a majority. We cannot vote on it now, but I dislike the idea of a board deciding, off its own bat, that, for a particular kind of decision, it will rig the ballot, as it were, and say that a majority will not be enough. It would be an odd thing for a company to do, and I am not sure that it would not lay itself open to proceedings in a court if it did, unless there were a clear power in the articles of association to do so. I would have thought that a majority&#151;including, of course, a majority of the non-executive directors, which is what the schedule provides for&#151;would be sufficient. However, I shall consider carefully what the Minister said and decide whether we should come back to the matter. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40115-17_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40115-17_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 4 and the two grouped with it would bring more clarity to the expression "cleaning-up", which we find in subsection (1)(c). It is defined in Clause 34, which deals with the general interpretation of Chapter 1 of Part 1. Clause 34 says:

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para15"></a>That definition of cleaning-up is not satisfactory. Cleaning up the site means removing the contaminant or radioactive material. It does not necessarily mean, at that stage, the treatment, storage, transportation or disposal of the hazardous material. Cleaning up a site without reference to that might simply mean removing the litter that blows around.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para16"></a>Given the importance of what we are talking about in terms of clean-up of the site, simply to refer to everything that happens after the waste is removed as constituting clean-up is unsatisfactory. I suggest, subject to an explanation from the Minister of his understanding of clean-up, that we would want a much firmer definition. I have not suggested one now, because I am interested to hear his definition. However, it should cover the removal from the site of the hazardous waste. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am minded to support the noble Baroness in the amendment. However, I wonder whether she has quite recognised the extent of its effect. One issue that has exercised many minds in the area&#151;again I come back to our Select Committee five years ago&#151;was that of fissile material that was no longer required and should be declared as waste. There has been a lot of literature about that. I shall start with the Select Committee report, my quotation starting from paragraph 7.47 and coming under the conclusions on reprocessing, plutonium and Mox&#151;mixed oxide&#151;fuels. We said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our concern is with the waste management implications of reprocessing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-17_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40115-17_para18"></a>Our next paragraph stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The one current use for separated civil plutonium is in the fabrication of MOX fuel. In the much longer term it may be possible to use plutonium in fast breeder reactors. In the United Kingdom our stocks of separated plutonium far exceed the amounts we could use as MOX in our own reactors or that we might wish to keep as a strategic resource for a future fast reactor programme. We have no reactors which can use MOX at present".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-17_para19"></a>
I am not sure whether that is still true, but it was then. We continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The amount required as the initial charge in the core of a 1 GW(e) fast reactor is about 4 tonnes; our stocks of civil plutonium could reach over 100 tonnes by 2010".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-17_para20"></a>
The figure of 100 tonnes has been very widely cited.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para21"></a>The recommendation that we made on that was that the authorities should determine the strategic need for plutonium, and that the balance should then be regarded as waste. When I read the amendment and looked at its implications, it seemed that we should certainly include the handling of redundant plutonium.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para22"></a>The most recent report that we have had on the matter came from RWMAC, the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, which reported last March. At paragraph 4.12, it made its most important recommendation, which was at the heart of its press release at the time. It read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One important aspect of radioactive waste management, on which RWMAC has already commented, is that policy should be robust to changes in radioactive materials declared as wastes. There are suggestions in Managing Radioactive Waste Safely"&#151;

One does not need to be an expert in nuclear science to recognise that, if we are to have some tens of tonnes of plutonium declared as waste, the significance of that in dealing with high-level waste is considerable.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para28"></a>The noble Baroness, perhaps inadvertently, seems to have touched on a very important issue. I would not regard it as in the least improper that the NDA should have the responsibility. We will come later to the question of its responsibility for the long-term disposing of waste, but it is right that it should regard what one might call redundant fuel as part of the problem to which it ought to address itself.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para29"></a>I cannot forbear from ending with a short story. There is widespread apprehension&#151;it has been frequently cited by the green movement&#151;that plutonium is the most toxic substance known to man. I was due to speak in a debate at the Cambridge Union&#151;it was long after I ceased to be a student; I was asked to go back as a visiting speaker&#151;to discuss the nuclear industry. I got myself briefed by the UKAEA, and I said, "There is sure to be the question of plutonium". The representative of the UKAEA said, "You are probably right", and handed me a small package, which I opened. There was a small plastic cylinder in it. He told me what it was and said that I should take it with me, and that it would be a good defence.
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para30"></a>Sure enough, some young man got up and said that plutonium was the most dangerous substance known to man. I simply turned to him, said, "Catch", and threw the cylinder across to him. He caught it and I said, "That is a heart pacemaker powered by plutonium oxide. May I have it back please?".
<P>

<a name="40115-17_para31"></a>The substances are well known, and scientists who handle them well understand them, but I wish that the Government could tell us whether they are to be within the remit of the NDA. I hope that they are; it seems to me that it would have to deal with them. I am not sure whether the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, quite realised what she was getting us into.

<FONT SIZE=3>a lump of plutonium across the Room might not either; I trust that we shall not see any of that behaviour in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para0"></a>There is a distinction between the amendment and what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is pointing out. On both counts, the Bill as it stands gives the NDA the responsibility for being able to implement clean-up. Far from making that more effective, the amendments would make it more restricted.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para1"></a>As the definition in Clause 34(1) makes clear, the NDA is required to ensure that all hazardous material and other matter and substances that need to be dealt with or removed to make the site or installation suitable to be used for other purposes is cleaned up. In other words, the NDA is not restricted to nuclear or radioactive waste. Clearly there is a long-running saga about the definition of spent plutonium. Were it to be the policy of the NDA to deal with spent fuel as well as waste, that would fall under the designation as well. Those issues of definition fall into the radioactive waste review, which is currently being considered by Defra. But the first of the two amendments to the clause would restrict clean-up to radioactive material and waste; it would exclude, for example, hazardous chemical material, which the NDA is responsible for removing. In this part of the Bill "clean-up" means clean-up, not simply clean-up of radioactive waste. It would be restrictive to adopt Amendment No. 19 and, in most respects, Amendment No. 20. That is the opposite of what the noble Baroness seeks, but it would be the effect of these amendments.

He is quite right; I had not thought about the issue of spent plutonium when tabling the amendment, although I am aware that it is a thorny issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   If I may interrupt the noble Baroness, it is not spent. It could be used, but there is more of it than we would ever need.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I bow to the noble Lord's much greater expertise in this subject. But it is effectively spent at the moment&#151;that is my understanding of the definition. An amendment has not been tabled to explore this issue, so I am glad that it could be discussed in debating my amendment.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para2"></a>I thank the Minister for his explanation, but I am still not entirely happy that the definition of "cleaning-up" in Clause 34 is entirely satisfactory. It hinges on whether the site is made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"suitable to be used for other purposes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-18_para3"></a>
One could do half a job and leave the site suitable for a few purposes, such as storing waste indefinitely, or one might seek to make it suitable to be used for any other purposes, in which case it would have to be entirely decontaminated. The definition is very loose. I look forward to discussing the issue with other noble Lords and seeking their opinions. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40115-18_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 6, which relates to Clause 3(1), I shall speak also to Amendment No. 28, which relates to Clause 9(2). Both amendments deal with the same subject&#151;safety and environmental performance. Those two factors must be the NDA's top and overriding priority.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para8"></a>Strangely, however, the Bill does not require the NDA to have due regard to the importance of a strong safety culture among companies competing for contracts or individuals seeking senior managerial positions&#151;a safety culture no less strong than that which currently exists at BNFL.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para9"></a>There is already a highly developed safety culture in the nuclear industry. Over the past 20 to 30 years, discharges from BNFL's Sellafield plant have been reduced to about one-thousandth of their 1970s peak. As my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding pointed out in his speech at Second Reading, BNFL has never really been credited for that achievement in the media and elsewhere. We must eliminate concerns, real or imagined, that the introduction of competition to the United Kingdom decommissioning and clean-up market will compromise the current excellent safety culture that is already there.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para10"></a>Sometimes the Government respond to the amendments that I table&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has never done so because I have never been on the opposite side of the Dispatch Box from him&#151;with the argument that they are "too prescriptive". On the topic of nuclear safety and environmental factors affecting the nuclear industry, it is impossible to be too prescriptive.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para11"></a>The amendments underline the importance that should be given to the safety, health and environmental record of contractor companies and individuals who will be potential senior managers competing for work under and on behalf of the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para12"></a>I shall now speak to Amendment No. 28. The NDA will not carry out decommissioning work itself. It will farm out the work to what are called and management and operation contractors. Clause 9(2)(b) requires the NDA to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"promote effective competition for contracts to provide it with the services it must secure in order to discharge its responsibilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-18_para13"></a>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-18_para14"></a>
Those two directives are not necessarily compatible with safety, health or environmental considerations. The temptation could be to go for the cheapest offer. It might be argued by the NDA, especially a cash-strapped NDA, that, on the face of it, that would answer the criterion relating to competition, on the one hand, and that relating to value for money, on the other.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para15"></a>My late grandmother, who always had extraordinarily clever sayings, used to say that to buy cheap was to buy dear. Cheapness is not a criterion that we want to see applied to nuclear decommissioning. We want skill, expertise and a proven track record, especially as it is conceivable that bids for contracts may come from overseas from companies of which we know little. Even in the case of home-grown companies, if I may describe them that way, we need only look at the abysmal safety record of the railways, where contracts have been placed in the hands of companies that have proved not to be up to the mark. Defective rail maintenance can cost several lives; that is bad enough. Poorly done nuclear clean-up can cost lives for generations, cause terrible illnesses and pollute tracts of the country for generations to come.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para16"></a>I am not standing here to promote the interests of BNFL, but it is right, in this case, to point out the world-beating reputation of that company. I would be failing if I did not say that. We are talking about companies that can compete, and we want to make sure that they have the same standards.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para17"></a>BNFL is to be subjected to outside competition, and it tells me that it welcomes that. I guess that it would say that, anyway. It is important that the competition is required to provide no less a standard than we have at present. That applies not only to the companies competing for the work but also to the individuals who carry out the management of the work at senior levels. Skill, expertise and experience are the essential ingredients of effective competition, as is value for money, which the amendment requires to be fully taken into account, when the NDA grants contracts. It is for that reason that the amendment is essential. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I shall not add much to what my noble friend said. She made the case strongly. I find it surprising that nowhere in the Bill is there a stated recognition that, in the process of what is rather inelegantly called "contractualisation", the qualities of the contracting companies with regard to safety and environmental protection should be regarded as an immensely important criterion for selection.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para18"></a>As my noble friend said, there is clear evidence in the industry that mishandling can have condign effects. Mercifully, there have been astonishingly few such results because of the safety culture that the industry not only in this country but elsewhere, with the possible exception of Chernobyl, has always demonstrated. I remember the row that followed the Three Mile Island incident in America. Senator Teddy Kennedy campaigned against the industry and there was a rash of bumper stickers in New York that pointed out that more lives were lost at Chappaquiddick than at Three Mile Island, which happens to be true.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para19"></a>One consequence follows from this debate on which the Minister may be able to comment. We now have two major organisations that have extensive experience in the field of decommissioning: not only BNFL, which has been mentioned, but the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which was mentioned at Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart.

<FONT SIZE=3>duty if I did not draw to Ministers' attention the fact that both companies feel that, whereas neither of them is opposed to the concept of competitive tendering for contracts&#151;although they will receive the initial contracts because they are the only people on the spot&#151;they should be regarded as the suppliers of choice until other competitors have shown that they have not only the same skills and ability to deliver competitively on cost but the same culture in their staff, which has meant that the nuclear industry in this country has had such an astoundingly good safety record. That ought to be written into the Bill, which is what the amendments would do.
<P>

<a name="40115-18_para20"></a>I also point out that my story about BNFL's reduction of pollutants from Sellafield and the fact that that was owing to the extreme skills of its operators prompted an outside body to ask whether that should apply to others as well. I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the amendments, he will be able to say that he will give them favourable consideration.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I, too, support the amendments so ably moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon. They enter into the spirit of Amendment No. 1, which I moved earlier, which some members of the Committee supported but some did not. The whole point of the culture of safety, health and environmental expertise in the nuclear industry, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, rightly stressed, cannot be overemphasised. As so much of the work will be undertaken under contract, it is vital that when awarding contracts, the NDA should have regard to those matters. Obviously, it will, but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, that should be written into the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I shall briefly support my noble friend's amendments. I know that in other fields, the countries entering the EU in May are being given time to come up to our standards. Something that concerns us all is that in this field it is crucial that standards are the same wherever in the world a company comes from. We need the formal assurance from the Minister that in this field there will be no levity. I also hope that he will accept my noble friend's amendments, because they are well supported around the Committee and crucial for the Bill. I am anxious, especially for the environment, because there is to be a phase-in period for those countries in some other forms of industry. I should like the Minister to clarify that those easier rules will not apply here.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Further to my noble friend's remarks, have the Government taken into account the impact of European competition and employment law, which will come into play when the new countries enter the European Union? Not long ago, at a nuclear industry conference, I heard a description of what had gone wrong in the old Soviet Union. The Soviet navy was in charge of looking after nuclear waste, somewhere not very far from the sea, <P>


<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and it was leaking into the sea. Of course nobody understood what could happen as a result. There could be tricky incidents if experts from new European Union states&#151;or indeed any country&#151;did not have quite enough experience.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para0"></a>It does not take just the top person in an organisation to make a mistake; mistakes can be made quite low down. During the war I was a laboratory assistant working with nuclear materials, including plutonium. I shall not trouble members of the Committee with stories of what that was like. Not even laboratory assistants were left out of security arrangements; it was extremely important that everybody understood them. It is crucial that the Bill makes certain that account is taken of those matters. Will the Government consider the implications of the new countries joining the European Union and the European law that will apply?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We understand the importance of the points made by several members of the Committee on the crucial issue of the health and safety standards to be employed in such a significant industry. We agree that the NDA must ensure that it has in place the necessary expertise, now and in the future, so that it can decommission successfully, which we recognise is always challenging.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para1"></a>Clause 9(2) recognises that. It places on the NDA a duty to ensure the maintenance and development of a skilled workforce able to undertake clean-up. But that is a means to an end. The NDA's role will be to set the strategic direction for clean-up across the whole United Kingdom; to manage the framework for delivering it; and to ensure that the necessary conditions are in place for it to be carried out successfully. Clause 9(1) specifies the general duties of the NDA when carrying out its functions as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"having particular regard to each of the following&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-19_para2"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) relevant Government policy;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-19_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) the need to safeguard the environment;
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para4"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) the need to protect persons from risks to their health and safety from activities involving the use, treatment, storage, transportation or disposal of hazardous material; and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-19_para5"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) the need to preserve nuclear security".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-19_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40115-19_para7"></a>The NDA is therefore working within a broad framework that takes on board the enormously important safety issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, and other members of the Committee emphasised. It is not just a matter of employing the right sort of people, although that is an important element. To achieve the step-change in nuclear clean-up that we seek, we must not detract from the NDA's focus on delivering on clean-up.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para8"></a>Amendment No. 6 relates to the decommissioning of NDA facilities and suggests that the NDA could in some way manage that more directly. That is simply not the case. Decommissioning facilities will be operated on behalf of the NDA in the same way as nuclear installations. Employees operating and decommissioning NDA facilities will be employed by site operators, with which the NDA will contract, directly or indirectly, to a site management contractor. The facility category to which we refer is designed to <P>


<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>capture installations that are not on a licensed site but that ultimately would need to be decommissioned. There are none of those at present but the Bill is designed to establish the NDA over many decades to come. We cannot be confident that there would be no such installations in future.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para9"></a>I accept entirely the representations about the culture that the NDA must establish. As I emphasised, that is part of the remit under Clause 9(1). It is indeed one of the essential tests for anyone involved in the nuclear clean-up. But it is for the regulators, not the NDA, to decide on a contractor's suitability in that regard. It is a very important decision. I hear what the noble Baroness says about new players coming on stream in due course. She suggested that some might not have a track record that meets our specifications.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para10"></a>Those responsible for certain nuclear power stations in the old Soviet bloc must certainly fall short of the specifications. We had an anecdotal moment earlier; let me give another anecdote. I remember standing on the shores of the Barents Sea in sub-zero temperatures of a magnitude that I never want to experience again. I was already a chilled soul when the person next to me pointed out six passing Soviet submarines&#151;this is many years ago when the Soviet Union posed a Cold War threat&#151;and said, "They are not the problem; they are the safe ones. It is those that are docked permanently in Murmansk that will cause the future problems". We have subsequently realised the truth of that remark.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para11"></a>Let me say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that of course the Government want to continue to see UKEA and BNFL management improve the efficiency of their organisations and their ability to clean up. We are working with them to help them create a viable contractor capability in preparation for any future site management competitions run by the NDA. We expect them to be in a strong position in any bidding. But the rationale for competition is straightforward: as I am sure all members of the Committee will accept, we are looking for the best organisation for the job. We seek the organisation that can deliver the NDA's clean-up objectives and meet its further objectives of promoting, ensuring the maintenance and development of a skilled workforce and securing value for money.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para12"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, we all recognise that shortcuts can be taken if the sole criterion is value for money. That might put health and safety standards at risk. Value for money in this context includes the effective operation of health and safety standards. Contractors will be evaluated by the regulators. This is not contractualisation for the sake of it; it is using competition to drive up performance. Performance is not just about ensuring the least cost. The least cost represents best value, which includes all the concepts to which the noble Baroness drew attention. Best value does not mean competitors diminishing employees' terms and conditions as a means of driving down costs. If BNFL and UKEA can prove their ability to deliver best value, they will be well placed to compete for the management of sites, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said they would almost certainly be.
<P>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para13"></a>The NDA will want as much comfort as possible that any contractor that it is minded to appoint will be acceptable to the regulators. That is addressed in the memorandum of understanding that will be put in place between the NDA and the regulator, and that has been agreed in generic terms as a draft document. But the regulators will not want to be drawn into detailed consideration of the merits of individual bidders, which might compromise their independence in sanctioning the organisational change that would be necessary on the appointment of a new contractor.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para14"></a>In response to the anxieties that members expressed clearly, we subscribe to the idea that one cannot talk about value for money, effective competition and the exercise of accepting contractors, unless one builds into the concept the necessary role of the NDA and the regulators in ensuring that all the considerations to which the noble Baroness drew attention are part of the concept of value for money. I hope that, on that basis, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I hope that the Minister will not take it the wrong way when I thank everyone who supported me. I took comfort in the support given by the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Ezra, who are experts in this field. I hope that the Minister will not be offended, as I do not suggest that he is not an expert, but the two noble Lords who supported me are the stars in this debate. They have gone through all the points very carefully.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para15"></a>The Minister spoke a lot about the general duties in Clause 9(1), but they are the duties of the NDA. My two simple amendments concern the duties of the contractors, which is a separate issue. That is an essential distinction. The Minister said that it was a matter for the regulators. I cannot believe that the regulators are involved in the employment of senior management of the companies given this business to do. If that is so, the whole issue is absolutely ridiculous. I was making the point that if the NDA puts the contract out to tender, requiring all those other conditions, the companies that win the contracts will be dealing with the employment of the senior management who will run the operation. It is not the Minister's fault that he did not understand my point; obviously I was not clear enough.
<P>

<a name="40115-19_para16"></a>I re-emphasise that that is what my amendment is about; it is extraordinarily important. Although I shall do as the Minister said and withdraw Amendment No. 6 at this stage, we do not feel that his answer was adequate given the seriousness of the issue. The Minister has not told the Committee what are his objections to our two simple amendments other than that they are not necessary. He prayed in aid matters that are nothing to do with the amendment but which relate to the NDA. We were talking about the contractors. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) In addition, the NDA may, under the direction of the Secretary of State, take responsibility for planning and developing nuclear facilities."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-20_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 7 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the NDA may, under the direction of the Secretary of State, take responsibility for planning and developing nuclear facilities",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-20_para1"></a>
That may appear to be well outside the purposes of the Bill, but I shall endeavour to explain why the issues are very pertinent. Some people may say that surely the NDA is there because we are now firmly in the era of closing down the industry. I wish to turn that hypothesis on its head.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para2"></a>On the question of the time-scale, in order to send a signal during the first three or four years of the operational effect of this Bill&#151;which is probably before this or any future government would envisage making firm decisions on new build&#151;it would be useful to acknowledge the possible close identity between many of these sites. They will be within the purview of the NDA, given its responsibilities for decommissioning and waste management, and thus are sites that would certainly be considered if there were to be new nuclear build.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para3"></a>From an engineering point of view, I can imagine that, in planning a site to deal with waste, for example, one would need to be clear about whether to allow for the possibility that new nuclear build might be considered on that site. One does not want to regret making a decision because it is not possible to plan for a possible future use. The famous precept, "Keep the nuclear option open", is brought down to earth in this amendment. In time, we may have to use these sites for new nuclear build. We do not want the NDA to encounter any difficulty when planning for that, and we should avoid it becoming a course that we cannot openly acknowledge.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para4"></a>Members of the Committee have pointed out that, for those of us who see an early need to plan for new nuclear capacity, the NDA would already have earned valuable credibility through its decommissioning role, in the running of safe sites and in managing waste. The noble Lords, Lord Ezra, Lord Jenkin, and others touched on that philosophy.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para5"></a>We are separating the issue of building new nuclear facilities from nuclear decommissioning. I would have made that point in relation to Amendment No. 5, but it was not moved. New nuclear build is not to be one of the principal functions of the NDA; it is a bridge too far. People would say that the Government had changed their whole policy on nuclear power. The Government are not ready to do that in this Bill. Since the question does not arise, the Minister is not in a position to answer it. That is why it cannot be a principal function for the NDA. Nor, politically, is the country ready for it.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para6"></a>Making provision for future nuclear build would be more acceptable if the terminology of this amendment was used. We should refer to "nuclear facilities" rather <P>


<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than "nuclear power stations", the term used in Amendment No. 5. That would offer more flexibility as regards the type of installation.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para7"></a>I close by making a central point. It would not be surprising to find that the NDA needs to protect certain sites which might later be required for new build. It would be short-sighted to waste the opportunity provided by accepting what is proposed in my amendment and precluding the possibility of protecting those sites.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para8"></a>I hope that my noble friend will take the opportunity to think aloud&#151;perhaps I may put it that way&#151;about the connection between the present, the immediate future and the future. I am sure that he will not want to suggest any change of present government policy, but it would be useful to hear what can be said at this stage in an open forum. We could then reflect on what has been said before Report. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I welcome the opportunity that this amendment gives to probe, a little, the Government's intention regarding site use during the period when decommissioning is going ahead.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para9"></a>In the case that I know best, Dounreay, it is anticipated that it will be a period of many decades. Although the present clear priority is to return it to a greenfield site, it can be envisaged that during the course of the work that is being done, and done with considerable distinction, attributes of the site will become positively attractive to others who wish to learn from the experience, in which Great Britain is giving a lead. That would be a circumstance which would give rise to questions as to whether it would be open, under the clause as drafted, to the decommissioning agency to entertain contracts on the site for the benefit of decommissioning work being done by other countries. Experimental work, which might flow from cognate developments in other countries, might usefully commercially be entertained in these circumstances. It would not necessarily go as far as building a new nuclear reactor, but would simply exploit the technology that is a by-product of the complex technological developments that are in train.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para10"></a>We should avoid tunnel vision in making the provision for this new agency. Failure to recognise the possibilities of the exploitation of the technology would seem to me to be a great mistake. I hope that this amendment will commend itself in spirit to the Government and that they will use this opportunity of exploring further whether such ancillary work could reasonably be undertaken. It would be in the national interest if it could.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I support the amendment on the basis that it very clearly shows the big void in this Energy Bill, which deals solely with clean up&#151;well, not solely, but one-third of it is clean-up&#151;of nuclear facilities. It does not nod in the direction of any further new build, nor in the direction of the security and safety of our supplies of electricity generation in the years to come. This was dealt with very thoroughly at Second Reading. Equally thoroughly, the Minister <P>


<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dismissed it and said it was no part of the Bill. The way in which the noble Lords, Lord Lea of Crondall and Lord Maclennan, have brought the issue into the Bill is very interesting. Immediately I can see that the Minister will say that one cannot possibly put a national decommissioning authority into a position of commissioning.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para11"></a>But there is a real case&#151;I shall deal with it in my later amendments&#151;for preserving the techniques, knowledge and know-how that exist in this country at this stage, and that will be increased by the operations of the NDA, and then asking what we will do in the future. That is one way of looking at the issue in strategic terms. I do not know whether the NDA is the right agency or whether an arm of the NDA could be given that specific responsibility. On that basis, if we are not going to get exposure of the issue, I certainly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jordan: </B>   I, too, want to speak in favour of the sense of this amendment and to follow the theme discussed by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain. The expertise, experience and facilities that inevitably will reside in the NDA mean that such a body should not by statute be confined, limited or even prohibited from making a contribution if and when the Government's policy on nuclear energy changes.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para12"></a>The Government's present energy policy, as contained in the Bill, relies on their predictions&#151;dare I say, hopes&#151;concerning what renewables will be produced and their ability to import adequate supplies of gas. The security of this country's energy supply cannot rest solely on that well-meant optimism. Government must be in a position to react quickly to unfavourable developments. The oil crisis of the 1970s is within everyone's experience. Such a crisis could loom on the horizon. Should that happen, this amendment proposes to the Government an option, not a requirement. If the Government believe that the intent is worth taking on, perhaps they will find ways of producing more suitable wording that is to their own liking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Jordan, has made a very telling point. I absolutely agree with him. I am sorry that we did not debate Amendment No. 5 because a number of those points could have been made then. Not only does technological understanding and skill need to be preserved, so does public goodwill. The noble Lord who used to represent the area around Dounreay power station said that it did not necessarily mean that there might be a rebuild on that site. He said that with great care. I do not know the public opinion around Dounreay&#151;I am sure that he does&#151;but I get the impression that, in general, there is a lot of goodwill in areas where there have been well-run state nuclear power stations. It is very important that we do not lose that reservoir that now exists.
<P>

<a name="40115-20_para13"></a>If only the Government could take a deep breath and have the courage to put such a provision into the Bill, it would begin to build a bridge between where we are now and where we know we must be&#151;probably <P>


<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not far after the next election. We will not have to wait long for a change in point of view, whoever is elected the next time around. It would be very helpful if people could realise that the process going on through this Bill is preparatory to future development&#151;that might even be on the sites of existing power stations. I am not aware of how the public feel, as I do not live near a power station.

<A NAME="40115-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for allowing me to clarify the point that I made. I was not seeking to say that I ruled out any idea of there being a nuclear power station built on such a site. At this stage, that might not be reasonably foreseeable. What is reasonably foreseeable is that there will be work done at the site that would be of great commercial value to others and ought to be exploitable under the Bill.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. He has given me the confidence to make this point as strongly as I can. I believe that it is the case in other parts of Scotland that a good deal of goodwill exists, as well as a great deal of understanding. We must not lose that by saying that all this is about clean-up and greenfield sites, ending up with a great rural scene of farming and sheep and all the rest of it. Certainly, Scotland needs a great deal more than that. I am hopeful that the Government might&#151;maybe not now&#151;reflect on that and perhaps, after a bit of deep breathing, put something in the Bill like this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, will remember&#151;because it was not very long ago&#151;that at Second Reading, apart from one or two speakers, there emerged a clear cross-party consensus&#151;I exclude the Liberal Democrat party&#151;that we would need to go to a nuclear rebuild at some stage. But it is widely recognised outside that it is impractical to imagine, however fast the development of renewable sources comes, that one will be able to develop those, keep the lights on and fulfil our Kyoto obligations. I do not want to repeat what was said at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para0"></a>However, I should like to endorse the point made by the noble Lords, Lord Lea and Lord Jordan, that there is a difference to be drawn between embarking on such a programme, on the one hand&#151;he was not here to move his amendment, but I think that the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Peyton might have been open to that interpretation&#151;and, on the other hand, of actually making certain that what we are in shorthand calling "the nuclear option" remains viable.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para1"></a>I was looking for the origin of the phrase "the nuclear option", and I turned to the White Paper. Of course, it is not there. There are two paragraphs. I think that it would be as well to put that on the record. It is a clear statement of where the Government stand on the issue. Paragraph 4.67 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As chapter 1 makes clear, our priority is to strengthen the contribution that energy efficiency and renewable energy sources make to meeting our carbon commitment. We believe that such ambitious progress is achievable, but uncertainties remain".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-21_para2"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC161"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That is the point made very eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Jordan. It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While nuclear power is currently an important source of carbon free electricity, the current economics of nuclear power make it an unattractive option for new generating capacity".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-21_para3"></a>
Pausing there, I am not too sure that that is right because it leaves out of account the question of what future designs of nuclear stations are likely to be. The paragraph continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there are also important issues for nuclear waste to be resolved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-21_para4"></a>
That is entirely right. I sense that the Government's strategy may well be, although they have been understandably cautious, to move ahead with nuclear waste in order to put themselves into a position to go back to the public and to say, "We solved that. We now need nuclear power stations".
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para5"></a>The paragraph goes on to state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This white paper does not contain proposals for building new nuclear power stations. However, we do not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-21_para6"></a>
That is what it says, followed by a short paragraph about what the procedure would be to do that. As I said at Second Reading, it seems astonishing that this is the first major energy Bill following the milestone White Paper&#151;it may have been criticised; I criticised it myself&#151;but it marked an effort on the part of the Government to set out their energy policy. But in this Bill, the first major piece of legislation, there is nothing that would lend credibility to that paragraph.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para7"></a>We have tabled a number of amendments on this. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain mentioned our amendments that seek to ensure that there will be an adequate number of trained and skilled people available, along with amendments to ensure that that research will continue. Points have been made about existing nuclear sites where all the evidence suggests a much higher level of local public support for nuclear rebuild because those people are familiar with the concept and they look forward to the resultant job opportunities in a continuing nuclear industry. But all this requires a clear view. Are we making the option credible, or are we simply leaving it? With respect, I say to the Ministers opposite that we have the impression that they are just leaving it.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para8"></a>Indeed, evidence given to the Select Committee in another place was at pains to stress that nothing in the Bill deals with new nuclear build. As I said at Second Reading, I find that quite incredible. If this option itself is to become credible, then it needs work.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para9"></a>If we faced an oil crisis of the kind we suffered in 1973, then of course it is not possible to build a new nuclear power station in that kind of time-scale. It probably takes between 15 and 20 years. But the forward outlook of energy generation and supply in this country&#151;looking 15 to 25 years ahead&#151;reflects an enormous fund of outside expert opinion that we cannot do the three things we want&#151;keep the lights on, meet our Kyoto obligations and satisfy energy needs&#151;without nuclear build.

<P>

<a name="40115-21_para10"></a>We cannot let the Bill leave this House without writing in some provision either on the lines proposed in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, or a more specific proposal on training, graduate staff and continuing research, about which my noble friend Lady O'Cathain will speak later. At present, Ministers appear to take some pride in saying that there is nothing, and that is not good enough.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para11"></a>We shall continue to return to this point. Either that paragraph in the White Paper meant something or it did not. I should say that it has been interpreted in a House of Commons Library paper to refer to renewables. It has simply been rewritten with no mention of the nuclear option. It states only that there are no plans to build any more nuclear power stations. That is how the paragraph is being interpreted.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para12"></a>However, that is not the Government's view. They say that we may have to come to that, but that they are not making any provision. As I have said, that is not good enough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I expected a wide-ranging debate on this. Two levels of discussion have emerged as a result of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lea. One concerns energy strategy as a whole and the viability or otherwise of the energy White Paper, while the second concerns the role of the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para13"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and my noble friends Lord Lea and Lord Jordan, do not entirely agree on the viability of the energy White Paper and the calculations made in it, which depend on delivery on the renewables front and, even more crucially, on energy efficiency measures, and various other aspects of policy outlined in it. However, it is the Government's view that if those measures can be delivered, then the figures will add up without requiring any new nuclear component. That is not to say that we should close any contingency arrangements either because we fail on our other provisions or because of a more cataclysmic event, as suggested by my noble friend Lord Jordan. We would reopen the issue should there be a need for nuclear build. But the strategy and, therefore, the assumptions on which current policy and the legislation are based is that the energy White Paper provisions will form the basis of our energy policy over the coming years.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para14"></a>We are concerned about our electricity supply and therefore we must keep open the possibility that we might need to return to the nuclear option within the terms of the energy White Paper. A decision on nuclear power generation may well need to be made in the future, but that is not the focus of the activities of the NDA. Our White Paper, Managing our Nuclear Legacy, published before the energy White Paper, spells that out. The focus of the NDA&#151;or the LMA, as it was known then&#151;is to concentrate exclusively on decommissioning and clean-up; that is, to deal with the consequences of our nuclear past whether or not we create new nuclear waste at some point down the line by reverting to the nuclear option as part of a future energy policy.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para15"></a>The role of the NDA is to deal with nuclear waste, decommissioning and clean-up. It is not to provide the facility whereby, even if we needed to do so, we could <P>


<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>build new nuclear capacity. In those circumstances that would be the responsibility of other organisations, not the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para16"></a>I agree with the secondary or tertiary point made by my noble friend Lord Lea: some of the sites that the NDA will deal with over rather a long term should not be prevented from providing nuclear facilities at some future time. No doubt that will be one of the considerations resulting from government direction to the NDA which might have to be taken into account. However, the NDA itself will not be a part of the planning, commissioning or delivery activities surrounding future nuclear build.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para17"></a>To an extent I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. The expertise that the NDA will rightly be expected to acquire in order to deal with decommissioning and handling hazardous material needs to be recognised. It may be that certain sites which it is managing for decommissioning purposes might be appropriate for other facilities directed at enhancing a nuclear capability. Indeed, reference is made in Clause 9 to the need to preserve and enhance the skills relating to the areas for which the NDA is to be responsible. That means that some of the NDA sites which will need to continue to be licensed for some considerable time for use as storage or disposal might also be used for other purposes&#151;including for research purposes undertaken by the NDA or other bodies. A decision would need to be made on that on a case-by-case basis, but nothing in this Bill rules that out.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para18"></a>Clause 10(2)(d), (e) and (f) will allow the NDA to use facilities for research and other purposes to generate funds&#151;or to allow others so to use them. For example, the nuclear science and technology service of BNFL could in its present capacity be located on a site managed under the NDA and use that site for future research. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that; indeed, under the requirements of Clauses 9 and 10, the NDA would be obliged to help to facilitate it.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para19"></a>So nothing prevents the NDA from facilitating those activities nor, should the Government revert to the nuclear option, from using those sites for nuclear facility purposes&#151;whether power station or other. But the NDA will not be carrying out those activities, as the noble Lord's amendment suggests and as many others have suggested. Under the amendment, the NDA would be a much broader body than envisaged in the Bill&#151;it would be closer to a nuclear power commission, which was envisaged in some contributions to previous energy policy debates, rather than a facility that specialises in the difficult and substantial area of decommissioning and dealing with the storage of nuclear waste.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para20"></a>That distinction needs to be made, even by those who favour a significant nuclear component in future. It will be needed partly for purely operational and focus purposes and partly for the purpose referred to by the noble Baronesses, Lady Carnegy and Lady O'Cathain, which is to ensure public confidence. One reason why the Government are not disposed to maintain a significant nuclear component <P>


<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over the long term is precisely because we have not worked out how to deal with long-term waste and do not have public confidence in our ability to do so. If the same body was dealing with waste under the Bill as was responsible for creating new waste, public confidence in the objectivity, cost-effectiveness and priorities of the NDA would be undermined.
<P>

<a name="40115-21_para21"></a>So even for those who want a bigger nuclear slice in our energy policy, it is not sensible to give the NDA responsibilities beyond those in the Bill. The noble Lord's amendment would provide that, or at least the ability to provide that.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness has a wider experience of Committees of the House of Lords even than I do, so she will know that when a Long Title has a fairly wide definition, members of the Committee are prone to table all sorts of amendments. If she is giving us forewarning that such an amendment may appear later in our proceedings, I do not have the power to resist it procedurally. I may resist it in argument, but I suspect we may return to this argument later, if I understand her correctly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I am gratified by the range and quality of the contributions made in response to the amendment. Things have been said from all parts of the Room that suggest that we seek to keep within the Bill's scope but to spell out the consequences of the philosophy, which is to keep the option open. Especially with the NDA, we want to do nothing to close off any contingency arrangement&#151;I think that was my noble friend's phrase. Another phrase that he used about which I am not so sure was that nothing prevented the NDA from doing X, Y and Z. That is one reason for the amendment: the vires of the Bill must be pellucidly not preventing that.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para0"></a>What I think my noble friend referred to as the tertiary subsidiary point at the centre of the matter is the locus of the NDA on the sites. It will be the principal responsible agency on the site. It may be that someone else should be doing X, Y or Z, but the NDA will nevertheless have broad responsibility on those sites, will it not?
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para1"></a>I am not making another speech, so I had better conclude. We are not looking for any change of policy in the Bill from that of the White Paper&#151;not because some of us do not seek that; self-evidently we do, but we recognise that that is not the Bill's purpose. I hope that we have given each other food for thought about what can be done before Report. On that hopeful note, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>   moved Amendment No. 8:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 24, at end insert "after consultation with representatives of the industry, the NDA itself and the person in charge of the site where the installations or facility are located"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40115-22_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: This is another amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith. It concerns a comparatively small question: whether there should be consultation with various people in the industry and the NDA before the Minister makes a direction. I cannot believe that that would not happen. That, no doubt, is the answer in the Minister's brief, in which case why not write that into the Bill? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I can give the noble Lord the assurance that on most occasions consultation would take place for all the best reasons. However, we are anxious that the amendment would introduce a mandatory requirement to consult. We can foresee the possibility of the kind of emergency where swift&#151;or immediate&#151;action would be necessary and it would be inappropriate to require the NDA to engage in consultation procedures.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para5"></a>The noble Lord will recognise that subsection (4) already requires the Secretary of State to secure the consent of the person with control unless that person is a public body, as defined in paragraphs (a) to (d) of the subsection. Beyond the legitimate interest of the NDA and the person with control of a particular installation or site, it is unclear what role representatives of the industry would play&#151;or, indeed, who those people might be.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para6"></a>It would certainly not be possible to envisage who should be consulted when the NDA may have to move with considerable dispatch. So, although we recognise the intention behind the amendment&#151;which is to tease out the extent to which we are committed to consultation&#151;to make consultation mandatory would create difficulty in certain circumstances. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am not sure that I am convinced but at this stage I shall withdraw the amendment. We shall study what the noble Lord said and he should not be surprised if we decide to return to the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40115-22_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40115-22_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: A number of amendments have been grouped with this one. Many members of the Committee who are present today were involved in discussions on legislation affecting British Energy. We had to face up to the problem that, for various reasons, that company had been unable to build up a fund to meet its nuclear commitments. Therefore, those substantial commitments, totalling no less than 3.3 billion, had to be taken over by the Government. The powerful <P>


<a name="column_GC166"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>argument that the Government advanced was that we had to keep those facilities running in the wider interest of the nation.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para10"></a>None the less, none of us wants that situation to recur and the purpose of the amendment is to avoid that. Clause 3(4)(e) refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person who has consented to the giving of the direction",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para11"></a>
to deal with that nuclear waste&#151;that person presumably being an organisation, body or company outside the public sector. The purpose of the amendment is therefore to make clear that that person will have set aside sufficient funds to deal with that operation so that it does not have to be taken over by a public organisation. That is its simple purpose. It is a highly desirable objective that should be stated.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para12"></a>In no way should it be implied in the Bill that any future operator in the private nuclear sector should feel that his liability to deal with nuclear waste would automatically be taken over by the public sector. We need a safeguard to ensure that the British Energy situation which we had to face recently does not recur. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   With the permission of the Committee and for its convenience&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will not mind&#151;we have noted that Amendment No. 8A deals with the segregated fund, although in his wording it says a "fully" segregated fund. We have tabled two amendments, Amendments Nos. 16 and 64, which deal with the segregated fund. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to our two amendments at this stage. It would be silly to repeat the debate, even though the word "fully" does not appear in our amendments.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para13"></a>Clause 5(2) deals with income received by the NDA from directions which it gives to anyone in relation to a nuclear installation site or facility in which it does not have a financial responsibility under the financial provisions of Clause 21. Subsection (2) enables the NDA to make what are described as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"payments to the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para14"></a>
Subsection (3) also deals with charges to be imposed by the NDA. There is no indication in the Explanatory Notes about what those charges may be for, but that is not important at this stage.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para15"></a>The clause entitles the NDA to charge someone for something. Clause 22 relates to expenditure and receipts by the NDA and includes a provision for the Secretary of State to make grants to the NDA. In both cases, the Bill requires the NDA to pay its income&#151;other, of course, than the grants from the Secretary of State&#151;to either the Secretary of State or the Consolidated Fund.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para16"></a>The Consolidated Fund could be described as being a euphemism for the bottomless pit or black hole operated by the Treasury, into which money somehow disappears, never to re-emerge in exactly the same form. Money paid into the Consolidated Fund is totally controlled by the Treasury, and there is no certainty that it will be available for the purpose for which it was intended if the Treasury has other calls <P>


<a name="column_GC167"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>upon it. Your Lordships may recall the pre-privatisation days when British Telecom, with its monopoly of telephone services, was a kind of milch cow for the Treasury, earning vast amounts annually but starved of funds for expansion of the service and new technology, and when there were waiting lists of weeks or months for a new line.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para17"></a>The work of the NDA is too important, too vital, to leave its funding in the hands of the Treasury in that way. The Treasury may have a different set of priorities for the use of the money. It is too important to allow the Treasury to take the money with one hand, to give it back with the other and, with a classic piece of creative accounting, to claim credit for all the money that it is providing&#151;in other words, funding the NDA partially with its own money. Let me draw the Committee's attention to a few facts. BNFL has pointed out, among what it calls "key messages" in its recent brief, that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The creation of NDA proposed by this bill will lead to a transfer of assets and liabilities and a subsequent restructuring of BNFL's balance sheet".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para18"></a>
I do not doubt that more liabilities than assets will have to be transferred, but we must be sure that those assets are used to meet the liabilities.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para19"></a>There is also the question of the cost of the new Civil Nuclear Constabulary. We still await a clear commitment from the Government that they will fund the transition costs of the current non-statutory police force. Those costs are estimated at about 1 million. The new civil constabulary is estimated to cost between 30 and 40 million a year, which is around 30 per cent more than at present. That money has to come from somewhere. Incidentally, BNFL thinks that the Treasury may be tempted to merge the new nuclear constabulary with the MoD force, possibly to save on costs. Although I am not debating that, it is clear that it is the Treasury and not the NDA that will have a large hand in policy making.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para20"></a>The Bill provides for the work of the NDA to be funded directly by the Government in the form of an annual grant. Over the years, the nuclear industry has set aside significant sums to discharge its nuclear liabilities. Nirex claims that a considerable proportion of those assets were provided for long-term waste management, as distinct from decommissioning and clean-up costs. Nirex then points out that funds for long-term clear-up must not be diverted into short-term waste management. Those funds must be ring-fenced and kept clearly separate from the 48 billion of liabilities that the NDA must address in the short term.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para21"></a>Depending on what the Minister may say&#151;I am not sure which of the Ministers I am addressing on this point&#151;I shall be pleased to hear from him by letter if he cannot deal with my points today. Later, either I or my colleagues in the other place may have to table a further amendment on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para22"></a>We are not talking about trivial sums here. Nirex is responsible for up to almost 14 per cent of the discounted BNFL liabilities. Those amount in total to between 700 million and 1.24 billion. While that marks a slight digression from the two amendments I <P>


<a name="column_GC168"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>am now addressing, I seek to make the point concerning control of the NDA's own income, generated by its own activities. My amendments would provide for that net income to go into a ring-fenced fund, still controlled by the Secretary of State, but freed from the grasp of the Treasury. Thus, the Treasury would be relieved of the great temptation to use that money for some purpose for which it is not intended. I hope that the Treasury would like that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Perhaps I may add a few words to what my noble friend said. I preface by saying that, as a former Treasury Minister, I did not entirely recognise what my noble friend had to say. The Consolidated Fund is not a bottomless pit and it is very much subject to parliamentary control. However, the main point that my noble friend sought to make is right.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para23"></a>There is a long history of this. The Select Committee report contains words of wisdom about this. Paragraph 6.41 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have sympathy with the proposal for a segregated fund".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para24"></a>
The point had been made to us, and that was our recommendation.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para25"></a>The argument has gone on since then. It was dealt with at some length by the Select Committee in another place towards the end of last year. I would not dream of reading out every paragraph, but it is interesting to look at the evidence on which it based its recommendation that there should be a segregated fund. It is attached to the report in the same volume.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para26"></a>The committee heard evidence from BNFL, which stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Given the restricted funds available to the NDA and the fact that it has no power to borrow, it seems very likely that BNFL or any other M&O"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para27"></a>
that is management and operating&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"contractor would be looking for NDA commitments to be backed by government comfort".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-22_para28"></a>
That is the point of the exercise. Very large sums of money will be dispersed over the years to the contractors carrying out the work of decommissioning. It is clear that the Government recognise&#151;this is their argument for the separate account&#151;that there needs to be, as it were, words of comfort; there needs to be an assurance that when the money is required to be spent it will be there.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para29"></a>There is some suggestion in the report that perhaps in the light of the Government's assurances the objections of BNFL and the objections made on behalf of the industry by the Nuclear Industry Association&#151;several paragraphs in the report refer to this&#151;had been set at rest. That is not entirely the case. The current position is that the Government have said that they would prefer an account, whereas the industry still would prefer a segregated fund, the subject of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. But, in relation to the account and how it will be funded, the Government have yet to finalise and publish the mechanism for determining the initial and subsequent annual contributions.
<P>


<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para30"></a>In those circumstances, the people who will look to the NDA to pay their contracting charges will require to be assured that as they incur the expenditure so the NDA will pay the bill. That is not yet the position. As my noble friend said, if there was a segregated fund, where the money was clearly there, there would be greater reassurance.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para31"></a>No doubt the present Chancellor of the Exchequer is even now wrestling with the problem&#151;the results of which will appear in the next budget survey&#151;of how he will meet his priorities for public spending on, for instance, health and education. If there turns out to be a hole, it would not be difficult to say that perhaps some of the nuclear decommissioning can be deferred for a while. In the mean time, what would the contractors do? If there were a fund, as has been powerfully argued by a number of bodies, including the Select Committee in another place, that assurance would be there.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para32"></a>That is the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. He quoted the example of British Energy, but that rather caught up with the Government at short notice, and they had to deal with the issue under considerable difficulties when we were debating the Bill last year.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para33"></a>We are looking at a long-term programme. It has had some years in preparation and build-up, with the original White Paper and the draft Bill that the committee considered in pre-legislative scrutiny. With the evidence that one has, there can be no excuse for the Government being caught short. It is the presence of a segregated fund rather than an account that relies on annual subvention from the Treasury that will provide the necessary reassurance.
<P>

<a name="40115-22_para34"></a>It is an argument that must be taken seriously. I understand the difficulty that Ministers in the DTI and in Defra have convincing their Treasury colleagues of the weight of the arguments that are being made. If I had been sitting on the other side of the fence, I might have taken some time to be convinced. It is so important. The Government have, perfectly properly, made the whole decommissioning process the centrepiece of this stage of their energy policy. I argue strongly that they must make sure that it works and that, three or four years down the line, other pressures on public subvention do not stop the programme working as Ministers now wish. I support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and the amendments to which my noble friend spoke.

<A NAME="40115-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This is a difficult area. The amendments deal with various aspects of the charging of third parties for work carried out by the NDA, including the very large costs of decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para0"></a>Amendment No. 8A would set a condition on the Secretary of State's ability under Clause 3(4)(e) to direct, with the operator's consent, the NDA to take over responsibility for private nuclear sites. It would require, as has been said, the operator to have a segregated fund to cover the costs of decommissioning its sites. In an ideal world, the Government would support the principle that any future operators of nuclear sites should be able to <P>


<a name="column_GC170"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pay the costs of decommissioning. In reality, those costs are substantial, and we do not necessarily believe that it is appropriate for decommissioning funds to be held in advance of need.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para1"></a>It is not possible to establish an independent fund that is sufficient to support what appears to be the NDA's long-term programme, unless we get the operators to set aside billions of pounds to meet those decommissioning costs. To establish such a fund now, if it came from the public purse, would hardly be a prudent use of public funds. To require current and, indeed, if there were new nuclear build, future operators of nuclear power stations to do so would have a substantial effect on the economics of nuclear power.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para2"></a>I did not respond to the earlier thrust of what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said to the effect that the economics of nuclear power work out. Certainly, if we were to do it, the economics of nuclear power would not work out, whatever arguments we may have without this. Indeed, in the only example that we have before us now, the amendment would, in effect, prevent the Government meeting their commitment to stand behind British Energy and their liabilities to the extent that British Energy is unable to pay for them itself. Under the terms of the solvent restructuring agreement with British Energy, the company will pay moneys into a nuclear liabilities fund, and that fund is to meet the costs of the decommissioning of BE's nuclear stations and the costs of uncontracted liabilities. As part of that restructuring deal, the Government will have to underwrite that fund, in the event that that fund proves insufficient.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para3"></a>Unfortunately for Treasury Ministers, and for DTI and Defra Ministers, it is ultimately the responsibility of government to ensure the safe operations of the sites. Therefore the agreements with BE provide the Government with an option to acquire BE stations which BE has concluded it intends to close, and the costs of decommissioning will have to take that option into account. The ability to require British Energy or any future operator to establish comprehensive funds now would not be completely feasible. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, acknowledged, if the amendment were taken literally it would also prevent us dealing with emergencies such a nuclear train crash. Clearly the NDA would have to take over such a site immediately. I am sure that no one intended the amendment to have such an effect.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para4"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, seek to establish a new fund that would ensure that the NDA itself controls all commercial receipts, rather than their being paid into the Consolidated Fund. Grant income would also be paid into that nuclear liabilities fund. I assume that the concern is that future Treasury Ministers&#151;not the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in his time, I am sure&#151;might look to use the fund for other purposes. Again, that fails to recognise the dimensions of the problem. The costs of clean-up activity and of decommissioning will far outstrip any likely income to the NDA from its commercial activities.
<P>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para5"></a>The annual cost of clean-up may be predictable in the short to medium term, but it is not in the long term. As an example I cite the commercial revenues of operating plants such as the Magnox power stations. The NDA would therefore be wholly dependent on an annual grant from government to discharge its responsibilities. The idea that it would hold those moneys to meet the future costs of decommissioning is difficult. The NDA will be funded by the Government within the usual public spending plan.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para6"></a>The Nuclear Decommissioning Funding Account, by recording the NDA's expenditure and income and being maintained at a sufficient level to support a rolling 10-year programme of activity by the NDA in accordance with the agreed strategy, would provide sufficient confidence from the public and markets for the NDA to have the necessary resources to drive clean-up forward and encourage competition for clean-up contracts. However, to require the NDA to keep a fund that would meet all future contingencies would be difficult.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para7"></a>The intention of Amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 33 is to strengthen the interpretation that, in most if not all circumstances, third parties would be required to meet the costs of clean-up carried out by the NDA. That goes back to the "polluter pays" principle. The Government support that principle but there may again be circumstances in which a private sector operator cannot meet its nuclear obligations. In those circumstances, the Government's ultimate responsibility for human safety and the environment means that we must retain the possibility of the Government meeting such costs.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para8"></a>That will apply whether the Secretary of State decides to charge in a direction to the NDA or whether the NDA is carrying out its established function. Amendment No. 33 would impose a similar obligation on the NDA to charge for anything for which it does not have formal financial responsibility under Clause 21.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para9"></a>The amendments would not have the desired effect. Although I can see why people are reacting to the use of "may" in the circumstances&#151;it seems to cut across the "polluter pays" principle&#151;it recognises that there needs to be an element of discretion, the exercise of which will be subject to the normal requirements of administrative law. Replacing it with "should" would in practice introduce another level of uncertainty about what happens when the private operator's funds are not sufficient to meet the costs of the clean-up. That uncertainty is precisely what we want to avoid in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para10"></a>Amendment No. 18 would prevent the Secretary of State giving the NDA the function of acting on his behalf in relation to agreements with third parties for nuclear decommissioning and clean-up activity. An example would be the NDA undertaking a similar arrangement to that made by the Government in respect of British Energy.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para11"></a>While I understand the argument, to proscribe the Government from using the NDA to fulfil such obligations would deprive them of the expertise and experience of the public body best equipped to deal with, for example, British Energy. If they were <P>


<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prevented in that regard, the Government would have to develop other expertise, thus duplicating the capacity of the NDA. That would not be in the best interests of the taxpayer or represent good value for money.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para12"></a>That is not to say that the Government's responsibility for funding these activities will be in any sense different because, as I have said, the commercial income of the NDA would not cover them. But using the NDA as a conduit or interface for any future British Energy-type crisis should not be prevented by this legislation.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para13"></a>The legislation should allow the NDA to take over not only responsibility for the clean-up of private sector sites&#151;that is central to its function&#151;but, in extremis, to meet the costs of those activities and to act on behalf of the Government in various ways to ensure that those activities are carried out and paid for.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para14"></a>This is a complicated group of amendments, all of which address the issue of the costs of clean-up and decommissioning. However, some of the suggested changes do not fully reflect the enormous costs involved or the reality that, in certain circumstances, it is inevitable that the operator will not have sufficient funds to cover those costs. Ideally, we would want to see all such costs internalised and any nuclear component of our future energy requirements to be so covered. However, the real world is not like that; it is certainly not like that now, as the position of British Energy demonstrates.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para15"></a>It is also difficult to envisage such a situation in the future, even for those members of the Committee who want to see a large nuclear sector. Were the economics to work out in the short term, there would still be a real problem if we restrict payment for decommissioning and clean-up either to segregated funds for the operator or to our pre-established fund for the NDA itself. Ultimately there may be some liability to be borne by government, but that is simply to recognise the reality of these matters.

<A NAME="40115-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I wish to apologise on behalf of my noble friend Lord Ezra. He deeply regrets the fact that he has had to leave the Committee to attend an urgent appointment at five o'clock. He is extremely sorry to have missed the debate and the Minister's response, but he will read carefully the report. Under any other circumstances, he would not have left the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para16"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, say that this issue must be taken seriously. It is an enormous subject. In his response the Minister stressed that we must look at the reality of the situation. Of course we must do that, but it is also our duty when considering legislation of this kind to consider what should happen in an ideal world.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para17"></a>One of the difficulties of the Government's stance is that it does not recognise the problems of the past that we are trying to resolve so that we can approach the future on a more ideal footing. It is interesting to note <P>


<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that both the pro-nuclear build lobby and those members of the Committee who represent the anti-nuclear build lobby are agreed that this is something we want to see included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para18"></a>The amendment is desirable, first, for the reasons set out by my noble friend on introducing it and, secondly, because without it the whole of the rest of the private energy market will be skewed in favour of any future private nuclear operators. They will not have to consider seriously the costs of decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40115-23_para19"></a>I should also refer the Minister to what the then government said in their July 1995 policy review of radioactive waste management. They declared that segregated funds should be established for decommissioning. I wonder whether this Government have actively changed that policy, or whether it has been altered without any discussion anywhere other than in this Committee. I realise that a different government said that, but it seems to be a change of policy that slipped through.

<A NAME="40115-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I apologise to the noble Baroness. I have not replied on the Question whether Clauses 32 and 74 shall stand part of the Bill. Perhaps the noble Baroness will wish to return to the issue when we reach those clauses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   That will suit me admirably. I hope that by then my noble friend Lord Ezra will be here to speak to them.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para0"></a>I did not understand what the Minister meant when he said that the segregated fund would not be any good in emergencies. An emergency is a peculiar situation, and legislation could never cover every eventuality. We should aim at least to cover non-emergency situations, for which a segregated fund should be seriously considered.

"(8A) The Secretary of State shall exclude&#151;
<br>
(a) from what he lays before Parliament and publishes under this section, and
<br>
(b) from what is to be laid before the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish Ministers,
<br>
anything the publication of which (otherwise than under any enactment) would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by any person."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-24_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: As I understand the rules, my noble friend would have to wait until we reached the amendments that she spoke to.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para5"></a>In moving Amendment No. 9, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 56, 57 and 58. The amendments address an issue that the industry feels is extremely important and crucial&#151;confidentiality. It refers not only to existing companies&#151;although, naturally, they are primarily concerned&#151;but also to any future potential contractors, some of which are major companies, and perhaps companies from overseas, which may be interested in participating in this market.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para6"></a>The first group of amendments relates to the publication of the directions by the Secretary of State, and the second group relates to the publication of the annual report. They are two separate groups, but it is sensible that we discuss them together.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para7"></a>The point can be stated very shortly. Under the Bill, information provided to the NDA&#151;or, indeed, any material that the NDA may already possess&#151;may be excluded from publication on grounds of national security but not on grounds of commercial confidentiality. That is felt to be a nonsense.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para8"></a>The whole point of creating the NDA is to drive down costs through competition. We have already discussed that, so I do not need to dwell on it, but competition requires competing contractors. Contractors will not come forward if they feel that, by doing so, their commercially sensitive knowledge and information will become unprotected and liable to be put in the public domain. As my brief puts it&#151;it is another rhetorical question&#151;if you were in their shoes, would you?
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para9"></a>We are going to try to attract some of the leading companies in the world&#151;many of which may come from the United States, but others have experience of decommissioning&#151;to come forward and play their part in a major UK programme. By the time that the Bill comes into operation, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will be in force, but the Bill does not recognise the conditions and protections allowed by that Act. The Bill appears to confine itself merely to national security.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para10"></a>I made a considerable point at Second Reading that we all recognise that openness and transparency are key to the success of the NDA, but that must take account of real commercial confidentiality issues, as does the Freedom of Information Act 2000. What is the difference? Why should that Act protect commercial information while the Bill does not? I am advised that our amendments are consistent with the Act and would not fall foul of it.
<P>


<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para11"></a>Existing contractual commitments always include confidentiality obligations. The Bill now requires disclosure of that information and provides no protection for companies&#151;BNFL or UKAEA, for instance&#151;in relation to breach of contract or other legal liability resulting from disclosure of information. In this industry, as in many others, operational information is commercially confidential. It has a commercial value and, in an environment that will be increasingly competitive, that factor must be taken into account. Information disclosed in that way would be of significant value to competitors.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para12"></a>As I said, that applies not only to the existing firms, but to those that may be looking at the opportunity of coming into the industry. In the absence of protection for their commercial information, they will see a considerable no-no. We have an opportunity in the Bill to put that right. The disclosure duties placed on site licensees by the Bill, and the related duties placed on the NDA to publish the material that it receives, could deter prospective contractors from taking up site licences or investing in site licensee companies where that would expose them to excessive obligations and potentially to third-party claims for breach of confidentiality. That point was made to me very forcefully.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para13"></a>The very broad disclosure obligations in the Bill severely restrict the NDA's ability to secure value for money, which Ministers have today reiterated is part of the purpose of the whole exercise. They would also restrict the NDA's ability to act in the manner that it considers most beneficial to the public and to obtain value for taxpayers. I cannot help feeling that that argument must have been raised with Ministers by the industries concerned, and I am rather puzzled about why Ministers have not seen fit to respond to the argument as must be necessary. The whole process will not work unless there is proper protection for commercial information. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   As my noble friend pointed out, this is a very serious matter. I regret the time that I spent writing my speech in support of his amendment because he covered every issue that I could possibly think of. There is virtually nothing left for me to say, other than that the issue is so important that I do not understand why it has not been catered for anyway. The problem is that, when one tables an amendment&#151;one can do nothing in Grand Committee other than to raise an amendment&#151;invariably the Government say that it is not necessary or give some such response. This amendment is totally necessary. There is no reason why the protections given by the Freedom of Information Act should not extend to these extraordinarily important matters.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para14"></a>As I discussed in an earlier amendment, and as my noble friend&#151;and indeed the Minister&#151;mentioned, one of the NDA's duties is to ensure that it seeks competitive tenders. But one cannot have competitive tenders if nobody is prepared to put their hat in the <P>


<a name="column_GC176"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ring and compete because they cannot keep confidential any information that they should be able to withhold.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para15"></a>I noticed that the Minister turned around to have a big chat with one of his officials. My noble friend said that he could not believe that other people had not discussed the matter with the DTI. Although we cannot divide in Grand Committee, I hope that we will have the pleasure of not having to bring back the amendment on Report and that it will have been agreed here; otherwise, we will most certainly bring it back.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Lord emphasised the great significance that he attaches to the amendment. He remarked that foreign companies might submit bids and mentioned those from the United States. He will probably recognise that if such companies are used to making submissions in the United States, they will have been subject to American legislation, which is as extensive as any statutes in this country. I am not sure that such companies would necessarily be deterred by the situation here.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para16"></a>Of course the Government understand the concern to protect certain information related to the interests of organisations and individuals, but that must be balanced against the interests of openness and transparency. We should surely think carefully before imposing wide-ranging restrictions on publishing or laying before Parliament information.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para17"></a>It is hard to see who might be affected by the information in directions containing designations. The directions will identify what is to be designated to the NDA. They are therefore likely to include little more than a description of what the NDA is required to clean up. It is in everyone's interests, as a matter of effective parliamentary scrutiny and public confidence in the NDA, that that information be made available.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para18"></a>As the noble Lord said, the Bill contains national security restrictions. I have difficulty in accepting why commercially confidential information should require the same degree of protection. In respect of the NDA's annual report, the Bill provides for a discretionary restriction on matters of national security, but what it will describe in terms of the NDA is surely information that will be necessary for the wider public and Parliament. The NDA will inevitably, and necessarily, hold commercially sensitive information on operators and contractors. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, are right to emphasise that fact. Before making any such information publicly available, as a matter of normal practice the NDA will be expected to seek the consent of the organisations affected.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para19"></a>In the event that agreement cannot be reached, the Freedom of Information Act provides for the matter to be referred to the Information Commissioner for a determination on whether the information should be made public. There is also a right of appeal to the courts, should a party feel dissatisfied with a determination. Given our clear commitment to ensure that the NDA becomes a model of openness and transparency, we should not rush to impose additional <P>


<a name="column_GC177"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restrictions on it. Excessive secrecy is seen as having been one of the failings of the nuclear industry in the past. We must change that culture, if the NDA is to command public confidence. That approach to openness has been central to our efforts to carry all stakeholders, employees, local communities, trade unions and environmental groups with us.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para20"></a>The explicit provisions proposed in the amendments would not inspire confidence that the creation of the NDA will make a significant change to the management of nuclear clean-up. I recognise from the strength with which those points were put by the two noble Lords that my reply may not entirely satisfy them at this juncture. Therefore, I would be verging on the excessively optimistic if I thought that this was the last that we would hear of the argument in the context of this Bill. There are other stages at which issues may be more fully pressed.
<P>

<a name="40115-24_para21"></a>I emphasise that we must protect national security, but we must also ensure that, when commercially sensitive information is released, efforts are made in consultation to secure the agreement of those who supplied the information. The NDA must be free to use information on commercial activity in pursuit of its functions. It will need to promote competition and will not, therefore, release information that compromises the duty of ensuring that competition is fair. The NDA will not release information that would give unfair advantage to others in the competitive situation that we seek to create, with as secure, sound and level a playing field for competitors as is possible and consistent with the objectives that we discussed earlier. By the same token, we have a clear objective in the Bill: aspects of the operation of the NDA will need to be as open as possible for parliamentary scrutiny and public confidence. We know that problems relating to the industry have sometimes flowed from the excessive withholding of information that ought to have been in the public domain.

<A NAME="40115-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Will the Minister put himself in the mind of a company that would be prepared to bid for a contract for the NDA work? There are such things as intellectual property rights. If that organisation were to read the Minister's speech and be told that, if it did not like what was happening, it could go to the Information Commissioner and that, if it did not like what happened then, it could go to the courts, would it be bothered even to tender for the contract?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   As I said, first of all, the NDA would be concerned to encourage as many participants in the bidding process as possible and to create fairness between them. That means that it would have due regard to commercially sensitive information. However, in order properly to inform Parliament and the wider public about how it carries out its duties, the authority's first recourse would be to ensure that it consulted the organisations that had submitted such information before using it in the reporting process. So, there would be consultation at that stage.
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para0"></a>Secondly, as I said, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, aggrieved parties have other means of redress against the NDA, if the consultation <P>

<A NAME="40115-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am a little confused. The Minister started by saying that what was contained in the clause would be laid before Parliament and the Scots Parliament and that it would not contain confidential information. He then went on to give a long argument, which was not particularly well informed, about the confidentiality of sensitive matters from the company's point of view. Either we do or do not consider that the amendment applies to the clause. Can the Minister inform the Committee whether or not sensitive and confidential matters will be laid under the clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I was seeking to illustrate that in the annual report which the NDA will make to Parliament&#151;and given the necessity of making its processes as open as possible&#151;it will seek to provide the requisite information which, as I have indicated, will not substantially involve information of commercial confidentiality. It will describe the functions it has carried out and its responsibility for carrying them out. Within that framework a very limited amount of information would relate to the competitive bidding of organisations seeking to obtain contracts.
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para1"></a>We recognise that the NDA will be in possession of confidential information&#151;it cannot fail to be, on the basis of such bids&#151;but if the NDA feels that any aspects of the situation require it to produce such information in its report, its first duty would be to consult the organisations concerned to establish which parts of that information they were prepared to see made public. If the consultation is successful in those terms, the NDA will reach a position where anxieties are allayed. If not, and the NDA has to proceed further, I have indicated the ways in which, under our freedom of information legislation, organisations have recourse to law if they believe the NDA has acted unfairly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, as an amateur among professionals I must say that I am appalled by the Minister's ability to accept the thrust of the argument made by other noble Lords and then to suggest that perhaps the NDA would not use such information, but perhaps it would. He then said that if the companies agree the information can be printed quite happily. But if they do not agree, it would not be a question of keeping out the information; it would be put in and the companies would have to seek recourse in another way. But, by then, all the information will be out in the public domain.

<FONT SIZE=3>not seem to be willing to address the issue. I can see that one or two of the people sitting behind the Minister are busily writing. This is a matter to which he should give urgent and greater thought. I hope that he will do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am most grateful to those of my noble friends who have joined in this important argument. As I listened to the Minister's reply, I was reminded of the architectural feature outside ancient Roman houses called a Janus figure, which looks both ways. The first part of the Minister's response was a perfectly reasonable plea. He said that we are all arguing for transparency, disclosure of information and so on, and therefore this is a part of that. If that meant that secrets had to be disclosed, so be it.
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para3"></a>The second part of the Minister's reply was, "Mind you, by the time that the Freedom of Information Act is enforced all kinds of remedies will be available to contractors to keep information out of the public domain". My noble friend Lady Byford has just raised the important point of whether the information has to be published before they can go to the commissioner and the courts under that Act. If so, the whole thing is pointless. If the FIA procedures are open to contractors who are in a position where commercial information is threatened to be disclosed, in either a designation or an annual report, and if the contractors can then get a decision on that before any disclosure happens, why can that not be put into the Bill? Why do we have to have two separate pieces of legislation that say different things?
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para4"></a>If the noble Lord is right that there will be a remedy under the Freedom of Information Act, for goodness' sake, let us have the same remedy here. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government are resisting this. If it will be there as soon as the FIA comes into force&#151;and I am told that it will be in force by the time the whole process starts&#151;let us have it in the Bill. Why not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hear what the noble Lord says. The whole point of the Committee stage is for us to think seriously about such representations. However, I emphasise to him and to everyone who has articulated the argument that we are seeking to extend the openness of the NDA's activities in order to build up public confidence with regard to that aspect of its operations. That will develop public confidence in its judgments and policies.
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para5"></a>I thought that I had identified that the areas where commercially sensitive information was involved would be very limited indeed in respect of the NDA's accountability to Parliament and the way in which it must describe how it has fulfilled its functions. Where there is the possibility of information that is commercially sensitive being disclosed, the NDA would need to consult the companies and organisations so affected.
<P>

<a name="40115-25_para6"></a>The NDA has to protect its process. It will want the strongest competitive position possible, of course. Anything that frightened off commercial organisations from applying because they believed that, by doing <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so, they would automatically give an advantage to competitors through such information, would be totally against the NDA's interests. It would seek to reach agreement on how it would use commercially sensitive information. The consultation process is there to safeguard the interests of those who submit themselves to the competitive process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I hear what the Minister says. He refers to very limited use but, ultimately, someone&#151;presumably the NDA&#151;decides. Let us imagine that my noble friend's company objects to confidential information being published. Once the NDA had made the decision she would be in no position to appeal or to go anywhere else before the information was put into the public domain. I do not think the Minister has addressed that aspect of the matter we are trying to put forward very clearly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   The Minister has nearly got the point. Surely the risk is that a commercial concern will not take any risk; that it will not get involved for fear of losing its intellectual property rights.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   If such a risk were manifest the NDA would be vitiating its capacity to fulfil its functions in terms of ensuring that bids were successful for the work that it needed to carry out. Of course the NDA has to act with very considerable sensitivity. I merely seek to emphasise that we do not think that the annual report&#151;the necessary reporting of the NDA to Parliament&#151;and the aspects that naturally go into the public domain with regard to designation will involve commercially sensitive information. But if it were thought that there was a danger, the NDA's obligation would be to talk to the companies or organisations concerned with the information to reach an agreement with them. If it failed to do that, it would risk real alienation of bidders in terms of property rights and of intellectual property rights. Loss of confidence in those terms would mean that the NDA could not discharge its functions to the nation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-25_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I apologise to the Minister for stopping him in full flow. When he started to answer on the amendment, the Minister said that it would not be "substantially included in". I am not asking how much "substantially" is, but once he says that it will not be "substantially included in", it means that part of the confidential matter will be in the public arena. No member of the Committee can understand how the Minister thinks that that is appropriate, when even the Freedom of Information Act 2000 would not allow that. So what is the difficulty? He is quite right: we will return to the amendment, but we should not need to; it should be accepted now.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   May I suggest a nice way for the Minister to get out of this? That is to send the Bill back to the lawyers, together with all our contributions, to say "This is the problem; do they have right on their side? If they do, just change the Bill".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I cannot add anything to that. It is a tough vote on this occasion. Indeed, I thought I detected a glimmer of hope in the Minister's first reply that the Government would look at it again. Without trying to be unkind, I think that the Minister found himself on exceedingly shaky ground in trying to draw a distinction between the Bill and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. If the remedies of the Freedom of Information Act are open to the contractors as he asserted, then it would be sensible to put that provision in the Bill. The Minister may be sure we shall come back to that. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I tabled this Motion to provide a peg for what I hope will be a reasonably brief debate. We have debated various aspects of Clause 3 at some length and it may well be that other members of the Committee will want to make different points from me. I want to raise only one point at this time.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para3"></a>This is an opportunity for the Government to clear up what are widely perceived as uncertainties about the NDA's role in the disposal of long-term waste. As I said on Second Reading, when the Bill was first published, and at a meeting that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was kind enough to call upstairs, there was widespread doubt in the industry as to whether we should expect some other body following the CoRWM report or, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has, I think, subsequently said, that that may become a function of the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para4"></a>We had an exchange at Question Time. The Question was originally asked by my noble friend Lord Attlee about the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, CoRWM, and the exchanges continued about geological disposal. Then the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, asked:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Lords, reference has been made to the length of time we have already spent on this subject and the length of time we may still spend on it. Can the noble Lord indicate whether he thinks that as a result of some slight speeding up, this could be resolved when the proposed Nuclear Decommissioning Authority comes into office?".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-26_para5"></a>
In response, the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Lords, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will not deal with the kind of waste we are talking about here&#151;it is about cleaning up sites. The timescale envisaged in the Energy Bill, which we debated last week, for the establishment of the NDA would probably be before the committee had completed its work".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1054.]

<FONT SIZE=3>
Defra is the department to deal with nuclear waste; that Question was not for the DTI.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para7"></a>We raised the matter at the meeting on 6 January, and I came down from that meeting to find in my pigeonhole in the Attendants' Office a copy of a letter originally addressed to my noble friend Lord Attlee and copied to several of us that appears to correct what the Minister said on 16 December. In it, the Minister cited his Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and went on to discuss the different kinds of waste. We are primarily discussing high and medium-level waste, but it is clear that the NDA will deal with low-level waste because, as I said on Second Reading, the Explanatory Notes refer to the Drigg repository.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para8"></a>The Minister states in his letter of 16 January:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is also taken to include those proportions of spent fuel, plutonium and uranium which are likely to become regarded as waste during this period. In practice, the NDA's responsibility will be for the operational management of the wastes&#151;including the 'higher activity wastes'&#151;that arise or are held on the sites it takes over. This is provided for by clauses 3 (NDA functions) and 34 (clarifying definitions) of the Energy Bill. The NDA must manage its waste in line with Government policy. And this includes policy for the very long-term management upon which CoRWM will be delivering its recommendations. This is the key distinction between the role of the NDA and CoRWM which I was seeking to delineate.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-26_para9"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Also, in referring to the long-term solution needing to be good for 'centuries', the meaning intended was until there was no further danger from the waste, which may of course, in practice, be many centuries. That is why above I have talked of the very long-term management policy above".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-26_para10"></a>
With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that is about as clear as mud. It is not yet clear whether, following the CoRWM report&#151;we have already referred to the fact that that will mark the next stage in the process of long-term disposal of intermediate and high-level waste&#151;it will be that body that does that. The Answer in Parliament said, "No"; I think that the letter attempts to say, "Yes".
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para11"></a>I have received legal advice to say that the answer to the question that I asked on Second Reading&#151;is the Bill intended to cover the disposal of medium and high-level waste?&#151;is "Yes", in which case we can all go home. Well, we cannot yet, because it is not yet time, but I must say that the Government have been speaking with forked tongue on the matter. It is not yet clear.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para12"></a>The right answer may well be that NDA will have responsibility in the course of its decommissioning exercises to ensure that wastes are handled safely and properly in the interim. There is surface storage at most nuclear power stations; some activities involve transport of that waste to Sellafield. Do we need a definition of "disposal" in Clause 34, to which the Minister referred? There is no definition there.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para13"></a>Having received the letter, for all its obscurity, I got the impression that a separate definition might not be necessary, but it is appropriate in a clause stand part debate specifically to pose the question: does the NDA have the power to deal with the matter, when the time <P>


<a name="column_GC183"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is right, after the CoRWM report and after the Government have made up their mind and made their announcement in Parliament? Will it be for that body, or will there have to be another one?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   Perhaps I may take this opportunity to enquire about the Government's intention regarding issuing directions containing a designation. Until now, the emphasis of the debate has been on the possibility of the Government disclosing more information than the NDA or its contractors might wish to have disclosed. But, so far as I can see, nothing in this clause requires the Government to disclose anything at all. It would be reassuring to have an indication that the reasons for the designation might at least be advanced as a requirement in making statements and laying them before Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In response to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, my response to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, might inadvertently have caused confusion. I thought that his question related to long-term management of high-level waste. I think that other members of the Committee drew the impression that I meant that the NDA would not be responsible for high-level waste. That is not the intention; the NDA is responsible for all levels of waste at those sites that it manages, and under any designation. It is therefore carrying out government policy in that respect&#151;there are sites that it manages and others that are designated. But that does not mean that all high-level nuclear waste is the NDA's responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para14"></a>CoRWM has been asked to look at the long-term management and disposal of high-level waste and at intermediate and low-level waste that is unsuitable for disposal at Drigg. We await the report of CoRWM recommending government policy on what the long-term aim should be&#151;we anticipate that it will be published at the end of next year. The Government's response to the report will determine what the NDA's role will be in that regard. After all, the NDA carries out government policy; it does not make it. The Bill reflects current government policy that the NDA will be responsible for the management of the sites allocated to them. The CoRWM may recommend that the NDA should take over all responsibility for the long-term disposal and management of high-level waste in general, but we are not at that point. The Bill would allow the NDA to take on that responsibility, but it does not determine that the NDA take on wider responsibilities. The government policy determined in the light of the CoRWM advice will specify the NDA's role at that point.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para15"></a>On defining "disposal" of radioactive waste, the disposal and discharge of radioactive waste through air, water and land are regulated by the Environment Agency under Chapter 12 of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. That is not altered by the Bill; therefore, we do not propose substituting a new definition of "disposal". Obviously, the NDA will work closely with the nuclear regulators in England and Wales to ensure that it adheres <P>


<a name="column_GC184"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the regulatory framework. The CoRWM report may also cover the long-term strategy on that. The noble Lord may think that that does not clarify things totally, but I hope that it indicates the difference in time scale. The NDA is responsible for the sites allocated to it, and CoRWM will make recommendations on the long-term management of radioactive waste.
<P>

<a name="40115-26_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, made a point about issuing directions on designations. In making designations, the Government will indicate their reasons for them. In most cases, they will be apparent, but there is no requirement for any vast amount of detail in the Bill. Obviously, there will as ever be a responsibility on the Government to act reasonably, and, in such circumstances, that includes making clear the reasons for the designation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, replies, can the Minister tell me whether there is any difference between the NDA having a "responsibility" and the NDA having a "duty"? Frequently, in legislation, we find that a body has a duty to do something, but here, all the time until much later in the Bill, there is reference to a responsibility. Clause 9 refers to a duty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The responsibilities are as set out largely in this clause and, to some extent, in Clause 9. They are the areas for which&#151;I do not wish to be tautologous&#151;the NDA is responsible. The duties are laid on them either by Act of Parliament or by designation by the Secretary of State. There are duties laid on it in both respects. Future designations could spell that out more clearly than the Bill. That could arise in the light of the CoRWM recommendations and the Government's response to them. Further duties could be laid on the NDA at that point, which would not be inconsistent with the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I have heard what the Minister has said, and I shall read it carefully. My impression of what he said was that it was a little clearer than the letter. I think that he said, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, that there was no such duty on the NDA yet. If the Government decide, in the light of the CoRWM report, that the way is open for all the processes that will be needed for long-term disposal, the NDA could be the body that is charged with the duty of taking the matter forward, but that is not necessarily so. Is that right? If it is to be the relevant body, it has or could have sufficient power under the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, nods assent, having consulted his oracles, so I think that I have got that right.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para0"></a>We must consider this carefully. We have until the end of 2005 before CoRWM is expected to report. I understand that, and I fear that a lot of time has been lost on the matter already since the House of Lords report. Nevertheless, I think that there is a view now that it is time to get on with things, particularly if the <P>

<A NAME="40115-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 3, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "DUTIES IN RELATION TO NEW AND POTENTIAL NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS
<br>
(1) In addition to the responsibilities placed on the NDA by section 3 of this Act, it shall have the responsibilities provided for in this section.
<br>
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the NDA imposed by this Act shall apply equally to any nuclear installation, site or facility commissioned after the commencement of this Act.
<br>
(3) Within five years from the passing of this Act, the NDA shall submit a plan ("the plan") to the Secretary of State on the subject of the feasibility of building and commissioning new nuclear power plants to replace those becoming or likely to become obsolete within the ensuing fifteen years.
<br>
(4) The plan shall include projections as to the economies of such plants and their eventual decommissioning and as to the effect on the supply of electricity to the various parts of the United Kingdom in the absence of new nuclear facilities, and may include such other material as the NDA may consider to be relevant to the subject.
<br>
(5) The Secretary of State shall lay the plan before Parliament within one month of its receipt, and after consultation with such persons or bodies as he deems appropriate shall publish his response."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40115-27_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is slightly more abstract and theoretical in concept than others that I shall table. That is why I need to explain it at slightly greater length than normal. I ask for the indulgence of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para4"></a>First, I shall deal with proposed new subsection (2) in the amendment, which seeks simply to remove a drafting ambiguity by making it clear that the duties of the NDA extend not only to existing nuclear power plants but to any which may be built in the future. In other words, the amendment makes it clear that what is being set up by the Bill is not an authority that will die a natural death when it completes the immediate task before it of ensuring the safe decommissioning of the 20 nuclear power plants currently in service or already in the process of decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para5"></a>I should make it clear&#151;emphatically&#151;that if the Government accept the proposed new subsection, as I hope they will, we will acknowledge that we do not consider that they are committing themselves in any way to any new nuclear build. The subsection is simply intended to ensure that there is no end to the role of the NDA as long as&#151;however long&#151;there is a nuclear power industry.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para6"></a>The main substance of the proposed new clause requires the NDA to prepare a plan within five years of the passing of the Act to cover its duties and responsibilities in the event that any new nuclear plants are built. Of course, in preparing that plan the <P>


<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>NDA will have to have regard to every aspect of the feasibility of building such new plants, both economically and from the point of view of the need for them and the effect they will have on our electricity supplies.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para7"></a>The energy White Paper, which one might have thought would have something to say on the subject, was non-committal, except to the extent that it predicted that only one plant would still be in operation by 2025. That is just 21 years away. I raised the point at Second Reading but the Minister said in reply:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The policy has been set out in the White Paper".&#151;[Official Report, 11/12/03; col. 918.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para8"></a>
And what did the White Paper say on the question of future nuclear build? It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not propose to set targets for the share of total energy or electricity supply to be met from different fuels".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para9"></a>
If the Government are not going to set targets, who is?
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para10"></a>What has the question of whether we build any further nuclear power stations got to do with the NDA? It has everything to do with it because the last of the present nuclear stations will still be operational until, as I have said, 2025&#151;or perhaps until 2035, according to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, in answer to a Question. To decommission each of the plants will take decades. I hope that the noble Lord realises that I listen very carefully and read what has been said afterwards.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para11"></a>The NDA has to plan for that and for the future in case new plants are built. It has to be involved in the planning of new plants for which later on it may ultimately be responsible. It has to make sure that the mistakes made in the 1940s and 1950s, when the earliest plants were built, will not be repeated. Those mistakes were not including in the plans for a new plant the facilities necessary for its ultimate decommissioning and waste management.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para12"></a>Currently&#151;and here I quote from the brief that I and many Members of the Committee have received from BNFL&#151;in the case of older plants,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the biggest challenge is not how to tackle a particular task, but determining exactly what has to be dealt with".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para13"></a>
I also draw attention to the fact that the skills and expertise in decommissioning need to be preserved intact, both for our own purposes and to enable those skills to be exported in the future.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para14"></a>The NDA has to be involved from the outset in all the necessary planning of any future nuclear plants. The amendment makes sure that it will be part of the equation if and when the Government make any decision about future nuclear build. It is certainly not my place&#151;nor is it my intention&#151;to repeat the arguments that members of the Committee have heard many times, especially in the course of recent debates, about the place of nuclear energy in our power equation. The Minister of State told the All-Party Group on Nuclear Energy on 3 December that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we need the possibility of new nuclear build".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para15"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
He did not say that to Parliament. No doubt, in due course we shall be told whether or not that is government policy. If it is, the NDA needs to plan and prepare for it. That is all this amendment would require it to do.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para16"></a>Again, let me make it absolutely clear that I am not at this time asking the Government to announce a policy either for or against nuclear power. Indeed, at Second Reading, the Minister stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not appropriate to provide in legislation a commitment to nuclear build".&#151;[Official Report, 11/12/03; col. 918.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40115-27_para17"></a>
All this amendment requires is for one of the players in the field&#151;the NDA&#151;to make some plans during the next five years and for the Government to consider them at whatever point they think it necessary and appropriate to do so. I ask nothing more and seek no commitment either way. I beg to move.

<P>

<A NAME="40115-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I recall that, in answer to an earlier amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that it was not necessary. Do we assume that if, in the future&#151;which he was not prepared to look at too closely&#151;a decision were taken to pursue nuclear build, the NDA would necessarily be the body to discharge that role? I am equally dubious about whether it is the body to pronounce on the issues that this proposed new clause suggests. Essentially this is a policy matter, one which could be interestingly and helpfully illuminated by factual information of a kind more at the disposal of a Royal Commission or some other body not engaged in something as hands-on as the decommissioning of existing reactors. I would hope that the personnel engaged in that task are particularly suited to it. I am not at all sure whether they would be suited to evaluating the kind of evidence relating to whether there should be replacement plants&#151;I agree that it ought to be considered within the next five years.
<P>

<a name="40115-27_para18"></a>I agree with the underlying thesis of this amendment&#151;that there is an unacceptable and, in a sense, unnecessary uncertainty. The independent collation of the best evidence that is undoubtedly available on the pros and cons of what is described as the "feasibility" of commissioning and building a new nuclear power plant ought to be given urgent consideration. However, I doubt that this is the right body to do that.

<P>
<A NAME="40115-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   To a certain extent we are going over the ground covered in our debate on the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lea. The noble Baroness rightly said that this amendment does not presume a shift to nuclear build. The secondary point just referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, is that if we did have nuclear build, whether the NDA should be responsible for planning and assessing such a project.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para0"></a>I do not need to rehearse the argument. The energy White Paper does not envisage the need for additional nuclear build, but even if the Government were minded to revert to the nuclear option, we do not consider the NDA to be the appropriate body either to run such a power station or to produce a plan on the feasibility of building a new power station.
<P>


<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para1"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, made clear, that is an issue of policy and the assessment of the practicality of any proposals which may emanate from the generating industry to produce such a power station. Such proposals would be subject to a whole range of assessments by regulatory authorities both here and under European law, as well as to the Government's assessment of the economics. It would not be appropriate to divert&#151;and it would be a diversion&#151;the NDA to deal with such planning and feasibility issues. Its focus must be on how to deal with the consequences of our nuclear past.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para2"></a>Subsection (2), which the noble Baroness says is for the avoidance of doubt, is unnecessary because Clause 3(1) does not differentiate between current or future nuclear facilities. It means that the NDA could deal with the waste and decommissioning of future facilities, were they to be built, as well as past ones. Therefore any avoidance of doubt is not necessary. There is no inhibition on the NDA dealing with future nuclear build.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para3"></a>The focus of the NDA must be on clean-up and decommissioning. Indeed, that focus was widely supported by all stakeholders and was central to the proposals for the creation of the NDA. It was one of the reasons why people with differing views on the future of nuclear power have all supported the concept of the NDA. It should not be diverted into issues of policy, new build and the running of nuclear facilities. If the NDA were to be given the responsibilities suggested in the amendment, it would have to develop a new tranche of expertise and skills which could only divert it from its central task.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para4"></a>The NDA has been given the crucial and very important task of carrying out the secure and cost-effective clean-up of our nuclear legacy. That in itself is a massive task. The estimated cost currently stands at 50 billion and the estimated time-scale is 100 years. The noble Baroness suggested that after the NDA had done all that, it might move on to something else. She did point out that that was a theoretical suggestion, but we may assume that future governments will take a view when the current task is finished. However, we must focus on the present task. To divert and dilute the NDA's focus would be wrong and would not deliver the advantages we see in creating the NDA in the form proposed by the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   As an aside, when referring to new nuclear build, the Minister said "We do not envisage it". Given that, I wonder why we hear continually that the Government are keeping the option open. In answer to a question last week, I believe the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said that, "It will not be necessary", or something of that ilk. If necessary, I shall look up the exact reference.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para5"></a>I understand entirely what the Minister is saying; that the NDA is not necessarily the correct body to undertake preparing plans because it has too many other things to do. I shall certainly read carefully what the Minister has said, but this issue is extraordinarily <P>


<a name="column_GC189"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column GC189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important. It may be that at some stage the Government will say, "Perhaps we do need some new nuclear build". We do not know. We certainly heard one Minister remark at a dinner not too long ago that he envisaged it would be necessary to have some new nuclear build.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para6"></a>All I am trying to do is to help the Government by providing a vehicle. I should say that it is always my intention to help the Government. My noble friends know that, as do noble Lords on the other side of the Committee. It would be terrible if the Government woke up one morning and decided that, "Gosh, that is what we need. What a pity we did not think it through and prepare a plan".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115-28_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  On 27 February 2003, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the Government's response to the recommendations of the independent review team appointed the previous September to take a fundamental look at the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). One of its recommendations was that the Capita contract should be renegotiated to align the contract to the changed and evolving circumstances that had occurred since the original contract was signed back in August 2000. Following a thorough and constructive period of negotiation, the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita signed a revised contract on 22 December 2003.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para10"></a>The revised contract is a major step forward for the CRB and represents a substantial improvement over the previous terms. The revised contract now provides for:
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para11"></a>as a result of recent and planned efficiency savings, from October 2004, a significant reduction in the price paid to Capita for processing each disclosure application;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para12"></a>the ability to achieve year-on-year operational cost reductions with further incentives to reduce operational costs over the lifetime of the contract; any such cost savings would be reflected in further price reductions; pricing levels matched to guaranteed volumes, agreed on a bi-annual basis;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para13"></a>additional contractual performance measures including both qualitative and quantitative standards to enhance further the disclosure service; far greater clarity of roles and responsibilities within the partnership;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para14"></a>incentives to allow Capita to further enhance the IT and other technical systems to meet evolving process and output requirements;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para15"></a>the implementation of recommendations made by independent consultants on the IT system;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para16"></a>an improved agreement in respect of financial penalties for failing to meet agreed performance standards, which have been revised to meet the evolving circumstances that had occurred since the original contract was signed back in August 2000;
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para17"></a>a one-off payment to Capita of &#163;3.6 million in final settlement of the earlier agreed contract change, which provided for the introduction of the blank application form. The payment covered the additional cost of processing the blank application forms in the period February to September 2003.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para18"></a>Capita's part in the renegotiation underlined its commitment to this partnership and to this important public service. It also reinforced our belief that it was preferable to continue with the partnership if at all <P>


<a name="column_WS32"></a>

<B>15 Jan 2004 : Column WS32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible. The partnership approach, with continued open book accounting and commitment shown during this renegotiation augurs well for the future.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para19"></a>The CRB is now on a sound footing and through the revised contract will now have far greater flexibility to improve and develop the disclosure service over the coming years.

<A NAME="40115-28_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para20"></a>When the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister introduced new procedures in August 2000 to improve the handling of planning appeals we said that their operation would be monitored and reviewed. The outcome of the most recent review has suggested a need for some changes to be made.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para21"></a>Concern was expressed during the course of the review by a wide range of stakeholders about the perceived inequity for third parties taking part in the appeals process. It was considered anomalous that the rules do not allow third parties to comment on the appeal statements made by the main parties. In order to address this inequity and more fully involve all members of the community in the planning process, we intend to conduct a consultation on proposals to amend the rules for written representations, hearings and inquiries procedures. The proposed amendment would allow third parties that have commented at the six-week stage a further opportunity to comment on main parties' appeal statements at the nine-week stage of an appeal.
<P>

<a name="40115-28_para22"></a>We shall also be amending the rules to take account of drafting amendments suggested by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and to correct minor technical anomalies.

<P>

<a name="40115-29_para0"></a>On 4 June 2003, it was announced that the Ministry of Defence would undertake a review of Gurkha Married Accompanied Service (MAS) policy.

<A NAME="40115w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  Donors in Afghanistan are encouraged to provide funding for programmes that appear in the Afghan Government's National Development Budget (NDB). The Community Organised Primary Education Programme is listed as a programme for donor funding in the NDB. This shows that the Ministry of Education itself sees this programme as a priority. Donors can fund this programme either by providing funding to the Ministry of Education or by providing funding directly to the implementing agency, which in this case is CARE.
<P>

<a name="40115w01_para0"></a>DfID provided a total of &#163;550,000 to CARE for it's work in Afghanistan in financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. In line with the Afghan Government request that donors concentrate on key areas of support, we are no longer providing funding to the education sector although we continue to provide funding to the Afghan Government budget, which includes teachers' salaries. A number of other donors are focusing on education. They include the US, Denmark and Sweden.

<UL>Whether the Oil for Food Ration List could be used as the basis for the electoral register for democratic elections in Iraq; and what would be the advantages and disadvantages of doing this. [HL635]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115w01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   On 15 November 2003, the Iraqi Governing Council announced plans for establishing a Transitional National Assembly formed through caucus elections at provincial level. The Assembly will be elected no later than 31 May 2004, leading to the creation of a new transitional administration by the end of June 2004. This will be followed by elections for a Constitutional Convention and the holding of a census, leading in turn to national elections for a new representative Iraqi Government by the end of 2005. The Oil for Food Ration List would only be used at national level if direct elections were held before the census. There are no plans to do so at this time.

<P>
<A NAME="40115w01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Our aim is a political settlement in Moldova acceptable to all there. The memorandum recently drawn up by Russia following negotiations with the parties represented significant progress on some constitutional issues. But it was not ultimately accepted by President Voronin, who had reservations about certain aspects of the proposed settlement. Other OSCE member states, including the United Kingdom, shared some of these concerns. We remain committed to encouraging the parties to continue negotiations, with a view to concluding a settlement acceptable to all concerned at the earliest possible date.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Jopling </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>To what extent they are satisfied with the level of security surrounding former Soviet Union nuclear, chemical and biological legacies; what schemes for increasing security are planned; and what contribution from Western and Asian governments is promised.[HL646]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40115w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   Ensuring the security of sensitive materials is an integral part of many projects currently being carried out as part of the G8 Global Partnership. Work is also being carried out specifically on physical protection. The UK recognises the importance of helping Russia ensure that its stocks of proliferation-sensitive materials are protected to international standards from the risk of sabotage and theft. We will be identifying a portfolio of high priority projects in collaboration with the Russian authorities and other G8 Global Partnership donor countries, which will enhance nuclear security at key buildings and infrastructure. Once identified we expect to spend at least &#163;1 million per annum on these projects as part of our commitment to the Global Partnership. Some pilot projects have already been completed including a physical protection system for a nuclear-propelled cargo ship in north-west Russia in collaboration with Sweden, and physical protection systems for two nuclear powered ice-breakers in collaboration with Sweden and Norway.
<P>

<a name="40115w02_para0"></a>During the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference in 2002 the UK pledged &#163;500,000 to its nuclear security fund. The fund contributes to meeting the UK's objective of improving the security of nuclear and radioactive material and nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union.
<P>

<a name="40115w02_para1"></a>A number of other countries have provided, or plan to provide, assistance with improving the security of nuclear, chemical and biological facilities and materials. For example, during the last financial year, the US spent 39.8 million dollars on nuclear weapons storage security, 19.6 million dollars on nuclear weapons transportation security, and 199.5 million dollars on nuclear material protection, controls and accounting, and some 20 million dollars on security at the Kizner and Shchuch'ye chemical weapons storage sites. Canada has committed 65 million dollars to strengthen nuclear and radiological security. Germany has committed 170 million euros by 2009 for the physical protection of storage sites for fissile material. France has committed up to 5 million euros in 2003&#150;04 towards security and safety in Russian biological facilities.

<A NAME="40115w02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   We regularly raise our concerns about Syria's human rights record, bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners. Most recently, the EU made a demarche to the Syrian authorities on 16 December 2003 in respect of those arrested in Aleppo for protesting against the continuing state of emergency. EU representatives have attended all the court hearings in this case. The EU is also trying to gain access to the hearings against eight Kurdish defendants taking place in the (usually) closed State Security Court. Bilaterally, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Bill Rammell) spoke of Syria's human rights failings in an adjournment debate in the House on 2 July 2003 (Official Report, cols. 139WH&#150;146WH), and my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mike O'Brien) raised the issue with President Bashar al-Assad during his visit to Damascus on 5 March 2003.

<A NAME="40115w02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Ministers sign a variety of letters including letters to other Ministers, Members of both Houses, overseas governments, public bodies and members of the public. Records of these letters will be maintained by departments in different ways. It is not therefore possible to provide an accurate breakdown of the numbers of letters signed by Ministers between different categories of senders without incurring disproportionate costs.

<A NAME="40115w03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   The Health Development Agency (HDA) has indeed taken into account the full range of weight management and reduction options in its recent review of the literature in this area. Both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the HDA follow an open and transparent methodology where high quality evidence is extensively gathered in order to assess the effectiveness of interventions.
<P>

<a name="40115w03_para2"></a>A transparent and open approach will be taken during the development of the joint NICE/HDA guideline on obesity, referred to them by the Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly. It would therefore be inappropriate for either agency to have dialogue with any individual organisation. NICE/HDA expects to be consulting on the scope (exactly what the guideline will and will not cover) for this guideline from 27 January&#150;24 February 2004. All interested parties are encouraged to register as stakeholders on the NICE website by 23 January 2004 in order that they may fully contribute towards the development of the guideline. The Obesity Awareness and Solutions Trust has registered as such a stakeholder and will therefore have an opportunity to engage with this process at that stage.
