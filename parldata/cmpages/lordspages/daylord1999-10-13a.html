<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, first, may I congratulate the noble Baroness on embracing Wales <P>


<a name="column_358"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>among her responsibilities? I know that she has strong family connections with Wales, so her credentials are impeccable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-01_para4"></a>Since I tabled this Question, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has presented his significant Memorandum of Understanding and supplementary agreements between the United Kingdom Government, Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet of the National Assembly of Wales, as anticipated in our devolution debates.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-01_para5"></a>Subject to more detailed scrutiny, I can say that we welcome that document as a statement of the Government's intent as to how the various bodies involved should behave. However, does the noble Baroness agree that while the memorandum and concordats represent a brave attempt to reduce the potential for conflict between the devolved administrations and central government, our experience of devolution to date--brief as it is--suggests that only the fullest possible co-operation and mutual support between the executive elements in the new system are required if the best interests of the peoples they govern are to be served?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-01_para6"></a>Is the noble Baroness fully aware of the very serious difficulties the Welsh Cabinet has got into as it sought to pursue its own line on agricultural issues in Europe? Are there not some hard lessons to be learnt from that critical experience?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the first three points made by the noble Lord and thank him for the welcome he so generously gave me. Obviously the concordats have been considered and agreed by the Scottish Ministers in the Cabinet. They are available for scrutiny by the UK Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament Members at this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-01_para7"></a>I share with the noble Lord the belief that we are all working together to overcome any minor difficulties at the beginning of the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that in these early stages Mr Alun Michael and his colleagues are working extremely carefully? They are impressing the people of Wales, north and south. He deserves the help of all parties at present if the new Assembly is to be effective and respected by everyone in Wales and outside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Cledwyn is right. I share with him the view that I believe was expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Geraint, who said that the principle of devolution for Wales is right, a principle which has been endorsed by the Welsh people. We owe it to them to work hard to make it a total success.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the Secretary for Agriculture of the Welsh Assembly has said that she will not resign in the face of a resolution of censure which is being debated at this moment? Does the Minister agree that <P>


<a name="column_359"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it would be a bad day for democracy in Wales if a Minister of the Crown refused to resign in the face of such a resolution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, seeks to draw me into a totally improper area: to discuss the decisions, policies and actions of Members acting in their capacity as Members of the Assembly for Wales. It would be a brave Minister in your Lordships' House who commented on the behaviour of even Members of a Committee in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Islwyn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Welsh Assembly is still in its infancy, therefore, it will have its trials and tribulations? Nevertheless, progress is being made. Does the Minister further agree that one of the Assembly's principal objectives must be to get every possible aid for the South Wales valleys and other areas which have suffered so badly in the past? Does the Minister appreciate that the Assembly is buttressed by a first class Secretary of State in Mr Paul Murphy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I agree with my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the real effect of the actions of the Secretary for Agriculture, Christine Gwyther, which may lead to her defeat in the vote of censure, is exactly the same as with Ministers in both Houses of this Parliament? They have falsely given the impression that it would be possible to negotiate for Scotland and Wales wholly different policies in Europe from the rest of the United Kingdom. Has not the European Commission now called their bluff and quite rightly shown that it is absurd for farmers in, for example, my valley, to be treated differently from those in England two or three miles away or in the Scottish Borders where exactly similar conditions exist?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, Her Majesty's Government have put no obstacles in the way of the Assembly exploring possibilities of various courses of action with the Commission. As the noble Lord said, it is true that any application would have had to be made by the UK Government, as a member state. Such applications only occur when preliminary discussions have indicated that they would be acceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that the Welsh Assembly, like the Scottish Parliament, suffers from a gross under-representation of rural areas, notwithstanding the fell designs of proportional representation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, ultimately it is a matter for the people in both Assemblies to consider whether the degree of representation is accurate. My experience from <P>


<a name="column_360"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 360</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>looking at television and reading the newspapers in Wales is that fair coverage is given to the needs of both rural and urban communities in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-01_para8"></a>This may be the final comment on the Question and I am sure all noble Lords wish Wales well tomorrow in their rugby match against Samoa. We also wish Neil Jenkins well. He is a joint record holder, with the largest number of points scored. Tomorrow he may break that record.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam  </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "91013-01_para9"></a>What action they are taking to persuade the United States Government to repeal Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act as it is applied to Azerbaijan.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="91013-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, the repeal of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act is a matter for the United States authorities. We are aware that the US Administration has sought to have it repealed; we welcome its efforts. So far, the US Congress has refused to repeal the legislation, but the US Administration continues to pursue this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-01_spnew17"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her reply and fully understand the points that she makes. The US Congress voted recently by quite a small margin to retain this measure. Is the noble Baroness aware that some 200,000 Azeris were ethnically cleansed from Armenia at the beginning of the troubles and since then about 800,000 have been displaced from the areas occupied by the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh? In the light of those distressing facts, does the Minister agree that Her Majesty's Government should make every effort to impress upon the United States the importance of its position in this matter?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, both sides would press issues of the kind raised by the noble Earl. Her Majesty's Government have good relations with both sides in this dispute and a strong interest in the resolution of the conflict. One of the difficulties that has been prayed in aid of the Azeri position is that Section 907 has adversely affected their ability to restore their economic base. Surely, it is in our interests to enable security in Azerbaijan to be enhanced so that the peace process can be pursued with vigour. Although we have not exhorted the US Administration in their action we cannot but commend it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of reports that Azerbaijan has been allowing the passage of troops and weapons through its territory to join Islamic terrorists who are now fighting in Dagestan, <P>


<a name="column_361"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that those terrorists have declared their next target to be Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh? In the light of such developments, does the Minister agree that it may be inappropriate to repeal Section 907 until Azerbaijan has proved its unequivocal refusal to be involved directly or indirectly in any further military offensives against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I reiterate that the United Kingdom has no locus in relation to this matter which is internal to the United States. However, we do not believe that the Azerbaijan Government are endorsing any activity of the kind referred to by the noble Baroness. The Russian Government have formed the same view. Both Prime Ministers are working very hard in conciliatory terms to resolve this issue. We exhort all those in this debate to be cautious about the language and tones that they use which do not necessarily inure to the benefit of peace. We are at a very sensitive stage in the negotiations, but there is some reason for optimism in terms of the approach that is currently being taken. We are pursuing with vigour the peaceful methods that are being adopted by both sides.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, what contribution does the Minister believe the TRACECA corridor initiative may make to the peace-making activity? Is there any possibility that Britain will become a Minsk member?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we endorse the initiative to which the noble Viscount refers. The three co-chairs are doing a splendid job in terms of the Minsk initiative. At present, we do not seek to add our name to that. We have been very active in giving as much support as we can to these initiatives. We shall continue to pursue that to the best of our ability.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh needs reassurance about its future security which has been so threatened in recent years by the conflict? Over two years ago in July 1997 the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, gave noble Lords an assurance that with their commitment to human rights the Government would ensure that the international community made this issue central to reaching an agreement. Can the Minister outline the specific ways, rather than general exhortations, in which the Government have sought to do so since then?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the Government have encouraged the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh matter. The noble Lord is aware that that is based on three key principles set out in the Lisbon Summit: first, the preservation of the territorial integrity of both the Republic of Armenia and Azerbaijan; secondly, the security of legal status for Nagorno-Karabakh, which should be defined and based on self-determination to the highest possible degree; and, thirdly, that the security of Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole population should be <P>


<a name="column_362"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guaranteed. That includes mutual obligations and the compliance of all parties. Her Majesty's Government have provided aid to both sides, engaged in visits and direct exhortations with those involved and given practical assistance in that process which is ongoing. This is a sensitive issue which, if I may say so, is being dealt with at the moment with commendable skill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Government's concern with this issue is a matter for congratulation, but the Minister has said that negotiations are at a delicate stage and that we must be careful of the attitudes that we strike. Would not the removal of the restriction requested in the Question be a very partisan gesture in favour of Azerbaijan which last week shelled Armenian territory and which earlier this year was shown by Physicians for Human Rights to be engaged in the torture of Armenian prisoners and to this day is maintaining a blockade of Armenia? Surely, there needs to be some balance and if gestures are to be made in one direction they should be made in the other as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the balance with which Her Majesty's Government have acted has, if I may say so, been truly magnificent. We have exhorted both sides to be cautious and to use moderation. It is regrettable that when one focuses on one side of the argument the other side very quickly gives a robust riposte and lists all of the incursions made by its opponents. Her Majesty's Government have tried to introduce a balance. We have aided both sides in humanitarian terms and have tried to assist in the structure and maintenance of good governance and broker a rapprochement as best we can. To be the friend of both sides gives us an advantage. In my previous incarnation as a family lawyer I see all the benefits of Relate on the international stage.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="91013-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, MAFF's successive annual reports detail its achievements in promoting a sustainable, efficient food chain and ensuring consumers have competitively priced food produced to high standards of safety, animal welfare and environmental care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, such gratitude as I have for that reply is at least tinged with sympathy for the noble Baroness in her present role. Will the Minister be so kind as to assemble a group of her colleagues and advisers and take it on a tour of the <P>


<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>countryside in Germany, France, Holland, and anywhere else she may choose in the Community, where it will find prosperity and confidence? If the same group returned to the UK it would find the very reverse: no prosperity and no confidence whatever. My neighbour, who is a third generation small farmer, has been forced to sell up because of rising capital costs and the disappearance of rewards. I put the following question to the noble Baroness, even in her rather embarrassing position: does that not point to a total failure of the department, which in fairness may be attributed to the split in its role representing the interests of both consumers and producers? Should that not be replaced with the farming role in preserving the environment and ensuring that the health of the countryside is fully safeguarded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am not in the slightest bit embarrassed in answering this Question, although any prudent Minister would probably adopt the precautionary principle when dealing with questions from the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, particularly those that appear to be deceptively simple.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-02_para2"></a>I do not disagree with him as to the severe problems that are facing farmers and the agricultural industry in this country across a wide range of sectors. It is the difficulties in each of those sectors occurring at the same time that makes this crisis particularly deep and difficult for those involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-02_para3"></a>Many issues are influencing the situation, not least the over-supply in commodity markets, the effects of world trade, the recession in the Far East, the collapse of the Russian economy and the fact that farmers in this country have had to deal with the beef export ban and the associated charges on the livestock industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-02_para4"></a>We are trying to deal with all the issues involved, but there is a general understanding that there will have to be a restructuring within agriculture, not only in this country because there are areas of agriculture where equal strains are being felt internationally. We have to find ways of supporting those who are working in the industry while that restructuring occurs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend give an assurance that she will give the utmost support to British beef farmers following the insufferable and illegal action by the French of banning British beef, although the European Union has said that it is safe? Will she and her department be tough when negotiations are held with the EU and, if the French will not return to legality, will my noble friend advise the British people to boycott French goods?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I prefer to adopt the strategy suggested by my noble friend in the first half of his question in relation to the completely unjustified non-implementation of an EU decision about the resumption of beef exports from this country. We must ensure that the decision is properly implemented throughout the Community. I can reassure my noble friend that my right honourable friend the Minister of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Agriculture and the Prime Minister have made quite clear within Europe and to the governments concerned, particularly to the French Government, our belief that they have no new evidence in this field and that the measures that have been approved by the EU scientific advisers after exceptionally thorough scrutiny show that British beef is safe and that they are legally obliged to implement that decision.

<A NAME="91013-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Minister to her new position. May I say how pleased we are in the south-west that we will be part of her particular brief.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para0"></a>Will the Minister make particular efforts to ensure that MAFF looks beyond the farm gate, which it has failed to do historically? That is one of the reasons for the lack of prosperity in the countryside and has led to a situation in which the amount of money that we are to receive for rural development regulation is below that given to Finland and most other countries in Europe. Can the Minister ensure that that money receives matching funding for the development of such essentials as farmers' co-operatives, farmers' markets and measures to make it easier for farmers to sell their extremely high quality produce to local people?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman:  </B>  My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her welcome. I agree that the Rural Development Fund gives opportunities for exactly that kind of restructuring, diversification and support for rural economies in the round, not necessarily only through a very narrow definition of conventional agriculture. There have been difficulties because of the EU decision to base the amount of funding that is available on historical spend rather than on necessity, and that is an issue that we are pursuing. I agree that the opportunities exist, as with the special aid package that was announced by my right honourable friend in providing support for marketing schemes in particular areas for particular produce.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity must be brought to justice. The Government are very concerned about the reports of atrocities committed in East Timor. There is a pressing need to establish the facts and who was responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para1"></a>An international commission of inquiry has been set up by the UN and we are offering our practical support. The Commission will report to the UN Secretary-General before the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister warmly for the close interest that the Government <P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have always displayed on the issue of East Timor, and the Foreign Secretary in particular for his active concern. Is the Minister aware that the Commission which is to be set up will have no jurisdiction over the offences but only a power to inquire into what offences were committed and by whom?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para2"></a>Will the Government therefore try to ensure that the transitional authority being established by the UN has criminal jurisdiction over the criminal acts which have been committed during the Indonesian occupation? Will she also ask the Security Council for a ruling on whether the fourth Geneva Convention applies to East Timor so that these criminal acts can be subject to universal jurisdiction and tried in the courts as signatory states?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships will know that the details of the transitional authority are still being worked out. The UN Secretary-General's report makes clear that one of the objectives of the transitional authority is to create non-discriminatory and impartial institutions, particularly the judiciary and the police, to ensure the establishment and maintenance of the rule of law and to promote and protect human rights. As stated by the Secretary-General's special representative, it is to facilitate the creation of an independent East Timorese human rights institution whose functions will include investigation of alleged violation of human rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para3"></a>It is very important to establish what happened. If we act precipitously and on ill-founded evidence, we might identify the wrong culprits, if indeed there are culprits for these atrocities. Therefore there is a real need to act with a degree of circumspection and caution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para4"></a>The noble Lord will know that the Security Council does not make rulings on the applicability of the Geneva Convention. I shall seek to respond to the noble Lord in written form, if that would be acceptable to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, rather than addressing these situations ad hoc, the best method of bringing war criminals to justice would be to establish the international criminal court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I cannot say anything specific in relation to the ratification of the treaty; what I can say is that the appropriate nature of our response should be dependent upon the facts once they are established. We know that a number of solutions and responses have been adopted in the international fora; for example, in South Africa. There is a whole panoply of appropriate responses. We have to await the results of our inquiries and see what recommendations come from the UN. We have to engage the people of East Timor, because they have <P>

We have to bear in mind that Indonesia has taken a number of crucial steps towards the establishment of democracy within its borders and in East Timor. It has an ability and it would appear now perhaps a willingness to engage constructively.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para12"></a>The Minister will not be surprised that I wish to return again to the subject of benefits for widows. She has referred often to modernising widows' benefits. Indeed, this is the description given to the proposals in the Bill in the Queen's Speech. Modernising in this case means removing benefit altogether from widows over the age of 45 without children and substituting an improved one-off bereavement allowance of &#163;2,000 rather than the present &#163;1,000, plus a benefit lasting for six months. These arrangements are intended to apply both to widows and widowers on the basis that <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this will equalise benefits for both sexes. In both cases we are informed that benefits will depend on the contribution record of the deceased spouse.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para13"></a>In support of those proposals, it is asserted that widows' benefits are now out of date; most women work and are now no longer dependent on male earnings. It is said that continuing to provide the benefit means that it goes to women who do not need it, like women who benefit from a spouse's occupational pension; and that funds should be concentrated where there is the greatest need.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para14"></a>I do not accept those arguments. Leaving aside altogether the view that the Equal Opportunities Commission has always held, that one should equalise upwards rather than downwards, I think that there is a quite deliberate confusion here between insured benefits and welfare provision. Insured benefits arise from the system of social insurance to which everyone contributes and individuals draw benefits from it as and when they qualify for them. Welfare provision is something else. It is not based on contribution records but only on need. That being so, it is means tested and depends upon the claimant's perceived and established lack of means.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para15"></a>Widows' benefits belong to the first, insured, category. The Government confirm that. Even in discussing the new proposals the then Minister for Social Security, Mr Stephen Timms, stated on 9th March that the contribution conditions for the new bereavement benefits exactly mirror those that they replace. He spells out precisely what those conditions are. In other words, this is a benefit for which the recipients have paid and they therefore have entitlement not in any way dependent on their present circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para16"></a>In response to a Question that I asked on 13th April, the Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;It is certainly true that the widow's benefit has been a contributory benefit ... The purpose of that contributory benefit was to help the needs of those who would have no income, but that is now met in other ways".--[Official Report, 13/4/99; col. 617.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-03_para17"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para18"></a>With respect to my noble friend, I think that that is wrong. If that had been so, the benefit would have been a means-tested one; and it was not. It was paid as of right on the death of the spouse provided that contributory conditions were met. Hence it is wrong in my view to argue against a continuation of the existing arrangement on the basis that it is no longer needed. But even if we look at the matter from the standpoint of the Government and the Minister, again I think that that is wrong. The Minister has said on a number of occasions that times have changed. I do not think that they have changed as much as she thinks they have in particular for large numbers of poorer women. The Equal Opportunities Commission figures demonstrate that women's earnings are still very much less than those of men. While it is true that many more women now work, much of the work is poorly paid. I say that, even though acknowledging with gratitude what the present Government have done and continue to do via the minimum wage to alleviate some of this poverty. Nevertheless, households where the woman partner is <P>


<a name="column_368"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the main earner are still the exception rather than the rule. The death of the male partner usually means a substantial drop in the standard of living of that household.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para19"></a>Nor is it true that there are large numbers of women with generous benefits from occupational pension schemes to which their husbands belong. It is true that some schemes are generous, in particular those negotiated in the wake of the Castle plan by some unions. But plenty are not and are based on the assumption that there will be a state pension in addition or, in the case of an early death in service of the spouse, a widow's pension to the remaining partner.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para20"></a>So the state widow's pension is a very useful addition and not one that can be dispensed with easily and without hardship. And the state will benefit quite substantially from this transfer of benefits from women to men which is what is involved here. The figure of &#163;600 million has been mentioned. I do not know whether this is accurate. But I am also advised that the proposals in the Government's plan in relation to equalising for widowers will cost &#163;100 million so there will be a gain of &#163;600 million and a payment of a &#163;100 million in order to equalise on the basis suggested for widowers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para21"></a>I have had some interesting figures supplied to me by the Widows' Advisory Trust of which I am a trustee. I hereby declare my interest which I think is known to your Lordships. This is a comparison between the sums paid out over the past eight years to a widow who is widowed at the age of 50 in 1991 and the amounts that would be paid out in the case of a women widowed in 2001 at the same age of 50 over a similar period of eight years under the Government's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para22"></a>The 1991 widow received a bereavement payment of &#163;1,000 plus a small sum representing the SERPS addition, now to disappear, and benefit over the next years. The total cost to the social security budget over eight years was &#163;20,560.32.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para23"></a>Now let us consider the woman widowed in 2001--and remember that we have been told that the contributory rules will be the same in each case. The 2001 widow will receive a bereavement allowance of &#163;2,000; there will be no SERPS addition; and she will receive a benefit for only six months thereafter--nothing at all in the following years. In the case of the latter woman (to be widowed in 2001) the saving to the Government, compared with the cost of the 1991 widow, is &#163;20,242.42. That is for one widow over an eight-year period. I do not believe that that is at all justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para24"></a>Widows, particularly poorer ones, do not constitute a very powerful lobby. Many women journalists have written on the subject and cannot themselves very easily empathise with some of the women who have not had their education or career opportunities and who spent earlier years bringing up children. Even if they have had jobs they always looked to the male earner in the couple to produce the required living standard. I ask my noble friend the Minister to picture <P>


<a name="column_369"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the lives of some of these women. I say again to her that for such women things have changed far less than for women from more privileged backgrounds. Such women are entitled to have what they believe their spouses have contributed on their behalf.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para25"></a>The TUC, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Child Poverty Action Group have supported what I am saying. In fact, the Child Poverty Action Group states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Except for a minority, women's lack of economic independence while bringing up children means that they are ill-placed to take on work after bereavement. The on-going income of a contribution-based benefit such as the widow's pension is thus an important safeguard".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-03_para26"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-03_para27"></a>Finally, I gather that the Government's intention is to remove from widows the two-year income tax concession that they have had hitherto. When one takes that into consideration it seems as though the increase in the bereavement payment from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000, although welcome, is not all that generous. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I explained in Committee why I am unhappy at the abolition of the widow's pension. I do not need to repeat myself. Nothing has changed since then and I am still unhappy. In particular I do not like the fact that another contributory benefit is being virtually removed for some people who have already contributed to it. The House knows of the campaign I have been waging with Age Concern to protect future widows' rights to SERPS after April 2000. This matter is somewhat similar.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para0"></a>The Psalms teach us that God defendeth the widow. Thank goodness someone does, for there appears to be very little help from this or previous governments. I recognise that they have the prerogative to make changes to the benefit system. Judging by the amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, and those to be moved, I believe, by the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, and the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, it is abundantly clear that no one believes that a six-months' bereavement allowance is enough. The Minister hinted in Committee on 6th July that she would reconsider. I hope that we may hear some good news today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Crawley: </B>   My Lords, I speak to Amendment No. 96A. It reflects a similar amendment that I tabled, with colleagues, in Committee. It is a modest but sensible alteration to the measures in the Bill as regards the bereavement allowance and its length of payment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para1"></a>We know that for those who have lost a loved one through death, a year rather than six months represents some kind of landmark on the road to recovery. The first anniversary and a festival such as <P>


<a name="column_370"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 370</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Christmas have been endured and survived. Their physical and mental health have started to improve after the trauma, as any doctor will tell us. Acceptance of death is beginning to be experienced and the practical and financial matters concerned with organising the deceased's estate have begun to be dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para2"></a>There is no ideal stage at which a person must decide to begin again and move on. But I genuinely believe that the resources and the strength required to take that step and accept new challenges are far more likely to be present for the bereaved a year after death rather than at six months. I ask my noble friend the Minister to look favourably on this temperate amendment which would be of enormous significance for those who have suffered bereavement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-04_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the House owes thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, for the determination with which she has kept before us the big issues arising from this clause. I agree with a great deal of what she said. At the end of the day, however, our positions differ. The Minister has also said a great deal with which I agree, but at the end of the day our positions differ. Indeed, I believe that I just about bracket the difference between the two of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para3"></a>As the Government originally envisaged the clause, it is in effect the downside of equality. The requirement to work, on women as on men, after bereavement is an attempt at full equality. I understand the kind of pride that leads the Minister to defend that. My sense of it is not that it is wrong but that it is considerably premature. It is a major cultural change enforced on a world which is not yet ready for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para4"></a>Before we have such a change I would like to see progress made towards equal pay reach at least the point of women earning 90 per cent of equivalent male earnings. I would like to see effective legislation against age discrimination. The requirement to work is nugatory if people cannot be considered for employment. I know the Minister will tell us that there is in place a code of guidance against age discrimination. A recent survey by, I believe, the CBI found that one-third of its members were unaware of the existence of that guidance. The overwhelming majority of the others thought that it made very little difference. Were that otherwise I would be more inclined to agree with the Minister's position than I do.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para5"></a>However, we cannot begin from anywhere other than where we are. I listened with a great deal of sympathy to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley. I remember the amendment moved in Committee. It was introduced in a particularly moving speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. At the end of that debate I said to myself that this is probably where we are going to end up. If so, it has taken a very long time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para6"></a>The Treasury always reminds me of the 17th century Spanish proverb that if death came from Madrid we would all live to be very old. In a perfect world compromise is inadequate. But the whole point is that it is not quite adequate to any party. That is why <P>


<a name="column_371"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>compromise works. If this were our position of ultimate resolution, I do not believe that it would last for ever but give rise to disadvantages. However, it would give everybody something. Therefore, even though we have heard what the Chairman of Committees has said about pre-emption, if the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, chooses to put her amendment to the vote, we on these Benches will support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, for moving her amendment so eloquently. She made a very convincing point. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para7"></a>As regards the two amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, we on these Benches are very sorry that they were tabled so late. We believe that they should have been grouped with our Amendments Nos. 96 and 99. Accordingly, and with the leave of the House, I shall speak to those amendments at this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para8"></a>We agree with the noble Baroness that an allowance for 26 weeks is not long enough for a bereaved widow. However, we do not believe that one year is long enough. Our amendments are designed to ameliorate the effect of Clause 51 by extending the new allowance to two years. We realise that no length of time is likely to truly overcome the sense of loss of bereavement, which is often unexpected. My noble friend Lord Higgins gave warning at Committee stage that we would be returning to this issue. The principle of our amendments was widely supported in the other place by Members who sit on the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches. There was a truly outstanding contribution on this issue from the honourable Member for Newbury.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para9"></a>The principle is supported by Age Concern, the Child Poverty Action Group, Disability Alliance, citizens' advice bureaux, the National Association of Widows, Cruse- Bereavement Care, Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide and the All-Party Group on Ageing and Older People. All of those groups are unhappy about the abolition of the contributory widows' pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para10"></a>The Government will eventually save over &#163;600 million per year which many future widows--there are over 250,000 of them--thought that they would receive because their husbands had paid national insurance contributions. Sometimes they paid voluntarily over a lifetime of work. Those contributions will no longer count. The Government clearly do not seek to honour that contract. There was no mention of that intention in the Labour Party Manifesto. Every penny of that saving for the Treasury will come directly from the pockets of recently bereaved women. The additional expenditure on widows and children in a family where there has been a bereavement pales into insignificance when compared with the savings being taken from widows.
<P>


<a name="column_372"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 372</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para11"></a>Losing a partner is often devastating. Some people will have nursed their spouse through a terminal illness. I have seen at first hand the suffering that a husband endures watching a partner die since my wife's sister died of cancer only a couple of years ago. Many widows in that age group still need to continue to support their older teenage or young adult child through further education or training. The Government's proposals mean that a woman will suddenly be forced to work to support herself a mere six months after the death of her husband, when she may still barely cope with getting through the day. The reality is that the job search would have to start long before the six months were up.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para12"></a>Is it not incredible for the Government to expect a widow to enter the competitive world of work so quickly? She may have had no previous work experience, nor time to study for a qualification to earn the kind of money that the widows' pension would have provided. The six month bereavement allowance is not an adequate substitute for the widows' pension, especially for those who may be struggling hard to keep their heads above water and to keep a family together. An allowance should give the bereaved person time for grieving, for reorganising the home, taking care of financial and legal matters connected with the bereavement, and preparing, where necessary, to take up work. Widows will be punished for having stayed at home to bring up their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-04_para13"></a>These amendments will ensure a more realistic degree of comfort than 26 weeks or one year to vulnerable people who believed that they had security and provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Berners: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the amendment, and especially what my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever has just said. The proposal as it stands is far too short a time for any real support for a widow or widower in a state of bewilderment and desolation. There must be many who are not able to cope at all for months. All kinds of ongoing circumstances may abound, such as debt or disablement and family problems of one sort or another. Such widows would find 18 months to two years' pension a real benefit towards helping them to sort out and come to terms with their much-altered circumstances. Therefore I ask the Minister to concede this point as a way of extending the compassionate nature of this welfare reform.

<A NAME="91013-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the clauses which we are discussing, which the Government propose and to which Amendments Nos. 95 and following relate, would reform the current, and in my view, outdated, system of widows' benefits, which apply only to women and not to men. The proposals would replace it with a fair system of bereavement benefits for men and women alike. Far from reducing the contributory principle, they will actually be extending it to men for the first time. The benefits are designed to provide help where one member of a working-age couple is left, often unexpectedly, to cope alone.
<P>


<a name="column_373"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para0"></a>Our reforms will concentrate help from the State where it is most needed. Many noble Lords have experience of this issue. I can tell the House where that help is most needed. It is needed at the point of bereavement itself, for the immediate problems of adjusting to funeral arrangements, of sorting standing orders, pensions, car insurance, house insurance, the estate and so on. That will normally take a couple of months. One may also need a lump sum to help with the immediate arrangements. One will need a breathing space while one continues with the arrangements and &#147;gets one's life sorted". If one has children who are not yet in further or higher education, one will also need help to support them and in order to have a genuinely free choice as to whether one should work--man or woman alike--or stay at home and bring those children up, knowing that having lost one parent, they may not wish to see the second parent out of work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para1"></a>I know, as do many noble Lords, where the points of pressure lie. They lie first, in the immediate few months after widowhood, or widowerhood, and secondly, there is pressure if one has responsibility for children, which remains an ongoing responsibility. I am sure that I am speaking to something which all noble Lords would accept and understand. That is precisely where our reforms are aimed to help. At present, they help women, who will often for the rest of their lives be back in the labour market, and they are giving them a benefit which they do not necessarily need, like myself. The present system does nothing at all to help men who may have come out of the labour market to look after their children, and in doing so go onto income support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para2"></a>We must change the system because it is not fair to men who may be struggling to look after their children, and because it no longer in my view reflects the situation which families may face. They need help in the immediate few months after bereavement, and, as I say, if they have ongoing responsibilities for children.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para3"></a>We are talking about the future. No existing widow will be affected by these changes, so no one need worry that their benefits will be changed tomorrow. In our reforms we are proposing three things. First, at present, a woman would receive a bereavement payment of &#163;1,000 at the point of her husband's death for the immediate expenses. The Government propose to double that sum from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000, and to apply it to men and women alike, because these needs do not apply solely to women but to men or women in that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para4"></a>Secondly, we are giving both men and women alike a breathing space; a benefit as of right--not a means-tested benefit--for six months to men and women, whether they have children or not and whether or not they work. They will have a breathing space in which to come to terms with their loss and to adjust their lives accordingly. Thirdly, the Government propose to develop a widowed parents allowance, to apply to men and women alike, while their children are dependent on them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para5"></a>That is our approach--three proposals; for the bereavement allowance to be doubled, for the breathing space payment to be paid to men and women <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>alike, and for a widowed parents allowance to be paid to men and women alike while children are dependent on them. In addition, we shall be giving extra help to those aged over 55 at the start of the new arrangements who are widowed in the first five years, so that they can receive extra income-related help without signing on for work, as well as extra access to the New Deal and so on, should they so wish.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para6"></a>My problem with the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner is that they effectively maintain the status quo. There is effectively no change: they propose money for life for a widow, whatever her circumstances, and as far as I can see, unless the noble Baroness is going to say otherwise, virtually no change for men. It may be that my noble friend wishes to extend the same principle of benefit as of life for men, at whatever age they may be widowed, whether or not they have responsibilities or whatever their income. That would mean that my noble friend would be offering the state benefit to men who possibly have perfectly generous salaries, and so on, simply on the grounds that they have become a widower at some point in their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para7"></a>I believe my noble friend's amendments would undermine one of the fundamental principles of what we are trying to achieve--to focus support where it is most needed; that is, in the immediate period after bereavement and on families with children. Quite frankly, why should a woman with no dependent children and therefore no one dependent on her staying at home, possibly in a well-paid job with no financial need and possibly with a generous occupational pension, receive a state benefit as of right? I am talking about someone who has no children, is in a job and with a decent pension. And yet a man who may be struggling to bring up his children by coming out of the labour market on income support gets nothing at all. That cannot be right and that is what we propose to change. It is not right to put money into the pockets of a widow who does not need it while denying it to men who may do. At the moment men get nothing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para8"></a>Our reforms will change that. We propose to extend bereavement benefits to men and remove the assumption that widows--simply because they are women--should have to rely on benefits through the rest of their lives. I do not find that situation acceptable because the world in which the original widow's benefit was devised--the world of Beveridge and of subsequent times--has changed beyond recognition. When I listen to speeches, even those of my noble friend, who knows a great deal about the field of social security, I wonder sometimes whether people realise just how much the world has changed. In Beveridge's day, one woman in eight worked. Now seven out of 10 married women work; eight out of 10 married men work. That is seven times as many as in Beveridge's day. I give another example: 98 per cent of married women--that is, all but 2 per cent of them--either are in work or have been in work while married.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para9"></a>That was inconceivable in Beveridge's day. The assumption was that a woman was at home and, therefore, when her husband died she had to obtain her <P>


<a name="column_375"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>widow's benefit through him because she had no other income. Now 98 per cent of married women will have worked or will have built up work records or are able to go back to work. The assumption behind the very thoughtful speech of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the moving speech of the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, is that with these amendments a widow will for the first time &#147;have to go into work". But a widow is going back to work from the job she had.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-05_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is putting words into my mouth when she says &#147;for the first time". I did not develop my side of the argument about how much the world has changed because I thought that the House knew it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am sure the House is grateful for the noble Earl's brevity. In that case, let me attribute the phrase to the noble Lord, Lord Astor, who certainly used those words.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para10"></a>The assumption behind a lot of the argument for no change is that a widow has not worked and that, suddenly, as a result of bereavement she is forced out into the rough and difficult world of work and that that is not fair. There are as many women working in the labour market as there are men. There are almost as many married women in work as there are married men. I repeat that 98 per cent of married women have worked. Therefore, the assumption that married women should have a benefit as of right for life simply because they are a widow, irrespective of their income, their job or their children, belongs to a generation that has passed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para11"></a>Indeed, I wonder what noble Lords would expect when looking at the figures relating to the number of women and men, of widows and widowers, in work. If one looks at the number of widowers in work between the ages of 45 and retirement--admittedly, five years longer than women--53 per cent of widowers work while 54 per cent of widows work; that is, more women (widows) work than men (widowers), and yet we give the benefit to women and not to men. That is the scale of the change in our society. Our proposals seek, in decent, fair and just ways, to reflect that so that men and women are supported at the two points of need--the immediate period after bereavement and also if they have a responsibility for children.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para12"></a>We recognise that people need a breathing space to come to terms with the emotional and practical upheaval caused by the loss of their husband or wife. That is why we propose that the bereavement allowance should offer financial support for six months for men and women alike.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para13"></a>We weighed up all the arguments. We thought that six months was about right. We wanted to concentrate help where it was needed. However, following the debate in Committee and the eloquent speeches made there and again today by my noble friend, there has been much pressure on the Government to change the period from six to 12 months; that is, to double the <P>


<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>period in which we give a supporting benefit to men and women alike while they come to terms with bereavement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para14"></a>I believe those arguments were put forcibly. Men and women alike, particularly if they have been caring for a spouse, may be tired and depressed and may need a longer breathing space than we perhaps first thought. My noble friend Lady Crawley has made that point. We have reflected and I am delighted to be able to say that we are willing in principle to accept the amendment of my noble friend Lady Crawley to extend the bereavement allowance not to six months for men and women alike but to one year. That is a significant move and means that widows and widowers aged over 45 without dependent children--if they have dependent children, they are both eligible for the widowed parent's allowance--will receive financial support from bereavement benefits for a year. That is for twice as long as under our original proposals. That will cost a further &#163;50 million. As a result, 20,000 or so new widows and many thousand widowers each year would receive that allowance for six months longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para15"></a>As I said, we are willing in principle to accept the spirit of the amendment of my noble friend Lady Crawley. However, if the House were instead to accept the amendment of my noble friend Lady Turner, or, more particularly, the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, I must tell the House that I would expect the Secretary of State to seek to overturn that amendment. I phrase my words carefully. But because the six-month period is on the face of the Bill, we would find ourselves returning to that point--not the 12-month period. In that situation I could not guarantee what the other House would do. It would obviously reflect upon it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para16"></a>The offer that I make to your Lordships today is that were the whole House to support my noble friend's amendment which proposes a 12-month period, that would be accepted by the Government and would survive. If instead that is displaced by an amendment which has to be overturned in the other place, I cannot predict what the outcome of that may be. I do not know what would happen. I am being frank with the House. There would be all sorts of pressures in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para17"></a>I urge your Lordships to accept that the Government have moved very considerably on this matter. We have listened to the points made by your Lordships. As a result we are proposing, if the House so wishes, to accept the amendment of my noble friend Lady Crawley which would double the bereavement period from six months to 12 months. That means that men and women alike would get a bereavement payment of &#163;2,000, not &#163;1,000, at the point at which they lost their spouse.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para18"></a>Secondly, men and women alike, whether or not they had children, and whether or not they were in work, would get a bereavement payment of support for 12 months. Those with dependent children would receive benefit--men and women alike--until their children were adult. That is the package I put to your Lordships. We have listened, but we cannot accept the <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, because it goes too far. I urge the House to accept the compromise amendment of my noble friend Lady Crawley. If we secure that today, the House will have done very well.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_time0"></A><H5>4 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for her detailed response. She will not be surprised to learn that I do not agree with it. If I may say so, I believe that she has overlooked one of the main points in my submission, which is that we are talking about a contributory benefit. This is a benefit to which the spouse who has died contributed during his working life. Probably because he believed that his widow was covered to some degree, he had not perhaps made other provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para19"></a>As regards widowers, I certainly did not intend to imply that I do not believe that widowers should have the improvement that has been recommended. On the contrary, but under the same conditions. The widower would be entitled to a benefit based on the contributions of his spouse while the spouse was in work in the same way that the widow would be entitled to a benefit based upon the contributions that her husband had made. Answering this again on the basis of need--that a great number of women who do not need it receive it--is no answer to the argument. A contributory benefit ought to be a contributory benefit, and you should get the benefits accruing therefrom when you qualify.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para20"></a>For example, if I took out a policy with the Prudential and when under the terms of the policy I qualified for a payment I was told by the company, &#147;Well, we're very sorry but you can't have it because you don't need it", I would feel very angry indeed and the Prudential would probably end up in court. We are talking about the same kind of principle here. We are discussing a contributory benefit in a system of social insurance: we all contribute, and then when we need the amount due under that contributory system, we receive the benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-05_para21"></a>Further, I do not agree even when we examine the question of need and the number of women who are said to be in work. According to information I have been provided with by, for example, the Child Poverty Action Group, the majority of widows, if they work, are working part time, and are usually in low-paid employment at that. I do not believe that that argument holds water.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the majority of married women in employment work full time and not part time. The average pay for a married woman in full-time work is &#163;15,000 a year. I am afraid that my noble friend's statistics are not up to date.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, we could argue about that, but certainly those figures do not tie up with some of the information I have received from a number of lobbying organisations which support what I have been saying. The fact remains that we have <P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>here a situation in which there will be women who would have expected to receive the benefit but will not receive one.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-06_para0"></a>We have been told that there is to be an increase. Of course I welcome the rise from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000 at the point of bereavement. That is very welcome. However, I must point out that it is the first increase since the benefit was introduced some 10 or 15 years ago--I cannot remember exactly when. However, as I said in my opening statement, the Government will recover the money to pay for that by not paying widows' benefits beyond six months, or the year that has been suggested today. Further, I believe that the Government have decided that in future the two-year tax concession available for the first two years after the husband has died will not be paid. It seems to me that the Government will recover some of the extra costs involved there. Further, as a result of these proposals in total, the Treasury will gain substantially over and above what would have been the situation had the existing arrangements continued.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-06_para1"></a>For those reasons, I do not accept what my noble friend has said. However, I do not intend to call a vote on the issue today. I shall think about what has been said. As regards the amelioration of one year, I do not think that that is enough. Should the noble Lord, Lord Astor, choose to press his proposition calling for two years, I would vote for two years rather than one year, because two years are rather more generous. However, I still do not think that that is enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-06_para2"></a>I should like to think about what has been said today and perhaps return to the whole issue of benefits based upon the contribution record at Third Reading. I regard the matter as very important. I am a supporter of social insurance and not a supporter of an entirely means-tested system which we would otherwise need to have if we do not have a system of social insurance leading to the eventual provision of universal benefits when people become qualified for their entitlement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-06_para3"></a>As I said, I am not happy about the proposal for one year. It is quite insufficient. I do not agree that you can get over everything in one year. From personal experience, I do not think that that is true at all. Two years is not really sufficient, but I would much prefer that to one year. That will be my position. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-07_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I understand that the amendment will be moved to leave out the words last inserted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, we have just decided that the appropriate length of time for the widow's benefit to continue is two years. That seems to me to be a very clear decision of the House. The amendment seems to be quite inappropriate and I should have thought that it should fall. The House has clearly indicated that it believes that that is right, and I do not understand why it should not be so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I might assist the House. Noble Lords may remember the debate on the Police Bill in the last Session of the last Parliament when the House carried an amendment from the Labour Front Bench and one from our Front Bench. The amendments were inconsistent with each other. The advice we received from the Table was that the House was perfectly entitled to carry both if it wished to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we sought the advice of the Table on this matter. We were advised that the House has taken a view on the two-year rule but has not yet had the opportunity to make a judgment on the one-year rule. That comes afterwards and is subsequent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, this seems to me to be quite remarkable tactics by the Government. I understand that it is in line with advice received from the Table. None the less, the House has clearly indicated what it wishes to do. Other than on the grounds that this will result in procrastination, I find it difficult to understand why the House should be asked to vote again. However, if that is the wish of the House, that <P>


<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is so. I would strongly advise my noble friends to vote against what is now proposed and re-affirm what they have said only a few moments ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that we can allow the noble Lord to get away with saying that this is a device by the Government. This is nothing to do with the Government; it is the advice of the Clerks at the Table and is reflected in the Chairman's brief. The words are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;to leave out the words last inserted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-07_para1"></a>
As the noble Earl, Lord Russell confirmed, that is entirely in accordance with the procedure of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am astonished. We all know that there are important amendments later on which the House is anxious to reach and vote upon. We have just had a vote which says that widow's benefit should be extended to two years. As the noble Lord just said, it is perfectly true, as I understand it from the Table, strictly within the rules of this House, that it is possible then to put the amendment which states &#147;one year". However, that would be extraordinary when the House clearly indicated, a moment or two ago, that its preference is for two years. However, if the Government are determined to waste time to avoid votes on later amendments, we must put up with that. We will have to make it clear and vote again. If the amendment has been moved and is put to the House, I urge my noble friends to vote, as they did a few moments ago, against this amendment in order to establish what we have already clearly indicated is the will of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, first the House is entitled, if it wishes, to express the view that both one year and two years are preferable to six months, which is at present in the Bill. Secondly, however dissatisfied we may be with procedure, we cannot change it ad hoc to suit the convenience of one amendment. If the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, thinks that the present situation is unsatisfactory--there may be merit in that view--his proper recourse is to recommend this issue for consideration by the Procedure Committee rather than to make an issue of it immediately without notice. I accept that it is no fault of his that there is no notice; the situation has arisen suddenly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may seek guidance as I find this puzzling. As I understand it, Amendment No. 96A, tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;leave out (&#147;26 weeks") and insert (&#147;one year")"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-07_para2"></a>
and Amendment No. 99A states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;leave out (&#147;26 weeks") and insert (&#147;one year")".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-07_para3"></a>
As a result of the Motion just carried by the House, &#147;26 weeks" has disappeared from the text and does not exist any more. Instead of &#147;26 weeks" we have &#147;two years". I cannot see what the amendment is amending.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, surely if an amendment is carried which alters slightly the wording <P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of a subsequent amendment, the normal procedure of the House is to leave out the words previously agreed &#147;and insert". That is exactly what is happening on this occasion. The Chairman must take the amendments in order. We have just voted on Amendment No. 96. The next amendment to vote on is Amendment No. 96A. That is perfectly in accord with the usual procedure and certainly in accord with the briefings that I have received from time to time as a Deputy Chair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I would not question, for one moment, what the noble Baroness says. Clearly, she has vastly more experience in these matters than me. I entirely agree with the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell; the procedure is as it is. In that case we must clearly follow it. I presume that if the noble Baroness wishes to press her amendment to a Division, it will take place but we should be clear that it is against a background where we need to make rapid progress in order to reach other important amendments. However, if the House wishes to vote again, it is right that it should do so. I strongly advise my noble friends to vote against the amendment which the noble Baroness is moving and in favour of the one we have just carried.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I abstained on the last amendment because I did not think that Her Majesty's loyal Opposition were right. On this occasion I shall vote with the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, because I think that she is right. There has been a great deal of fuss over nothing. It is not often that we have a number of alternatives of this sort before the House. However, we are following the correct procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-07_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Crawley: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 51, insert the following new clause--

(&#147; . In section 70 of the Contributions and Benefits Act, at the end there shall be added--<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;(11) The Secretary of State shall issue regulations in respect of persons who cease to be in receipt of Invalid Care Allowance as a result of the death of the person in respect of whose care the allowance has been claimed which shall set the condition for the award to be satisfied for a period of eight weeks from the date on which that person ceased to be in receipt of Invalid Care Allowance."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-08_para4"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I speak on this amendment in place of my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley, who has unfortunately been detained. She is in discussions with the Secretary of State in her role as chair of the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para6"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the payment of invalid care allowance for eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for. At present ICA stops immediately on the death of the cared-for person. This amendment is, I believe, a relatively modest measure. The amendment provides the opportunity to recognise a small but vulnerable group of carers who are bereaved, carers who receive ICA and who look after children or parents who then die. The amendment could help to make the single work-focused gateway operate more sensitively.

<A NAME = "91013-08_para7"></a>If individuals are caring for a spouse who then dies, the new provisions contained within this Bill will mean that they may receive support to help them through their bereavement. However, in the case of carers looking after a child or parent who then dies, there is no such support through bereavement. The trauma is not necessarily any less, as we know. The loss of ICA underlines and emphasises their own personal loss.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para8"></a>There is already a precedent for this suggested addition to the Bill. Carer premium is paid to certain carers who receive income support and is paid for eight <P>


<a name="column_387"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>weeks following the death or the movement into permanent residential care of the person being cared for. This provides a valuable breathing space for those carers. Carer premium is not a benefit in itself but an extra amount of money, worth &#163;13.95, which is paid to a carer receiving income support. In order to receive carer premium, a carer also has to be entitled to ICA or have underlying entitlement to ICA.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para9"></a>If ICA were extended under the similar but more generous rules of carer premium, it would cost around &#163;5 million per year. Invalid care allowance is currently worth &#163;39.95 per week. Although many carers feel that the benefit should far better reflect the amount of support given to relatives, it is, nevertheless, a very valuable benefit. It is the only benefit to recognise that caring has some value. It was introduced because it was recognised that caring had limited the opportunities of the individuals who do that caring; in other words, it is intended for people of working age who give up the opportunity of full-time employment because of their caring responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para10"></a> This small but significant change to the rules governing ICA, together with the other measure that the Government have developed in the national carers' strategy, would, I believe, send a strong message to carers that they are both recognised and valued. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-08_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, this is a good and useful amendment and we on these Benches are happy to support it. There is another precedent; namely, the linking rules on housing benefit introduced in 1993. That draws my attention to one snag which I hope will be avoided in the administration of this amendment. Under the linking rules, housing benefit has to be claimed within eight days, but people are often not told that they need to make a separate claim until the eight days have already elapsed. Therefore, if the amendment is accepted, I hope that the administration will take account of that point. Moreover, while we are about it, I hope that the Minister will look at this defect in the administration of housing benefit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 100 would extend the period of entitlement for all recipients of invalid care allowance to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for and in respect of whose care ICA was being paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para11"></a> I have a great deal of sympathy with the intention behind this amendment, which is to provide an opportunity to recognise a small but vulnerable group of carers who receive ICA for looking after disabled children, parents or others who then die. I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing the attention of the House in this debate to this small but deserving group and equally grateful to my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley for doing so during the Committee stage. <P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They have enabled me to make clear the Government's agenda in this area following publication of the national strategy for carers earlier this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para12"></a>In his preface to that report, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Carers are among the unsung heroes of British life",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-08_para13"></a>
and they,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;should be properly recognised and properly supported"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-08_para14"></a>
a view I wholeheartedly endorse. The national strategy put down a marker of the Government's intention to do this by stating that we would,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;keep under review how financial support for carers--Including Invalid Care Allowance--can best meet [Carers'] needs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-08_para15"></a>
The issue was then immediately underlined by the publication, a few days later, of the report of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care. The Royal Commission suggested that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;the system could do more to offer support for carers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-08_para16"></a>
Clearly, therefore, the Government are committed to taking forward a review of the financial support available to carers. In turn, this work must link across to the proposals that we make in our response to the Royal Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para17"></a>I know that the concern of my noble friend is to secure what is in the best interest of carers. So she will be looking to the Government to indicate that we have in hand specific plans to take forward this assessment of financial support for carers which the carers' strategy explicitly proposed, and the Royal Commission implicitly suggested. I am pleased to be able to give that assurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para18"></a>Our thinking is, as yet, at a very preliminary stage. I am not able to make any promises to my noble friend, or to your Lordships' House, about specific objectives and outcomes. I hope that she will be able to take on trust that we will indeed seek to reflect the best interests of carers. We will of course be consulting the Carers National Association, and other representative groups, about particular proposals. That would be the only appropriate way to ensure that we are promoting the best interests of carers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para19"></a>I turn briefly to the amendment. I emphasise that the group of carers which it seeks to help is small, though none the less deserving of consideration for that. However, I should like to assure your Lordships that there is at least already protection for those whose need is greatest. Carers who receive income support and the carer premium, which is the increase paid specifically for people entitled to ICA, receive an increase to income support and continue to receive the benefit, including the carer premium, for eight weeks after their caring responsibility ends. In addition, during this eight-week period, they are also exempt from the need to be available for and actively seeking employment in order to qualify for income support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-08_para20"></a>Where the death is that of a spouse, bereavement benefits are normally paid within a few days of the claim being made. As such payments take precedence over ICA, a run-on would not be of material assistance to those carers. For those who are most vulnerable and in greatest need, therefore, their income is already <P>


<a name="column_389"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protected despite the loss of ICA on the death of the disabled person for whom they have been caring. This is, however, by way of offering some reassurance to noble Lords on the specific point. It does not alter what I have already said; namely, that the Government are very strongly aware of the need for adequate financial support for carers and are now seeking to take forward their existing commitment in respect of that support, with a view to addressing the concerns of carers in the round. In the light of that, I suggest that it could be difficult to anticipate specific changes at this stage. Therefore, in view of what I have just said, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Crawley: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that response. Carers who have put a great deal of store by this amendment will obviously be disappointed, though I am sure my noble friend realises that. I know that we have had reassurances from my noble friend that there is a commitment to a future programme to meet the challenge of carers in the round in future government legislation. Therefore, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-09_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this group of government amendments makes two main sets of changes. First, the amendments implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on delegated powers, as they relate to Clause 53. Secondly, they clarify that all claimants have the right to launch an appeal against, or ask for a review of, a personal adviser's decision that they have failed to take part in an interview. The amendments also make a minor technical change to support joined-up government within the ONE programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para1"></a>Firstly, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 106 to 111, 258 and 259, which implement the recommendations of the Select Committee. I should like here to offer my thanks to the committee for its positive response to the department's memorandum and for its broad endorsement of our use of delegated powers. I am happy to say here that we have taken on board all the recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 106 to 111 are intended to exclude men and women aged 60 and over from having to take part in compulsory work-focused interviews, either as part of a training process or during the lifetime of an award. I assure your Lordships that it <P>


<a name="column_390"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has never been the Government's intention to require this group of people to have work-focused interviews. Originally we had planned to exempt them through regulations, but we are happy to accept the committee's recommendations and to place this exemption on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para3"></a>As state retirement age gradually equalises over the next two decades, there is likely to be a need to amend the Bill to include all claimants below the age of 65. In the mean time, men and women aged 60 to 65 who do want help to stay in touch with the labour market will still be able to access support through the ONE service. However, this will be available on a purely voluntary basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para4"></a>We are also happy to accept the committee's recommendations for full parliamentary scrutiny of the first set of regulations under this clause, setting out the detail of how the mandatory phase of the ONE service will operate. Amendments Nos. 258 and 259 insert a new paragraph into Schedule 12 of the Bill, amending Section 190 of the Social Security Administration Act. This will ensure that the first set of regulations made under Clause 53 are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para5"></a>Amendment No. 118 seeks to give clearer effect to our policy intention that all claimants should have a right to lodge an appeal against, or to ask for a review of, a personal adviser's decision that they have failed to take part in a work-focused interview. It has been made clear in this House and in another place that where personal advisers make the decision on non-participation the claimant should be able to challenge that decision in line with our new dispute resolution procedures. In other words, claimants should be able to contact the ONE service within one month to examine the reasons behind the personal adviser's decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para6"></a>If an error has been made, the personal adviser, in looking afresh at the case, should be able to correct it. In addition, we have always made clear that the claimant should also have a right of appeal against a personal adviser's decision. Subsection 2B of Clause 53 was intended to give all claimants a right of appeal to a tribunal under Section 12 of the Social Security Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para7"></a>However, the current drafting fails to achieve our stated policy intention. For example, a claimant who received a negative decision from a local authority personal adviser would not be able to access the dispute resolution procedures, and in some circumstances would also be denied a right of appeal. In addition, local authority personal advisers would not be able to revise their own or another decision, even where it was clearly incorrect. The amendment makes absolutely clear our stated intention that dispute resolution procedures and rights of appeal should apply in all cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para8"></a>Amendment No. 262 clarifies that a claimant has a right of appeal against a decision that they have failed to take part in an interview rather than a right of appeal against the consequences of that decision either terminating or reducing a benefit. This makes things simpler for claimants by giving them a single route of appeal which is focused on the key decision that caused <P>


<a name="column_391"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the penalty to be imposed, even where it impacts across a number of benefits and follows a model adopted elsewhere in the benefit system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 151 and 152 make necessary changes to support closer working. They give local authority staff working in the one service the same powers as those possessed by the Employment Service and the Benefits Agency to require JSA claimants to attend for interview. Amendments Nos. 156 and 208 are consequential. Amendments Nos. 274 and 280 provide consequential changes to the commencement and extent provisions of the Bill. I hope that, with this explanation of a large number of amendments we have grouped together for the convenience of your Lordships, your Lordships will accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, although this amendment relates to widow's benefit, it also refers to a rather different aspect. I have given my noble friend the Minister an indication of what I intend to raise. My real purpose is to seek clarification.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para16"></a>Clause 53 sets out the arrangements for work-focused interviews. The recipients of certain listed benefits are to be asked to attend these interviews. Clearly, the intention of the interviews is to get claimants off benefit and into work, but they could result in a loss of benefit. Among the benefits included are widows' benefits, which I take to mean widows' benefits already in payment and not those which are to be put into operation under this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para17"></a>The inclusion of widows' benefits under this heading raises some quite serious issues. When proposals relating to widows were first made public a guarantee was given to the Widows Advisory Trust that women already receiving widows' benefits would not be affected. They would continue to receive their benefits for which contributions had been paid, as before, and they would not be affected by the new legislation. Indeed we have had that assurance repeated today.
<P>


<a name="column_392"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para18"></a>However, as already indicated, widows' benefits under present legislation are paid as of right and on the basis of the contribution record. They are not dependent on means-testing or income received from elsewhere, either from a pension or a job. If existing recipients are being asked to attend for a work-focused interview on pain of losing benefits if they do not attend, this is an alteration in the conditions for receipt of their benefit and it undermines the assurances given by the Government that the benefits will not be affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para19"></a>What happens if a widow, believing that she had assurances that her benefit would not be affected, simply does not attend? She might then find that her benefit will disappear. I hope that such a thing could not be a result of what is said in the Bill. That would be unacceptable, and I would very much welcome the comments of my noble friend. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend has explained, this amendment seeks to exclude widows and widowers from the requirement to participate in a work-focused interview. As with other amendments--I do not think they have been moved and so I will not speak to them now--to exclude certain groups from the provisions of this clause, I have every sympathy with the proposal that has been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para20"></a>We must have regard to individual circumstances in which those who have recently been bereaved find themselves and we must treat them with appropriate respect and compassion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para21"></a>
However, the Government believe that the amendment is not the way to achieve this. A blanket exclusion of all those claiming bereavement benefits does nothing to address the needs of individual claimants. Again, it would deny many people the help and support they may need at a difficult time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para22"></a>As I tried to make clear in Committee the ONE service is not just about jobs, although work for those who can is a central aim. It is about providing an holistic approach to the welfare needs of each claimant based upon their individual circumstances. If those needs are best met by helping individuals move towards the labour market, then that is what will be provided irrespective of the reason for their benefit claim. If they have different needs--such as help in stabilising their financial position or bereavement counselling--then we will provide that help, each person treated according to their personal needs, which is the philosophy behind ONE.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para23"></a>The amendment moved by my noble friend would perpetuate the failing of the current benefits system, which makes broad assumptions about people according to which benefit they claim. This approach does nothing to address the wider welfare needs of individuals or help them to realise their potential. The ONE approach treats people individually, including widows.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para24"></a>We must remember that many widows and widowers choose to work. Many widows and widowers were in work at the time of their <P>


<a name="column_393"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bereavement and they will go back to work very quickly after their bereavement. Others may have given up work to provide care for their spouses and may wish to move back to work quite quickly. Others, particularly those with children, may wish to stay in touch with the labour market to improve their future employment prospects while not seeking to return to work straightaway. Those are three different possibilities. The ONE service will enable people--widows and widowers alike--to receive the help and advice they need by providing tailored assistance through their adviser.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-09_para25"></a>Advisers will, of course, receive full training and guidance to ensure that they are sensitive to the needs of those recently bereaved and to help them deal with clients in an appropriate way. Of course, if an immediate interview is not appropriate in the individual circumstances of any particular claim, the requirement will be deferred and benefits put into payment in the normal way. It may frequently be the outcome where a bereaved client makes a claim to benefit that the interviews are deferred until a later and more appropriate time. I hope that my explanation reassures my noble friend and that, as a result, she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, as we stated very clearly in Committee, we on these Benches welcome the principle of ONE, the single-focus gateway to work. However, we have been talking about the principle. The problem lies in the detail. The amendment therefore again specifically refers to the training of the personal advisers who will conduct the interviews.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para2"></a>As we understand it, the recipients of benefits must turn up to ONE interviews. The interview is extremely important and therefore it is important that those attending the interview fully understand what they are in for and that the interviewer is able to cope with a broad spectrum of recipients. The interviewers' job will be extremely tough. They have a tough timeframe within which to carry out the interview, sometimes as little as an hour. It is important that the personal advisers involved in the interviews really understand some of the sensitivities with which they will be faced in the broadest sense, particularly with regard to the <P>


<a name="column_394"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabled and others who will feel very upset and disturbed by the fact that the interviews are compulsory.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para3"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for forwarding to me a copy of the learning assessment framework; I have read it in detail. It presumes a considerable amount of expertise and knowledge. I appreciate that. In the framework, the accent appears to be--quite rightly in many senses--upon benefits. I understand--the Minister made it absolutely clear in Committee--that the interview is not only about work but also about opportunities for benefits. I am grateful to her for sending me that information. However, we feel strongly that the level of expertise which the advisers will need to retain and develop in a very short space of time is crucial in terms of the ways in which the advisers will be trained. We accept that many of them will not be starting from a nil base; that many of them are already trained to some extent. However, the amendment makes particular reference to those people with mental and physical disabilities; they will need very special treatment and attention during the interviews.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para4"></a>It is important that I give an example. Multiple sclerosis is often completely invisible in a person. If a person with multiple sclerosis is in remission but is put under stress by fear of the compulsory interview, the consequence could be that the stress will trigger off another serious illness. We feel that the more pressure we can apply from this side of the House with regard to the level of expertise and training which is to be carried out, the better.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para5"></a>In Committee, the Minister made clear that during interviews the advisers will be able to call upon other areas of expertise. However, if personal advisers will have ready access to a wide range of support services--the Minister stated that the advisers would not themselves need to be experts but would need to know when to bring them in--and the interview is really one interview, how will the adviser know what kind of expertise to call upon until the interview is taking place? Surely it will be too late then to call in the experts. Perhaps the Minister will be able to advise me in regard to that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para6"></a>Although I have some sympathy with the principle behind Amendment No. 115, which is very similar to Amendment No. 114, it is important that we question the wording of it. It states that the training of personal advisers is,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-10_para7"></a>

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para8"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the best one can realistically hope for from a general person conducting a ONE interview, especially where no warning is given beforehand, is that that person is expert enough to know the limitations of his knowledge. I believe that that is what the noble Baroness was driving at. One of the most difficult tasks in assessing disability is realising what you do not know and backing off. I hope that those who will conduct the interviews will have more success in that field than people have in virtually every other field--medicine, teaching, and so on. I have heard of an enormous number of cases where people have been struggling and have not known whether they should become involved or pass the case on.

It is important to know when not to give advice and to defer rather than give bad advice. That is the crucial thrust behind the noble Baroness's amendment and underlies everyone's concerns about the interview. In Committee, the noble Baroness gave a considerable amount of assurance about the amount of training that would be available. I doubt whether she will ever be able to provide enough training to be able to handle these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para10"></a>A point was raised as to whether the ONE interviews could be extended. I assumed that they could be. I assumed that the one-stop interview was merely a starting-point--and, it is to be hoped, the finish in the majority of cases. The option of an interview is in the structure and I hope that it can be used.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para11"></a>Those who have mental health problems, almost by definition, have the greatest degree of difficulty as regards their perception of their own case. All the problems that we have previously referred to are magnified. Someone who suffers, for example, from severe depression is incapable of taking a clear look at his or her situation, even when confronted with the necessary information. Surely, it must be necessary to involve someone with expertise. That is why I have added my name to Amendment No. 115. If the wording is not correct, I am happy to accept that. The point is that some real expertise should be found.

<A NAME = "91013-10_para12"></a>I know that the noble Baroness wants this provision to work well, as do we all. But the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In certain pieces of government legislation such wishes have led us at least as far as purgatory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williamson of Horton:  </B>  My Lords, we are dealing with matters for which the regulations &#147;may" make provision, that is to say, the draftsmen have an element of discretion. However, it is reasonable to indicate on the face of the Bill the issues which, as legislators, we regard as important. That is why I support Amendment No. 114. The role of the person who conducts the interview is extremely important. If the interview goes wrong, there could be serious difficulties. It would be wise to refer to that element of training in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para13"></a>It should be particularly borne in mind that the percentage of those with mental illness who are in work is substantially less than it is for those with other forms of disablement. I believe it is about 12 per cent of those with severe mental problems. The present reforms may make possible an improvement in that figure. So the present reforms are a move in the right direction. However, we need properly qualified interviewers in order to maximise the chances of a good result. Therefore, I support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we discussed the first of these amendments at an earlier stage. I was then able to offer some assurances to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. I have subsequently provided her with additional information.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para14"></a>The aim of the training, as I made clear in Committee, is to create a group of people able to support and advise clients with a very wide range of needs. An extensive training programme is therefore essential. However, this programme needs to recognise both the skills that many staff will bring to their new posts and the range of additional, specialist support to which personal advisers can have access where that is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para15"></a>Although we recognise that the quality of the training is crucial to making the ONE pilots work, we cannot accept this amendment. Identifying only three or four, albeit important, subjects in legislation, and requiring all personal advisers to be trained in those areas, would reduce the flexibility we need to give every member of staff appropriate training. In addition, we consider it essential that all ONE staff, not merely the personal advisers, are allowed access to the same high-quality training packages.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para16"></a>I appreciate that this is, in part, a probing amendment on what is clearly a very important subject. I should therefore like to reassure the noble Baroness as to the importance that we place on providing suitable training for ONE staff. As I made clear in Committee, the average member of staff working for ONE will carry out well over 200 hours of learning before taking up his or her post. That equates <P>


<a name="column_397"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to nearly seven weeks. In addition, all advisers will be required to work towards a professional qualification in advice and guidance, at least to NVQ standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para17"></a>Some of the training will focus on enabling staff to provide good-quality benefit advice; other aspects will cover the administrative processes that staff need to undertake. However, we have recognised the clear need to ensure that staff are given adequate training and support in handling a wider range of clients than they currently see and for a wider range of work and welfare related issues. That means appropriate learning opportunities for staff to ensure that they can give client groups with special needs a high-quality, sensitive service.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para18"></a>The help that key voluntary organisations have given to our officials has been invaluable in that respect. As I mentioned in Committee, we have developed training in the needs of special client groups in association with organisations such as MIND, the National Schizophrenic Fellowship, Scope, Mencap, Gingerbread and the Carers' National Association. I had intended to give further details of what we are doing to help to take account of the needs of people with mental illnesses. As that amendment, which I thought was important, was not moved, I have not been able to set out our proposals. All of the organisations involved have spoken to ONE staff at training events and have provided extremely useful background information on the needs of the groups they represent and what the ONE service needs to give them if it is to prove effective. That knowledge has been incorporated into an on-line information system, which all personal advisers will be able to use in the course of their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para19"></a>All ONE staff without thorough knowledge of disability issues are being required to undertake a disability awareness course as an essential part of their training. The course is now being thoroughly updated, both to take on board the additional information that has been made available to us and to build on the best of the existing training material used by the Employment Service to train disability employment advisers. Again, we will ask organisations that represent people with disabilities and mental health problems for their views, to ensure that we are providing staff with appropriate and helpful material.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para20"></a>I hope that that has reassured your Lordships that we are treating the issue of training extremely seriously. We are investing considerable money and effort to offer training that will enable ONE staff to provide a high-quality service, focusing on both the employment and the welfare needs of clients.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para21"></a>I do not believe that these amendments will allow us the flexibility to respond to individual training needs. In the light of that, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, will not pursue her amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, was right when he said that, however much we invest in training, disability, particularly mental health disability, can be such a complex area that we cannot hope to achieve the necessary skills, even with the extensive training that is proposed. In particular, staff may not know the range <P>


<a name="column_398"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of problems until the ONE interview takes place, and by then those with appropriate skills--including those who can offer advocacy help--may not be at hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para23"></a>There will, in fact, be two interviews. There will be the start-up interview, in which basic information is taken. It is hoped that the major ONE interview will then be arranged within a couple of days of that. If the disability emerges, as it should normally do--I accept that it will not do so in all circumstances--at the start-up interview, staff will ensure that those with the most appropriate skills will be available at the second interview. If such people are not available, the interview can be deferred either at the convenience of the person being interviewed or in order to make sure that appropriate help is available. I fully accept that only a consultant in certain areas of medicine could have the full range of knowledge. But we are doing our best to ensure the opportunity, first, to train and provide skills to staff and, secondly, to ensure that those trained and skilled staff are available to help those with particular disabilities and special needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-10_para24"></a>I shall be happy to write to noble Lords on the issue because I have not had the opportunity to give much of the information I was going to give the House and I am sure that noble Lords would wish to have it.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, the point I was trying to make is that I appreciate that the Minister is trying to deal with this through regulation. However, the problem is that we may not know what we are dealing with at any point in the process. Do the staff have the power or the authority to be able to stop the process dead if they feel they do not have the expertise? That is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para0"></a>I did not move the amendment standing in my name because I thought that this amendment would cover the matter. I did not want to go over the same ground twice. However, if the noble Baroness will write to me with the information, I shall pass it on to those whom I shall consult on the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, if the interview is inappropriate because of mental health or learning or language difficulties, the full interview can be postponed. That is on the assumption that the problems emerge quickly. In the normal course of events I would expect most of the issues to emerge at the start-up interview. If someone has severe learning difficulties and cannot write or read, if they have language problems or are from an ethnic minority, that also would emerge. If they have other disabilities, it will become clear. At the major follow-up interview, those resources would be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para1"></a>If that was not the case and it was clear that the interview needed to be postponed, deferred or taken in two stages, that is possible. It would include having an interview in the person's home and whatever else is most appropriate. We wish to ensure that all people coming through the ONE service have the opportunity to engage with a skilled and appropriate personal adviser who can take them through the range of <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, following this discussion, can the Minister clarify one point? We talked at great length about the location of the interview at Committee stage and I do not wish to be repetitive this afternoon. However, I wish to confirm a point with the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para5"></a>In relation to location, we said at Committee stage that in cases of severe disability or mental illness, home is not necessarily the place for the interview, although we appreciate that the Minister and others seek to be as flexible as possible over the location. We stress that we believe that for many the home can be invasive and make people feel awkward when the so-called experts are at hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para6"></a>In relation to the start-up interview and the major interview, can the Minister reassure us that if the adviser decides at the start-up interview stage that the personal adviser would value additional skills and expertise at the major interview, the personal adviser would explain carefully to the recipient that they could have a choice of either having the second interview in the home or at an alternative location. While the home might be the better alternative for the disabled at the first stage, with one person visiting them in the home, if it is decided thereafter that several people should visit them and therefore there would be a crowd going into the home, it might be better if it is held elsewhere. The adviser could suggest alternative locations. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, this is a sensible point and I hope the Minister will consider it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has identified a problem. If one is trying to make a home visit to suit the convenience of the client because that client may have a range of disabilities, and if as a result a whole range of skills is needed, there may be many people going to one house, as opposed to one person going there. There are considerations of convenience such as administrative arrangements, costs and the like.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para7"></a>I have tried to emphasise that we seek to ensure that the ONE delivery sites would be relaxed and friendly environments where all clients would feel at ease. They will also meet the needs of disabled people on access and facilities. In addition, sites currently in use in the pilot areas were selected to minimise the likelihood of ONE clients having to travel further than 45 minutes to their local office. On the whole I would expect the ONE delivery site or office to be seen as the most appropriate place for an interview.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para8"></a>If that is not the case--and we recognise that in certain circumstances it will not be--there will be other options such as phoning, mobile facilities or providing a home visit. So, for example, where a person's mobility problems prevent them getting to a ONE office, the personal adviser may visit the claimant and conduct the interview in their home. There has never been any suggestion otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para9"></a>I understand that noble Lords have concerns that personal advisers carrying out home visits might not have the benefit of the combined expertise of the rest of the ONE team. It is a dilemma for us. I agree that it is important to see the ONE service as a team effort, particularly to ensure that advisers consult colleagues when it is clear that a situation calls for knowledge outside their sphere of experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para10"></a>Having said that, I think it is equally important to emphasise the ability of trained personal advisers to provide for most, if not all, the immediate needs of clients during a home visit. The information given during the start-up interview should provide the basis for determining which personal adviser is best qualified to deal with the needs of a specific client who requires a home visit. Equally, we should not see the initial personal adviser interview in isolation. It should be viewed as part of an ongoing relationship between adviser and client. I believe it is acceptable for a personal adviser, during the course of a home visit or an on-site interview, to take away unresolved issues with a view to dealing with them more thoroughly, after consultation with colleagues and then come back.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-11_para11"></a>We are trying to ascertain how best to negotiate the issue that the noble Baroness identified. On the one hand, we do not want the house full of a range of possible people, but on the other we wish to ensure that we can offer the facility, where appropriate, in the client's home. I hope that with that description noble Lords are reassured by what I have said and will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-12_para20"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, a key principle behind the creation of employment zones is to allow pooling of the various funding streams currently available to help long-term unemployed people. Obviously, that is the point of Amendments Nos. 129 and 130. These include funds for training, jobsearch and the equivalent of JSA. One effect of pooling these funding streams is that they cease to be separately identifiable and no longer need to be earmarked for a specific purpose. For example, money which was originally destined to support training can be used for any purpose within employment zones. It is straightforward to pool the funding in England. Training money is being set aside from the work-based learning for adults budget, which is already held by DfEE, and there will also be a transfer made from employment service programmes into the employment zone pot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para21"></a>This is more difficult for employment zones in Wales. The clause in the Bill which establishes employment zones is a social security measure and social security is not a matter transferred to the National Assembly for Wales. Nor is it intended that the provision should change this principle. The power to fund training for work, however, is devolved to the National Assembly for Wales (concurrently with Ministers of the Crown) and it holds the funding for this in its block grant. We intend that this should continue to be the case. In the absence of a legislative provision the Assembly does not have the power to fund employment zones. Without this amendment, the money which it holds for training could not be used for employment zones in Wales.

<A NAME = "91013-12_para22"></a>Amendment No. 129 would ensure that the National Assembly for Wales could make payments to those running employment zones in Wales without changing the devolution arrangements for training for work, jobsearch and social security, and without restricting the use of such payments to the provision of training. It is not intended that this provision should broaden the Assembly's role in relation to jobsearch or other non-transferred matters.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para26"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 131 I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 132 and 133. This Government have an outstanding record of help for disabled people, but this clause is one of the few blots on that record. I hope that this debate will help to remove that blot. I am strongly opposed to Clause 58 because it will create hardship and suffering to 170,000 future disabled people by depriving them of their incapacity benefit if they have been unable to work in the two years before claiming.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para27"></a>I speak not only of disabled people but of severely disabled people--not those with a sick note from a friendly GP but people who are certified by the strict Benefits Agency doctors as being too incapacitated to work. These people of working age are so severely disabled that they have no realistic prospects of enhancing their lifestyle. Most of them are poor which, in most cases, is a concomitant of severe disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para28"></a>The clause does not affect present claimants, but that is no comfort to the 170,000 who will be hit. Their crime is to commit the cardinal sin of being unable to get a job in the two years preceding their claim. The Government are barging ahead with this ham-fisted penalty as if we live in Shangri-La where everyone can get a job if they want one. Everyone else knows that that is hopelessly unrealistic. There are prosperous areas but there are also depressed areas where few, if any, jobs are available. Why should severely disabled people in those areas be treated unfavourably compared with their counterparts in better areas? Why should they lose the valuable &#163;66 a week incapacity benefit through no fault of their own? Where is the justice in that? Disabled people who are poor will find this a stunning blow.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para29"></a>Just as serious, unreasonable and unfair is that the Government's proposal will deny incapacity benefit to people, no matter how severely disabled, who may have paid national insurance contributions for 20 or <P>


<a name="column_405"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>30 years. This is a clear and unambiguous moral contract between the Government and people who are paying. They have paid trustingly and in good faith on the legitimate assumption that if they become disabled they will get what they have paid for. That is a very simple, honest and reasonable proposition. But now the Government tell them, without so much as a murmured apology, that they have moved the goalposts. They say it is too bad that these people could not get a job, too bad that they have paid contributions for all those years and that they now need the money. They are refusing even a penny of incapacity benefit if they have not worked in the preceding two years--end of discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para30"></a>There are various theories about wanting to relate benefits to recent work and wanting to help very poor disabled people and modernise the system. They are all fine, high-sounding principles, and I agree with many of them. But none of them can justify the blatant unfairness, breach of moral contract and cheating of future disabled people of their right to incapacity benefit. The House should reject completely the implicit policy that poor disabled people should be forced to pay for very poor disabled people. That is the job of wealthy people or the general taxpayer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para31"></a>I repeat. I am strongly opposed in principle to Clause 58. However, I recognise that the Government have a massive majority in another place and would seek to overturn any decision made by this House. They may or may not succeed, but it is likely that at some point, being politically realistic, a compromise would have to be reached if the Bill is to be saved.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para32"></a>In the hope of reaching an honourable and reasonable compromise sooner rather than later, I have put forward Amendments Nos. 131 and 132. I hope that the Government will accept them because the last thing we want is ping-pong between the two Houses, which would hardly be dignified or edifying--but it may come to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para33"></a>I have no doubt that the clause should be dropped, but in an effort to bridge the massive gap between the needs of disabled people and the Government, it is proposed in Amendment No. 131 that the period should be seven rather than two years. That figure is as arbitrary as the Government's figure, but it is much more reasonable and fairer. Although the Government believe that this benefit should be related to recent work, I believe that it should go to those who have shown a commitment to work. Therefore, I am proposing the additional provision in Amendment No. 132 that people should qualify if they have worked and paid contributions for ten years at any time in their working life. A commitment to the world of work and the national insurance principle for such people cannot be disputed. That commitment should be recognised by giving them entitlement to incapacity benefit should they become severely disabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-12_para34"></a>I hope that the Government will accept the amendments because it is a reasonable, reasoned and honourable compromise; it is also a benchmark.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, being in two minds is not a comfortable position to be in, and I am in two minds in relation to this clause. I have signed my name in full support of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley which propose an extension of the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit to ensure that more people who have contributed during their working lives will be entitled to the benefit. I believe this to be a laudable approach that is consistent with the Government's overall strategy of reform, but which nonetheless offsets some of the harsher consequences of the change in policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para0"></a>However, I suspect, as we have just heard, that in the context of this debate there will be no third way. I believe we will be asked to vote for polar opposites: either support the clause as originally proposed, or support a wholesale rejection of it. If my suspicions turn out to be correct, then, with great reluctance, I would be unable to vote in favour of the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para1"></a>Testing the opinion of the House in this manner seems to be something of a missed opportunity. It is unfortunate that the Government have failed to table a compromise amendment which could lend credence at this stage. I urge them to do so at the earliest opportunity, and in so doing to consider seriously the suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para2"></a>I fear that as the Bill progresses the political strategy may begin to overshadow the substantive concerns of the debate. I therefore urge all noble Lords and those in the other place to focus their minds on the impact of these changes on disabled people rather than on what transpires as political victory in the latter stages of this parliamentary timetable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-13_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, has hit the nail on the head. Clause 58 is objectionable because it penalises people for things which are not their fault.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para3"></a>Between two people, both of whom have actively sought work with equal determination, one will be eligible for incapacity benefit having been successful and one will be ineligible as a result of being unsuccessful. The race is not always to the swift if they are not running over an equal course.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para4"></a>We on these Benches think that that is wrong, and that is why we agree so entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, about the clause. We do not regard his amendments as being a satisfactory compromise. I agree with him that there always has to be compromise. Normally, it is true that half a loaf is better than no bread, but there are possible exceptions to that principle, as, for example, when the bread has ergot and is poisonous to eat. We think that that is the case here.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para5"></a>We are familiar in this House with the concept of salami-slicing. Were I the Treasury, I would be making contingency plans at this moment to accept the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, this year and then to take another salami slice off it next year and another salami slice the year after that and so on--I will not add the words &#147;ad infinitum" because there is not an infinite amount of money to take, but for quite a long time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para6"></a>For that reason I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, will not press the amendments but will press the clause that should not stand part.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para7"></a>One of the ways in which the Bill penalises people for things which are not their fault is that it is geographically discriminatory. There are some areas where we are happily approaching full employment. In Newbury we have an unemployment rate of 1.1 per cent. My honourable friend Mr Rendel happens to be Member for Newbury, but he does know that Newbury is not the whole country. There are many other areas where the unemployment rate is 10 per cent, and sometimes more. In those areas the impact will be very much harsher. I do not see any good reason why it should be easier to get incapacity benefit in Newbury than in Newcastle, easier in Hampstead than in Hartlepool, and easier in Crawley than in Chorley. That seems to me to be an injustice.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para8"></a>It is not only geographical area which makes it harder for some people to get work than others. It is a very clear fact that it is much harder to get work if you are black. The rate of youth unemployment under 25 nationwide is 18 per cent. That is a Labour Force Survey measurement which I think is reasonably reliable. For black men under 25 nationwide the rate is 51 per cent; for black men under 25 in the Greater London area the rate is 62 per cent. So clearly the impact of this clause between black and white will be severely discriminatory. It will be discriminatory between those who have lost work, both under 45 and over 45.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para9"></a>I have already mentioned the lack of any satisfactory legislation against age discrimination and employment. In many areas and in many fields of work, if you lose a job over the age of 45 you have very little chance of getting another. If you thereafter fall ill, as has been known to happen, your chances of getting incapacity benefit drop by the year. I do not see any reason for saying that is fair. It works harshly against those whose disabling condition was weakening their capacity to work before they were diagnosed as eligible for incapacity benefit. Back pain and depression are two very common conditions to which that applies. It is not only that it is discriminatory; it is also that those against whom it is discriminatory are most likely to suffer limiting long-term illness and need to apply for incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para10"></a>I take my evidence from a source that I am sure is familiar to the Minister, DSS Research Report No. 94. It shows that the incidence of severe disability varies very much indeed across the country. Indeed, the rate in Wales is as much as twice the rate in the south-east. There is a clear correlation between the poverty and disadvantage of an area and the amount of illness and disability which is found in it. For example, in <P>


<a name="column_408"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Glasgow Easterhouse 18.3 per cent of the population have a limiting long term illness which hinders their capacity to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para11"></a>The interesting argument is this. Which is the hen and which is the egg? Government--I say &#147;government" because it is equally true of the last government in 1993-94 and of this--assume that people claiming incapacity benefit after unemployment use it as a form of early retirement. I have never seen one shred of evidence for that assumption. But there is a large amount of evidence, some of it very powerful and not simply resting on correlation, that unemployment has a negative medical effect and leads to illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para12"></a>The most persuasive presentation of this view that I have seen was in a book by Jane Mattinson published by the Tavistock Institute for Marital Studies. It demonstrated bit by bit in individual case studies the deterioration of the state of mind, followed by limited resistance, followed by mild illness, followed by serious illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para13"></a>I refer to another specific case: the closure of the Harris bacon factory in Calne. That led to a massive increase in illness in Calne. It came immediately after the closure and was documented in each individual case and often consisted of physical symptoms about which there could be no argument. We still have to answer this question: why are so many more people found to be disabled than used to be? The DSS Research Report No. 94 found that a great many more people were found disabled than in its previous survey. But it concluded that almost all of them would have been found disabled by the criteria of previous surveys. So it is not that the criteria are being used more loosely. It is more a matter of disability coming out of the closet: being prepared to avow itself; not hiding away and refusing to admit. It is also probably the result of the highest levels of unemployment we have seen in this country since the 1930s. When we ask, &#147;Which is cart and which is horse?", I believe that it is the unemployment that leads to the disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para14"></a>The people concerned are being doubly punished by this clause. Its philosophy is this: &#147;To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away even that that he has". It is not the policy of this party. I did not think that it was the policy of the Labour Party either.

<A NAME = "91013-13_para15"></a>My noble friend describes himself as a lifelong Labour loyalist. I ask anyone who questions the truth of that to point to the last occasion in my noble friend's 33 years in Parliament on which he voted against a legislative proposal by a Labour Government.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para16"></a>I hope that we and other Labour Peers who cannot accept the clause without radical change will today be spared any homilies on the iniquity of disloyalty. In truth we feel more sinned against than sinning. For where in our general election manifesto was there even the vaguest suggestion that 170,000 people who now qualify for invalidity benefit would be denied it altogether? Who among us even hinted to the electorate that vulnerable people with a progressive illness like multiple sclerosis would lose their invalidity benefit even though they had contributed for it from their earnings week by week for 30 years? And how do I reply to the woman who wrote to me last Thursday from Huntingdon to say:

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para18"></a>No wonder my good and right honourable friend Tom Clarke, who led for Labour in explaining our policy for disabled people at the general election, felt bound to speak and vote against this clause in the Commons. His speech kept faith impeccably with what he told the electorate on our behalf.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para19"></a>No convincing case has been made for the proposal since it was unveiled last October. Labour Ministers rightly condemned the Major government for their encouragement of unjustified invalidity benefit claims from unemployed people to cut their ever-lengthening dole queue. But the proposals now before Parliament do not dispossess those who allegedly ought not to have the benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para20"></a>Instead they pile handicap upon handicap for many thousands of severely disabled people who, having paid national insurance for a contributory benefit in good faith over many years while in work, will lose the help for which they insured themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para21"></a>Their resentment is compounded by media suggestions that the proposals are justified by massive fraud in the disability benefits system. Those suggestions persist and are repeated in public debate notwithstanding the conclusive proof of their dishonesty given to your Lordships' House--with all her customary candour and decency--by my noble friend Lady Hollis. As long ago as 15th January 1998, she made it crystal clear that suggestions of massive fraud were,

<A NAME = "91013-13_para24"></a>What my noble friend's statement to this House demonstrates is that to accuse disabled people of abusing the benefits system is to bark not just up the wrong tree but in the wrong forest. The real story is not that disabled people are abusing the system, but that the system is abusing them. For while the cruise <P>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 410</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>missile can now be successfully targeted at a telephone booth in another country, we still seem unable to deliver their statutory entitlements to disabled people in this country. And without them they are left doubly disabled and often in double despair. Yet between &#163;5 billion and &#163;6 billion a year in benefits go unclaimed by the disabled people entitled to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para25"></a>A reason often given by disabled people for not claiming their entitlements is fear of being branded as what some commentators call one of the &#147;something-for-nothing merchants". The same reason is given by frail elderly people, more especially single women living alone, for underclaiming &#163;2 billion a year in income support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para26"></a>Like those who speak for them in this House, disabled people want the Government to be tough on fraud and tough on the causes of fraud, not least when it is caused by administrative incompetence and corrupt private landlords. They point out that failure to tackle low take-up of benefits frustrates the will of Parliament. They are not resistant to change. For there are many reforms disabled people want to see. They are deeply appreciative, as I am, of the helpful new steps the Government have taken and will be taking and want the Government to succeed. But for that to happen Whitehall and Westminster must get the facts straight. And benefits for disabled people should be commended to the taxpayer not as acts of compassion but of enlightened self-interest and moral right. Our preoccupation should be with value as well as cost. And disabled people should be seen as givers, not only as receivers. For there are marked cost savings in humanely assisting them to achieve their potential as full and fully participating members of British society.

<A NAME="91013-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, anyone who participates in a debate on the disabled opened by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, the noble Earl, Lord Russell and the noble Lord, Lord Morris, must do so with very considerable diffidence. But the measure which the Government have included in this clause is fundamentally wrong in principle. In particular it is a further step in the undermining of the contributory principle. If this clause is not amended it seeks to restrict incapacity benefit for those who have only recently been in work and paying contributions. But all the evidence that one receives from outside bodies shows that vulnerable people such as the unemployed, people with progressive illness such as multiple sclerosis and so forth, would lose benefit even though they may have contributed for 30 years. Therefore, I believe that this clause is completely wrong and that it is right to oppose it. It is entirely understandable that it should have been opposed in all parts of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para27"></a>There are those who will say that there are reasons for taking action on incapacity benefit. There was the argument that under the previous government people received incapacity benefit more than was justified in order to take early retirement. That argument is invalid on two grounds. The first is that they were <P>


<a name="column_411"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to severe inspection as to entitlement. In any event, the clause will only affect future claimants who have contributed and therefore it cannot have anything to do with what has happened in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para28"></a>The reality is that the clause should be opposed in toto. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, has tabled other amendments by way of compromise. I do not take the view that this is a matter on which there can be reasonable compromise. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred to half a loaf being better than no bread. But the people who have contributed to the benefit will not receive half a loaf. Unless they have contributed in the previous two years, under these restrictions they will get nothing whatever. That is quite wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para29"></a>Many of the points that I wished to make have already been made. There is one other point. This matter is set against a background of events a couple of weeks ago when there was a large publicity campaign as to what the Government are doing on welfare issues. However, the reality of what they are doing now is contained in this clause, the one which follows and in Clause 61. All three severely endanger disabled people. It is wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-13_para30"></a>Therefore, I cannot go along with the compromise amendments which have been put forward. I very much hope that the House will ask the Commons to think again on this issue and accept the amendment which asks that the clause be deleted. In principle I believe that that is the right thing to do on this occasion.

I shall address my remarks to Amendment No. 133. The debate was begun with clarity by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, as one would expect. When this matter arose in Committee the Government claimed that the Beveridge proposals were linked to recent work and that that was the reason why they were now making it difficult for people who have been unable to make contributions to national insurance for two years.

<A NAME = "91013-14_para1"></a>There is a geographical consideration to which the noble Earl, Lord Russell, made reference; namely, that there are parts of the country where it is exceedingly difficult to find work, particularly for a disabled person. Of course, it is much easier to find work in other parts of the country. That situation makes the clause objectionable.

<A NAME = "91013-14_para2"></a>There are two other considerations. As they grow older, some disabled people become more infirm but they try to stay in work. They should be congratulated on that. But it has to be part-time or low paid work. That means that when they retire altogether they will not have made recent contributions to national insurance and not enough to meet the requirements contained in this clause.

<A NAME = "91013-14_para3"></a>The other point is fraud. The noble Lord, Lord Morris, touched on that. It is clear that there is very little fraud in the disabled sector. Most of the fraud connected with benefits is concerned with able-bodied people, employment and housing benefit. It is not concerned with the disabled. That has been confirmed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, in this House on previous occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para4"></a>One of the troubles was a misunderstanding caused by an article in The Times of 15th January last year by the Prime Minister. It has been quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Morris, and I shall point it out again. There were two consecutive sentences in the article. The first was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;We spend more on disability and incapacity benefit than we do on the entire schools system".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-14_para5"></a>
The next sentence was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Benefit fraud, estimated at &#163;4 billion a year, is enough to build 100 new hospitals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-14_para6"></a>
That is a non sequitur. The first sentence refers to disability benefits whereas the second refers to all welfare benefits put together. The noble Baroness knows that we on this side of the House are in favour of trying to reform the system. However, there is not much to reform as regards fraud and the disabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para7"></a>When the noble Baroness replied at Committee stage she referred to &#147;recent work" being envisaged in the Beveridge proposals. That did not completely answer the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, concerning the intentions of the 1948 legislation. I remember that time very well. I was working in Whitehall from 1946 to 1949. I remember the legislation being prepared on the Beveridge Report which mainly introduced the new national insurance system. I was not in the department in Whitehall which was primarily involved, but friends and contemporaries of mine were. Whitehall was very small at that time and most of us had been in the Armed Forces during the war. We were in touch with each other and we were interested in what was being done.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para8"></a>From that experience I disagree with the noble Baroness who said in Committee on 13th July of this year, at col. 313 of Hansard, that Beveridge did not anticipate long-term unemployment. Of course he hoped that his national insurance system would prevent it. However, the whole basis and purpose of his proposals were to avoid the severe unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s. That was what inspired him to come forward with his proposals. The benefits then proposed anticipated loss of work and being able to help people when that happened. But the proposals were not hidebound as has been suggested. I trust that the Government will reconsider Clause 58 very seriously. If not, I shall oppose it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, I do not doubt for one minute the sincerity expressed by both my noble friends Lord Ashley and Lord Morris on this matter. I do not doubt the sincerity expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, but I do want to test the depth of sincerity of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and that of Members on his Benches.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para9"></a>Only last week in Blackpool David Willetts, the Opposition spokesman for social security, said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Labour's failure on welfare is first and foremost a catastrophic failure of financial control. That is why the first Conservative pledge I give this conference is that we will cut social security spending as a proportion of our national income. We did it before; we can do it again; we will do it again".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-14_para10"></a>
But the facts are these. The Tory Government increased welfare spending by 90 per cent in real terms when they were in office, despite making cuts in benefit entitlement. The reason for the increase is that mass unemployment resulted during their period in office. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, might say, as he did, that it is a question of entitlement because of contribution; but that did not seem to be the philosophy in 1986 when the Conservatives were cutting SERPS for widows--which would have occurred next year if we had not altered the situation on Monday this week.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para11"></a>If David Willetts is right--and he is the Conservative Party's official spokesperson--I ask the party opposite how it justifies the enormous cost which will result, contrary to his view, from the amendments which it is tabling to the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-14_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, I do not propose to become involved in a discussion about the hypothetical views of Sir William Beveridge, although I worked with him for three years as his personal assistant when he was drawing up the main report some years before our much esteemed Prime Minister was born.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para12"></a>For over half a century, I voted loyally for the Labour Party whether they were in government or opposition, with a few exceptions. I often have to come along nowadays and ask, &#147;which is the Labour Lobby"? I usually follow along obsequiously. But this time I am afraid that is not quite the case. In my eyes, my noble friend Lord Morris is unlikely to be wrong. Nor for that matter is the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, whom I of course much admire. I had the honour of carrying Alf Morris's famous Bill through this House nearly 30 years ago, and I have never yet found him to be wrong. If anyone should ask me whether I believe he knows more than the present Government, or any government, about the disabled, the answer is yes, I believe that he does. So I am afraid that I shall vote for the amendment of my noble friend Lord Morris.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-14_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Buccleuch: </B>   My Lords, I should first declare an interest inasmuch as I am a recipient of disablement allowances of various kinds. I am also president of RADAR, and previously its chairman, and so I have been much involved in what has been going on behind the scenes in negotiations. I am saddened that the Minister in the other place in charge of the Bill is the Member of Parliament for my former constituency--what was Edinburgh North. Had I produced a measure such as this in my day I would have been literally savaged by my constituents.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para13"></a>We have gone so far down this road, and now, looking at these three amendments, I have great sympathy for the first two of them: to try to find a <P>


<a name="column_414"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>compromise, if it is possible to do so, on the very practical grounds that when the Bill goes back to the other place, if we simply delete this clause it will be reinstated; whereas if it goes back amended, there is some possibility that those sensible people in the other House will agree that those changes are better than nothing. Therefore I greatly hope that it will be possible to test the opinion of the House on the first two amendments before deleting the clause altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_time0"></A><H5>6.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the proposals contained in this clause have been debated thoroughly and I understand the issues expressed so eloquently by my noble friends--and they are my noble friends; it is not just a formality, but sincerely meant--Lord Ashley and Lord Morris. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State and I respond to the spirit of co-operation in which my noble friend has put forward various amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para14"></a>However, the Government believe that their proposals are right. We remain convinced that a proposal for a contribution test based broadly on the two most recent tax years is largely right, although obviously--this has been made clear--my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in the other House is reflecting, both in the light of your Lordships' discussion and that elsewhere, on whether the two most recent tax years is the most appropriate figure. My noble friend's suggestion of a test which requires either contributions in one of the last seven years or 10 years' contributions in total would largely perpetuate the current position whereby incapacity benefit goes disproportionately to people who were previously unemployed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para15"></a>As has been said tonight, and it is perhaps worth repeating, no one currently on incapacity benefit is affected. We are talking about future claimants only. It would be wrong to take away benefit from existing claimants, where they satisfy the other entitlement conditions, but we do not believe it right that incapacity benefit should become a means of alleviating the effects of long-term unemployment. The right way to tackle unemployment is through our welfare-to-work programme, not through incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para16"></a>As my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity pointed out, the previous government were content to let thousands of people, men in particular, drift from unemployment to incapacity benefit and stay there until they retired. Not surprisingly--and I do not blame those people at all--many older people turned to IB as a more generous benefit, and perhaps somehow as a more &#147;respectable" benefit than unemployment benefit. The then government colluded in order to massage their unemployment figures by switching people onto &#147;the sick". We all know it. Never again. In many parts of the country a whole generation was written off by the previous government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para17"></a>The Chancellor has made a statement to which I believe Beveridge would certainly have responded. He said that he is expecting and hoping for the prospect of <P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a return to full employment and that that it is within our grasp. But if we are going to help people realise their full potential, as well as giving them support through the New Deal and the ONE service, it is essential that we are clear about the role of benefits such as incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord Morris raised the point about fraud. I say that this is not about fraud at all. I entirely accept his statements. I have never said that this provision was about fraud and I have never said that BIP was about fraud. He has been generous on many occasions to acknowledge that. The exercise of BIP (the benefit integrity project) showed that there was no confirmed evidence of fraud. I was delighted to be able to tell the House so on several occasions. However, it showed that quite a significant percentage of people--between 15 and 20 per cent or thereabouts--were actually on the wrong level of benefit. That was usually, I am glad to say, because they had got better, but they continued to claim an incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para19"></a>Those are precisely the people whom the Government seek to help; those on, say, incapacity benefit who have got better, or those on DLA who want to, are entitled to and able to work. We want to encourage those people into the labour market, not to ask them to hold onto a benefit when the need for that benefit and the basis for their entitlement to it has passed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para20"></a>What is the function of incapacity benefit? Incapacity benefit is supposed to provide a measure of earnings replacement for people who have had to stop work because of sickness or disability. It replaces to a degree the wages lost from work. That was the original intention. I know that many noble Lords may not accept that point, but it is long standing. I defer on this to the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, and to that of my noble friend Lord Longford. But we have had this checked and it is clear when one looks at what Beveridge was doing, from the start of the National Insurance Fund in 1948, the conditions of entitlement to sickness benefit included a requirement that contributions had been paid or credited in the most recent year. That was Beveridge's stipulation in 1948.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para21"></a>But the purpose of the original sickness benefit, which in time became invalidity benefit, which in time became incapacity benefit, was to require that contributions had been paid or credited in the most recent year. In other words, it was a benefit for those in work who had lost their work through sickness and disability in that year or the year before and, as a result, needed a benefit of support to replace their earnings. That was introduced by Beveridge. That requirement evolved over the years until in 1988 the previous Conservative government introduced the current second contribution condition for both sickness and unemployment benefit, which requires contributions or credits in both the last two years. That condition was carried forward unchanged by the previous government when sickness benefit was replaced by incapacity benefit in 1995.
<P>


<a name="column_416"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para22"></a>I might add that when the second contribution condition was debated in 1987 the then junior Minister, Mr Portillo, said unequivocally about sickness and unemployment benefit:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Both benefits are designed for people who have been in work and they have been so designed since 1948".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-14_para23"></a>
Therefore, there has always been an understanding, an acceptance and an intention that IB was an earnings-replacement benefit for people recently in work who fell out of work through sickness or disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para24"></a>There is, therefore, a continuous history of a link between entitlement to incapacity benefit--or its predecessor, sickness benefit--and recent work. It has never been enough, as some noble Lords might suggest, for someone to have paid a minimal amount of contribution in just one year--a sort of &#147;on account"--in order to receive incapacity benefit at any point thereafter; that is, 20 or 30 years after and so on. Equally, it has always been possible for people to have paid contributions over a number of years and fail to qualify. The entitlement conditions have always involved looking at what the person has been doing recently. In practice, people whose circumstances do not attract credits will currently need to have been working and paying contributions in both the last two years in order to qualify. It is an insurance scheme. If one has not paid that insurance, there must be questions about one's entitlement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para25"></a>At the same time, however, the second contribution condition can be satisfied by credits alone. The current rules mean that someone who has been unemployed and who has signed on for many years qualifies. The result is that half of the people receiving incapacity benefit today came not from work, because they had become sick or disabled, but from unemployment--often many years of unemployment. Incapacity benefit was never intended to be an alternative unemployment benefit or, indeed, a top-up to early retirement benefit. It was intended to replace the earnings of someone who became ill or disabled while in work and fell out of work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para26"></a>Therefore, the current situation with regard to IB is not consistent with the role of the benefit as a replacement for wages. Indeed, it would not have been even conceived of in the late 1940s by Beveridge when the national insurance system was created.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para27"></a>The Government's proposals for reforming the contribution test are intended to remedy the situation and establish a firm link between benefit entitlement and recent work. That link would not be achieved through the suggestion of my noble friend Lord Ashley of a test of contributions in one of the last seven tax years or 10 years in total. That is what he calls his compromise amendment. The one-in-seven test would allow people to qualify for as long as 8&#189; years after they last worked and paid contributions. The 10-year alternative would extend that period even further. In practice, there would be so little difference from the current situation under the so-called &#147;compromise benefits" as would make virtually no difference. At the moment approximately 300,000 people claim incapacity benefit after the six-month period. Under <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my noble friend's amendment, only 5,000 people would find themselves in a different situation from the one in which they are now. It is not a compromise. Effectively it continues the status quo.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para28"></a>However, the Government's proposals do recognise the need for some exceptions to the requirement to pay recent contributions. We are providing exceptions and exemptions for a number of vulnerable groups. Who are those vulnerable groups? In my view, the most vulnerable group is those young people who are long-term sick and who have become long-term disabled before they have the opportunity to work and contribute. They may have been born with cerebral palsy. They may have severe learning difficulties. However, they will never have been able to enter the labour market nor to build contributions. They are among the poorest and most severely disabled in our society. As a result of the measures which we propose in Clause 60, those people will be in a far better position than ever before. Those measures will enable them to claim incapacity benefit, rather than the much lower severe disablement allowance, without having to satisfy the contribution conditions. Therefore, the poorest and most disabled, those born with a disability virtually from birth or acquired in their youth, will be protected. They will receive IB without contribution conditions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para29"></a>Another vulnerable group is carers. We have made it clear all along that there will be regulations to maintain the status quo for former recipients of ICA--invalid care allowance. They will continue to be able to qualify in the same way as now on the basis of contributions paid in any tax year and credits in the last two.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para30"></a>We have also said all along that there will be safeguards for people who leave IB and have to return to it before they have had sufficient time to rebuild their contribution record. Those are people on IB who have taken the risk of entering the labour market. We seek to lay that risk not on them but on the Government so that such people can return to IB if their health or their job, so to speak, collapses. We have achieved that through the protection of the one-year linking rule, which we introduced last year. We want to be able to provide a complete assurance that people will not lose out under the new contributions test if they try to return to work in that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para31"></a>I am pleased to announce today a further initiative. We are providing protection for another particularly vulnerable group who might otherwise lose out through trying to work; that is, people receiving disabled person's tax credit and earning below the lower earnings limit. I believe that may refer to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy. I believe it was a legitimate concern and we are addressing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para32"></a>People on DPTC already benefit from a special two-year linking rule in IB. However, after careful consideration of the representations made by disability organisations, we agree that further safeguards are needed for low-paid workers who remain on DPTC for more than two years. Therefore, I <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>am pleased to announce that we intend to provide that people who no longer receive DPTC--perhaps because a deteriorating condition such as multiple sclerosis, which has been mentioned this evening, means that they can no longer work--will be able to qualify for IB as they do now on the basis of contributions paid in any tax year rather than one of the last two. An amendment will be needed to ensure that our regulation-making powers are wide enough to do that. I hope to bring forward such an amendment at Third Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para33"></a>I believe that those safeguards, and in particular the further protection that I have announced today, show very clearly that the Government are not inflexible. We recognise that there are particular circumstances in which it would be wrong to require contributions to have been paid in one of the last two tax years, and we are dealing with those. By using regulation-making powers, it also means that we have the scope to modify the protection for the groups which we have identified, should that be found to be necessary, and to provide for other people in comparable situations that may arise in the future. Flexibility is built into our approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-14_para34"></a>For those who do not qualify for IB in future, income support will be available. Income support already goes to many people who satisfy the medical conditions for IB but not the contribution conditions. As your Lordships will know--

<P>
<A NAME="91013-15_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am very glad to hear what the Minister says about disabled person's tax credit, but can she tell us the number of people affected by that concession?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, we expect some 20,000 people to come onto DPTC. That is the broadbrush figure. Within that, I would not be able to tell the noble Earl who would qualify automatically--because even on DPTC there will not be a lower earnings limit--and those who might. However, we are expecting a figure of that order, although we hope to bring it up to 30,000. That is the best advice I can give to noble Lords at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para0"></a>To return to the point. If people are not receiving IB, where do they go? If someone is unemployed and becomes disabled, there is an alternative benefit which is in fact more generous than IB; that is, income support with a disability premium. Income support with the disability premium is worth &#163;73 per week compared to &#163;66 or &#163;67 for IB. There is no question of hardship arising as a result of the change to the contribution conditions. That is the alternative benefit for someone who becomes unemployed and then after some years becomes entitled to help because they have become disabled. The benefit, according to household circumstances, is actually more generous than IB. Certainly, anyone who is unemployed--which comprises more than half of those coming on to IB--would normally have been receiving as their basic benefit the means-tested JSA. If someone qualifies for <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>JSA and then becomes disabled, that person will qualify for IS with the disability premium and therefore will be better off.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para1"></a>Our approach recognises that where someone has been unemployed for an extended period and has not paid contributions, income support with the disability premium is the right benefit rather than incapacity benefit. We are not stripping away benefits and thus leaving people in hardship. We are trying to ensure that IB returns to the function for which it was always intended; namely, to be a replacement for those who become sick and disabled at work rather than those who have been long-term unemployed, who are currently on JSA and who would qualify for IS.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para2"></a>The Government believe that their approach is the right one. Of course, on top of all those benefits, people will qualify for DLA. Some noble Lords have tried to argue today that it is wrong to change the rules at all. However, in reality the rules for contributory benefits have changed numerous times over the years, and that is probably understandable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para3"></a>Finally, I would remind your Lordships that the new contribution conditions are not difficult to satisfy. As now, contributions on earnings equivalent to 25 times the lower earnings limit, currently &#163;66 a week, will suffice. To qualify, this is equivalent to just four weeks' earnings for someone on average male full-time earnings, or 12 weeks for someone on the national minimum wage. That period of 12 weeks' work on the national minimum wage to build up the qualification for a national insurance IB need not be continuous. The conditions can be satisfied by people with broken work records and intermittent health problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para4"></a>It has been suggested again tonight that the rules will create particular difficulties for people with deteriorating conditions like MS, for whom incapacity is preceded by a period of unemployment. But there is no question of people losing eligibility for IB after short periods of unemployment. Contributions need only to have been paid in one of the last two years. As I say, my right honourable friend in the other place is reflecting on that two-year rule. If the rules applied now, someone claiming benefit in 1999 following a period of unemployment would have been able to qualify on the basis of contributions paid as long ago as April 1996. I believe that that would normally be expected to cover a wide variety of the kind of circumstances your Lordships have properly raised tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para5"></a>I said at the beginning that the Government fully understood the concerns that have been raised about the proposed changes to the contribution conditions for IB. Safeguards need to be provided--noble Lords raised some of those concerns at Committee stage--and I am glad to be able to announce that low earners on DPTC will be protected, as well as carers and former IB recipients, and indeed those who currently are on SDA and who are the poorest and most disabled who have never had the chance to enter the labour market.
<P>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para6"></a>But the Government also believe that there is a principle at stake here, and that it would be wrong to allow the current situation to continue where IB goes to many thousands of people who have no recent record of working and paying contributions. I hope that I have responded to the very real worries that noble Lords have addressed. We are reflecting on the two-year rule, and we have made important announcements tonight. However, at the end of the day, my noble friend's compromise is not a compromise. The Government cannot accept it and therefore I must say to my noble friend that the Government cannot support him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has treated the House to a first-class contribution which is typical of her eloquence. She is a marvellous government spokesman. Nevertheless, it may not have escaped her attention that in this House she was in a minority of one in advocating those policies. The noble Lord made a very ambiguous speech. I did not hear any strong advocacy of the Government's policy other than in the contribution of my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para7"></a>The point I wish to make is this. The noble Baroness has spoken of what has gone wrong in the past, and no doubt she was, as usual, accurate. However, Clause 58 does not deal with the past. It deals only with the future. My noble friend was unable to contradict my allegation that 170,000 severely disabled people will lose their &#163;66 incapacity benefit. She was unable to contradict my assertion that those people may have paid their contributions in good faith for 20 or 30 years, and then in the future they will be denied this crucial benefit. She failed to deny the fact that this will cause immense suffering to those people. When you are poor, &#163;66 is a fortune. Valiantly though she tried, my noble friend has failed to deal with these problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para8"></a>When the Minister mentioned income support, she must know of--she is an experienced Minister--its shortcomings. There is no excuse for saying, &#147;Income support is available", because you lose your savings beyond a certain amount. My noble friend knows that people's pride is involved here and the take-up is poor.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para9"></a>I do not wish to speak at length. However, I repeat: this Government have an outstanding record of helping disabled people. This clause is one of the few blots on their record. I hope that it will now be removed. At the beginning I said that if the Government do not accept my compromise amendments, I would withdraw Amendments Nos. 131 and 132. I said that I would press to a vote Amendment No. 133 to delete the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-15_para10"></a>I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 131 and to test the opinion of the House on Amendment No. 133.

<A NAME="91013-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>   moved Amendment No. 134:
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991013/text/91013-16.htm"/>

<P>

Page 66, line 37, after (&#147;payment") insert (&#147;exceeding the level of the Disability Income Guarantee")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the position regarding my amendments to Clause 59 is the same as for Clause 58. I am strongly opposed in principle to the clause because its provisions would devastate many severely disabled people who have saved via an occupational pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para1"></a>The Government are making an extraordinary proposal which provides, for the first time, means testing for a major long-term contributory benefit. The importance of that should never be underestimated. It raises questions about the future of contributory benefits. Are the Government moving away from them? The same arguments for hitting disabled people claiming incapacity benefit and having an occupational pension can also be used against the retirement pension. What will happen in future if this principle is accepted?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para2"></a>Means testing breaches the moral contract between the Government and the people. None of those people who have paid national insurance contributions, <P>


<a name="column_424"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps for 20 or 30 years, will have had any idea that if they became disabled, they would be hit as hard as they will be under this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para3"></a>The clause provides that anyone claiming incapacity benefit who has an occupational pension of over &#163;50 shall lose a stunning 50 pence in every pound for every additional pound over &#163;50. That is a stunning figure by any standards. To start penalising severely disabled people so drastically because they have such a small pension would be remarkable for any government. For a Labour Government, historically committed to helping the poor, that is amazing. I know that the figure of &#163;50 is not in the Bill. The specific figure will be in regulations. However, the Government's thinking was clearly betrayed when they put the figure in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para4"></a>Ministers have indicated that they will reconsider that figure. However, I must tell them that any paltry increase would not be acceptable to me nor, I believe, to the House as a whole. It certainly would not be acceptable to the 500 disability organisations which have unanimously condemned the proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para5"></a>It is bad enough to start cutting incapacity benefit at this low level of pension. It is equally unfair that the cut should be at the penal rate of 50 pence in every pound. As incapacity benefit is already taxed at 23 per cent, this new imposition would mean that the incapacity benefit of many future disabled people would be at the marginal rate of 73 per cent. The top rate for millionaires is 40 per cent. Where is the sense in that? Where is the justice and the reason?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para6"></a>Ministers are implying that incapacity benefit recipients are well off. I do not like using figures because I am not good at them, but I must impose a few on the House. The Government intend to start cutting IB for someone with an occupational pension as low as &#163;51 per week. Severely disabled people, with an incapacity benefit and a &#163;51 pension would have a total income of just &#163;117.75 per week, or &#163;6,123 per annum. That is only 37 per cent of average income and just 28 per cent of average male earnings. These people are not, by any stretch of the imagination, well off. They are also too severely disabled to work to improve their income. They are nailed to poverty. By definition, they are incapacitated, and too incapacitated to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para7"></a>The Government's proposal is that all incapacity benefits should be withdrawn when a person has a pension of &#163;181.77 per week; that is &#163;9,452 per annum. That is 58 per cent of average income and 43 per cent of average earnings. All I can say is that an income of &#163;9,500 is not a wealthy one.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para8"></a>The Government seek to justify their proposals by claiming that there is double provision of pension and incapacity benefit; that very few people used to have occupational pensions, whereas now many people have them. That is the Government's case, or part of it. However, that has already been taken account of by the previous Tory government who removed the earnings-related element of the former invalidity benefit when it became incapacity benefit. The Tory Government did that precisely because of double provision, so it is already dealt with. The deduction is <P>


<a name="column_425"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>already made. This Government are going on with a further deduction as if the previous government had done nothing about it. It is a duplication of effort. In fact it is double jeopardy for disabled people and I cannot see for the life of me how that can be justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para9"></a>If the Government wish to remove incapacity benefit from those who make their own provision with savings and pension, then they should also remove the requirement to pay the portion of contributions that pays for incapacity benefit. That is logical common sense. Not only is the principle wrong; so is the practice proposed by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para10"></a>In the spirit of compromise which I mentioned a moment ago, I want to propose some fairer figures. Instead of the Government's proposal of penalising people with a &#163;51 pension, I suggest in my amendment that the reduction in incapacity benefit should not begin until a person has a pension of &#163;128 a week. That is the level of the disability income guarantee and that is an amount fixed by the Government. It is a realistic figure. By relating the level to the guarantee and placing this in the Bill it indexes the level and ensures that it will not decline in real terms over time, and that is very important. I hope the Government will be able to accept that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para11"></a>The 50p in the pound rate of deduction is far too high. I know that there are all sorts of social security tapers, but the significant factor about incapacity benefit is that people have contributed in order to receive it should the need arise. It is not a means-tested benefit which, by definition, has to be related to overall income. I believe, and I invite the House to believe, that two types of payments--national insurance and occupational pension--should mean two benefits. Again, those are straightforward, reasonable, honest propositions. But, again, if Clause 59 is accepted, the moral concept is totally removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para12"></a>If we must have the taper then this figure of 23p in the pound, which is the standard rate of income tax, is a reasonable one. I recognise that if all the provisions of my amendment were accepted the incapacity benefit would not be totally withdrawn until the disabled person had an income of &#163;21,747 per annum. The Government would no doubt object to that and claim that these people would be wealthy. I disagree. They would not be paying the higher rate of tax, which is the usual measure of wealth.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para13"></a>There are two vital points to take into consideration. First of all, most people affected by the Government's proposals will have nothing like this income and most of them will be poor. They are the people that we are concerned about tonight with these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para14"></a>Secondly, regardless of how high the income of the few may be, all of them have paid their national insurance contributions, in some cases for decades, and they are entitled to the benefit when the need arises. I am labouring that point. I make no apology for it, because it must be fair. If people pay you must keep faith with them and give them what they have earned. In an effort to build some kind of bridge, I commend this amendment to the Government. If it is not accepted by my noble friends and the Government, <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as I have said, in my second amendment I shall invite the House to reject the clause completely. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_time0"></A><H5>7.00 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix </B>  : My Lords, I regret the extension of means testing to a non means-tested benefit, and I should like to see the Government accept the substantial easement of the new means test proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley--seconded, as it were, by me--but that, I fear, is wishful thinking.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para15"></a>The Government deserve credit for the improvements they have made through this Bill for severely disabled people, and I for one accord that credit. However, beneficial changes inevitably have a price tag attached, and the savings contained in this clause certainly provide the necessary financial leverage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para16"></a>Noble Lords may wonder why I am taking such an interest in this clause, particularly as the majority of people with severe learning disabilities do not have pensions and therefore will not be adversely affected. The reason for my profound discomfort with the principle that an advance for one group of disabled people must be paid for by a reduction in benefits for another group of disabled people must be quite clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para17"></a>The Government seem to have couched this distinction in terms of the deserving and the undeserving disabled, characterising the undeserving--the losers in this clause--as those who are using incapacity benefit to finance early retirement. This I believe is misleading. All those who have passed the all work test for incapacity benefit should be judged to be incapable of work, albeit with a measure of assessment of their future capabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para18"></a>I have heard enough said by Ministers to convince me that some further change is in mind to the means test formula. But once again detail has not been forthcoming. I, like a number of other noble Lords present today, would be satisfied with a change which includes substantially raising the level of the existing disregard and protecting its value over time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-16_para19"></a>I am therefore led to express my disappointment at the Government's continual procrastination over this clause. If there is a Division on Clause 59, as I believe there will be, I feel unable to lend this clause my wholehearted support. I cannot in all conscience represent the concerns of disabled people generally unless I vote against the clause as it currently stands. Nevertheless, I look forward to hearing more detail on any progress in government thinking from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and I urge her and the Government not to defer such detail to another place.

<A NAME="91013-17_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>  : My Lords, majorities of over 150 do not happen very often in this place. Whatever they may say about the composition of this House or anything else, Ministers should think very carefully about what they may have done to contribute to that result. I say, not to the Minister, who is too good a scholar to need it, but through her to the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister: I pray you, in the bowels of the Lord, to think it possible you may be mistaken.

<A NAME = "91013-17_para0"></a>I am afraid, however, that I have to make the same point to the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, about his amendments that I had to make in the previous debate. I respect and honour the intention behind the amendments, but the principle of what is being attempted is not acceptable and therefore a compromise would not really be a compromise since it would involve accepting the Government's principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para1"></a>My objections to what the Government are doing are twofold. The first is the obvious commonsense one that it discourages saving. The second is the erosion of the contributory principle and therefore the taking away of what one might perhaps regard as a legitimate expectation. I am not, of course, going to adopt the tablets of stone principle that conditions for contributory benefits may never be changed under any circumstances whatever. We are not Medes and Persians and if we were we would not need a Parliament. But we do have to take account of the fact that in pension provision, with the changing age balance, the shortage of young people as well as the numbers of old ones, we really must be thinking about encouraging a climate of private provision. Occasionally I think people are going too fast in that direction, but I do think that discouraging private provision, in the present actuarial situation, is going rather against a change in culture which we need to see. I think it is a long way from joined-up government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para2"></a>The argument about these people being wealthy, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, hinted at very briefly, grossly fails to take account of the extra costs of disability and it gets more and more clear that we have underestimated those at every stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para3"></a>The other really interesting thing about this proposal is how it got here. Some of your Lordships will have read the article in the Guardian of 25th September which pointed out what some of us had previously suspected; namely, that the proposal is identical to one put forward, largely by the same civil servants, through Michael Portillo and offered to Peter Lilley in 1993. I am interested in the response that Mr. Lilley gave, and the quote is from the original documents. He said that the move would justifiably create &#147;a source of resentment" among disabled people and raise difficult questions about the contributory principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para4"></a>Mr. Lilley went on to say--these are his exact words--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;I do not favour this approach. Apart from the disincentives to make private provision it would introduce, I think it would raise some very difficult questions about the future of the contributory benefit system before we have fully thought through the direction we want to take".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-17_para5"></a>
Mr. Lilley said it all.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para6"></a>We heard earlier from the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, who is no longer in his place, a variant of the &#147;Mr. Jones will come back" argument directed against the Conservatives. But there are two points about that argument: first, it was never employed, except when those in charge were doing something rather wrong; <P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and, secondly, if we take Mr. Lilley as the Mr. Jones on this occasion, he seems to me to have shown a good deal more sense that this Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para7"></a>The final point that I wish to make is that this direct carbon-copying of a proposal from the Treasury under Michael Portillo seems to me to cast some doubt on the general concept of welfare reform as employed by the Prime Minister. It tends to suggest that it is not some great, new, glorious brainchild of the Prime Minister's thinking: it is simply the Treasury doing business as usual. We are used to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B>  : My Lords, writing to me about this clause yesterday my friend for many years, Sir Peter Large, than whom no severely disabled person is more widely respected in all parts of both Houses, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;The policy of redistributing resources from disabled people in need to others in greater need is abhorrent to me. Unfortunately, the policy is nowhere more clearly evident than in Clause 59, which introduces the dangerous precedent of means testing a contributory benefit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-17_para8"></a>
Sir Peter went on to say that by no stretch of anyone's imagination can people with a personal pension of &#163;51 a week be thought of as sufficiently well off to be an appropriate target for means testing. He added:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;It is in stark contrast to the future upper earnings limit for the new Children's Tax Credit which will be approximately &#163;38,500 a year".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-17_para9"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para10"></a>Many disabled people fear that the worse is to come. Clause 59(3)(c) allows invalidity benefit to be reduced through,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;a payment of any other specified description; and 'specified' means prescribed by or determined in accordance with regulations under this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-17_para11"></a>
There is widespread worry, notwithstanding all that has been said by Ministers so far, that the means testing of invalidity benefit that this clause proposes will lead logically to taking other benefits into account and means testing them also.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para12"></a>Where in our general election manifesto was there any hint that disabled people would be forced to take a cut in benefit of 50 per cent of any personal pension worth over &#163;50 a week so that, for example, someone who has saved for years to provide a weekly pension of &#163;75 will have her or his benefit cut by a punishing &#163;12.50 a week? What possible justification can there be for doing this when between 1980 and 1998 disability benefits were frozen, while average earnings in Britain rose by &#163;115 a week in the same period?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para13"></a>Clause 59 confuses reform with retreat. &#147;What justice is there", I am asked by disabled people, &#147;in penalising those who forgo pleasure today in order to pay for safeguarding their future?" Many say that the Government's top priority ought to be improving the take-up of disability benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para14"></a>I most strongly urge my colleagues in government to think again about this clause which they know, as well as I do, is deeply resented by everyone aware of its implications for many of the most vulnerable people in Britain today. Speaking from ministerial experience of, I think, twice the length of any present Minister in your Lordships' House, I know the consequences for <P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>individual Ministers of the deceit that government is seamless. The reality is that every Minister in all governments must fight his or her corner for available resources. I have no doubt whatever that my noble friend Lady Hollis has fought her corner and that her commitment to making life better for disabled people is every bit as strong now as it was before she became a Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para15"></a> I profoundly hope that we shall hear when she speaks that this clause will now be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 136, which would leave out the whole of Clause 59 and which is grouped with the other two amendments that we are discussing. The clause would extend means testing within the system of contributory benefits, as noble Lords have already pointed out, but it would penalise people who have saved for the future with the encouragement of successive governments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para16"></a>I spoke on this point in Committee, so I shall be brief in what I have to say tonight. However, I draw your Lordships' attention to this anomaly. It appears that pension income only is involved in the means testing. This seems unfair as between pensioners with pension income and pensioners with other private income. I should be grateful for confirmation from the noble Baroness that this is so and perhaps she could explain why it is so. I shall join the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, in opposing this clause for the reasons which I gave in Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, as has rightly been pointed out, this is means testing of a major, long-term contributory benefit and, as such, must give grave cause for concern. The case against the clause and in favour of the amendment has already been made strongly, but what is extraordinary about it is not merely that it is means testing a major benefit but the way in which it proposes to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para17"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, suggested that this was something put forward by the previous government, turned down by them but accepted now by this Government--a kind of &#147;Yes, Prime Minister" television show scenario. If any Sir Humphrey had put this before Jim Hacker in the programme, he would have had no difficulty at all in turning it down. He would have pointed out clearly that the people who would be means tested are those who happen to have pensions. He might have added that the entire purport of most of this Bill, which we have been debating day after day, is to encourage people to take out pensions. If they happen to be disabled, and no doubt had greater difficulty in procuring a pension in the first place, they are now to be told, &#147;Well, you are not going to get the full amount of your disability benefit because you have been prudent enough to take out a pension".
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, suggested that the Government are distinguishing between the deserving and the undeserving disabled. He is right: in my view, we must make no such distinction. But the people who <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are regarded by the Government as the undeserving disabled are those who have been prudent enough to provide themselves with a pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para19"></a>This clause verges on the bizarre and I really do not think one needs a very long speech to point that out. The reality is that there are estimated to be some 45,000 people--prudent, disabled people--who will lose in the first year, rising to 335,000 after 10 years. I have had a very large number of letters from people. One example concerned a lady who had previously worked as a nurse and had had a stroke. She managed to get a pension and long disability benefit, but she now writes to me saying, &#147;If this goes through I will probably have to sell my house".
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para20"></a>There are many such cases. It is very easy, in this atmosphere, to look at it all in a rather academic way, but the reality is that there are people concerned who are disabled, who have been prudent, and they are being penalised by the Government. I think I am right in saying, if I may just pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy just now, that if someone has a disability benefit--the Minister will correct me if I am wrong--and has an income from, let us say, shares, of &#163;2 million a year, they will still continue to get their disability benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-17_para21"></a>This clause, as it stands, is quite absurd. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, has rightly considered the matter and he has put down amendments which would effectively contain a degree of compromise. I think the principle behind this clause is doubly wrong, and we really must totally oppose it.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I would just like to say: was not the cause of the downfall of the Conservative government that they did not listen to their friends? It would be very advisable tonight to listen to their friends, the noble Lords, Lord Ashley and Lord Morris, who know so much. As a disabled person myself for about 42 years, I can assure your Lordships that whatever a person's income, disability is exceedingly expensive. I do hope that the Government will listen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, in proposing to take some account of pension income and incapacity benefit, perhaps I could pick up some of the points that have recently been made tonight. We are not of course means testing in any conventional sense. We are not taking into account in these proposals other income, such as a spouse's income; nor, despite the suggestion of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, are we taking into account savings and the thrift associated with them. We are talking about pensions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, knows, incapacity benefit is designed for people who lose their work through sickness or disability. If they become sick or disabled after normal retirement age they do not qualify for IB. They qualify for a retirement pension and possibly for attendance allowance, but the state retirement pension is paid basically at the same level as IB. Therefore if someone retires early and has a pension, as an alternative to their earnings as opposed <P>


<a name="column_431"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to a normal retirement, at that point they simultaneously receive IB as well as their earning pension. That means a double coverage for the same contingency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para1"></a>In the same way, perhaps I may take the example of travel insurance and also insurance of household goods. If I lose a suitcase on holiday I do not get reimbursed from both sources. You do not get double coverage for the same contingency. That is why we are taking pension income into account: not savings, not income, not a spouse's income and so on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I wonder if the noble Baroness will allow me to intervene? Is she not aware that if you have to give up work and take a pension early, particularly early by a number of years, you are taking a pension at a very much reduced rate and you are not getting the amount every week or every month that you would have been getting if you had reached the normal retirement age. The pension is cut down. Therefore, the Government are giving a double-whammy to disabled people who are forced to retire early.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I would not accept that. In the first place, from my own experience, when people do retire there is often a package in the round of added years and so on, if retirement is on medical grounds. Secondly, if the disability is of sufficient severity they will almost certainly be entitled to some level of disability living allowance which tops up their income in addition to IB. I accept that in some circumstances what the noble Lord has said may be right, but I would certainly not accept that it applies to the majority of people about whom we are talking here. There are other sources of income, like DLA, which I think he has overlooked tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para2"></a>As I explained before, benefit for incapacity and similar allowances were introduced when very few people had occupational pensions. If someone needed to retire early through sickness or disability, there was nowhere else for them to go but on to sickness benefit. They could very seldom draw down an occupational pension, whether reduced, as the noble Lord said, or in full. In either case, three-quarters of the population would not have had that sort of access.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para3"></a>Now, the vast majority of people do: about 85 or 86 per cent of men, for example, have an occupational pension. Incapacity benefit, IB and its predecessor, sickness benefit, were designed to replace wages. They were never designed as a top-up to generous white-collar pensions, offered for early retirement. In the public sector, for example, there can be ill-health retirement on &#163;25,000 a year, and such pensions cost us &#163;1 billion a year. The Audit Commission found that in some local authorities 50 per cent of retirements are on ill-health grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para4"></a>Overall, 22 per cent of civil servants, 25 per cent of teachers and 39 per cent of local government staff--I say nothing about the police--who retired over a five-year period did so on medical grounds. Normally they <P>


<a name="column_432"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would also be eligible for IB; yet they have generous occupational pensions and in most professions their pensions are made up in full. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about IB which for many people who have generous white-collar pensions has become a top-up for early retirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para5"></a>My noble friend, in his usual courteous and impeccably careful way, has put forward amendments which at least accept the principle that there should be a partnership between the state provision and what people themselves provide, by way of pension. I very much appreciate the careful and considered way in which he has sought to move the debate on, but I hope I may yet persuade my noble friend that he should not insist on seeking the support of the House for his amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para6"></a>The Government are currently spending over &#163;24 billion a year on benefits for disabled people: that is about a quarter of the Government's total social security expenditure. We believe it is right that the money should go to those who most need it, to those disabled people on low or modest incomes and to those whose disability needs are most severe. In other words, we are talking about those who are most likely to be in financial need and those with the most acute disabilities. Those are our priorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para7"></a>Perhaps I may just remind your Lordships that no one on IB at the present time will be affected. For the future, assuming the same proportion of IB recipients with pensions, the number of new cases who are unaffected will still be around 80 per cent. Therefore, under the Government's proposals everyone now on IB will be unaffected and in future 80 per cent will be unaffected. The 20 per cent who would be affected are for the most part retiring early with generous white-collar, often public sector financed pensions, paid for by us all, which were designed to cover the same contingency as IB is being asked to pay for: that is early retirement on grounds of sickness. That is, where the Government stand. They do not believe that that is the right or the best use of public money.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend allow me to intervene? She has raised the question of cost: &#163;24 billion. If cost is the issue, could she tell us what would be the cost of allowing this amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to go on, because I will come back to that in detail later regarding my noble friend's proposal about the number of people who will be affected. We are talking about those in financial need and those who have the most acute disability, the most financial need, those who are currently on SDA and the client group so movingly spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on many previous occasions in your Lordships' House who are now bumping along on income support; they have SDA but they have to be means-tested for income support and they still live, in my view, a very limited life in terms of the income available to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para8"></a>What we are doing with our proposals is ensuring that those people go on to IB. In other words, those who have been born with a disability or acquire a <P>


<a name="column_433"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disability before going into the labour market--the poorest of the poor--will see an increase in their benefits of nearly &#163;30 a week. That is what we are doing; we are seeking to bring money to those who most need it. Not to the early retirement teachers, civil servants, university lecturers or who you will, but to those who most need it. People such as those who have learning difficulties or cerebral palsy will receive an extra &#163;30 a week. We are seeking to help those who are the poorest among the groups of disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para9"></a>Secondly, we want also to concentrate help on those who are the most severely disabled as well as on the poorest. I hope to offer some good news to the House. Many of the concerns about the Government's proposal to take pension income into account in IB have focused on the impact on severely disabled people with progressive, degenerate diseases, or perhaps on people who have had a traumatic injury which has left them in need of care by day and night and unable to work until retirement or early retirement. I am delighted to tell your Lordships that in recognition of the special circumstances and particular needs of this group, the Government have decided that there should be no reduction of incapacity benefit at all in the case of people who are the most severely disabled; that is, those who are entitled to the highest rate of the care component of disability living allowance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para10"></a>This recognises that the most severely disabled people who work and have to plan in the expectation of early retirement--because of MS or whatever--and a reduced pension are in a very different position from the school teacher, the university teacher, and so on, who retires early--perhaps on grounds of stress, depression, a lower back injury or arthritis. They are very different from the people we are talking about, such as the person who has a broken back or who has been born with cerebral palsy; they are the people who really need our help. We are therefore focusing on the poorest and most severely disabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para11"></a>In the Bill we are helping the most severely disabled with the exemption for those on the highest rate of DLA; and we are helping the poorest by ensuring that those who would otherwise be on income support and SDA--MENCAP clients and those with CP, for example--will get a &#163;30 lift in their benefit. That is consistent with our strategy of concentrating resources on the most severely disabled people and the poorest people, those with greatest need. We will bring back an amendment to put this into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para12"></a>We estimate that approximately 20,000 people on IB will benefit in the long run in the future. None of these pension proposals, the tapering or whatever, will affect those people with the most acute need and whose disability generates the highest rate of care--they may have MS, spinal injury or be bed ridden--and qualify for the highest of the DLA; they will be exempt. This will recognise the high cost of disability, as the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, said. I am sure that this will be welcome news to your Lordships. It is a direct consequence of the views expressed in your Lordships' House and urged on the Government.
<P>


<a name="column_434"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para13"></a>It also has a direct bearing on my noble friend's amendment linking the disregard to the disability income guarantee. The Government's guarantee that he quoted applies only to people on the highest rate of DLA. My noble friend would apply it to all people, irrespective of the degree of disability. My noble friend is offering a disregard of the same value for all disabled people, whether they are suffering from stress or mild arthritis or have been paralysed by a major injury. My noble friend's amendment treats the ex-bank manager with a good pension, who has taken early retirement and who 10 years on develops depression and qualifies for IB in the same way as the King's Cross fireman with a broken back. The Government do not. I am not for a moment denying that depression is not real; I am saying that the ex-bank manager is in no financial need. His depression need generate no additional financial costs--if it does, he may go to DLA--unlike the fireman, who needs constant care and attendance. The fireman is the person we are seeking to help.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para14"></a>I would also remind the House that the Government have not yet confirmed the level at which pension income is to be taken into account in other cases. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has said all along that he will review the proposal in last year's consultation document to reduce IB at the rate of 50p in the pound for every pound of pension income over &#163;50. In seeking to specify the value of the disregard and the taper on the face of the Bill, my noble friend's amendment would pre-empt the Secretary of State's consideration of these issues and prevent him from bringing forward his own proposals. I rather suspect that is my noble friend's intention. The Secretary of State has made it clear that his figures are not set in tablets of stone. He has listened and consulted and he is reflecting on the issue. He will come back in due course with his proposed figures.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para15"></a>My noble friend said that he is offering a compromise. In linking the taper to the basic rate of income tax and starting the disregard at the disability income guarantee of &#163;128, my noble friend has more than halved the taper and more than doubled the disregard. Some compromise! My noble friend's idea of a compromise is to accept the principle in theory and then to move an amendment to exclude almost everyone affected from its impact. While the Secretary of State is thinking carefully about these figures, your Lordships will appreciate that my noble friend is expecting the Secretary of State to move a very long way if there is to be any meeting of minds.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para16"></a>What does my noble friend's amendment mean? Take together a taper linked at the basic rate of income tax and his disregard, and what would it mean? My noble friend quoted a figure of &#163;23,000 for a single man; only at that point would he lose his entitlement to IB. If someone was getting IB for a partner and two children, they would continue to be eligible for IB until the pension income was &#163;39,000. My noble friend would protect the situation of someone with previous earnings of &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 and the possibility of decent savings which would generate a pension of nearly &#163;40,000. Only at that point would my noble friend's amendment extinguish the right to IB.
<P>


<a name="column_435"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 435</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para17"></a>I ask your Lordships, is it really our priority that people at that generous level of income, with pensions nearing &#163;40,000 a year, should still retain, if they have children and a spouse, an entitlement to incapacity benefit? Should they receive a level of support when we have people with very modest incomes living on income support--people with learning difficulties and the like--not getting the help and support that they should? It is about priorities--and I am asking your Lordships to judge those priorities tonight. Under no circumstances can the people protected by my noble friend's amendment be regarded as modest or in need.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para18"></a>In setting the level of the disregard we have to be fair to all, including people on IB who do not have the advantage of pensions and people in work who are often earning less than the level of pension that would be protected by my noble friend's formula. I should remind the House that nearly half of those on IB are in the top 40 per cent of income in this country, whether or not DLA is calculated. Many disabled people are not poor if they retire early with generous pensions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para19"></a>My noble friend and I disagree. I hope that your Lordships will accept that the Government's approach is based on principle and a careful assessment of the issues. The important exemption that I have announced for people on the highest rate of DLA care will go a long way to meet many of the concerns raised by your Lordships and disability organisations. It will do far more for the most severely disabled than my noble friend's amendment. On his proposal the taper will still kick in; on ours they will be exempt altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-18_para20"></a>The Government's proposals are more generous to the most severely disabled people than my noble friend's compromise amendment. My noble friend, however, is more generous than the Government think right to those who have earned &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 in the past and who now have white-collar pensions of &#163;30,000 to &#163;40,000.

<A NAME="91013-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that, under her proposals, if the disabled person does not have a pension but an investment income of &#163;39,000, &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000, they will lose none of their incapacity benefit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords. But if one looks at the profile of savings and wealth compared to the profile of pensions, one will find that people protected by that are a tiny handful compared to the number of people who will be protected under the amendment of my noble friend Lord Ashley. His amendment protects pension income; an occupational pension is the big source of income for white-collar people. We think it not unreasonable, if they are not in financial need, to consider the interlocking of that pension with disability benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para0"></a>I was asked by my noble friend Lord Barnett what would be the cost of accepting my noble friend's amendment removing the clause. It would remove savings of &#163;45 million in year one, &#163;190 million in year three, and &#163;550 million in year 10 as provided for in the <P>


<a name="column_436"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government's original proposals. That money would not then be available to help the poorest, those on income support and those born with a disability or who acquired it in their youth. There are choices to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para1"></a>The gap between us is large. The Government are giving most help to the poorest--those on severe disablement allowance topped up by income support. We are also protecting the most severely disabled, those on the highest rate of DLA. My noble friend's proposals would mean that much less could be done for both those groups and instead protect people with generous white-collar pensions and less severe disability. The Secretary of State will consider all the factors. However, I hope that noble Lords will accept that the Government's case is not only principled but also fair and decent and one that deserves support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend again on a splendid presentation of the Government's case. My noble friend and I have crossed swords on the detail of this issue for many months. It would be remiss of me to bore the House with a repetition of the details set out in our debates at Second Reading and in Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para2"></a>My noble friend has not justified the Government's proposal for hitting people who have a pension income of over &#163;50 a week at the extraordinary rate of 50p in the pound. Nor has she persuaded me that this is not a case of disabled people who are poor being forced to pay for those who are very poor. That is not a philosophy I can accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para3"></a>My noble friend seemed proud of the number of people who will not be affected by the provision. But we are concerned with those who will be affected. That is the whole point of the debate. My noble friend spoke of people on &#147;generous white-collar pensions". I visualised millionaires driving up by the million in Rolls-Royces to draw their incapacity benefit. But we are not concerned with millionaires. We are concerned with people on a pension of &#163;50 or just above being robbed of 50p in every pound over that amount. This is an extraordinary proposal. One speaker in this splendid debate described it as bizarre. How true that is.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para4"></a>At the beginning of the debate I said that if the Government were unable to accept my reasoned, honourable amendments--despite the scorn poured on them by my noble friend, they are a genuine attempt to reach a compromise sooner rather than later and there must be a compromise at some time--I would not press Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 but would seek a Division on Amendment No. 136. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para5"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-19_para6"></a>[Amendment No. 135 not moved.]

Leave out Clause 59

<A NAME="91013-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNair </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will reconsider their support for the American cruise missile attack on the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in the light of subsequent scientific and technical reports on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is now absolutely clear that the American cruise missile attack on the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, was a disastrous misjudgment. As the House will be aware, Professor Thomas Tullius, Chairman of Boston University's Department of Chemistry, conducted detailed tests on the remains of the Al Shifa factory. The analysis, carried out in three accredited European laboratories, did not uncover a shred of evidence to support American claims that the Al Shifa factory was involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para2"></a>Everyone, except for a few who cannot afford to face the truth, now accepts that Al Shifa was a factory producing a range of medicines. Even the American Defence Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's own intelligence service, has admitted that the attack was a serious error of judgment. The attack was a foreign policy disaster which set the Islamic world against the United States and, by association, the United Kingdom. It was also a catastrophe for the Sudanese people because a factory that produced two-thirds of Sudan's medicines at an affordable price was destroyed and has not been replaced.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para3"></a>There is a curious inconsistency between the overall treatment of Sudan and the treatment accorded to Saddam Hussein and Iraq over the past 16 years. The <P>


<a name="column_440"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 440</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>House will remember that in 1998 the American and British Governments went to war against the Iraqi state in order to force Iraq to open its factories for chemical weapons investigations. Yet both governments had, a few months earlier, pointedly refused repeated Sudanese requests that they examine a factory on the outskirts of Khartoum which the Americans alleged to have been involved in the production of chemical weapons. In fact, Iraq was listed, de-listed and re-listed according to the prevailing political climate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para4"></a>President Clinton attacked and destroyed the Al Shifa medicines factory on the false assumption that it was owned by Osama bin-Laden. Osama bin-Laden is the conduit through whom the Americans poured millions of dollars in military assistance, equipment and training to the mujaheddin in order to remove the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan. Not for the first time, such a person bit the hand that fed him. He turned against the Americans and is now the sworn enemy of the United States. The Taliban now rule Afghanistan as a direct result of American policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para5"></a>The Prime Minister's hasty and unwise support for President Clinton's attempt to divert media attention from his domestic affairs damaged Britain's standing abroad no less than the bombing damaged America's. The most important lesson from Al Shifa is the danger of labelling countries as state sponsors of terrorism on the basis of political rather than factual logic.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para6"></a>So how did this occur? I suggest that the American Administration's foreign policy establishment began to believe its own propaganda and also the erroneous information that it had been given by people who are in opposition to the present government in the Sudan. Naturally, it is one of the ways that people in opposition can press their point.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para7"></a>One problem with this is that it tends to underline the political nature of the listing and un-listing of countries. It also tends to undermine international efforts to combat the real terrorists.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para8"></a>When the Clinton Administration listed Sudan in 1993, no less a figure than former President Jimmy Carter asked to see the evidence behind the listing. These are former President Carter's own words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;In fact, when I later asked an assistant Secretary of State, he said that they did not have any proof but there were strong allegations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-20_para9"></a>
So Sudan was listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism without any proof. In particular, the US Government have been unable to point to a single act of international terrorism sponsored by Sudan. Instead, they fall back on allegations of &#147;passive support".
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para10"></a>These allegations of &#147;passive support" for international terrorism by Sudan apparently consisted of turning a blind eye and allowing members of several Islamic groupings to reside in Khartoum. On that basis the UK should have been so listed long ago. Not only do the British authorities allow thousands of foreign &#147;extremists" to live in and agitate from London--many are in receipt of state benefits--but the Governments of Algeria, France, Egypt, Israel and <P>


<a name="column_441"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Saudi Arabia, among others, have all complained about terrorist acts being planned by foreign radicals in Britain. The recent Yemen affair could be cited as an example.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para11"></a>We should remember that it was Sudan that extradited Carlos the Jackal to France and, at the request of the American Government, expelled Osama bin-Laden in 1995, while at the same time prophetically warning that in doing so it would be difficult for the Sudanese and Americans to keep tabs on him. One year later bin-Laden began his attacks on American personnel.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para12"></a>There have been many allegations that within the borders of Sudan there are terrorist training camps. The question to be asked is: if these terrorist training camps exist why were the Tomahawk missiles not aimed at these as they were in Afghanistan? Why else would the Americans attack the Al Shifa factory in the suburbs of Khartoum, where, if the allegations were correct, tens of thousands of people might have died or been crippled permanently, rather than the terrorist training camps?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para13"></a>The American Government quickly realised that the factory had no connection with bin-Laden. They were candid enough to admit that for one whole week after the attack on Al Shifa they did not know who was the owner of the factory. The world's press quickly ascertained that the factory was owned by Mr Salah Idris, a Saudi Arabian businessman of Sudanese origin. The Clinton Administration were unwilling to admit that they had made a mistake in associating the ownership of the factory with Osama bin-Laden. President Clinton then hurriedly invoked American anti-terrorist legislation, listed Mr Idris as a terrorist and froze 24 million dollars of his assets in accounts with the Bank of America. Washington also banned him from entering the United States. Fortunately for Mr Idris, he had the resources to challenge this listing in a federal court in the United States. In May of this year eight months after the freezing of his assets, the United States Government chose not to defend the action and released his funds. Most American newspapers saw this as an admission of error on the part of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para14"></a>The Minister may recall that some months before this court case I asked whether Her Majesty's Government had at any stage decided to regard Mr Idris as a terrorist or supporter of terrorism and, therefore, whether he would be excluded from the United Kingdom, mirroring the American measures. The answer was no. If the Government of the United Kingdom were so convinced by the American case in respect of the use and purpose of the factory why did they not follow the American line in respect of Mr Idris?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para15"></a>One of the unexpected by-products of the American attack on the Al Shifa medicines factory was a surge of in-depth investigative journalism into the issue of Sudan and terrorism by American newspapers and periodicals such as the New York Times and New Yorker. On 21st September 1998 the New York Times called into question the US State Department's claims <P>

The article revealed that two years before the Al Shifa debacle the American Central Intelligence Agency had found itself obliged to withdraw over 100 intelligence reports alleging Sudanese involvement in terrorism because it realised that they had been either fabricated or were simply wildly inaccurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para16"></a>The bombing of the American embassies in east Africa occurred several days before the attack on the Al Shifa medicines factory. It is a matter of record that the Government of the Sudan were among the first to condemn the terrorist bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, and Khartoum granted unlimited and unconditional overflight permission for American aeroplanes to evacuate those injured by the explosions. The day after the embassy bombings two men entered the Sudan travelling on forged Pakistani passports. They attempted to rent a flat overlooking the American Embassy in Khartoum. At this point the Sudanese authorities arrested them, notified the US State Department that they were in custody and offered to hand them over to the US justice system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para17"></a>According to recent American media reports, the US Government, for reasons best known to themselves, preferred to ignore the possibility that the Sudanese had apprehended two of the embassy bombers, and a few days later Tomahawk missiles destroyed the Al Shifa factory. Sudanese government officials, despairing of American co-operation, deported the two suspects to Pakistan where they promptly disappeared. In August of this year the American media reported that the Clinton Administration's decision not to take into custody two possible bombers of the American embassies was being investigated by committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para18"></a>Since, yesterday, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, referred to allegations by Norwegian Peoples Aid, which I regard as a thoroughly discredited organisation, that the Government of Sudan used chemical weapons in a bombing raid on 23rd July and since the Minister seems to be unaware that, according to the Guardian of Friday 6th August,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-20_para19"></a>
I should like to ask--I have given the noble Baroness rather late notice of this question--what has been the result of that investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para20"></a>In addition, Africa Confidential, which is no friend of the Government of Sudan, reported on 27th August that,

Can the Minister enlighten the House about the reasons for that silence?

<P>
<A NAME="91013-20_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Bradford: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships' House has considered the subject of Sudan a number of times over the past few years, and I believe that is right. It is a vast country with vast problems and suffering and is easily forgotten. Therefore, I welcome <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the debate initiated by the noble Lord today. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I say I do not think that we should concentrate on Al Shifa and the missile attack. That is now history. I do not believe that we shall get very far by raking over the ashes of that particular incident.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para22"></a>The life of Sudan is daily one of claims of atrocity and counter-claims, with blame going to and fro. I believe that for two significant reasons the time has now come to move forward and not rake over the past. First, as the Minister told us yesterday, in September the Foreign Secretary and Dr Mustapha Osman Ismail, Sudan's Minister for External Affairs, met. As a result, full diplomatic relations are to be restored. I believe that that gives Her Majesty's Government a real opening to stress again the need for peace in Sudan and to work for peace with justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para23"></a>Every time I go to Sudan and meet Sudanese who live in Uganda and Kenya they do not pray for victory in a military sense but for peace so that their lives may be restored. With the exchange of ambassadors I hope that the Minister will assure us that every effort will be made to support the IGAD process and to take any other measures which are open to Her Majesty's Government to promote peace in Sudan.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para24"></a>The second reason is the development of the oil industry in Sudan which could be a blessing or curse. Fighting goes on. There have been explosions at Atbara and Kasala and stories that the government are to buy 50 tanks with part of the oil revenue. The increase in oil revenue provides an incredible opportunity for the Government of Sudan, encouraged and supported by Her Majesty's Government, to address homelessness, hunger, poverty, disease and the needs of education in their own country and to receive international approval for doing just that. It is essential that there are people in a position to encourage the Government of Sudan not to spend the money on weapons but in that other way. People who know the country well tell us that it is most unlikely that a military victory would ever be possible. If the revenue is spent and if those in the rebel parties continue the war ad infinitum, it will not lead to victory but to increased suffering for ordinary, innocent people who have suffered far too much already.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para25"></a>I hope that Her Majesty's Government, with these new links, and based upon the development of the oil revenue, will exercise a diplomatic and sensitive and supportive role in inviting the Government of Sudan and the dissidents to talk seriously, as a matter of integrity, so that the country may find peace.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para26"></a>In this process I believe that Christians and Muslims have a significant role to play. I resist the idea that this is in every respect a conflict between the two great faiths. There are many devout Christians in Sudan and many devout Muslims. Dr Mustapha Osman Ismail, who I know personally, is one such. Here is an opportunity for people of these two great historic religions to prove that religion can heal and reconcile and not just divide and persecute. It will not be easy because there is deep bitterness and suffering, but already modest but significant steps are taking place. <P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Groups of Muslim and Christian women, who have been brought up to regard each other with suspicion, if not distaste and hatred, are meeting together as mothers to ask what it means to have their sons in the war. They are beginning to meet as human beings and to listen to each other, which is crucial.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para27"></a>In the Christian context the recent agreement at Wunlit between the Nuer and the Dinka, who have a history of violence, hatred and killing, is one more building block in this new building of peace in Sudan.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para28"></a>If the Minister was in any way responsible for this, I thank her warmly, but yesterday at Question Time I drew her attention to the intention of the Government of Sudan to evict the Episcopal Church at Omburman from its headquarters, and today I received a message relayed by the Sudanese Embassy from Dr Mustapha Osman Ismail saying that this will not happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para29"></a>These are small things, straws in the wind, but I would argue that the time has now come to take those straws and to build for peace. Active and sustained involvement by Her Majesty's Government is greatly to be desired. I can assure the Minister that the churches, and I believe devout Muslims, will play their part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, I regret that I must follow the right reverend Prelate's contribution, which was so optimistic, with a more disturbing analysis. Given the Question before us, I will focus on three issues: first, the bombing of the Al Shifa factory; secondly, reports of the import and manufacture of chemical weapons by the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime--I cannot call it the government because it forcibly replaced the elected government and has no legitimacy--and, thirdly, continuing violations of the ceasefire by the NIF, including allegations of the use of chemical weapons.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para30"></a>The Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory is inherently capable of manufacturing chemicals which can be used for chemical weapons. Usage of facilities can be changed overnight. As far as I know, there has been no investigation by the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Warfare. However, there are convincing reports that there are other facilities in Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan which are used for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. At least one of those is in a residential area and, if that had been bombed, there would have been many civilian casualties.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para31"></a>For further evidence, I refer to the film shown on Channel 5 in October 1998 called Exporting Evil--Saddam's Hidden Weapons which gives chilling accounts of the export of weapons of mass destruction and the personnel and means for manufacturing them from Iraq to Sudan. Among those giving evidence is a senior UNSCOM inspector, whose testimony cannot be lightly dismissed. Obviously, the NIF regime's supporters did not like that film and complained to the ITC. The film's producer, Damien Lewis, answered all the criticisms. The complaint was dismissed; the report stands, and the claims that Sudan is making chemical weapons must be taken seriously.
<P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para32"></a>Even more serious are the reports that the NIF has used chemical weapons against its own people. During recent visits to different parts of Sudan, I have been given repeated accounts of the use of unconventional munitions by NIF forces in southern Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountains. Descriptions of the shells and of the aftermath are always consistent: the shells emit smoky gas which cause symptoms of eye and skin irritation, followed by intense vomiting and bleeding. Some victims die, others survive. Experts claim that the symptoms are entirely compatible with poisoning by arsenical compounds such as Lewisite. Water in some craters is a deep crimson viscous fluid, unlike any liquid seen in conventional high explosive craters. I am placing a photograph in the Library. Vegetation subsequently changes colour and atrophies.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para33"></a>Then, on 21st, 22nd and 23rd July, the NIF dropped 16 bombs in Lianya in southern Sudan. Descriptions of the after-effects are identical to those of the other incidents. But on this occasion UN relief workers were hospitalised and local people suffered. The United Nations sent in an investigative team, including a Canadian chemical weapons expert. Surprisingly, it was recalled just before arriving on location. There are also reports of an as yet unidentified team who arrived at the site very shortly after the bombings, and who effected what appears to have been such a thorough clean-up job that by the time subsequent investigators arrived there was not a single metal fragment to be found.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para34"></a>This abandonment of any full and publicly accountable investigation has left local people terrified and aid organisations deeply concerned. Equally worrying is the message to the NIF; that it can use these unconventional weapons with impunity.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para35"></a>However, we have facilitated an independent investigation. Samples have been collected and we are presently seeking full co-operation of the government in analysing one set of these samples. Others are being analysed elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para36"></a>There is enough evidence to demonstrate that the NIF's record of brutality is as savage as any in the world today. As recently as 1st June I was in the oil-rich areas of western Upper Nile and witnessed the attempted ethnic cleansing of the local civilians to clear the land for oil exploitation. NIF Antonov bombers and helicopter gunships had bombed and terrorised them; then massive forces had swept through the region, killing scores of people, destroying 6,000 homes, seven churches, three clinics, and burning all the crops. We have the evidence in photographic and video form.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para37"></a>Therefore, in response to the noble Lord's Question, I hope that the Government will not in any way disassociate themselves from the United States' robust response to the murder of hundreds of people in the bombings of its embassies in Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salaam. It is generally acknowledged that Sudan was implicated in those bombings, and the noble Lord, Lord McNair, seems strangely unconcerned about the victims of those bombings. Furthermore, his concern <P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pales into relative insignificance, given the cumulative evidence of the likely use of chemical weapons by the NIF.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para38"></a>Therefore, will the Minister give an assurance that the Government will not in any way lessen their pressure on the NIF to desist from massacres or ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of civilians from their lands in Bahr-el-Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, the Moslem Beja territories of eastern Sudan and the oilfields in western Upper Nile.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-20_para39"></a>The bombing of the Al Shifa factory was a response to the bombings of the United States' embassies with all the attendant death and suffering caused by those bombings. But it is not only the bombing of those embassies which needs to be taken into account. It is well known that Sudan harbours and trains international terrorists who are responsible for such acts of violence. Many are now involved in fighting in Chechnya and Dagestan and terrorist activities elsewhere in Russia.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para0"></a>And the evidence suggests that not since Iraq gassed its own people has a regime so systematically used chemical weapons against its own people. Now, as then, the West looks the other way. So I hope that this Government, committed to an ethical, human rights based foreign policy, which I respect, will stop looking the other way and support the United States in more sanctions until this brutal regime stops murdering its own people and spreading terror and destruction far beyond its own borders.

<A NAME="91013-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kennet: </B>   My Lords, the House should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for having raised the question of Sudan at this moment when it was perhaps fading a bit out of sight. I, for one, learned a great deal from what said and also from what the right reverend Prelate said about the Christians and Muslims and everybody else in Sudan.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para1"></a>The Minister may find it difficult to sum up in a way that will encompass the contributions made by the noble Lord, Lord McNair, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, has the advantage of having been in the Sudan, which I never have, and so I must defer to her up to a point. But I firmly reject her global picture of relations between Sudan and the United States, and Sudan and this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para2"></a>I want to tell a particular story. An interview on the Al Shifa bombing was given by a Sudanese opposition politician to a Jordanian journalist only a few days after the bombing. The Sudanese said that he had given what later turned out to be false information--that the Al Shifa plant was producing chemical weapons--only because to do so was &#147;disobliging to the [Sudanese] Government" (which was his aim).
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para3"></a>Soon after the CIA and the DIA withdrew a sheaf of reports that they had previously issued about Sudan on the grounds that they were not reliable. I think that we may assume that much of the information must have come from the Sudanese businessman, whose name is missing from my records, for which I apologise. Our friends in Washington, the American Government, are by now pretty shamefaced and apologetic that this country should have been linked with the episode, and that we should have received threats on account of our support. Next time I hope that Her Majesty's Government will check, double check and triple check DIA and CIA-based information, whether it comes directly at intelligence level or through the President himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para4"></a>It is still the case that the CIA Kids' Page on the Internet tells the world that in this country we have no elections, and that it is the Queen who appoints the Prime Minister. While I know that in a certain sense it is the Queen who appoints the Prime Minister, I have always piously believed that the role of Parliament was considerable in such choices. The purpose of the CIA Kids' Page is long-term recruiting. It used to say that this country had obtained its independence in 1801. I have often wondered from whom, but the CIA text had nothing to say on that point. That story has at least now been changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para5"></a>My final point is about the Summary of World Broadcasts (SWB). It is linked administratively--but only administratively--with the BBC Overseas Service. They share the building. SWB works in the opposite direction. It feeds information into this country from every other country in the world by monitoring public broadcasting and television and putting out each day a sheaf of papers up to about 90 pages thick. This service is free to Members of both Houses of Parliament. It costs many tens of pounds each day to everyone else. It is an extraordinary privilege that we receive it free. It is without exception the finest sustained day to day report of what is being said on the airwaves of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para6"></a>A few years ago--I should like to ask the Minister what is happening now--every morning the SWB was pushed over to the Research Department of the Foreign Office. This had a bad effect. The people who needed it were the frontline departments. They were in action diplomatically every day; but they did not receive it. I hope that the situation has now changed. I do not press the noble Baroness for an answer today. But it would be good to know that that priceless resource is available to the people in this country who most need it; namely, the working diplomats in the Foreign Office and elsewhere.

<A NAME="91013-21_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for raising this Question. I shall be interested to know whether the Minister has any firm information on whether the factory made chemicals for warfare as well as pharmaceuticals or whether it is a US mistake, as was the bombing of the <P>


<a name="column_448"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Chinese Embassy in the Balkans. I shall be grateful if the noble Baroness can also say whether a claim for damages by the factory owner against the US Government has been filed; and, if so, whether it has been accepted or rejected or whether this claim is still under negotiation or in the court. I shall ask the Minister a number of questions. I, too, shall be happy for the noble Baroness to write in response to any which she does not answer today.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para7"></a>At col. 210 of the Official Report yesterday, the noble Baroness referred to the July bombing by the Sudanese Government; and to allegations of use by the Government of Sudan forces of chemical weapons. It is obviously impossible to know whether or not these had been made in the Al Shifa factory. We probably do not know for certain whether the allegation is true. If the Sudan Government signed the Chemical Weapons Convention on 25th May, as the Minister informed us yesterday, why has not the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigated the results of the July bombing, which was two months after Sudan signed the convention? Surely such investigations have to be carried out immediately. My noble friend Lady Cox talked about subsequent investigations after evidence had been removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para8"></a>I refer also to the three UN World Food Programme aid workers who were allegedly caught up in the aftermath of the attack and hospitalised in Nairobi. Can the Minister tell us whether that is correct? Were their injuries consistent with having suffered from chemical weapons?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para9"></a>My noble friend talked about a team--I believe also from the UN World Food Programme--going to investigate but being recalled, perhaps for their protection. I have also heard that they collected blood samples from the area before they left. Can the noble Baroness tell us what reports were made both on the three WFP workers and on the blood samples? Have there been any subsequent allegations of use of chemical weapons in Sudan? None has come to me. I wonder whether the Government are aware of any.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para10"></a>Has the OPCW started working in Sudan? Is it ready to do so if any allegation of chemical warfare arises? Is it ready to move swiftly? Where is the local team based? How long would it take to get to any spot in the Sudan if allegations are made again?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para11"></a>What we need is authoritative and factual information on whether the Sudanese Government are using chemical weapons. I believe that that is important. We hear about allegations. It would be helpful to have from the Minister the up-to-date position on whether we have absolute proof.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para12"></a>Finally, I have seen allegations that chemical weapons are being manufactured in El Obeid in Sudan and that another factory for constructing chemical weapons is being built in Katdugli. Can the Minister assure the House that if there is any backing to these allegations the OPCW will investigate that and any other such allegations? It is encouraging that Sudan has signed the convention. It is right that the UN should take action as a result when allegations are made. As I have already said, we need to know the facts.

<A NAME="91013-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ahmed: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for raising this Question in your Lordships' House and enabling us to debate the important issues related to international law and unilateral action taken by the United States.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para13"></a>The United Nations Charter prohibits the use of force by one state against another except for action taken collectively with the authority of the Security Council under Article 42 or, in the exercise of self-defence, under Article 51 when an armed attack occurs on a member state. There are conditions attached to this latter part. The circumstances must be such that if the Security Council had had the time it would have taken measures broadly in line with those taken by the state claiming to act in self-defence.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para14"></a>The American Government's cruise missile attack on one of the poorest countries in the world had no mandate from the United Nations Security Council. Nor was it attacked by Sudan. The principle of a super power taking unilateral action against a poor African nation without any warning, based solely on unreliable intelligence sources, about which we have heard tonight, could only result in such a violation of international law and foreign policy blunder.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNair, pointed out that even former President Jimmy Carter said that US State Department officials admit that there was no evidence, only strong allegations of Sudan being involved in state sponsored international terrorism. That point was explained by the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para16"></a>In January samples from Al Shifa were tested by laboratories including TND Prins Maurits in The Hague, one of the top dozen laboratories in the world for chemical weapons testing, using the two most advanced techniques in the world. They found no evidence that the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant was producing any chemicals other than medicines desperately needed by the poor people of Sudan.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para17"></a>Immediately after the missile attack, the US national security adviser, Samuel Berger, claimed that the Al Shifa (Arabic for &#147;the cure") was part of the Sudanese military industrial complex, that it was heavily guarded, that it produced no medicines, and that its ownership trail led to Osama bin Laden.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para18"></a>Within 24 hours of the attack the German ambassador in Khartoum, Werner Daum, confirmed that it was not a heavily guarded installation, although a power plant a quarter of a mile away was. Al Shifa did indeed produce large amounts of medicines, some under contract to the United Nations. Independent investigators from Kroll Associates in London concluded that the plant was certainly not part of the Sudanese military industrial complex.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para19"></a>Finally, the owner of the factory was a private citizen, as has been mentioned previously. He is a Saudi businessman, Mr. Salah Idris, who has never had any connection with Osama bin Laden.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para20"></a>Since last year over 1,100 missiles have been launched against 298 targets in Iraq because Saddam Hussein refuses to allow the UN inspectors to inspect <P>


<a name="column_450"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the alleged chemical factories. Repeatedly, Sudan has asked the United Nations and the international community to visit the country and investigate. The Americans declined the invitation because they would have had to admit that they have made a mistake and pay compensation to Mr Idris for the destruction of his factory. They would have had to apologise to the family of a worker who was killed and 12 others who were injured in the attack.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para21"></a>President Clinton has apologised repeatedly to China for wrongly bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Why not apologise to Sudan? Clearly, it is a case of &#147;might is right". President Clinton has also apologised to Guatemala, another victim of American foreign policy. He has apologised to the Africans for the transatlantic slave trade. He apologised on almost a daily basis for the unfortunate Monica Lewinsky affair. It is time now for the American President to apologise to the people of Sudan and embark on a new chapter in America's relations with the Islamic world.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para22"></a>I am aware that a few Members of the House have already spoken. They speak regularly in debates about Sudan. Yesterday the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, displayed photographs of alleged bombing by the government in the south and the alleged use of chemical weapons which are difficult to detect on photographs even in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para23"></a>Early this year Sudan signed the UN chemical weapons convention and yesterday the Minister pointed out that it is up to the international community to determine the truth of the allegations. Perhaps I may recognise some positive steps taken by the Sudanese Government. There is the protection of human rights through a new constitution; freedom of association leading to multi-party elections; freedom of the press; the offer of a UN-monitored referendum on self-determination for the south and a new national security Act which demands accountability from the police and the security forces to Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para24"></a>On 5th August a comprehensive and unilateral cease-fire was announced by the Sudanese Government. Yesterday it was extended for a further three months. I call upon the supporters of the SPLA to do the same and bring peace and prosperity to this nation.

<A NAME="91013-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I would also like to thank the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for securing this debate. The facts of what took place on 20th August last year, when the United States launched a cruise missile attack on the Al Shifa plant in Khartoum, are well known. But like my noble friend Lady Cox, I believe that it is important for your Lordships to recall the context of the attack on the Al Shifa plant. More than 100 innocent victims were killed in Africa as a result of a savage and senseless act of terrorism, the sole purpose of which was to kill and injure ordinary people going about their daily business. From these Benches we remember those who died, and we offer our sympathy to their families who will suffer the loss of their loved ones for the rest of their lives.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para25"></a>I would like to take this opportunity to condemn absolutely all acts of terrorism. From these Benches we will always give our support to the Government to ensure that terrorism is fought in all its forms wherever it may occur, whenever it may occur and whatever its motivation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para26"></a>Indeed, because of this, we echoed the support that the Government gave to the United States Government for their attack in August of last year. The US Administration maintained that they were taking action against international terrorism and further asserted that they had compelling evidence that the plant was being used for the production of chemical weapons materials and was associated with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, the man responsible for the embassy bombings.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para27"></a>Furnished with this information from one of our key allies, we believe that the Prime Minister acted rightly to support the United States in this strike against international terrorism. Yet although the context in which this act of retaliation took place is clearly of critical importance in this House, we are all agreed that vengeance for the lives of the innocent wreaked upon the innocent would be pyrrhic indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para28"></a>Since the attack over a year ago questions have been repeatedly asked about the true purpose of the factory. Did it manufacture chemical weapons or did it manufacture pharmaceuticals? The owner of the factory, Salah Idris, has since drafted a law suit, as we have heard this evening, seeking compensation for the loss of his factory. For the past year the Government have reiterated their willingness to rely on the statement of the United States Administration that it had compelling evidence for its action.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para29"></a>However, the American case appears to rely on the analysis of a single soil sample, although contradictory evidence has since come to light concerning both the chemical analysis and the origin of the sample. This evidence has been repeatedly reported in the American press. Indeed, less than two months ago the Washington Post reported that CIA analysts had produced a three-page document in July 1998 which raised questions about the conclusions which could safely be drawn from the soil sample. The Minister will also be aware of the opinions of eminent figures such as Professor Williams from Oxford University who have expressed doubts.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para30"></a>Much of that evidence, which appears to contradict the US position, may possibly be hearsay and gossip concocted by the press and based only on partial facts. But given the speculation and the questions raised over the use of the facility in the aftermath of the attack, questions which have simply not gone away, I hope that the Minister will agree that it is important that the Government are able to substantiate the US Government's position from independent sources.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para31"></a>From these Benches, we naturally would not expect the Minister to go into details of intergovernmental communications and intelligence reports. However, I should like an assurance from the Minister this evening that the Government are satisfied that the soil <P>


<a name="column_452"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sample is genuine, that the work done on it was properly conducted and that the evidence upon which the action was taken was conclusive.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para32"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, has just mentioned, simply taking the word of the American Administration is now not enough. It cannot be forgotten that the tragic error which led NATO to target the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May during the air campaign against Serbia demonstrated that the intelligence assets and technology of the United States are not infallible. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister would tell us whether she is in a position to confirm independently the belief of the US Government that the Al Shifa factory site in Khartoum was indeed a chemical factory, capable of producing the deadly V series of chemical weapons, and not a pharmaceutical plant, as claimed by the Sudanese Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para33"></a>Can the Minister also say whether any official or Minister at the Foreign Office has met the engineer who set up the factory, as they were invited to do during the debate in another place in March, and what conclusions they have reached as to the factory's capabilities as a result of such a meeting?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para34"></a>Furthermore, will the Minister tell the House what reply the Government have given to the invitation from the Sudanese Government for a United Kingdom verification mission to examine the Al Shifa factory site or for a UN weapons inspections of the site, and what steps they have taken to make it clear to the Government of Sudan that the way to achieve an examination of the Al Shifa site is for Sudan to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para35"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response to the important questions which have been raised this evening. I hope that the right reverend Prelate will forgive me for I cannot agree with him that this chapter is completely closed for the reasons and questions which I have just raised. However, I totally agree with him that we need to focus on Sudan in the border context. I was grateful for his comments in that regard. Last year the Select Committee on International Development recognised and recommended that the Government should urge the United Nations to broker a peace agreement in Sudan and the surrounding region to end conflict, not only in Sudan but also in neighbouring countries such as north Uganda, and that such an initiative should,

<A NAME = "91013-21_para36"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para37"></a>From these Benches, we believe that the role of the United States will be key to making significant progress in Sudan. There is some hope on that front. Earlier this year, the US Administration appointed a special envoy to Sudan in order to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis there, to shine the spotlight on Sudan's egregious human rights record, to marshal greater international awareness and concern for those issues and to reinforce US support for the IGAD peace process. I hope, now that our embassy in Khartoum is once more fully operational after a period of 11 months, that we shall be able to continue to urge progress in that direction.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-21_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the debate this evening has covered a wide range of difficult issues and the participation of noble Lords from all sides of the House is a demonstration of the depth of the interest this country has in the Sudan. The links between the people of the United Kingdom and the Sudanese are historic and remain strong. The continuing terrible suffering of the Sudanese people as a result of war is rightly felt strongly. I therefore welcome the opportunity to speak about this Government's policy towards the Sudan. I also commend the noble Lord, Lord McNair, for initiating the debate. He asked a very specific question and I should like to address that first before putting it into a wider context.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para39"></a>As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, he gave his support to the US action against the Al Shifa factory last August as action against international terrorists. The US told us at the time of the strike on the Al Shifa factory that it had compelling evidence that the plant was being used for the production of chemical weapons materials. As noble Lords are well aware, and as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has kindly indicated, I cannot go into the details of the intelligence reports and confidential intergovernmental communications. Those are covered by the code of practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para40"></a>In response to the noble Lord's question, I can say that I have been assured that in accordance with usual practice, there was evidence upon which Her Majesty's Government could act. Noble Lords are also well aware of this Government's determination to fight terrorism wherever it occurs, and whatever its motivation. The UK more than many countries in the world has experienced the horrors of terrorism at first hand. Terrorists must realise that they cannot act with impunity and that we shall do all we can to prevent further atrocities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para41"></a>As we have said to the Sudanese Government on many occasions, the way to clear their name on the whole issue of chemical weapons manufacture was to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Conventions. As noble Lords are aware, the convention prohibits the acquisition, development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. It is supported by a verification regime consisting of data declaration and on-site inspections.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para42"></a>The OPCW can investigate only when asked to do so through the EU. We have urged the Government of Sudan to invite such an investigation. Her Majesty's Government promptly welcomed the news in May this year that the Sudanese Government had indeed signed the convention. That opens the way for Sudan to submit its declarations on its chemical sites to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical <P>


<a name="column_454"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 454</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Weapons and for the consideration of inspections by that organisation. That will also allow chemical weapons allegations to be looked at by the appropriate expert body.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para43"></a>I suggest that further issues in relation to the Al Shifa factory are really a matter for the Sudanese and US Governments. There have been claims made, as I understand it, by the owner of Al Shifa in relation to the US, and those matters are being dealt with between those two parties. Noble Lords will of course be aware of the recent developments in UK-Sudan relations, and we have had mention of them tonight. Following the events of last August about which we have been talking, the Sudanese Government withdrew their top two diplomats from London and demanded that we withdraw our ambassador and his deputy from Khartoum. Sadly, this made it impossible for us to maintain an embassy in the Sudan and we were forced to withdraw temporarily all our British staff.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para44"></a>In the following months we maintained regular contact with the Sudanese authorities both in London and in Khartoum. Discussions covered a whole range of issues, including the US attack on Al Shifa and comments made by Her Majesty's Government. Those talks led, as your Lordships are now aware, to a visit by Dr Hassan Abdin, Under-Secretary at the Sudanese Ministry of External Relations, to London in June when we agreed that the constructive way forward was to look to the future and to turn a new page. As your Lordships are also now aware, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary then met his Sudanese opposite number, Dr Mustafa Osman Ismail, in New York last month. Again the discussions focused clearly on the future; on normalising relations by returning ambassadors to capitals in the near future; and on areas of concern to both our Governments in the coming months.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para45"></a>That is the position today of both our Governments and so I should like to take this opportunity to speak about what the future now holds, a subject many noble Lords have also looked to. I entirely agree with the sentiments so elegantly expressed by the right reverend Prelate, that what matters now most to the people of Sudan is an end to the terrible suffering caused by civil war. Only when peace is established will the Sudanese be able to rebuild their lives which have been torn apart by a war that has gone on for some 40 years with only one significant break. That is why Her Majesty's Government have given peace in the Sudan a new priority and that is why one of the key areas of work for our re-established embassy in Khartoum will be peace work--a task we can only perform usefully if on the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para46"></a>We have been active supporters of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development--IGAD--peace process. That process is the one to which the two main parties to the conflict--the Government of Sudan and the SPLA--have agreed, and through which an initial agreement on the form of a settlement--the Declaration of Principles--was agreed. It is a regional organisation dealing with a regional conflict. We are well aware of some of the limitations of this process and the slow progress it has <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made recently. We have, therefore, with other donors, helped to establish a permanent secretariat in Nairobi which will allow for an accelerated and sustained negotiation. We shall be working closely with the IGAD special envoy, Daniel Mboya, and all the parties to try to push the process forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para47"></a>In July 1988 the late Derek Fatchett, then Minister responsible for Sudan, visited Nairobi and Khartoum to discuss the possibility of securing a break in the fighting in the areas most affected by the humanitarian crisis. As a result of his visit, both the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army announced an initial three-month ceasefire in Bahr al Ghazal. That has been extended ever since.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para48"></a>When my right honourable friend the Secretary of State recently met his counterpart, Mustafa Osman, in New York, he stressed again the importance the UK attaches to an extension of the ceasefire and the role it plays in alleviating the humanitarian situation in southern Sudan, and in the search for peace.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para49"></a>My right honourable friend further encouraged this extension by writing to the Government of Sudan and the SPLA. Yesterday the Government of Sudan, in part response to the UK request, announced an extension to the current ceasefire. I understand that the SPLA is also going to announce an extension and I look forward to confirmation of that. I hope that the ceasefire will give confidence to the two parties to pursue broader peace negotiations within the IGAD framework.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para50"></a>Her Majesty's Government see the focus of peace efforts as being within IGAD, but we shall also be promoting the cause in other fora, not least in the European Union and in the United Nations. As many of your Lordships are aware, the work of civil society is also key to promoting peace and we also hope to maintain close working links with those, such as the churches, who are active in that field.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para51"></a>Peace in the Sudan will be the main theme of our future policy. But, as we have heard tonight, there are other issues of importance in our relationships with the Sudan about which we shall also be in dialogue with the Sudanese, not least human rights, cultural ties and commercial ties. In our efforts to alleviate the humanitarian situation, the UK is one of the largest bilateral donors. We have committed over &#163;180 million to Sudan and the Sudanese refugees through Operation Lifeline Sudan since 1991, &#163;28 million in 1998 as a result of the famine, and &#163;9 million in 1999 so far. We shall continue to assess the needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para52"></a>The Government look to the future, as the right reverend Prelate exhorted us to do. Our aim and our major concern is how to improve people's lives--in this case, the lives of the people of Sudan. There is a forum to address chemical weapons concerns--the OPCW--and there are fora in which to promote peace and reconciliation. I take this opportunity to commend the work that several noble Lords have done to improve the lives of the Sudanese. I can assure your Lordships that they remain a priority for this Government also.
<P>


<a name="column_456"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 456</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para53"></a>I turn briefly to a few of the matters that have been raised. I turn first to the points raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford. We understand that three foreign aid workers were hospitalised in Nairobi. One was British and came to the UK for treatment. None of the three has released details of their illnesses to us. The British worker is back at work in the Sudan and we have no information about the whereabouts of the others. To date we have no definitive evidence which would justify the assertion that chemical weapons have been used.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para54"></a>In relation to the chemical attack on 23rd July referred to by the noble Lord, Lord McNair, we understand that the UN sent two medical teams to the area where attacks were alleged. There has been no conclusive report in relation to that matter either. None has been released by an authoritative and neutral body. As I have already said, the Sudan has signed and ratified the CWC, which provides for the authoritative mechanism through the OPCW to investigate allegations of chemical attack. Through the EU we have urged and continue to urge the Sudanese Government to use that mechanism for the purpose for which it was intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-21_para55"></a>I am grateful too for the comments made by the Loyal Opposition. To close, I would commend to your Lordships the words of the right reverend Prelate--that we are looking for peace. It would appear at the moment that we are moving in the right direction. There are several specific questions to which I have not been able to respond. I hope that noble Lords will permit me to write to them in due course in relation to those matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>   moved Amendment No. 137:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 67, line 38, leave out (&#147;each of").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 141 and 144.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para3"></a>The severe disablement allowance has a noble ancestry. It started life as a provision for a greatly neglected group--housewives. It has become of vital benefit for disabled people who, through no fault of their own, were not able to pay national insurance contributions. It has been a unique benefit, not means tested and paid solely on the grounds of severe disability, and 80 per cent disability is required.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para4"></a>SDA was paid at a lower rate than incapacity benefit. Therefore, many people also needed to claim income support, but 30 per cent did not. Having SDA as a right gave all severely disabled people a valuable income. It gave them dignity and a measure of independence. Ministers may feel that it is justifiable to <P>


<a name="column_457"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abolish the benefit because 70 per cent can claim income support, which is a higher amount. However, it is utterly wrong to discard the severe disablement allowance until there is provision for all those groups of people who now benefit. I am afraid that is not the Government's current policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para5"></a>The Government have made a welcome provision in Clause 60 to allow young people with no chance of work but who have not had the opportunity to make national insurance contributions to gain access to incapacity benefit paid at a higher rate than the SDA. That is very welcome and I congratulate the Government. But apart from the provision for some carers, there is nothing for the other 80 per cent of disabled people who would receive severe disablement allowance. It is remarkable that in today's climate, a Labour Government are planning the removal of such an important disability benefit with no replacement for many people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para6"></a>My Amendment No. 141 is a compromise amendment. It extends the compassion and logic of the Government's proposals for young disabled people to other small, clearly defined groups who may be disadvantaged by the abolition of the severe disablement allowance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para7"></a>One group whose case I plan to argue is those people receiving the new disabled person's tax credit but who are in low-paid employment. However, my noble friend Lady Hollis has accepted this without hearing my argument. I am grateful to her for her mind reading. She is obviously psychic. I hope that she will be able to extend that psychic capacity to the other amendments. In the meantime, I am delighted that she has accepted it and I thank her very much indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para8"></a>The other important group who will lose out as a result of the Government's proposals includes those who do not work because they stay at home to look after disabled relatives or children. Of course they are mainly women. Women, women, women: it is always the women who suffer. The Government will provide for carers, but only those carers who have previously worked but have then left work to care for disabled people. They are receiving ICA. However, there are many other carers whom I hope the Government will be able to consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para9"></a>The Government claim that the world has changed. They say that now women work and pay national insurance contributions. We know that. Further, they say that benefit should not go to women who have chosen not to build up a contribution record, and that is that. It is true that most women do now work and are therefore eligible for incapacity benefit, having paid national insurance contributions. However, there are 2.4 million women who work but who earn below the national insurance threshold and cannot build up a contribution record. That is real poverty. It is extremely unlikely that this group would have specifically chosen not to earn enough to pay contributions and thus deprive themselves of access to the benefit. They may have childcare or other caring responsibilities, and that is why they have a part-time <P>


<a name="column_458"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>job. My compromise amendment would provide compensation should they become 80 per cent disabled, which is an enormous disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para10"></a>If the Government are correct and women now have little need of the severe disablement allowance, the numbers claiming it would have fallen, but they have not. The latest government statistics from the DSS Analytical Services Division for May 1999 show that the number of people claiming SDA has remained consistent over the past two years, 1997 to 1999, having risen gradually from 1995 to 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para11"></a>Once again, this Government are penalising one group of severely disabled people to pay for the improved benefits of another group. On 20th July this year when the House debated the case of disabled women with no contribution record and no access to means-tested benefits, my noble friend Lady Hollis said that she did not believe that disabled women had a prior claim on disability benefits over young people. My noble friend feels that this group of women should make sacrifices to pay for improved benefits for young disabled people. However, such improvements should be paid for by wealthy people or by the general taxpayer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para12"></a>I wish to conclude by saying that I hope that the Government will feel able to accept my compromise amendment. It would give the higher rate of incapacity benefit to several groups of severely disabled people who deserve it. If the Government accept Amendment No. 141, I shall not seek to press for the deletion of Clause 61, which ends the severe disability allowance. However, if the Government cannot accept my compromise, I shall seek a Division on Amendment No. 144. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, again I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Ashley for the force and clarity with which he moved his amendments. As he knows, any debate about the severe disablement allowance--SDA--is of special importance to me because it was one of the four major new benefits for disabled people and their carers introduced in my five years as Minister for Disabled People from 1974 to 1979. They also included the invalid care allowance which was discussed on an earlier amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para13"></a>When official rhetoric about it was in full flood, the boldest claim for this Bill was that, more than 50 years on, it revised and modernised Beveridge. But if Clause 60, as drafted, stays in this Bill we shall see a reversion to one of the ugliest features of Beveridge; namely, the denial of an income support benefit in their own right to disabled married women and others.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para14"></a>Beveridge was revised and modernised by an historic decision of the last Labour government to provide a non-contributory income support benefit as of right to people who, due to severe disability, had never been able to work and pay national insurance contributions. Before that decision they were non-people in terms of statutory income support and it was this that led the late Megan du Boisson and Berit Thornbury to found the Disablement Income Group in the 1960s.
<P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 459</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para15"></a>In a recent letter Berit Thornbury said she was &#147;appalled" by this clause in the Bill. She and many others see it as a weird and cruel &#147;reform" that turns the clock back to 1977 and consigns disabled married women once again to being nonentities in the social security system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para16"></a>Let me strongly re-emphasise that Clause 60 is in truth not a reform of Beveridge but a return to one of the worst features of the system his report created.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para17"></a>In previous debates I have spoken of those who will benefit from the changes this Bill proposes. I welcomed in particular the help envisaged for 20 to 24 year-olds in full-time education. But today we must also consider the losers. Around one-third of SDA claimants who are not eligible for income support will be the main losers. They include every severely disabled person whose partner works on average more than 24 hours a week.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para18"></a>One of them is a married woman suffering from Guillan-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. She is a wheelchair user, now receiving &#163;52.70 a week in severe disablement allowance. Her husband works 40 hours a week. So under Clause 60 she will not be entitled to income support when she loses her SDA. Nor it appears will she be able to claim earnings replacement benefit in her own right.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para19"></a>The Government have stated that they want disabled people to lead a fulfilling life with dignity, but the Citizens' Advice Bureau, commenting on this and other cases, says that,

I very much hope he will now recognise that many such people will be very badly let down by headlong retreat from the radical reform that created a non-contributory income benefit as of right for severely disabled housewives in the 1970s.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para23"></a>I ask again tonight: what kind of radical reform is it that inflicts gratuitous and unmerited further hardship on severely disabled people? And what kind of moral crusade is it that hurts them at a time when the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists that our economy has never been stronger or more prosperous?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, first I must apologise to the House and to the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, for not being in my place when he moved Amendment No. 141. I can only claim that the enunciator was a few seconds behind. It is the first time that I have been off since 1942, when I was appearing with Sir Donald Wolfit at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, and unfortunately I was ogling the chorus girls in &#147;Chu-Chin-Chow" at the theatre opposite, the Empire Theatre, Nottingham, at the time and failed to be on my cue in &#147;King Lear". I was severely reprimanded, as I am sure I shall be for tonight's indiscretion.

<A NAME = "91013-22_para24"></a>I would like to support the noble Lord, however, in seeking to protect disabled carers and disabled low earners. I hope that the Minister in replying will be able to reassure your Lordships that at least some of those the amendment seeks to protect are already or will indeed be protected.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para25"></a>The logic of the Government's position, as I understand it, is that they wish to rule out those who could have worked but chose, for whatever reason, not to work. By that same logic, it would be unfair to exclude those whose caring responsibilities and personal disability prevent work, or who have in fact been working but have had low earnings because of disability. Some are easier to identify than others, but the focus of this amendment is on those who have already been identified and singled out for social security purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-22_para26"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively to this amendment.

<A NAME="91013-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to sound pedantic and I do not want to exasperate the House, but I think that the noble Earl might refer to DLA, which is a non-contributory benefit of major significance for disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-23_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I accept the Minister's correction and I apologise. It is the first amendment after dinner and the papers are not yet sorted. The point that it is non-contributory, however, is one which I think the Minister will not dispute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, has hit the nail on the head here. If you do not have a contribution record, you become a non-person. I shall not deal again with the argument that it is much harder to establish a contribution record for some people than it is for others. I made that point on Clause 58 and I hope that I do not need to repeat it. But the prospect of remaining a non-person is for some people quite considerable. The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, referred to the speech by the Secretary of State at Newham. I think it was in that speech, though it may have been at the one in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, in February, when he referred to families who have been without work for three generations in a row. That is not simply a matter of poverty of expectation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para1"></a>Very often the people concerned come from mining or shipbuilding areas. That is why Frank Field, the honourable Member for Birkenhead, is so aware of the problem. For many of those people there simply is not the work to be got. I am reminded by a briefing from the ME Association that the problem is further exacerbated by the fact that those who become disabled at age 16 or 17 years do not have income support on which to fall back. Those who suffer from <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>being estranged from their parents while aged 16 or 17 often find that it takes them years to struggle back, if, indeed, they ever do.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para2"></a>One of my son's closest friends, with whom he was drinking last night, was in this situation. It took him five or six years, and a very creditable achievement it is. Not all of them manage to make it. These may be people who, for over 10 or 20 years, do not get into a position where they are sufficiently engaged in the normal world to be able to build up a contribution. They were made non-persons early on and they remain so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para3"></a>For those reasons, the amount of hardship at risk and the number of people who do not have a contribution record because they are on low pay--which I am glad was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Morris--we want this clause deleted. I hope, when it comes to the point, that that may be what happens.

<A NAME="91013-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, I, too, would like to apologise for not being in my place when the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, introduced the amendment. I was involved with the Food Standards Agency debate next door.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para4"></a>The issue raised by the noble Lord is important. Severe disability allowance only goes to those who have 80 per cent or more disability. That is a serious disability which leaves a person in the hands of someone else. That person will need help. We are talking about the blind, the terminally ill and those who simply cannot look after themselves. We must remember that two-thirds of such people are women, many of whom bring up children. If we do away with SDA, what will they be left with? They must rely on their spouse. If they do not have a spouse, they will be in a great deal of trouble. We must think about this very seriously indeed. I take the opportunity earnestly to ask the Minister to think about this carefully. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, for raising the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend who has just spoken. It is helpful to have this debate. The clause which we are discussing abolishes SDA for new claimants. As has been rightly pointed out, it is a non-means tested benefit for severely disabled people who are unable to work and have not paid sufficient national insurance contributions to claim incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para5"></a>A feature of our debates on the Bill, as on other welfare matters, has always been the noble Baroness's enormous expertise and depth of knowledge. That is reflected in the answers she has given in many of our debates. I should like on this occasion to take as a text what she said on 20th July, referring to this benefit:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;I believe that that is the right focusing of the benefit--not continuing to give it to people who have chosen not to build up a contributory record, as in the case of some married women, or who would not need access to means-tested benefit because they have sufficient finances coming into the household. I do not believe that they have the prior claim on disability benefits over young people".--[Official Report, 20/7/99; col.834.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-23_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_462"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
I thought it right to give some thought to what she said and to analyse what was being proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para7"></a>The first proposition made by the noble Baroness is that SDA provides additional money to people who do not need it, and that income support is there for those in financial need. However, the Government and the noble Baroness have not provided any evidence of the household incomes of those on SDA. She has not demonstrated that those are well off households. The Government appear to be saying that provided a family is above income support level, they are effectively well-off. I do not believe that that argument is acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para8"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness seems to be saying that SDA makes no difference to 70 per cent of the recipients as they have to claim income support as a top up anyway. However, saying that income support is available if there is a financial need ignores the problem that comes with the means-tested benefits. For example, as we debated earlier this week, if someone has savings of over &#163;3,000, it is reduced. If they have capital of over &#163;8,000, they cannot claim at all. If the husband is working the family will not be eligible for income support. Thirdly, she seems to be arguing that the world has changed, that most women now go out to work and therefore build up eligibility for incapacity benefit, and that benefit should not go to women who have chosen not to build up a contributory record. In practice the sort of situation in which a married woman will claim SDA is where the husband has been working and the wife is looking after children. If she becomes disabled then, clearly, if the benefit is abolished, she will lose out.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para9"></a>Her fourth proposition is that money is better spent on increasing benefit for young disabled people who have never had the chance to work. The cuts to SDA are therefore needed to pay for the increased benefits of 16 to 19 year-olds. This has been a feature of the Bill. It is the same as the proposals on bereavement benefits where, having lost in the Court of Human Rights, the Government decided on a cut-back for widows in order to pay for the widowers. It is much the same in this case. The Minister seems to be saying that there is a fixed amount of money involved and if we spend it on this we cannot spend it on that and the priorities are wrong. That seems to be the essence of her argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para10"></a>It is very difficult to think of priorities which would justify eliminating the benefit we are discussing for the reasons set out clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, and others. If the Government are not prepared to abandon this proposal I hope that the House will take the view that they ought to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, this extensive group of amendments includes one proposed by the Government, to which I should like to speak if your Lordships agree. The amendments, under the new rules in Clause 60, extend entitlement to incapacity benefit to additional groups of disabled people and retain SDA for all other groups. The extensive nature of the amendments indicates to me that perhaps we ought to go back to say, "Why reform the SDA?" I am sorry that so many of our comments <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were perhaps misunderstood or even misrepresented by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in an authentic effort to engage with the Government's argument. If I am repeating what was said in Committee, forgive me. But given that those proceedings were quoted back at me, it is perhaps right that I should do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para11"></a>We have strong reasons for reforming SDA and we do not want anyone to doubt why we think that reform is necessary. Our core belief is that SDA is now failing. The one group who are prevented from building up entitlement to help from the national insurance system, those who become disabled before they can enter work, are likely to face a lifetime on benefit. Yet currently we only award them as of right a benefit, SDA. I am talking about people who may have had Down's syndrome, with severe learning difficulties as a consequence, cerebral palsy or the like and receiving a benefit which is so low that in almost all cases it has to be topped up by income support.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para12"></a>There has been a broad welcome, I believe, for the Government's proposed reform of SDA. As a result, there will be a future hike in income for young disabled claimants. SDA recipients aged under 20 will receive &#163;26.40 a week more than they do now. That is almost &#163;1,400 a year extra. We estimate that around 175,000 people will gain in the long term, over half of whom will be women. The notion that we are not including women, with the hands in the air that we had from the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is not true. This beneficial change, however, cannot be achieved without substantial additional cost. In the long run we estimate that cost will be about &#163;180 million net. And, of course, people who are receiving SDA at the point of change will continue to receive the benefit on the same basis as now, which means that 350,000 disabled people receiving SDA will be unaffected.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para13"></a>As noble Lords are now aware, following further consideration we have introduced an amendment which will ensure that young disabled people who become entitled to IB under these rules, but then leave benefit, for example to try work, will be able to re-qualify. The amendment will apply to those who return to benefit beyond the age limit and who are not covered by the normal linking provisions should they have to reclaim benefit after a period abroad or after earning below the lower earnings limit. As I announced when we debated the last amendment, we are extending the protection for people under the age of 25 in education. Young people in any form of education or work-based training will now have access to invalidity benefit under the new rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para14"></a>I firmly believe that our reform of severe disability allowance (SDA) is right in itself. As I said in Committee, I do not believe it right to continue to direct benefit at people--and here the noble Lord certainly quoted me correctly--who have chosen not to build up a contributory record, as is the case with some married women. Perhaps I may make a confession: I would be one of those. I joined the labour market in 1967 and chose, quite deliberately, to pay the reduced married woman's stamp. I am grateful that my noble friend Lady Castle actually abolished that <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>choice in 1978. I think that it was a misguided choice for most people. However, I chose it. I calculated just the other day that I have probably saved, out of my pocket, an extra &#163;30,000, or more, by paying the married woman's stamp.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para15"></a>Why, then, because I chose not to build up a contribution record and make myself eligible for invalidity benefit were disability to hit me, should I go on, after pocketing &#163;30,000, to be eligible, as of right, to SDA? I have no necessary financial need and I made a choice to save money all the way through. In my case, as I said, it was a matter of &#163;30,000. Is the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, really saying that I should be able to save such a sum, courtesy of taxpayers, and have a benefit on top, irrespective of my financial need and irrespective of the cost of my disability because, of course, those are covered by DLA? Is that the noble Lord's proposal? I believe that that day has gone. Indeed, we are reforming SDA because of the changing position of women more broadly.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-23_para16"></a>Disability living allowance, which was much less widely available when SDA was introduced, is now paid to the vast majority, indeed, 80 per cent of people. I give way to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful. Is it not also the case that there could be someone with a number of small part-time jobs in supermarkets, McDonald's, and so on, who cannot build up a contribution record because such jobs are separate? In those circumstances, should that person become disabled, he or she would be penalised as a result of this change.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_time0"></A><H5>9.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis: </B>   Yes, my Lords. However, that is one of the arguments I was about to deal with. If the noble Lord will allow me, I shall extend it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para0"></a>First, when severe disability allowance was introduced, DLA was rarely available, but now 80 per cent are receiving DLA. Secondly, the disability premium in income support was introduced in 1988. So, in answer to the point made by the noble Lord--namely, that it is fine if the woman has a spouse but what does she do if she is single--I should tell him that she would go on to income support with a disability premium and get a higher benefit than she would on SDA. Therefore, it would not be a case of that woman being exposed to hardship.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para1"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I can tell him that in the past 20 years the number of women acquiring eligibility and claiming invalidity benefit has gone up from 84,000 to over half a million; in other words, 500,000. That is a sixfold increase. As a result of the minimum wage and changes to the lower earnings limit (LEL), introduced by this Government, 90 per cent of women who work more than 16 hours a week, and between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of women who work less than 16 hours a week, in whatever shape or form, will now build up contributory benefit entitlement. Not only will people currently on SDA be protected but also women will <P>


<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increasingly be building up their own contributions record. In addition, given the changes on LEL and the introduction of the national minimum wage, and so on, most women will be covered in their own right as, in my view, they should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para2"></a>That is the first change as regards what has happened to the world of work and the women in it. We should remember that seven out of eight married women do not stay at home looking after the children and doing nothing else; they look after their children, as that is a priority in their lives, but they also go out to work. Almost as many married women are working as married men. The assumption that somehow women are always at home looking after the children takes no account at all of the world of work and women's place in it. That place has been transformed in the past 20 or so years.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para3"></a>The second point I want to make is that there is extra help for disabled people which the Government are providing. We shall be spending up to &#163;2 billion more on benefits for disabled people by the end of this Parliament. We are building on a commitment to comprehensive civil rights, helping disabled people to get into work through disabled person's tax credit. We have made a &#163;200 million investment in a new deal for disabled people. There will be a further &#163;18 million in the ONE programme. In addition, the most severely disabled people under 60 will receive the new disability income guarantee. In retirement, long-term disabled people with broken work records will be helped by our state second pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para4"></a>Within that context--what we are doing for disabled people in general and also for women in terms of encouraging them to build up their own contribution record to claim IB and not need SDA--we are going a long way. Of these amendments, Amendments Nos. 137 to 141 seek to extend the entitlement to IB under the new rules in Clause 60 to additional groups of disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para5"></a>Clause 60 ensures that disabled people aged under 20, or in certain circumstances under 25, will in future be entitled to IB. People with learning difficulties and with other forms of disability, either acquired at birth or at a very young age, will also benefit: they will be awarded IB. Amendment No. 144 would retain a severe disablement allowance for all claimants aged between 16 and 65: not just those who have been unable to build up a work record but those who have chosen not to build up such a record, including women like myself who have chosen to pay the married woman's reduced stamp.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para6"></a>The amendments before us would extend this generous treatment to other people of any age who, though they may not satisfy the current contribution conditions for IB will have the opportunity to work and to build up a contribution record earlier in their lives. In particular it is proposed that this should be extended to carers receiving ICA for a year, to parents and to people receiving DPTC or DWA.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para7"></a>Of course we recognise the valuable role of carers, and we are already protecting them. They will be passed forward to IB where they meet the appropriate <P>


<a name="column_466"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contribution record. Carers who are receiving ICA will be able to use credits to qualify for IB provided they have worked and paid contributions at some stage in the past and would, on the basis of those contributions, have qualified for IB under the current rules. Carers are therefore protected and I do not believe that this amendment is necessary. I could continue with the concessions that we are proposing to give to carers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para8"></a>A concession built on a record of recent caring would result in lifetime carers becoming entitled to IB only if they become incapacitated within a year or so of ceasing caring, while a lifetime unemployed could secure IB on the basis of having received ICA fairly recently.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para9"></a>Given that we are protecting the position of carers in terms of access to IB, the second part of my noble friend's amendment would apply the same principles to newly disabled people who have been, until the amendment, precluded from employment by responsibilities at home. I presume this largely means parents who have children who have chosen not to work but to stay at home and not even to go into part-time work, and thus fail to take the opportunity to build up a contribution record.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para10"></a>I do not believe that this is right. We are saying that women, parents, have the same rights, capacities and abilities, as the statistics show, to enter the world of work and protect themselves against disability, in terms of contributing to a benefit which will give them full coverage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para11"></a>The third element of my noble friend's amendment is the proposal that someone who has been receiving DPTC or DWA for 25 weeks of the last two complete years in relation to the relevant tax year should also be entitled to IB. Again, this amendment has been overtaken by events. We are extending protection under Clause 58 to certain people who might otherwise lose out through trying to work: namely, people who reclaim IB after receiving DPTC and earnings lower than LEL. For those people on DPTC who have previously been entitled to IB, on the basis of contributions paid, a special two-year linking rule also exists within IB. We therefore intend to provide that people coming off DPTC--perhaps because of a deteriorating condition--will be able to qualify for IB as now. Amendment No. 142 guarantees or ensures that that will be protected. We were worried that certain people who might be disadvantaged would need to reclaim after having left benefit; government Amendment No. 142 puts that right.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para12"></a>As your Lordships know, to be entitled to claim IB under the new rules, disabled people must be aged under 20 or, if in education or work-based training, aged under 25 when they make their claim. Having qualified for IB, these limits will stop people requalifying once they have left benefit, if they are over the appropriate age, unless they are covered by a linking rule. As now, for claims to link, the break between benefit claims must not exceed eight weeks. However, there are special rules which allow this period to be extended to 52 weeks for those who leave <P>


<a name="column_467"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>benefit to start work. Those who qualify for the disabled persons' tax credit will have that link extended to two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para13"></a>However, we have identified two groups of people for whom it would be impossible ever to requalify if they do not satisfy the current linking rules: those who take up employment and are below the LEL for a lengthy period before becoming incapable of work; and those who return to the UK after a long period abroad. Our amendments protect them and rectify that situation. Of the remaining amendments, Amendments Nos. 143 and 269 are purely technical in nature.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para14"></a>These concessions go a long way to protecting the benefit position of disabled people who have been receiving DPTC or DWA. My noble friend has argued that there should be an extension to carers. I have tried to argue that they will be protected through the new access to IB in exactly the same way as now; they are unaffected by these changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para15"></a>Secondly, my noble friend argued that parents should have access to IB as opposed to SDA in the future, irrespective of the fact that they may have chosen not to build up a contributory record. I think that is unreasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para16"></a>Thirdly, he asked for additional protection for disabled people who receive DPTC. I hope that I have reassured him that we are protecting such people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-24_para17"></a>I hope that the House will feel, believe and accept that the Government, in reforming SDA, are trying to take account of those who most need help--those who can never enter the labour market and build up the contributions which qualify them for IB. One group only is affected--young people who are either born disabled or acquire a disability at such a young age that they can never enter work. Everyone else can--and increasingly does--build up a contribution record in the world of work which qualifies them for IB and which makes SDA redundant. Given that, we believe that the time for SDA in its old form has passed. It used to be called a housewife's benefit pension. &#147;Housewife's" is not now an appropriate term; because as many married women are in work as are married men. I hope that your Lordships will accept that SDA's time has passed and that we need to go forward with benefits which more appropriately fit the world in which we live.

<FONT SIZE=3>it is not the presentation that is wrong but the policy. She is saddled with it; it is her bad luck. I offer her my sympathies.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para1"></a>I listened very carefully to my noble friend. I am afraid she has not made out a case for abolishing the severe disability allowance for new claimants. I do not propose to go over the old ground; we have done so time and time again. Basically, the Government are trying to juggle benefits. They have made a worthwhile, admirable attempt--but some of the balls are falling to the floor. That is one of the reasons why we cannot accept the proposition of my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para2"></a>There is a basic flaw in all these proposals, which I have dealt with in previous amendments; namely, the poor are being asked to pay for the very poor. That is not justifiable. The very poor should be paid for by the wealthy or by the general taxpayer. There is no getting away from that basic principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para3"></a>My noble friend says that the time for the SDA has passed. In that case, the Government should put forward proposals to deal with those whose lives have been influenced and helped by the SDA. They have not done so for all of them. I said in moving the amendment that if the Government are unable to accept my compromise amendments, I would withdraw them and press Amendment No. 144 to delete the clause at the appropriate time.

Page 68, line 5, after (&#147;cases") insert (&#147;which shall include those in which he is a student undertaking a course of further or higher education,")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Government were quick to respond to the concerns expressed by the disability lobby about their original proposals that only those aged under 20 would benefit from the transfer from severe disablement allowance to incapacity benefit. Mencap was prominent among those seeking a higher age limit, because those with learning disabilities are properly seen as slow learners rather than non-learners, and are therefore likely to be studying and training into their early twenties. We welcomed the inclusion of those undertaking training or education which began before the age of 20, provided that claim to benefit was made before the age of 25.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para7"></a>That modification of the original proposal brought within the scope of the benefit improvement those whose capacity for work was not self-evident to everyone until early adulthood. It catered in particular for those whose special educational needs were catered for within the mainstream education system. It put them on a par with those severely disabled young people who become eligible for incapacity benefit while still at school. However, we were completely taken aback by, and promptly questioned, the limitation of the age 25 concession to those in higher education or training, apparently excluding those in further education. People with learning disabilities <P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para8"></a>We have for some months been pressing Ministers and their officials to put further education on a par with higher education. That is what we understood to be the original intention. The logic is incontrovertible. Our focus has been on those applying for benefit for the first time. It seems to me that the same incontrovertible logic applies to those receiving SDA at the changeover point, under age 25, and receiving further or higher education or training which began before the age of 20. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. The distinction between further and higher education is rather silly; the two merge into one another. Whether someone is eligible for higher education, the education is ongoing and it is education in the true sense of the word. It should be pushed forward. My party was fairly active in supporting the case in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment for the reasons the other two speakers have given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, first I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rix, for tabling the amendment. It gives me the opportunity to make clear the Government's position on the issue. I am pleased to say that we agree wholeheartedly with the purpose behind it. Following representations by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, our intention to extend the age cut-off to 25 for people in higher education will not help certain young people with severe learning disability who are in mainstream education beyond the age of 20. Following those representations, we have decided to widen the concession to include people in any form of education or work-based training. I hope that this further concession will be good news to Mencap, of which the noble Lord, Lord Rix, is president, as well as to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-25_para9"></a>As noble Lords know, we intend to prescribe in regulations the circumstances in which the extended age 25 cut off will apply. We believe that it is particularly suitable for secondary legislation due to the level of detail necessary to ensure the inclusion of the new group, as well as the changing nature of educational prescription. We want to get the detail right and the use of regulations will give us this flexibility.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 146, 147 and 148 are technical amendments that do not alter the meaning of the clause but make it significantly easier to understand. They give greater clarity to the parts of the clause that define which overpayments of disability or incapacity benefits will not be recoverable. They remove unnecessary duplication and ensure that the language used is consistent throughout and is in line with the terms used in the legislation relating to adjudication.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para1"></a>As noble Lords will appreciate, this clause is all about ensuring that there is no requirement to recover overpayments of benefits where it would be unreasonable to do so. It addresses a problem that we have identified with the current rules. In some situations it is not reasonable to expect claimants who are ill or disabled to know that they should report a change in their condition to the Benefits Agency. In such cases we want to ensure that the claimant is not required to repay any overpayment of benefit which may result. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Morris, will be delighted with the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para2"></a>Clause 64 sets out the circumstances in which these overpayments would be recovered. It is important that this definition is as clear as possible. The amendments do not alter the meaning of this clause but do make the definition of the relevant overpayments easier to understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para3"></a>As I am sure your Lordships appreciate, it is important that this provision is clear in its meaning and is no more complicated than it needs to be to achieve its intended effect. I therefore ask noble Lords to accept the amendments to incorporate it in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, these government amendments are all technical amendments dealing with Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para12"></a>The majority of the subject matter of the Bill is devolved under the Northern Ireland Act. We had hoped that devolution in Northern Ireland would have occurred before the Bill received Royal Assent and any corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland would have been a matter for the Assembly. As it is likely that the Bill will be granted Royal Assent before devolution in Northern Ireland, it is prudent to take steps to ensure that corresponding Northern Ireland legislation can be enacted within a similar timescale to the rest of the United Kingdom. The negative resolution Order in Council clause is a well-established procedure for allowing Northern Ireland to legislate where it is desirable to have parity and early implementation. This new clause is provided for by Amendment No. 266.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para13"></a>The amendments ensure that corresponding provision can be made for Northern Ireland as soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 154 and 260 provide that the Social Security Advisory Committee is able to advise on Northern Ireland provisions corresponding to the measures in the Bill. I ask your Lordships to support the amendments. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is another group of technical government amendments which ensure that some regulations can apply in some parts of the country but not in others. This is necessary to enable provisions in the Bill such as the ONE service to be introduced initially in pilot areas rather than nationally. In other words, it is entirely benign.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 158 to 164 and 271. I speak first to Amendment No. 271. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who in Committee identified the technical issue relating to the drafting of Clause 84. I said at the time that I would take the matter away for further consideration and table an amendment at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para24"></a>At present Clause 84 has no specific provision for bringing the mixed measures into effect. Therefore, by default it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Social Security to make the necessary commencement order. However, as the House is aware, responsibility for national insurance policy was transferred in April this year to the Treasury and the Inland Revenue by the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Act 1999. Amendment No. 271 will therefore make Treasury Ministers responsible for appointing the date from which the national insurance contribution measures come into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-26_para25"></a>The other amendments in the group deal with the power to make regulations in relation to parts of Schedule 9 and Schedule 10. Amendments Nos. 157 and 158 make it clear that regulations in respect of the new Section 6A of the Contributions and Benefits Act will be made by the Treasury. That is currently not explicit in the drafting. Amendments Nos. 159 to 164 deal with contracted-out rebates in relation to the Pensions Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act. They relate to the power to make regulations to allow employers to recover contracted-out rebates from the Inland Revenue in cases where the rebate owed is greater than their national insurance contribution liability. That may arise, for example, where a large proportion of employees earn between the lower earnings limit and the new primary threshold because earnings in this band will be eligible for contracted-out rebates but not liable for contributions. This will bring the Pensions Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act into line with GB legislation. I urge the House to support the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may set out my stall. I am proposing to move this amendment and then speak to Amendments Nos. 168 to 180, 182, 183, 186, 188 to 200, 202 and 203. All these are government amendments.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para5"></a>My speaking notes begin to the effect that we have already debated Amendment No. 165. I shall have to start with what would have been that amendment. We last debated this matter at Committee stage on 20th July. A number of clear messages emerged during the debate. I believe that everyone agreed that there was a problem of tax and national insurance contributions avoidance where workers are hired through an intermediary. By using a one-man company and <P>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>paying himself in the form of dividends rather than salary, a worker who would clearly be an employee but for that arrangement can avoid paying national insurance at all on his earnings. He can do so without giving away any secrets of tax avoidance by paying himself out of his one-person company in dividends rather than through a salary on earnings.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para6"></a>I was relieved and reassured to hear from the Front Bench opposite that they acknowledge that the Government have a legitimate right to take steps to remove that avoidance. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;We are entirely in favour of everyone paying their fair share. It would be wrong to suppose for one moment that we are in favour of unjustified tax avoidance".--[Official Report, 20/7/99; col. 912.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-27_para7"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said on the same day:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;I do not think that the use of one-person companies for avoidance purposes is acceptable. It is an abuse of the NIC system and should be stopped".--[Official Report, 20/7/99; col. 918.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-27_para8"></a>
Although noble Lords expressed their support for the need to act, a number of them had severe concerns about how the proposals would work in practice. I confirmed that the Government were considering the issues raised in consultation with business representatives, although I made it clear that there could not be any retreat from our intention of introducing legislation to remove that avoidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para9"></a>Consultations continued throughout the summer. The Government announced revised proposals in response to the consultations on 23rd September. The Paymaster General said in her announcement that while she was determined that no one should be able to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and national insurance contributions simply because of the way they structure their relationships with their clients, she recognised that any action must not do unnecessary damage to flexible labour markets where intermediaries are currently used. Our revised proposals will tackle the avoidance in a way which is more tightly targeted and does not prevent the use of intermediaries where they provide advantages other than the avoidance of tax and NICs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para10"></a>There are three main changes to the revised approach. One thing we learned from the consultation was that both clients and workers saw benefits in the use of intermediaries--that is, these one-person companies--to hire skilled staff for short contracts, regardless of the tax and NIC advantages. The original proposals would effectively have given the client a choice between taking the worker onto his payroll for a short period, or running the risk of a PAYE and NIC liability on the contract payment which he had made to the consultant service company.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para11"></a>We were told that that threatened to take away the flexibility. We therefore decided to change the proposals so as to give the clients the option of continuing to hire workers through intermediaries on the basis of gross payment and without the risk or a new tax or NIC liability. The obligation to pay a fair share of tax and NICs will still be there, but it will be an obligation on the intermediary, not on the client.
<P>


<a name="column_478"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para12"></a>One welcome result of that approach is that there will be no need for the Inland Revenue to run a certification scheme. That was originally proposed to allow clients to identify those service companies which could continue to receive gross payments. Many were concerned about the administrative and bureaucratic demands which would result for both workers and clients.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para13"></a>The second major change concerns the method of identifying engagements or contracts which have the characteristics of employment and therefore fall within the scope of the new rules. As the House is aware, our original proposal would have relied on the degree of control that the client had over the worker as to the task and manner in which it was completed to decide whether he should be treated as an employee under the new rules. We thought that this &#147;control test" would provide simplicity and certainty for both clients and workers. That was much criticised during the consultation. Now that we have decided to remove from the client any need to identify the contracts caught by the new rules, we have had the opportunity to look again at the way in which we identify those contracts.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para14"></a>We have decided to accept the arguments made in the consultation process and to retain the existing method of determining the boundary between employment and self-employment for tax and national insurance contributions purposes, as it is used for individuals without service companies. That method is based on the courts' interpretation of the concept of employment, without a detailed statutory definition.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para15"></a>I hope that this change will be welcome. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said in previous earlier debate, the change has the backing of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Tax Law Review Committee. When referring to the replacement of the &#147;control tests" with the normal markers for determining a worker's employment status, he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;If this amendment is accepted or passed, we shall support the Clause".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-27_para16"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para17"></a>It has, however, been suggested that the definition of employment which is already used throughout the economy--including, for example, in the market research industry, which I know well--is in some way not appropriate for the information technology and engineering industries. I find that idea extraordinary. In fact, there are many people already working in the IT industry to whom those rules already apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para18"></a>Let us consider the case of two people sitting side by side in the computer department of a big company. One is an employee of the company, the other works for his own service company. They might have been there for the same length of time; they are both part of the same team and work under the same team leader, doing the same kind of work. It has been argued that because one worker has chosen to set up a service company, he is somehow an entrepreneur and deserves to pay less tax and NIC, and that because applying the normal rules to distinguish employees from the self-employed would result in taxing both in the same way, there must be something wrong with those rules. I do not think his colleague at the next desk would agree.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para19"></a>There are freelance workers in all kinds of industries, not just IT: trainers, draftsmen, writers, cameramen--in fact, 90 per cent of the film production business is made up of self-employed people. Unless they have opted out by setting up service companies, the same definition of employment applies to all of them. I see no justification for arguing that it cannot be applied to the IT industry as it has already been for all the others.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para20"></a>The announcement on 23rd September also included clarification of the amounts which could be deducted from an intermediary's receipts from clients to arrive at the amount on which class 1 NICs and, in due course, PAYE tax would be due. These deductions are: first, any expense which would be allowed to an employee in the same circumstances; secondly, any employer's contributions paid by the intermediary to an approved pension scheme on behalf of the worker; thirdly, any class 1 NICs paid by the intermediary in respect of the worker, plus a flat-rate allowance of 5 per cent of the intermediary's receipts from relevant contracts. That deduction is to recognise the general and miscellaneous expenses associated with running a service company.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para21"></a>We believe that the deductions for expenses which we have listed are fair to workers who chose to set up a company to market their skills and those who are employed directly. The effect is to make a choice whether to operate through an intermediary or as a direct employee--a neutral one--in terms of tax and NICs. Therefore, I hope that it will be agreed that the changes which we have announced address the concerns of the House and reflect the genuine nature of the consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para22"></a>I need not say much more about the IT industry. Our support for the UK IT industry is on record. Our IT specialists are world leaders. However, we do not believe that the payment of a fair level of tax and NICs will wipe out the IT industry or that IT workers will leave the UK en masse as a result of those changes. To preserve a tax avoidance device which is used by many who are not in the IT industry, and not used by many who are, would not be a good way to show support for IT.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para23"></a>Our proposal must not stop any worker continuing to supply his skills as he thinks best. It is the decision of an individual whether one is employed directly by a company or sells one's services to a service company. It is a decision for the worker to take. The Government have a duty only to ensure that, whatever decision is made, one should expect to pay a fair level of tax and NICs. If it is argued, as it has been argued by the IT industry, that that puts them at a disadvantage compared to the large and, in particular, the foreign companies which provide consultancy, I can only say that that is based on a misconception. Any company which is other than a one-person service company cannot use the loophole of paying its principal in dividends. That company must pay a payroll and therefore must pay NICs and tax on its earnings from its clients. Therefore, there is a level playing field in that respect.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para24"></a>I shall now explain--and I shall do so as quickly as I can, but we are dealing with a large group of amendments--how our amendments work. Last week we had the advantage of a seminar in which some noble Lords were able to participate. At the seminar officials from the Inland Revenue were present to explain the amendments. We were able to provide the regulatory impact assessment, which sets out the cost--or a range of costs, because that is the best we can do--to industry of these proposals. We were also able to provide the text of Clauses 71 and 72 as they will be if these amendments are agreed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para25"></a>Clearly, the revised clause must reflect the change to transfer to the intermediary the liability to pay any NICs due under the new rules. That is achieved by changing references from &#147;client" to &#147;intermediary". There are consequential changes which recognise whether it is payments made or deemed to be made to the worker by the intermediary rather than payments by the client on which NICs must be paid. That introduces the concept of attributable earnings; that is, the total earnings from the client less the four items I have already described.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para26"></a>Subsection (2) allows regulations to define an intermediary for the purposes of this provision. It is the service company which employs the worker or a partnership of which he is a partner. Subsection (3)(b) confirms that the intermediary is the secondary contributor. The new subsections on page 76 line 12 provide more detail of some of the deductions which regulations may allow in calculating attributable earnings. They provide the power to set in regulations a deduction for the general expenses in running a service company. The other main change is the amendment to remove subsection (5) which was the provision that provided for a certification scheme, which is no longer necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-27_para27"></a>I am speaking before any introduction of Opposition or Liberal Democrat amendments. Perhaps it would be for the convenience of the House if I allow noble Lords to do that. I shall then respond to them as appropriate at the end of the debate. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, Clause 71 and its Northern Ireland twin, Clause 72, raise issues which are undoubtedly of great complexity. The use of personal service companies has grown very considerably in recent years. That is undoubtedly mainly due to the tax and NIC benefits where individuals use PSCs to solve their services requirements rather than contracting direct with the client to provide those services. I should say that those benefits accrue at least as much to the client as they do to the worker. At this time of night I shall not go into an explanation of how those benefits are obtained. To some extent the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has already done that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para0"></a>There is no doubt that single person personal service companies are artificial creations which, in most cases although I accept not all, would not exist but for the tax and NIC advantages which they present. To that extent it is plain that they involve tax avoidance. The <P>


<a name="column_481"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulatory impact statement calculates that the proposed changes in law will bring an extra &#163;220 million a year into the National Insurance Fund. That is a very significant amount. Furthermore, the sums avoided will get bigger if the avoidance route presented by PSCs becomes more widespread as, if no action is taken, it almost certainly will.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para1"></a>We therefore accept that something must be done. There has been a high-pressure lobbying campaign by some organisations, notably the Professional Contractors Group, to retain the status quo. However, as I have said, many personal service companies exist only for tax and NIC avoidance purposes and action does need to be taken against them. At the same time, we accept some of the complaints from the Professional Contractors Group and others.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para2"></a>First, we believe that the existing tests for self-employment, whether or not a personal service company is involved, need to be reassessed. In particular, the existing tests tend to look at the situation as a snapshot rather than as a film; that is, they look at a single moment of time. We believe that there is a great difference between a worker who is hired for short periods by a series of different clients to do a specific, specialist job and a worker who is hired on a more or less permanent basis by a single client to do a similar job. I hope that the Government will look carefully at the report that the Tax Law Review Committee will produce shortly on the subject of classification.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para3"></a>Secondly, the Government's initial proposals in the Bill met with many objections which they have now accepted are justified. They have moved some way to meeting those objections. However, we believe that, in doing so, they have opened up new reasons to object. One objection was that the Government originally proposed to apply a special test to decide whether the worker is employed or self-employed: a different test from the normal test which had been built up through case law. That met with serious criticism from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and other professional bodies concerned with taxation. The Government have responded to that, and the ordinary tests will now apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para4"></a>Another criticism was that the Government were proposing to introduce a certification scheme which would enable clients to purchase services from certificated service companies, without a risk of being held to be an employer. That was criticised as being bureaucratic, expensive and giving an unfair advantage to certified companies. The Government have therefore dropped the certification scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para5"></a>We now come to the problem. Under the original scheme if the client hired a worker through a personal service company and the worker was treated as an employee, the client would have had to pay the employer's NICs. That is what happens if there is a direct contract between the client and the worker. If the employment tests are satisfied, the client pays the NICs and not the worker in the case of a direct contract.
<P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para6"></a>Under the Government's new proposals employer's NICs will be paid, but they will be paid by the personal service company on the receipts from the client and not by the client itself. This, we believe, is wrong. It gives a significant advantage to a client which deals with a personal service company rather than directly with the worker. In borderline cases it plainly shifts the risk of an adverse ruling from the client to the personal service company and, through that company, to the worker himself or herself.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para7"></a>There are four main objections to that. First in most cases it is frankly easier for the client than for the worker to bear the risk of having to pay employer's NICs. That is especially so where the client is a substantial company and may have a number of short-term contract workers across whom it can spread the risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para8"></a>Secondly, if there is a risk of an uncertainty as to what the status of the worker is, it is plainly easier for the client than for the worker to get legal advice and to form a judgment of the degree of risk. The parties therefore are not, when they enter into contracts with each other, contracting on the basis of equal information and therefore on an equal footing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para9"></a>Thirdly, it follows that if a dispute arises and has to be fought with the Inland Revenue, it is plainly easier for the client to fight it than for the worker to fight it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para10"></a>Finally, pressure on workers from clients to form personal service companies, even if the worker does not want to do so, which already exists, will continue and may very well increase.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para11"></a>We therefore find ourselves in a difficult dilemma as regards our attitude towards the Government's amendments, and indeed towards the clause as a whole. There is undoubtedly a serious NIC avoidance loophole which needs to be blocked. The Government have to some extent improved their original scheme and it now appears to be acceptable to a number of professional bodies which criticised the original scheme. But we think that the drawbacks for workers--and we are looking at the problems facing these individual workers, many of them experts on whom the economy relies heavily--of placing on them the liability for employer's NICs and the risk in cases of uncertainty have been underestimated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para12"></a>We will therefore have to ask the Government, even at this very late stage, to reconsider their proposals. We find ourselves unable to support the clause as it is proposed to be amended by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para13"></a>Finally, I have put down some minor amendments. In view of the lateness of the hour and the fact that they are not of primary importance, I shall not be moving them and I need not therefore explain them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para14"></a>I would add a coda, however. The Professional Contractors Group plainly represents a large number of those people who have created personal service companies in the IT industry. It has a very strong view. As I have made clear, I do not, by any means, agree with everything it says but it is directly affected by this legislation and its voice needs to be heard by the Government.

<A NAME = "91013-28_para15"></a>After the Committee stage in your Lordships' House, the Government held consultation meetings with a number of the major professional bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, and so on. However, as we understand it, the Professional Contractors Group was not invited to a meeting until 22nd September. It was then simply told of the Government's proposals, which were to be published on 23rd September and, indeed, were published on that date. We believe that it should have been properly consulted. It has a justifiable grievance in having been given, effectively, the brush off.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in his opening remarks, quoted what I said in Committee with regard to the question of avoidance. In no way do I go back on what I said then and the statement he quoted. We are clearly concerned that there should not be unjustifiable tax avoidance. Having said that, quite clearly the proposals which the Government have put forward have given rise to considerable concern and are now radically changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para16"></a>The original proposals are now radically different from the amendments before us and can, at best, be described as half-baked. However, our fear is that even after the changes now proposed, those in industry with service companies, quite legitimately, will still be adversely affected. As has been pointed out, this is of particular concern to those who take an entrepreneurial attitude in, for example, the IT industry or North Sea oil.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para17"></a>The original proposals included a new control test to determine whether or not someone was self-employed. We criticised that heavily in Committee. The Government have taken it on board and, as I understand it, have now dropped it completely. We are now considering, for the first time something quite different. Similarly, in Committee the question of certification, rather on the lines of the construction industry scheme, was suggested. Again, that has been dropped.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para18"></a>The Government now propose to use the existing test to determine the boundary between employment and self-employment. They introduced some new terminology. I understand that these companies are now to be described as &#147;intermediaries" whereas previously they were personal service companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pointed out that there are some problems in applying even the existing definitions in this field. We believe that there are now significant objections, despite the changes that have been made to what is proposed. First, the burden has now been shifted from the client to the so-called intermediary. As the noble Lord mentioned a moment ago, the intermediary will carry the burden of administering the scheme and the risks involved in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para20"></a>Secondly, we believe that the new proposals will have a significant adverse impact on small entrepreneurial companies as against large, or even <P>


<a name="column_484"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>large international, companies. The representations we received subsequently suggest that the system that is now proposed is not fair to small companies. In effect, the small companies will pay PAYE and NICs on their entire revenues, which will include an element of profit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para21"></a>The representations also point out that there is usually a significant difference between the fees charged by one of these companies and the amounts normally paid by employees. However, the Government are proposing to allow only a limited amount of deduction as far as concerns expenses. The representations received suggest that that deduction, which is 5 per cent, is not adequate in the circumstances. That, in turn, will have an adverse effect on investment by such small companies, which we believe may lead to some people moving offshore. That will not be in the interests of the UK economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para22"></a>In essence the complaints which we have received suggest that the new proposals make a distinction by applying the self-employment test to companies, but in fact the consultant is not a self-employed tradesman but an employee of one company providing a service to another. The amendments which are now before us do not provide a satisfactory approach as far as this matter is concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para23"></a>I turn now to the way in which the matter has been handled so far and the way in which we believe it ought to be handled from now on. I should just add one point, which is that I was somewhat concerned, against the background of the Inland Revenue taking an aggressive attitude in these matters, though one which as far as the objective is concerned is legitimate, at a cutting from one of the papers last Sunday--which I have checked did in fact exist--to the effect that the chairman of the Inland Revenue, in issuing a newsletter, has made a statement saying he finds it exciting and important being at the forefront of implementing the new Labour Government's policy agenda. I find that a quite extraordinary statement for someone in the position of a senior civil servant in the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para24"></a>Some years ago we had a chairman of the Inland Revenue who seemed to think there was absolutely no distinction between avoidance and evasion and was determined to treat both the same. It is important that the chairman of the Inland Revenue should consider carefully the remark which he has made and what ought to be done about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para25"></a>I turn now to the way in which this whole matter has been introduced. Another place had no opportunity to debate the matter at Committee stage, where it would have had an opportunity of going into it in depth. In seeking to justify this, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, at Committee stage, said that that Committee stage was already half-way through by the time the Chancellor of the Exchequer made his announcement. Unless the whole thing was totally cooked up on the spur of the moment, there was no reason why a new clause at the end of the Committee stage--because that is where they turn up in another place--could not have been tabled and they could have looked into the matter <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in depth and in the rather more favourable circumstances of a Standing Committee than we have had perhaps in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para26"></a>What then happened was that the new clause was introduced at Report stage. I shall not go over the history of it again, but it appeared to be a device by the Whips to delay proceedings in the hope that the rebellion which was then going to take place on the matters we have been discussing earlier this evening would not take place at prime time but in the middle of the night. In the event it totally failed. It came up in the middle of the Today programme. None the less, this new clause was put down, the Report stage was guillotined and there was no opportunity adequately to discuss these matters. We find ourselves in a situation where the matter arrived in your Lordships' House at Committee stage. We have of course debated it and as a result of that we have found that the new proposals are in front of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para27"></a>In the course of debates at Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said two things: first, that he would offer a seminar which we could attend before the House resumed so that we could understand where the Government had got to; he added:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;I undertake that the consultation will be fully published well in advance of the Report stage. We will report to noble Lords and the public about the issues raised in the consultation process".--[Official Report, 20/7/99; col. 923.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para28"></a>
That has not happened despite what the noble Lord said. We are also receiving considerable complaints about the way in which the consultation process proceeded from those who were involved. It would seem that there was some degree of segregation between some of those who made representations, perhaps the larger organisations which were seen privately by the Minister concerned in the Treasury, the Paymaster-General, and another consultation process which took place with various of the other smaller bodies, and the Minister has kindly provided me with a list of those who attended this meeting.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para29"></a>It is alleged--no doubt the Minister can tell us whether or not this is so--that halfway through this meeting a telephone call was received which indicated that the revised proposals would be published the following day. This did not suggest that the consultation was such that the Government were open at that stage to changing their mind. It would appear that the consultation consisted of the people at that meeting being told what the Government were going to do and that was it. There does seem to be very considerable disquiet. One could perhaps describe it as a charade, although that might be a slight overstatement. At all events, it was not a satisfactory way of going about such matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para30"></a>I turn, finally, to how we should go forward from now. As I said, the Government have put forward new amendments but we have not had adequate time to get all the representations that we would like, despite the marvels of e-mail. Given this particular case, which is perhaps a little unusual inasmuch as the IT industry has been involved in it, I wonder how things will proceed in the future. My e-mail has been flooded with representations on the subject.
<P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para31"></a>If we allow the matter to go forward at this stage, there are still a number of important issues to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has drawn attention and about which I have expressed concern. If the government amendments are accepted, the Bill will go to another place. But we know only too well that it will be very difficult for those in another place, on seeing these proposals for the first time, to discuss them in detail. There will be considerable trouble in terms of having time to receive representations and adequately move appropriate amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para32"></a>Consequently, I have reached the conclusion that it is not appropriate that this clause should remain in the Bill. I think that another place should be given a full opportunity to look into the matter and discuss it. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, raised a fundamental objection to that conclusion. I suggested that such matters could be dealt with in a separate social security Bill if there is one in the new Session relating to the state second pension. That would be one way of dealing with the matter. Alternatively, it could go into a Finance Bill. I do not think that it would be overstating the noble Lord's position to say that he has argued that that is really quite impossible because Finance Bills can only be concerned with revenues that go into the Consolidated Fund and not those which go into the National Insurance Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para33"></a>I have already pointed out that it seems to me that that is probably an obsolete approach for the simple reason that at the beginning of the year we agreed a transfer of functions Bill, the exact title of which I forget, which transferred responsibility for the Contributions Agency--this matter relates to that agency--from the Department of Social Security to the Inland Revenue. Therefore, as this is an Inland Revenue matter lock, stock and barrel, it is absolutely clear that it should be dealt with in a Finance Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para34"></a>However, the noble Lord has said that that is not so and the matter cannot be dealt with in a Finance Bill. Such a procedure would, of course, give the House of Commons a full opportunity to debate these issues, together with the associated tax provisions which will have to be in a Finance Bill in any event. I have news for the noble Lord. It is normally the practice that the Finance Bill contains only measures of the kind that he has described. But it is also the case--I can give the noble Lord an example from 1987--that a resolution can be passed whereby such practice can be over-ridden and appropriately adjusted. If the noble Lord would care to look into the situation in another place on 23rd March 1987, he will find a record of a resolution, which was put before the House and approved; and, indeed, acted on. It related to the procedure under &#147;Personal Pension Schemes", and stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Ordered, That, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the practice of the House relating to matters which may be included in Finance Bills, any Finance Bill in the present Session may make provision for payment of sums out of or into the National Insurance Fund"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para35"></a><P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
I repeat, the National Insurance Fund--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;in connection with provisions relating to the payment of minimum contributions under Part I of the Social Security Act 1986".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para36"></a>
So the noble Lord, I believe, has been misinformed as to the true situation. There is absolutely no reason why a similar resolution should not be passed. Indeed, given the structural changes which have been made, it seems to me that it would be appropriate to reconsider the normal procedure, especially since the Inland Revenue now has responsibility for the Contributions Agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para37"></a>My view is that we should not accept these clauses this evening, or the amendments put forward by the Government. It would be more appropriate to delete them from the Bill and for them to be dealt with in another place in the way they should have been dealt with from the start. Up to now the other place has had no chance whatsoever of considering this matter.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>  : My Lords, I have listened to my noble friend in total fascination. I think he has succeeded, if I may say so with the greatest respect to the Government Front Bench, in blowing their case out of the water. The way the matter was handled in another place--and I need not elaborate on what my noble friend said--and the prevarications which have been put up really makes it wholly inappropriate that this House should now pass this clause in whatever shape it may be. Of course I entirely understand the Minister's desire to try to deal with tax avoidance. It is now perfectly clear that this matter can be dealt with in a Finance Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para38"></a>It has also been clear from the beginning, and indeed it has been part of the Government's case, that this is the first of two stages. The first will deal with social security and the second with PAYE and tax matters. I think my noble friend has made a totally unanswerable case as to why this should all be dealt with together in next year's Finance Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para39"></a>I reinforce what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and by my noble friend. I believe that the Minister is still gravely under-estimating the concern felt particularly by the IT industry but also by others who deliver their services through contractors rather than by direct employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para40"></a>One of the more influential bodies who have been making representations call themselves Forum 35. They represent 49 accountancy firms that specialise in advising IT contractors on issues associated with personal service companies. They have sent a note to me in which they say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;We accept that it is not the Government's intention that legislation should adversely affect legitimate service companies that were not set up in order to avoid paying their share of taxation. However, we are deeply concerned that the new proposals may have an unintentional detrimental effect on legitimate service companies if they are not fairly and equitably applied to the IT industry where modern business practices make the application of the self-employment tests difficult."

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para42"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, made the point about the two workers sitting side by side. If I may say so, he has totally identified the problem that these contractors are going to face if this clause goes through with the amendments now proposed by the Government. Martin Tallett writes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;From my personal point of view I will fail the SE tests and were I to attempt to operate under the new IR35 I would not only be liable for the employee's NICs on essentially the whole of my contract but also the employer's NICs."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para43"></a>
He goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;From a computer industry point of view we expect that 95 per cent of computer industry contractors will fail the SE tests because we generally go to work, sit in an open plan office and use a terminal all day."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para44"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para45"></a>This is the point that has been made about the &#147;snapshot". The Government have taken a &#147;snapshot" of these two characters sitting side by side in front of their screens. One of them may be a full-time employee of the company: the other may be there on a short-term contract for a particular piece of work. That is the difference between the two, We simply have to look at this against the pattern of employment that has developed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para46"></a>For some years I was the chairman of an insurance company, one of those which prided itself on being at the forefront of introducing information technology into the life insurance business. Again and again we found that the most effective way of dealing with the new matters, new procedures and new processes that had to be introduced was to use the contractors. This had all the advantages of having people there for the short-term burst of activity; and then they were free to move on elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para47"></a>It is worse than that. Mr Lewis, another person who has made representations to me, wrote as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;The irony of this whole situation is that the original press release, on 9th March 1999, stated the Revenue's intentions to prevent the so called 'Friday-to-Monday' abuse".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para48"></a>
We all agree with that; that intention is perfectly legitimate. He goes on:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;This is when an employee could leave a company on a Friday as a normal employee, only to return again on Monday doing exactly the same job, but as an independent consultant employed through his own limited company".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para49"></a>
He goes on:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;The latest proposals"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para50"></a>
these are the revised Inland Revenue proposals--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;actually allow this to happen, as the onus of paying any tax and NI is down to the independent contractor and not his client/agency. Unscrupulous employers could exploit this loophole, sacking employees on a Friday and allow them to return only if they trade as an independent through a limited company. The employer would not be liable for any PAYE, NI, pensions, redundancy payments or other benefits which go with normal employment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-28_para51"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para52"></a>If there is any substance in that--and there may well be--it seems another reason why the Government must take more time, think this through thoroughly and come up with a scheme at a later stage in a later Bill in order to make sure of things. Avoidance can be attacked without interfering with and destroying <P>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legitimate businesses. There is a fear in the industry that large numbers will have to go abroad in order to preserve their position.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-28_para53"></a>This is one more example of the Government saying one thing--&#147;We want to encourage e-commerce; we want to encourage private enterprise and entrepreneurs"--and then doing something that seeks to destroy both. We should not allow this clause to pass into the Bill.

<A NAME="91013-29_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Kintore: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 184 seems to have joined this grouping. It may be for the convenience of the House if I speak now.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para0"></a>I first became interested in this clause just before the Committee stage on 20th July and I had prepared quite a good speech to make then. I refrained from speaking as the Minister suggested a meeting during the Recess to try and thrash out some of the problems (col. 938 of Hansard). In my innocence I really expected the meeting to take place and for organisations, such as the Professional Contractors Group, to be invited to give us the benefit of their considerable experience of the practical application of the proposed law and regulations for contractors, and to suggest improvements. The meeting did not take place. I concur with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on what did take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para1"></a>Even as amended, this clause shows a lack of understanding of how the North Sea oil search works. The major oil companies, such as Shell, are oil producers and not engineering companies. When they want to exploit an oilfield they put out contracts to the major contractors such as AMEC, Brown and Root, and the Wood Group. The contracts will cover everything that is necessary to get the oil to flow.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para2"></a>The major contractors will have permanent staff to enable them to bid for contracts--they win about one in five--and once they have a contract they will need extra staff for all or part of the contract, which could last between six months and three years. These extra staff will be supplied either by a specialist agency or they will be individuals who have advised the major contractor of their special skills. Neither the main contractor nor the agencies will take the extra staff onto their employed payrolls as they will have the problem of firing them once the contract is completed. So a perfectly sensible system has evolved whereby individuals are prepared to live by their wits and bid to work on any contract which needs their expertise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para3"></a>Many of those individuals probably offer their expertise through personal service companies and, when working, command high salaries. But those salaries have to keep them going while they are not in work. There have not been too many contracts in the North Sea recently, so there are some rather hungry individuals about who may indeed have arranged their affairs, quite legally, to pay as little tax and national insurance as possible. But it is the proud boast of those kinds of individuals that they do not go on the dole when they are out of work. They make their own pension arrangements, and probably have private medical insurance. So where is the mischief to the <P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>National Insurance Fund? Those people prefer to work in that way. They do not seek the benefits of employment protection legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para4"></a>If the Government make operating through an intermediary so unattractive, there is a danger, particularly in the oil industry, of the intermediaries going abroad. It is a world-wide industry, and there are plenty of other countries that would be only too happy to have the skills that Aberdeen can provide. If one major professional contractor left Aberdeen, the rest would probably follow. The result would devastate the city's economy and, although it is of no concern to this Parliament, would cause severe difficulties for Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire council and, I hope it is in order for me to say, the Scottish Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para5"></a>I could go on, but it is late. I hope that, even at this late stage, the Government can be persuaded to withdraw this clause. If they will not, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will consider testing the opinion of the House on Amendment No. 184.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, in introducing the government amendments, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, described the changes that have been introduced since the Committee stage. In addition, a revised regulatory impact assessment has been published this month. I was invited to the seminar in London but I could not possibly get to it at short notice from northern Scotland because of my engagements there.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para6"></a>The issue of employment through personal service companies, known as intermediaries, needs to be examined carefully. I think we are all agreed on that. I agree with the remarks of my noble friends Lord Higgins and Lord Jenkin and I shall not expand on them. The original proposals would have penalised entrepreneurial enterprise--the opposite of New Labour's declared aims. I am advised that the revised version is likely also to cause damage. I am told that it could make matters worse for small businesses. The most vulnerable are those offering information technology and computer software services.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para7"></a>Since my remarks in Committee, I have received many complaints about this clause. It is surprising how many areas of our national activities it affects, especially where specialist work is required by a firm for only a few months. I endorse what my noble friend Lord Higgins said. Of course, we do not condone deliberate attempts to avoid national insurance contributions and PAYE. Besides the information technology industry, there are other industries and professions which are affected. An example which has been mentioned is the North Sea oil and gas industry. Its engineering and other specialist requirements offshore mean that specialists come only for a short time to do particular jobs. It would be cumbersome and unnecessary for individuals to have to be taken onto the roll of the companies concerned just for a few weeks or a few months. It does not make sense for them to be directly employed by the larger firms in that industry.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para8"></a>There is also a fear about partnerships in general which provide consultancy services to various industries. That takes us into the professions. There are worries about accountants, doctors, architects and other professions. That kind of approach could lead to problems in those areas too.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para9"></a>Small enterprises might have to go out of business. That is where foreign competitors would gain advantages. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, pointed out that foreign competitors have to follow the same rules and would not be able to produce one-man companies. If our small companies go out of business, that is where the foreign competitors could gain.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para10"></a>There is much concern about the clause in sectors which are important to the British economy and, where the oil and gas industry are concerned, particularly Scotland and the north-east of Scotland. The noble Earl, Lord Kintore, spoke about that so I shall not say more. He and I both know the situation in northern Scotland, and it could be a devastating setback for the economy there, and also for Britain as a whole, if the oil and gas industry were to suffer greatly from these changes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, I had no intention of speaking in this debate until I heard the two noble Lords from the north-east of Scotland. If I had any doubts about the need for the clause before, I have none after hearing their speeches. What was apparently a fairly minor point now spreads to the extent that doctors, technology and the whole of the North Sea oil industry are in danger of collapse because of this amendment. Are they really trying to persuade this House that an amendment dealing with national insurance contributions will end the North Sea oil industry? I have never heard such bunkum in my life and I hope we are not going to listen to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I do not know how long the noble Lord has been in the Chamber, but he has got hold of completely the wrong end of the stick. This provision was introduced in the other place as a new clause, but it is a major change, proposing major alterations. It is not something to be dismissed in the way that the noble Lord tries to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, with due respect, noble Lords, certainly the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, have said in the House that the oil industry in the North Sea could--all right, he said &#147;could"--be at serious risk.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, I believe the matter has been grossly exaggerated. The noble Lord may care to reflect that the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce was reported as saying that the allegations that 17,000 people might have to leave employment in the North Sea and go to work in, of all places, the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, neither the noble Earl nor I mentioned that figure, nor did we mention the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I take it that I have to reply to two kinds of objections in this fascinating debate. One is about process and the other about product, the real issue. The debate has been very heavy on process and rather light on product. On the basis of what I have heard, there has not been any convincing argument for the Government to agree to withdraw this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para11"></a>I should like to deal first with process, which in my view is the less important issue. The Chancellor, quite unusually and with great regard for public consultation and feeling, announced a tax avoidance measure in advance. Normally, such a measure would be introduced in the Budget and there would be no opportunity for debate other than in Committee in another place on the Finance Bill. There would be no debate in this House and no opportunity to table amendments and give the matter the kind of consideration that noble Lords have given it. The Chancellor, with unprecedented concern for the public, announced this matter in advance. It was introduced at the first opportunity in another place at Report stage on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para12"></a>I totally reject any suggestion that it would have been possible to introduce these amendments in Committee. They were introduced the first time it was physically possible to do so. Those amendments were available for debate. Admittedly, there was a guillotine, but they were debated in the other place in full in a way that, under the previous government, they would never have been considered in this House because of the principle, to which I adhere, that the Finance Bill is concerned with the Consolidated Fund, and the National Insurance Fund is a matter for other legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, accuses me of poor consultation. I shall turn to that in a moment. I recall that he did not give me any notice of his bombshell of 23rd March 1987; nor did he emphasise that what happened in 1987 was for that Session only and that no government of either persuasion had sought to introduce it again. Perhaps it was thought not to be a very good idea and it would be better that the Finance Bill should be concerned with the Consolidated Fund and that matters concerned with the National Insurance Fund should not be taken out of the purview of this House. If that is what the noble Lord proposes, so be it. However, that would be the effect of what he proposes. That would certainly be the effect if this clause were removed from the Bill. It would not be considered at Third Reading, and I am not sure that it would ever come back again. We would have to introduce it in another way.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-29_para14"></a>The second accusation about process is concerned with the nature of the consultation. The consultation was incredibly detailed. We sent out over 1,800 copies <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the original proposals, held two consultative meetings with 38 representative bodies and received 1,700 written comments and suggestions. We have paid attention to them and fundamentally changed the proposals as a result. Am I supposed to apologise for that? Certainly not. In particular, having had the satisfaction of everybody else I am told that the Professional Contractors Group still objects. I remind the noble Lord that the group was present at our seminar last week in support of the noble Earl, Lord Kintore. When the representative of that group was asked whether there was anything to complain about in the consultation he said that there was not. As a qualification, he said that the Revenue was determined to achieve its objective and it would not budge, but he did not complain about the nature of the consultation. I do not take those objections very seriously. The current convention of this House and another place on the consideration of these matters is greatly to the advantage of this House. It is astonishing that the noble Lord should seek to change it.

<A NAME="91013-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord leaves the question of process, will he comment on the allegation that, while the Revenue was still talking to bodies, the revised proposals were already in draft and ready to be published? That seems to me to be a thoroughly disreputable way of misleading people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is way over the top. Of course, we have been considering ways in which to respond to consultations which have been coming in since April of this year. If there was a meeting at a time when consideration was advanced, what is wrong with that? There have been other meetings and consultations and there have been plenty of other opportunities. Nobody else has complained about the nature of the consultation, except those who have clearly been filling the e-mail and mail boxes of noble Lords opposite. Noble Lords will forgive me if I pass on to the more important matter of the content of the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-30_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made a worthwhile point. He said that in returning to the existing tests that have been built up by case law over a considerable period we have to consider whether those tests are adequate. He said that they would have to be reconsidered. I totally reject the view of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that we were receiving information about these for the first time. These tests have been built up by the courts over many years. They are not new to anybody, and certainly not new to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, nor to anybody like me who has run a small business.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-30_para1"></a>If the Tax Law Review Committee wishes to make comments about the nature of these tests, of course we are open to suggestions as to how they should be improved, subject to the legislation and case law. We have yielded to the thrust of the consultation, which is that we should go back to the existing law and not introduce a new and simpler criterion.

<A NAME = "91013-30_para2"></a>We are told, as a new complaint, that this means that the intermediaries will have the additional burden of paying the national insurance contributions and, in due course, the tax. They can get out of that immediately; they can abolish single-person companies. Like my market research interviewers with whom I have bored noble Lords in the past, they can go back to their PAYE being calculated by their employers without the device of a single-person company. If the tax avoidance benefits are removed, that is exactly what they should do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, in that case does the Minister not think there is a risk that the clients would simply refuse to take them on on that basis?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, if that were the case, it would have been the case for 30 or 40 years. In market research, where that has always been the case and there has always been a requirement on research companies employing interviewers to keep a payroll for them, those research companies would have taken advantage of any loophole. Nothing new is being proposed. If there is no abuse of this kind, there is no supposition that there will be abuse in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-30_para3"></a>Since we are talking about these single person companies, these intermediaries, let us rid ourselves of the illusion that these are entrepreneurs. They are not entrepreneurs in the sense that the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, or the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, spoke about; these are persons working entirely for themselves and by themselves who have chosen to set up a company, maybe for legitimate reasons, but in some cases in order to avoid paying a national insurance contribution and PAYE by paying themselves in the form of dividends rather than in the form of earnings. As soon as they become real entrepreneurs and employ somebody else or expand, they can no longer do that because they have to have a payroll. This clause will not then apply to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-30_para4"></a>All the talk we have heard about the IT industry, the North Sea oil industry and all this emotional stuff is way outside the scope of the amendment. We really have no case to answer here. We are doing a simple thing to get rid of tax avoidance. We are doing it in a way which, after consultation, has received the approval of virtually everybody who has been consulted, and the idea that we should back down now on the arguments we have heard is simply not acceptable. I beg to move.

It will permit the Inland Revenue to supply, on a discretionary basis, information about the income of self-employed parents. The amendment is necessary because the Inland Revenue is a UK-wide organisation. It is therefore not possible for Northern Ireland legislation to create this discretionary gateway.

<A NAME="91013-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 263:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 85, line 20, leave out from (&#147;day") to end of line and insert (&#147;specified in regulations")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment deals with a short and simple point and, as it is late, I hope to move it quickly. I certainly have no intention of dividing the House on it. I believe that your Lordships have had enough for today.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para1"></a>Clause 81(3) now provides that pension sharing orders cannot be made in proceedings which start before Clause 19 of the Bill comes into force. I agree that pension sharing orders should not be made where the divorce proceedings have been started a substantial time previously. However, once the Bill has been enacted and it is clear that the power to order pension sharing will come into force, people are likely to hold up the start of their divorce proceedings until the pension sharing provisions come into force. That will create a log jam and, indeed, I suspect that that may already be happening.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para2"></a>My proposal is modest. I suggest that when the Government decide on the date on which they are going to bring into force Clause 19--which I assume is likely to be some time after this Bill is enacted--they should make a commencement order for Clause 19. At the same time they should make an order directing that Clause 19 applies to divorce proceedings begun after a date which is, say, three months earlier than the date on which it is intended that Clause 19 itself should come into force. Therefore, if a commencement order is made in, let us say, April bringing Clause 19 into force on 1st October next year, the power to make pension sharing orders should apply to any proceedings started after, say, 1st July next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para3"></a>That would enable the courts to start making orders as soon as Clause 19 comes into force. The courts will have in front of them divorce proceedings waiting to be dealt with and the proposal in the amendment would reduce what would, I fear, be a serious log jam <P>


<a name="column_502"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem in divorce proceedings. Otherwise, I believe that from now on, wherever there is a prospect of a pension sharing order, divorce proceedings will simply be held up and there could be cases where a husband who is confident that there is a possibility of divorce on the basis of a five-year separation may decide to bring forward his divorce proceedings simply in order to avoid the risk of a pension sharing order being made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para4"></a>That is a simple point. If the Government are not willing to accept it, so be it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the simple answer is that the Government are not willing to accept the amendment. The amendments return to an important issue raised by the noble Lord at Second Reading: the Government's intention that pension sharing should apply only to divorce proceedings that commence on or after the day on which the pension sharing provisions come into force.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para5"></a>At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, suggested that it would be reasonable to extend pension sharing to those cases where divorce proceedings begin after the Bill has received Royal Assent, as opposed to its implementation, which we are expecting at around the end of the year 2000. I disagree. It is a general principle of English and Scottish law that retrospective legislation should be avoided wherever possible. Many of those who gave evidence to the Social Security Select Committee on this issue shared that view. For example, the Solicitors' Family Law Association, in its evidence to the committee, were adamant that the Bill should forbid retrospection even in those cases where hardship was claimed. That is why the committee recommended that the Bill should make it absolutely clear that pension sharing may be used only in cases where the application for divorce is made after the pension sharing provisions come into force.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para6"></a>I accept that some cases of hardship may arise. I understand that there is a risk that some couples will choose to defer divorce proceedings until pension sharing becomes available and the extra distress that deferment may cause. However, on balance, the Government agree with the Select Committee that the case against retrospection is more persuasive. That is why we acted upon it. I understand that the overwhelming consensus in the legal profession is that the policy is right. It is easy for people to understand. It will spare pension schemes from having to deal with a surge of work immediately after implementation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para7"></a>In the light of that and the fact that we are responding to the position endorsed by the vast majority of the legal profession, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, before I do so, I should like to say that I believe that the Minister and her advisers have got it entirely wrong. I simply do not see how saying that pension sharing arrangements should <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>apply to divorce proceedings which commence after the Bill itself has been enacted could possibly be retrospective. Quite plainly they are not. Of course in an entirely different sense pension sharing will be retrospective in that it will apply to pension rights which have accrued before the date on which the Bill is passed. I have no objection to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para8"></a>I believe that what I am proposing here cannot possibly be regarded--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I thank the noble Lord. I do not challenge him on the definition of retrospection as it applies to pensions that have accrued in the past. I should like to make that clear. However, there is often a difference between the date of Royal Assent and the date of implementation. The noble Lord knows that perfectly well. Many Bills are passed, but implementation is set for some later date because of the need for regulations to be passed, IT systems to be set up and so forth. That often happens when new benefit legislation is introduced, and that was certainly the case with JSA.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-32_para9"></a>I do not know of any case in social security where, having passed a Bill with implementation coming in at a later date, some cases have been allowed to take effect before implementation. For this measure, by definition, the date of implementation is not Royal Assent. At that point the legal profession will not necessarily be ready to go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am unable to accept that pension sharing applying to divorce proceedings commenced after the Bill has been enacted is in any sense, as it is usually understood, retrospective. Be that as it may, this is simply a practical point and there is no great point of principle here. However, I believe that the courts will find themselves with a serious practical problem. So far as I can see, from now until the Bill is implemented--we have been told that that may happen towards the end of the year 2000--divorce proceedings are going to be delayed, and there will be a serious logjam. But it is not my intention to press the amendment, and I beg leave to withdraw it.

FUNCTIONS OF THE AGENCY: LABELLING, MONITORING AND NUTRITION
<BR>
(&#147; . The Agency has the function of--
<BR>
(a) providing guidance on the content of labels or descriptions (or both) to be supplied with food;
<BR>
(b) monitoring, at the point of sale, that all classes of food have been produced according to the standards applying to each class;
<BR>
(c) continuing to fund research into nutrition.")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I apologise to the Committee in advance, and I have warned the Minister, that of all the clauses to which I shall speak, this is one to which I shall speak at slightly greater length. We had a full debate yesterday on labelling and I again want to highlight some of the issues that were covered then.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para6"></a>Labelling is a critical issue. It is crucial to those unfortunate people who suffer acute food allergy. It is an important issue for all those who have to watch what they eat for other reasons. It is an important issue for anyone who has children or other family members that they should eat a balanced diet free of doubt from GMOs and other chemicals. It is a developing issue for farmers and for other food producers who know that their products are grown and processed under more stringent rules and subject to more rigorous inspection.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para7"></a>From among those people, and many others, who are simply fed up with BSE and E.coli, salmonella and the rest, there is strong support for the food standards agency. At the moment few of them realise that the Bill does not specify labelling as an agency function. The word itself does not appear on the face of the Bill. If we in this House do not use our influence to remedy this situation, I believe that millions will be disappointed and disgusted and will lose what little remaining faith they have in our political process.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para8"></a>In common with many others, at tense or potentially embarrassing moments I try to lighten my load by imagining the headlines in the Sun.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para9"></a>Seriously, if we place on the face of the Bill a requirement that the agency should provide guidance on labelled contents, we place on it a duty for which it can be accountable. If we do not, and it does not, we can only grumble that it is not doing the job in the way we would have liked it done.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para10"></a>Similarly, we should place on the face of the Bill a stipulation that the agency should devise a point of sale monitoring scheme which enforces our standards at the moment where the consumer comes face to face with the food product. European law allows us to carry out random sampling of food. It does not allow us to carry out full quality checks at the point of entry into this country. We are aware that many of our production standards are tighter and applied more stringently than their counterparts on the Continent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para11"></a>If the difference in standards has no impact on the quality of the end product, then perhaps we should consider relaxing our standards and lifting some of the burden from our farmers and food processors. However, if our higher standards do mean better quality and are something in which we believe, we should be given both the evidence and the means for people to choose the best; namely labelling.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para12"></a>If labels and labelling are not mentioned on the face of the Bill, neither is nutrition. Again, we had a good debate about that yesterday. Mr Rooker, speaking in another place, about the &#163;25 million research expenditure which is to be transferred from MAFF to the agency, assured us that about 30 per cent. of that sum is devoted to research into food and nutrition. Our concern is to ensure that the agency cannot drop research into nutrition in favour of that into food.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para13"></a>People today are increasingly both more adventurous in what they eat and more health conscious. They want definite answers to the red meat question, the red wine question, and the &#147;Are multivitamins good/bad for you?" debate. The agency must have a leading part to play in providing those answers and must be held to account both for its programme of research and its results.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para14"></a>Labelling and nutrition are vital aspects of modern food technology. The food standards agency will have an impact not just within the UK but across the Continent and, if it is good enough--I am sure that all of us in this room hope that it will be--world-wide. This week, the world's population reached six billion. It is expected by the middle of the next century to stabilise at 10 billion. Nutrition and high quality food are crucial to that stabilisation. So let us play our part by giving the UK food standards agency a clear brief to which we may hold it accountable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para15"></a>I turn now to two other matters. The Minister was kind enough to write to me on 8th October following the Second Reading debate and raised the whole issue of Article 30 of the treaty. I refer to the second page of her letter where she said:
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-33_para16"></a>
She went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Except in emergencies, it cannot unilaterally impose any limitations or restrictions on imports, nor can it generally inspect production premises in other member states or third countries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-33_para17"></a>
The letter concluded:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;And of course, the Agency will be able to work with our partners within Europe to ensure that the Commission is carrying out its own responsibilities effectively".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-33_para18"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para19"></a>These are very pressing issues. Like other Members of the Committee, I have only recently received a press release from the Food Advisory Committee, which has been asked to look at certain topics with regard to labelling. Of these, the five I wish to mention are: what information should be legally required; how rules on labelling and advertising could help to promote healthy eating; what controls should apply to claims made on labels and in advertising; alternatives to product labelling to get information across; and labelling of GM-derived foods.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para20"></a>In April last year I raised the question, which the noble Countess, Lady Mar, will remember, relating to inspectors from Portugal with regard to the meat hygiene service. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, kindly wrote to me following my inquiry. This was taken up and I wish to put it on the record, because it accentuates the problems we are facing and why I am so heavily pushing and encouraging the Government to put labelling on the face of the Bill. I asked how many inspectors there were within the meat hygiene service in Portugal. My understanding was that there were only five. Following from that, it was reported to the Commission. The end of the letter from the Minister says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;As you will see from the Commission's preliminary summary report, the FVO mission found serious deficiencies in the official controls in place and in the hygienic operation of the slaughterhouses and cutting plants visited, and accordingly recommended that immediate remedial action should be taken by the Portuguese veterinary authorities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-33_para21"></a>
Certain questions arise from this. Was meat withdrawn as a result of it? Has any come into our country and, if so, would it have been labelled? And how could it have been labelled?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para22"></a>I apologise for spending so much time on this issue, but it is absolutely crucial. Three pig farmers came to talk to me this afternoon about their plight and it is highlighted by the fact that the beef ban has still not been properly lifted in France and Germany. The least we could do for our producers and our consumers is to adopt some system of labelling so that, if we cannot enforce certain things because of EU restrictions, of which I am acutely aware, we can at least give consumers a chance to look at a label and know clearly what it says.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-33_para23"></a>Yesterday I said very clearly that if a product has a British sign on it--whatever that is--that should mean that it has been grown, produced and finished here, and not produced elsewhere but processed here and <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   I support my noble friend. I know that we had a good debate yesterday in relation to labelling and one of the things that came out of it, having thought about it last night, was an extra adjective. Not only does labelling give one protection and promotion, but it also gives one education.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para0"></a>It is important that we are able to educate people to understand and read a label used across the whole spectrum. We talked about the American methods that are being used now, which are giving everybody the chance to understand labelling more clearly. It is that sort of education which will come out of clear labelling. I should like to see that education being spread even back to the schools. I know I am moving slightly away from what we are trying to do here, but if a standard labelling system is set up, it will enable schools, and even adult education centres to a certain extent, to come to terms with the new systems that we can apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para1"></a>We can apply the new labelling system well in this country; there is no reason why we should not. So I want to underline the need to ensure that the Government take this opportunity to do something positive about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew1"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   I agree and support the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. Is the Minister aware that we are importing Belgian hard-boiled eggs which we put into mass produced sandwiches? But those hard-boiled eggs are chemically treated and sometimes the chemical treatment goes wrong and the hard-boiled eggs have to be discarded. In view of the state of our poultry industry and the stringent efforts we have been taking to get rid of salmonella, is that fair trade?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para2"></a>Another point I should like to make is that at the height of the Belgian poultry and pork problems with dioxins, it was discovered that packaged chickens which had in fact been imported from Thailand and packaged in Italy--not to the hygiene standards required by the European Union--were being sold to British consumers in Smithfield Market.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para3"></a>I am conscious of the need for safe food but I would be much happier if I knew that we were getting quality food. Nutritional quality as well as safety is important. Those of us in the dairy business have to provide a health mark on all our products before they leave the farm. That health mark is awarded to us by the Environmental Health Authority. People who buy our products with that mark know that we produce raw milk, cheese or whatever it is to the standards required. If that were a universal standard with all food products, it would be extremely helpful.
<P>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para4"></a>We had considerable debate yesterday on the placing of nutritional content on labels and the noble Baroness will know my opinion in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_time0"></A><H5>3.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I support my noble friend Lady Byford. I wish to declare an interest as a farmer and as a food producer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para5"></a>Labelling has a couple of important aims. The Food Standards Bill will ensure that labelling is legally required and that the requirement is to give full and proper information. It should also require the agency to scrutinise labelling. Labelling plays a leading part in enabling people to make informed decisions. As a food producer who comes under considerable scrutiny as to how I produce my food, I have no problem with that. And as a food producer I wish to produce food to the highest levels. However, in doing so it carries various costs which are not associated with some of the other food producers from, say, other EU countries or third world countries. We are interested that, when our food gets onto the supermarket shelves, the consumer can make an informed decision. For example, where a meat product on the left is more expensive and perhaps on the right is less expensive, one might suggest that the one on the right hand is less expensive perhaps because it has not been produced under the same scrutiny. Maybe it has had hormones injected into it, as American beef has.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para6"></a>There are many things that labelling can tell the purchaser. We discussed the fact that it can tell him the nutritional content of the food and about what risks that food carries. We talked about various sections of our community that may wish to know--because of their religion or whatever--what foods they can or cannot eat. We have already talked about country of origin. I feel very strongly that country of origin should be on our labels. If I take out my mobile phone I know that it is produced in a Scandinavian country; I know that mine has a German battery in it. If I take my shoes off in the evening, I know that they come from Italy. But I may not want Italian shoes--your Lordships see my point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   Perhaps I may suggest that the noble Lord might like to think about buying British in future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I did say &#147;in the evening". The ones I have on at the moment have a British stamp. So I am a true European there. The most important thing of all is that a label should say something of the history of the food; how it was produced from the beginning to the end. In the case of my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, the label might say, if it was a salmon, &#147;Caught by spinner" or &#147;Caught by worm". In the case of my beef--or the beef that I used to rear, which I no longer do--it should say whether it is suckler beef and whether or not it was grain fed. In the case of pork, for instance, the label might perhaps say that it was produced with a farrowing system from an EU country, or it is a more expensive pork because it was produced in England where we cannot use the farrowing system.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH70"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para7"></a>Again I suggest that fruits should say that they have been produced in our country under pesticide laws that forbid certain pesticides being used. For instance, I believe in this country that we are not allowed to put certain desiccants on pears, and yet just across the Channel pears are allowed certain desiccants. That means that ours are all in different growth stages when they go on the shelves, whereas pears from Holland, having had desiccants on them, have been burnt off and therefore they are all uniform. Such a label would inform the purchasers of the type of foods they are buying and they will be able to make an intelligent choice of their foodstuffs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para8"></a>I also ask rather tentatively what costs the Minister foresees falling on the farming industry if this kind of comprehensive labelling was adopted. At the present time one would be loath to see any more costs being placed on our farming industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   I support my noble friend on the amendment. Perhaps I may anticipate something that my noble friend may ask. We have to understand what the restraints on labelling are and what requirements the agency will need to meet if it is to do what it is charged to do in this Bill; that is, to protect against risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para9"></a>It may well be that the standards of food safety in this country are higher than those in other member states. We have heard one or two examples of that. As I read the Bill, there is nothing to prevent the agency from determining that, if food is produced to a different specification from around the world, then it should be so labelled. That would be protecting against risk and the agency is perfectly entitled to do that, leaving aside the issue as to whether or not it should be promoting labelling. However, where it is not able to fulfil the function with which we have charged it in this Bill is where the product comes from another member state. We are not allowed to require a country within the European Union to label the food as coming from a member state other than the United Kingdom. As the Minister reminded me yesterday, European funds, which are part of the common agricultural policy funding--our own money, you might say, recycled--cannot be used to promote something which demonstrably is from one member state rather than another. She was right to say that it was not a question of legality, but simply a question of making it impossible for a promotion to stress British qualities which because of national legislation may well be of a higher standard of food safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para10"></a>We have here something that is beyond the scope of the Bill. With regard to Community law we have a problem, because in this country standards in certain respects of food safety are quite different from other member states. We are charging the agency with identifying where there might be a perceived risk. It will be recognised, presumably, that there is a risk in producing food to lesser standards, otherwise we in this Parliament would not have required a higher standard, but because of Community law the agency will be unable to fulfil that obligation.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH71"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-34_para11"></a>That is a serious issue which has to be addressed. I am not suggesting that the Minister should somehow produce an amendment to this Bill which would resolve the problem because, it cannot be done like that. It has to go right back to fundamental Community law. It demonstrates the idiocy of the situation in which we find ourselves. We rightly having legislated in this country in order to achieve high standards will then have to keep quiet either because we will have promotional funds withdrawn or because we will be acting in a way which is non-communautaire when others are identifying, say, a Belgian product as inferior and we are not allowed to do so. That is nonsense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   We spoke yesterday about labelling, so there is not much more to say about that. I detect an undercurrent of protectionism; people are saying, &#147;Let us know that foreign goods are foreign" and therefore they must be inferior by definition. They may be, but we must use some common sense about this; it is not just a question of being law abiding. As far as I remember, we have not had a microbiological crisis from imported food. There is no evidence that E.coli or any other crisis was caused because food was imported from abroad. Perhaps I am wrong.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991013/text/91013-35.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-35_spnew0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   The noble Lord might not know about it, but only a few months ago there was some cheese in a Tesco shop in the north east of England which was contaminated and the whole thing was kept quiet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-35_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   While we are in the grip of reminiscence, let us not forget the Perrier water incident of a few years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   I was talking about microbiological risks, and the big scandal of E.coli and so forth which occurred. I am not saying that foreign food is not to blame, I am saying that we have to look at microbiological risk first.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para0"></a>What do the labels do? They must be simple; they cannot be complicated. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, wanted them to contain a complete description of the product. The leather on his shoes, for instance, may not have come from Italy. It may have come from India and the sole may have come from somewhere else. When you buy a product, the label indicates its final assembly and it is very difficult to indicate all the various components and all the processes which the goods have been through. Such a requirement placed on agricultural products it will place an immense burden on farmers or whoever will finally have to do the labelling, and it will be too complicated to understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para1"></a>We must separate these things. It is very important that the food standards agency has an educational role in clarifying our position compared with other countries, so that if people know foods are from Portugal, France or Belgium they will have some idea of the degree of additional risk they may be incurring by buying that food. You cannot state, &#147;In Portugal <P>


<a name="column_CWH72"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this is the process and they only have five veterinary inspectors.". You cannot indicate that on a label, but it is important to give adequate information so that people can make judgments and use common sense. It should not make it too complicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para2"></a>However, we must at all costs avoid a protectionist bias whereby the food standards agency is not just protecting the consumer but the producer as well by shutting out imports. That would be very damaging, because at the very least it will lead to retaliation and will not be any good to us. Others will also do the same with British food, so we should keep the position as simple as possible and as legal as possible but think of the consumer far more than the producer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-35_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  We have had an interesting debate and I assure the noble Baroness that she need not apologise for the length of it. It has built on some of the themes that we discussed yesterday with reference to the importance of labelling when we talked about including the matters of nutrition and labelling in various parts of the Bill. My answer on the specifics of the amendment may once again be the boring, ministerial, legislative, robot answer that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, would expect. However, that in no way implies that we undervalue the importance of labelling. The range of issues that labelling can cover was rightly pointed out. The noble Lord said that because labelling is important in different ways, it can have different functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para3"></a>We have come back again and again in Committee discussions to the danger posed to certain individuals from eating foods to which they are allergic. Therefore labelling can provide immediate and important health protection information for the individual. It can equally be vital that individuals or parents who want to ensure a nutritious and balanced diet for themselves or their children know the content of particular foods. Labelling can play an educative role as well in enabling people to understand that a particular food that they may not think contains salt, sugar or high levels of fat in fact does so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para4"></a>There is a range of issues here that it is important for us to cover. To address the other side of the matter, mention has been made of the importance of producers' interests in being able to communicate effectively with consumers on issues such as welfare standards or country of origin. Some people wish to base their purchasing on their own preferences as to country of origin. That is a convoluted way of making the point of buying British mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, or not buying a product from a particular country or--as we discussed yesterday--the ethical or religious reasons that people may have for choosing to avoid or specifically to support particular areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para5"></a>So there is no difference between us as to the importance of labelling. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, rightly pointed out that the Food Advisory Committee is opening up this discussion, giving the public the chance to put their views on food labelling <P>


<a name="column_CWH73"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>directly to members of the committee. The responsibilities in this area will be taken over by the food standards agency. We do, of course, have to recognise that we work in the European context here and it is important that we make progress--as the Government have been trying to do--in terms of labelling across the Community and in different countries. We are a trading nation and food is imported. It is important that we understand what is coming about and that we are working on a level playing field.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Desai was right to caution against trying to put everything on to a label. We have to put our corporate minds to the point of what the relevant information is on a particular product. I have been involved in the issue of foods with GM ingredients and then the issues that have now been raised about GM ingredients in animal foods, in the issue of GM processes that are involved in producing elements that go into a food and we have to make some decisions about what a phrase such as &#147;GM free" means in technical terms and make sure that those phrases are used in the same way by the same people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para7"></a>That takes me to the issue of misleading labelling. Concern has been expressed both today and yesterday by Members of the Committee about the potential for misleading information in a great variety of areas. Nutritional claims about food can be misleading and can give people the impression that they are buying something that is healthy in very broad terms, whereas in fact a rigorous scanning of contents might suggest that the balance of ingredients was not such that one would want to replicate the whole time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para8"></a>Today we have talked about the difficulty of misleading labelling regarding country of origin. We are currently considering whether the MAFF guidance notes, for both the industry and the enforcement authorities--and we have to recognise that the local authorities are the enforcement authorities here--which have a significant effect on practice, should be revised to deal with this point. We do not believe that the current situation is satisfactory and where there is clearly some risk of consumers being misled--for example, where meat is processed in the United Kingdom but produced elsewhere--we are looking extremely carefully at what can be done. Clearly, we do not want to break the law, but I believe that there are some flexibilities to tighten up, if that is not oxymoronic in this context. We are studying carefully what we can do to stop people being misled in this situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para9"></a>In the obverse case, there are higher standards in some cases, but by no means in all. We have introduced standards of animal welfare, for example, which we believe are right and also can offer positive marketing advantage to our producers. It is perfectly possible for producers to label their products to show how they have been produced. Indeed, many producers are developing just such quality assurance schemes. That is an important area although, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, pointed out, it is a voluntary act and we can compel other people to label in a particular way.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH74"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para10"></a>Turning to research, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggested, &#163;5 million per year in the nutritional research budget currently held by MAFF will be transferred over to the agency, which we clearly expect to continue carrying out research in this area. That was made absolutely clear in the White Paper, and there is no intention whatever to go back on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para11"></a>It would not be right, however, to predetermine in legislation the priorities in the agency's research budget at any one time and for one particular. It needs some flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and new problems. The programme at the moment is very large. There are ongoing commitments and those will be honoured, but knowing how MAFF's research budget has had to take account of BSE and fund more research into TSEs than we would have predicted 10 or 15 years ago, my experience shows that we have to be prepared to be flexible in such research budgets.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para12"></a>Finally, turning to the amendment, I believe that there is no need to include those specific requirements in the Bill. They are already adequately covered by existing provisions. All the functions described in the amendment form a valid part of the agency's work and we expect the agency to be active in this area. The agency has a general duty under Clause 7 to provide advice and information to the public, as well as the general objective of protecting the interests of consumers in relation to food contained in Clause 1(2).
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-35_para13"></a>These aims will be met in part by ensuring that the public have adequate information to make informed choices about food by offering advice on using and interpreting the information on labelling. The noble Baroness illustrated the need to have that general duty to provide advice and information to the public and not to narrow it down simply to labelling, when she said that the public want the answers to questions such as, &#147;Is red meat good for you?" That is not a question that can be answered only on the label of a piece of meat bought in the supermarket--it is a question which perhaps cannot even be answered! We will not go into the debate about whether an individual food is good for you, but this illustrates that we need a breadth of information coming from the agency. We absolutely intend that it should provide that and I hope that Members of the Committee will be reassured that the areas of concern which the noble Baroness has rightly raised will be covered as mainstream activity by the terms of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3>with pigs and pork, pig farmers are having to produce to different standards and they are struggling to make ends meet. Production here has decreased, but 18 per cent more is coming in from abroad. I am not being protectionist in any way; I am just trying to make Members of the Committee aware that there are practical implications to certain aspects. Labelling would help. It would not stop produce coming in from abroad and it is right that goods should come in from abroad--but the consumers, the buyers, ought to be able to make that choice. At the moment, they cannot do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para2"></a>I propose to come back at Report stage with something much simpler. Although I was very grateful for the contribution of my noble friend Lord Rotherwick, I am not looking to tie things down so tightly. I hope to achieve something that allows us to have some kind of British kitemark on our products, which will ultimately help the purchasers. I am not seeking to be protectionist in any way, because I do not believe in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para3"></a>I have two further points. One is in regard to GM labelling, about which the Minister spoke. The issue that worries me is that we have a requirement for restaurants and people who sell food to display a notice stating whether the food is GM-free or not. All that is happening is that people are putting up a notice stating &#147;This may contain", which is not hugely helpful. A negative denial does not solve a problem. I was therefore trying to be flexible, while giving recognition to standards, in particular the risk issue raised by my noble friend Lord Selborne. It is important that we should take that point on board. I accept the Minister's chide at my red wine remark, which was a little wide of the mark, and I am well aware that it would be a health rather than a labelling implication.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para4"></a>I thank all those who have contributed to the debate. This is an issue which the general public will be glad we have aired. I hope that, when we speak to this again, we will come to a slightly closer understanding. I beg to leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to extend the remit of the agency in Clause 9 beyond animal feedingstuffs to pesticides and veterinary medicines. An example of animal feedingstuffs included within the clause would be something like growth promoters which themselves contain antibiotics. Clearly that is something well within the remit of the agency. However, it is a matter of considerable concern that they are not only subject to UK scrutiny but also to that of the EU. A number of decisions have been taken by EU institutions with regard to growth promoters.

<A NAME = "91013-36_para8"></a>Veterinary medicines can also comprise antibiotics. They similarly have a knock-on effect on human health in terms of the resistant organisms which they may create. Therefore public concern should be just as great in regard to them. The distinction between an animal feedingstuff growth promoter and a veterinary medicine is a little difficult to appreciate. The use of vancomycin in a growth promoter or as a veterinary medicine should also be of concern to the public as the knock-on effects would have a similar impact on the public. Therefore the distinction between an animal feedingstuff and a veterinary medicine seems to be rather academic in those circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para9"></a>Turning to pesticides, it seems rather odd that they are not included within the ambit of this clause. In moving her previous amendment, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred to Sun headlines. I am not such a populist, so I would simply refer to the Independent and the Guardian headlines. The Guardian headline states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Researchers claim pesticide residues pose no healthrisks".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-36_para10"></a>
The Independent headline states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Pesticide residues on fruit 'no risk to public'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-36_para11"></a>
These are very recent headlines of 17th September in both those newspapers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para12"></a>I give the Committee a flavour of the Independent article which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Food campaigners called for new safety checks last night after fruit and vegetables sold in British supermarkets were found to contain pesticide levels above recommended limits".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-36_para13"></a>
The first paragraph of the Guardian article states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Government scientists moved yesterday to calm consumer fears about the level of pesticide residues found in food sold at supermarkets as campaigners called for more stringent safety checks".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-36_para14"></a>
It seems to us on these Benches that there is every logical reason why pesticides should be included within the ambit of the agency's powers. One has only to consider what body should be calming consumer fears and looking into the reality of whether those pesticides are indeed harmful to public health to realise that the agency should be the body doing that. Why leave it to a pesticide advisory group when animal feedingstuffs are already included in Clause 9? Why draw this line? I very much look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para15"></a>I appreciate that the amendment from the Conservative Benches constitutes perhaps a more cautious approach to this matter although it has a similar intent. I suggest that there are very good reasons why the remit of the agency should be extended with immediate effect rather than waiting for a review as the logic of the division between those three areas eludes us. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91013-36_spnew3"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   Perhaps I might say &#147;hooray" as this is my subject. Having spent eight years on this very subject I am delighted to see these few amendments put down. I cannot see any reason whatsoever why either of these categories should be omitted from the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, made a valid point about the Pesticide Advisory <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Committee and Safety Directorate being the bodies which say that these things are safe. They are, after all, the licensing authorities--or at least they advise the Minister to license the products. They are not going to say that they are not safe if they have already licensed them. We have had long debates on this matter in the House over many years. I have talked about intellectual corruption. It is too much to expect the same group of people who are responsible for licensing products to say whether or not they are safe in food.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para16"></a>I am delighted to see this amendment. I hope the Minister will see the reality behind it. The public are very unhappy about residues in foods, whether they be veterinary medicines or pesticides, and this would help to put the position absolutely clearly. We are, after all, setting up the food standards agency in order to get away from that and away from the producers. This is one place that it really should be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-36_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I should like to speak to my Amendment No. 89, which is linked with these amendments. The Government do not intend these areas of mass responsibility to be transferred to the agency, although they have considered the impact on food safety. This review would enable them to reconsider once the agency had been operating for five years. Many on-farm activities have a direct impact on food safety, such as E-coli, BSE, the contents of animal feedstuffs and the use of pesticides and antibiotics. There are provisions in the Bill which will enable the agency to have powers on-farm. Those will include its objectives of covering food production and supply and its information-gathering surveillance powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para18"></a>MAFF will continue to have responsibility for veterinary medicines and pesticides. The principle enshrined in setting up the agency--separating regulation from the department promoting the industry--will not apply. The product approval for the surveillance of pesticides and veterinary medicines will be inside the government department that promotes the industry. The agency will have greater responsibility for animal feedstuffs than it will for pesticides and veterinary medicines. In explaining the provisions in Clause 9 on animal feedstuffs, the Explanatory Notes to the Bill state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;The main reason for giving the Agency responsibility in this area is because of the possible implications of animal feedingstuffs for the safety of human consumers eating meat and animal products".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-36_para19"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-36_para20"></a>The same argument applies to both veterinary medicines and pesticides.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-36_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I believe that some of the discussion we have had on this group of amendments is based on a misreading of Clause 9 and the reasons for including animal feedstuffs specifically. I take the point that has been made and it is quite clear-cut that those pesticides and veterinary medicines can have important implications for the safety of food. It is important that the agency takes those firmly into consideration in doing its work. I suggest to the noble <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   That is precisely what I was saying. At the moment, we have the Veterinary Medicines Directorate looking at safety of veterinary medicines in animals and meat; we have the Pesticides Safety Directorate looking at grain and fruit and so forth. They all maintain that they are perfectly safe and in the case of veterinary medicines and my own particular issue with sheep dip and humans, it would be so much better. The public are concerned about the microbiological safety of food but they are also extremely concerned about residues in food. We need to make this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   It is a point to which I subscribe. I was trying to suggest to the noble Countess that at the moment MAFF has responsibility both for the executive agencies and for food safety. So, I have responsibility for pesticide residues, and we talked about some of the issues that can arise from them. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, brought forward the issue of imported pears. All these are mainstream food safety issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para0"></a>I should like to assure members of the Committee that the possible implications of pesticides and veterinary medicines to the safety of human consumers of food are already fully taken into account by the agency's main aim set out in Clause 1 and the general functions contained in Clauses 6, 7 and 8. These apply to all aspects of food safety, as we discussed before, from production on the farm to consumption in the home, and so fully address the agency's responsibilities--and it will have responsibilities--on pesticides and veterinary medicines as they may potentially affect human health.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para1"></a>There are also specific provisions elsewhere in the Bill--in Clause 29 and Schedule 3--to ensure that the agency will be fully consulted by the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate on matters of policy. Provision is also made for the agency to nominate a member to serve on the statutory advisory committees, the advisory committee on pesticides and the veterinary products committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para2"></a>The reason I believe that the concern has arisen is that Clause 9, to which all the amendments except Amendment No. 89 refer, is included and spells out the issue of animal feedstock. Perhaps I may explain to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, who raised this point in particular, that the clause is not included to bring in the issues relating to animal feedstuffs directly as they apply to food safety or the interests of consumers concerning food. Those will be covered in the same way as pesticides and veterinary medicines by the main aim set out in Clause 1. The reason we need the reference to animal feedstuffs here is to provide a legal base for the agency to deal with matters relating to animal feedstuffs which are not directly about food safety or the interests of consumers concerning food such as animal health or operator safety.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para3"></a>In relation to pesticides and veterinary medicines, however, these matters will continue to be dealt with by the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which are both executive agencies of MAFF. The Government considered very carefully whether they should include the PSD and the VMD within the agency's remit and took careful account of comments made in the White Paper. We concluded that it would not be the right solution to transfer PSD and VMD to the agency but that we should ensure that in various ways the agency could make an input on food safety matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para4"></a>There are many other strands of work concerning pesticides and veterinary medicines other than food safety such as user safety, of which the noble Countess is well aware, and uses for non-food-producing animals. That work will continue to be carried out by the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. Including those functions within the agency's remit, either now or in the future, could compromise the agency's very sharp focus on food issues. We are all agreed that we want the agency to have that sharp focus, and it could risk giving the agency some physical conflicts of interest of just the kind that the noble Countess suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew2"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B>  : Perhaps I may say that when I saw the first proposals I was absolutely horrified that they were going to encompass the VMD and the PSD. I am delighted that the situation is at it is now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Countess and I hope that she is reassured that that separation does not mean that the food standards agency will not consider the issues of veterinary medicines and pesticides as they affect the safety of food. That is covered in the general and the specific areas of the Bill in Clauses 1 and 29 and Schedule 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para5"></a>In addition, the agency will be fully involved in the planning and review of residue surveillance programmes. If it felt dissatisfied with the level of surveillance being carried out, it could undertake its own surveillance or advise Ministers of the need for action under the Food Safety Act. Amendment No. 89 recognises that views can change. As I said frankly to the Committee, this was a judgment issue which was debated during the formulation of the Bill. At some later stage it is possible that the arguments might stack up differently.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para6"></a>The idea of a review is therefore in principle very reasonable, but I do not believe that it is necessary to write it into the Bill. The agency's activities will be kept fully under review by health Ministers. The pesticides and veterinary medicines directorates, as executive agencies of MAFF, are subject to regular quinquennial review, which takes a fundamental root and branch look at whether the structure of the agency is right and whether the positioning of the responsibilities in that particular machinery of government are right. The questions considered in those reviews could include whether to transfer any functions to the FSA.

I hope that that explanation will provide some reassurance to the Committee.

<A NAME="91013-37_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Radnor: </B>   Perhaps I may ask a question. I wonder how much of this lies within our control or within European control? My memory serves me right, I hope, that Professor Laming of Nottingham University headed an international galaxy of veterinarians and decided that all except two of these growth-promoting hormones were perfectly safe, but before the Commission heard his report they banned it and created a mini trade war with the USA. Do we have control over pesticides ourselves or are we talking about people in Brussels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The noble Earl is correct; these are issues for Europe in so far as growth promoters are concerned. It is very important in the instance to which he refers that we ensure that the scientific advice available in this country is taken into the European context so that it can influence decisions taken at European level when competency is at European level. It is important that this area is covered and that we ensure that scientific advice feeds in to decisions taken at Community level and, as the noble Earl rightly says, that it has an effect on WTO negotiations and on our trade relationships with the United States.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para8"></a>As regards similar issues, I expect the agency to take a very close interest in matters related to antibiotic resistance. That is a matter of concern in your Lordships' House. That was the subject of a recent report from the Advisory Committee on Microbiological Safety of Food.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   Before my noble friend responds, perhaps I may ask a simple question of the Minister. There has been a considerable growth in drug resistant bacteria in hospitals and it is thought that the use of antibiotics in animal feedstuff as a routine might have an effect. What will be the agency's role in looking into this? Will it be allowed to look into it and, if so, is it compelled to look into it? In other words, has it a proactive or a reactive role in looking into that specific question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I must always beware of the noble Viscount when he asks me simple questions. Rather than risk giving him an answer which I think is right, if he will forgive me, I shall write to him on those specific points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for having responded to Amendment No. 89. As she quite rightly says, my concern was that a review should be considered. I wanted to put it into this clause because <P>


<a name="column_CWH81"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is an important clause. The Minister will not be surprised if I bring forward another amendment later which asks the agency to review itself and its objectives on an annual basis. Under those circumstances, I am grateful for her comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-37_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for her carefully considered and constructive reply on the subject. I listened intently to what she had to say, particularly about the executive agencies. I do not disagree at all with the desire to keep the balance between the food safety responsibilities of the agency separate from the executive agencies within MAFF.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-37_para9"></a>I was rather baffled, however, by the question of the legal base argument on Clause 9. It seems to me that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander in this case. If we need a legal base in respect of animal health relating to animal feedstuffs, why do we not need a legal base in respect of veterinary medicines?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo991013/text/91013-38.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Perhaps I may assist the noble Lord; I did not express myself clearly. We do not need a legal base in Clause 9 to take into account work on the effect of animal feedstuffs on human health any more than we need a separate legal base for the agency to take account of pesticides or of veterinary medicine in that area. Clause 9 allows the agency to be the overall agency for other areas with regard to animal feedstuffs because of the balance being smaller there, and the need for separation not being the same. Pet food is a good example of why we need this legislative cover. However, because we are content for the other elements of pesticide and veterinary medicine to be dealt with by the directorates, we do not need a separate legal base. That would be extending beyond food safety and consumer protection which is covered in Clause 1. I have obviously not helped, but hindered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   The Minister elucidated my confusion; however, in some respects the Minister, with greatest respect, has extended the confusion. Even if we keep the executive agencies relative to veterinary medicine separate, the same arguments on the legal base related to animal health or whatever still apply to veterinary medicines. Clearly this is an argument which I need to consider quite carefully. I still have geese and ganders knocking around in my head as a result of what the Minister has said. I am tempted to talk about angels on pins because there may be a splitting of distinctions between veterinary medicine and animal foodstuffs, but that may be a difference without distinction or vice versa which is being made here.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para0"></a>Again I was reassured by the Minister's assurance that all three areas would be fought within the food safety remit of the agency and that is a very important undertaking.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para1"></a>Finally, like the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I was also reassured that the remit of the agency would be kept under review. However, provided that we are certain that those three elements in so far as they affect human health, public health, food safety are already enshrined in the Bill, we have the powers of the agency that we need. I am still unclear about the aspect of <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: The Minister has already addressed this amendment and given reassurance, in a sense, about the absolute priority of the agency. As I am sure the Minister will have recognised, this is designed to tease out a view about the agency's priorities. In a sense, whatever the agency's advice to the users of animal feeding stuffs, and whatever its exercise of its duties under Clause 9, the agency's main priority will actually be food safety and human health.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para5"></a>Clause 9 recognises that it is important that the agency takes a plough to plate approach to food safety, as undertaken in the original White Paper. This duty, going from plough to plate, however, should not be allowed to detract from the promotion and protection of public health and result in an agency faced with a conflict of interest. That is why I readily took the point made by the Minister about the executive agencies staying under MAFF. In this way, any functions exercised in relation to animal feeding stuff should be related to public health. Any other functions in relation to animal feeding stuff, which are not related to public health, should be reviewed according to public health function. It is a question of priorities, and the Minister has already half answered the question. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I rise to speak to my Amendment No. 38, which follows on from the discussions we have just had on foodstuffs. This clause specifies that the agency has the same general functions relating to animal feed as to food safety in so far as these matters relate to the safety of animal feedingstuffs and other interests of users of animal feedstuffs.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para6"></a>The recent dioxin scare discovered in Belgian animal feeds and the questionable content of some pig and poultry feeds, let alone the wider use of antibiotics in feedstuffs, have been much highlighted in the press recently. Other Members of the Committee referred to that earlier. This, plus the ongoing discussions around genetically modified feedstuffs, makes this clause important. If you like, in an &#147;Ilkley Moor bar t'hat" sense, I may be defined as a user of animal feeds. However, in view of the dioxin crisis in the Belgian feed, and the content of some pig and poultry feedstuffs, we felt it necessary to take this opportunity to clarify the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para7"></a>The dioxin position points up the problems surrounding free trade. Not only do we have no control over what our farmers feed their animals abroad, but we have little or no control over the content of animal feedstuffs imported into the UK. If <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I am sorry to extend the proceedings on this set of amendments, but I have not spoken to Amendment No. 33, about which I should have said something. It is relevant to what we have already discussed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para8"></a>The agency's responsibilities in relation to animal feedingstuffs will require that it keeps users of animal feedingstuffs informed about matters which affect their capacity for making informed decisions about them, which is what the clause in its current form would require. It is also important, however, that members of the public are kept informed about any issues relating to animal feedingstuffs that may affect their ability to make informed decisions about food. This amendment is intended to ensure that both are made explicit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para9"></a>From what the Minister said earlier I suspect that what she is going to say--I am getting good at anticipating ministerial replies--is that the point is already covered by the food safety duty, that the agency will of course advise, whether it is on pesticides, veterinary medicines or animal feedingstuffs and that, therefore, we do not need this amendment. In that case perhaps the Minister could treat this as a probing amendment to ensure that she gives us the reassurances on that subject which we all need.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Gage: </B>   I do not know whether it is appropriate to ask at this juncture whether the agency will have powers to make compounders state the precise ingredients of animal feed. This has been an issue. There is still no binding authority; the authority is voluntary. Will the agency have the ability to compel compounders to state ingredients precisely so that farmers can take a decision on this matter and know exactly what they are feeding their animals?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-38_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I will deal with the final issue first. I agree with noble Lords who have commented on the inadequacy of labelling of animal feed at the moment. This is an area of EU competency. We have been working at EU level to ensure that proper labelling is provided which contains the relevant information. It is in that area, for example, that the GM content of animal feed comes into the equation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para10"></a>However, we have to recognise that responsibilities in this area do not just involve labelling. Some of the problems that have arisen have not involved bad or good labelling but rather have involved the misuse or contravention of what ought to be going into the feed in the first place. This is where surveillance, monitoring and enforcement powers are extremely important. I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and others who have spoken. The intention behind these amendments as I understand it is to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>ensure that the agency can, and does, carry out its duties across the entire food chain. That is already covered properly in earlier clauses in the Bill. The possible implications of animal feedingstuffs for the safety of human consumers of meat and animal products are already covered under the agency's main aim in Clause 1 and under the general functions contained in Clauses 6, 7 and 8. These functions apply to all aspects of food safety throughout the production chain. They cover the agencies responsible for animal feedingstuffs which could potentially affect human health. This runs parallel to the issue of veterinary medicines and pesticides.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-38_para11"></a>We come back to the question on which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, was probing me earlier; namely, why we need Clause 9 and why it contains a reference to animal feedingstuffs. This matter may be clearer when it is seen in print than it is at the moment. However, in common-sense terms this is a matter of balance. There are issues other than the implications of animal feedingstuffs for the safety of human consumers. I refer to pet food, for example. Pet food is covered by the same EU directive as animal feed. We believe that responsibility for that small area of animal feed--outside human health and food safety--lies with the food standards agency. It makes common-sense for one agency to deal with that matter. I fully accept that that is the opposite of the argument I made on veterinary medicines and pesticides because the balance of work in that area is quite different. Food safety is not the only element in pesticides, which have environmental and operator effects and are potentially harmful to human health. There are a wide range of other areas where we believe that the separation of the agency and the licensing authority is beneficial. So, it is not angels dancing on the head of a pin at all; it is a common- sense argument about where the balance of responsibility lies. I suspect, however, that I shall not have reassured the noble Lord, though I hope that maybe before Report stage I can write to him with greater clarity.

<A NAME="91013-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply, which was very much as I had anticipated. I can say that the penny is gradually beginning to drop, though I should definitely like to see it in writing. I am thinking &#147;pets", which is the clue to the whole thing. I suspect that the wording of the clause is rather confusing. Although pet food is of course an important animal feedstuff, when taking into account the many farm animals it would not necessarily have been an obvious item for the food standards agency. However, it will do so because in a sense such feedstuffs hang together. The confusion may lie in the difference between household pets and farm animals, but they all seem to have been swept up in clause 9.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para0"></a>The penny is beginning to drop, unless I am mistaken. The Minister may tell me that I have totally misunderstood it, but I believe that that is where we are heading. I accept her point that the food safety duties of the agency will ensure that the public are kept informed not only about animal feedstuffs but about pesticides and veterinary medicine. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-39_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if in moving Amendment No. 39 I speak also to Amendments Nos. 41 and 43. This group of amendments deals with the scope of the agency's ability to include fish farms within its programmes of observations under Clause 10. Amendment No. 43 clarifies the agency's power to take samples from food sources during its programmes of observation. In order properly to inform the development of food policy, the agency will need to gather representative information on food safety and related matters, subject of course to the limitations contained in the Bill and the agency's general duty to act proportionately. As the agency's remit covers the entire food chain, these observations must, similarly, cover the entire process from production to sale. Clause 10 provides the powers to make these observations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para6"></a>These amendments make minor technical changes to ensure that there are no technical gaps in the powers to carry out observations. Clause 10 also gives details of the information that may be sought through these observations and this amendment includes a reference to fish farms, alongside the existing references to food, agricultural and animal feed businesses and premises. In view of the animated discussion we had about the importance of fisheries and the safety of fish as a food, I hope that the Committee will warmly welcome the filling of this gap.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para7"></a>I should like to comment on Amendment No. 43 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Radnor. The amendments provide a useful clarification of our definition of fish farming. It was certainly not our intention--as he pointed out, we should be careful to avoid it-- to include the production of ornamental or other fish not intended as food within the scope of the clause. The agency will in any case exercise discretion in planning surveillance to make sure that only relevant premises are included in the surveys. The noble Earl's amendment helpfully draws attention to this point and I am glad that it has given me the opportunity to put firmly on the record that there is no intention to give the agency powers in such areas as the farming or production of ornamental or other fish which are not intended as food.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para8"></a>I am assured, however, that as currently drafted the powers in Clause 10, which look as though they are wide enough to encompass such areas of fish production, would apply only to premises used for food or animal food production. Clause 10 states:

They relate to food safety and the other interests of consumers in relation to food. So we are certain that those powers could only be exercised in relation to premises used for the production of food or animal food. When I saw the noble Earl's amendment, I thought the point was well clarified. It does not need to be clarified in drafting terms because of that reference back, but I am happy to make it clear in terms of the debate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-39_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Radnor </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 39, Amendment No. 40:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Line 2, at end insert (&#147;for the production of food")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 40 and 42. I was not able to hear too well the answer that came and I shall read my Hansard very closely tomorrow, but I must start by reiterating that I am both a fish farmer and a processor and rear all sorts of other fish as well. Once again, I felt this was perfectly simple and these two amendments to the noble Baroness's amendments made it absolutely clear that the owners of fish farms growing food were to be visited. It is well known that some fish farms are dedicated entirely to decorative fish, some are dedicated entirely to stocking rivers, reservoirs and so forth, and many of them duplicate on those two performances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para11"></a>The noble Baroness felt that her Amendment No. 43 covered the whole situation. If that is the case, the people who are going round making their observations will be visiting quite a lot of farms totally unnecessarily in order to find out whether there are food fish there or not.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para12"></a>Secondly, my amendment to the Minister's amendment cannot possibly be misunderstood and it seems to deal with the situation as well as anybody can. Perhaps the provision should be left out altogether because of the generalities that we were discussing. Here is a very interesting situation. We had a very wide discussion about fish yesterday, but said nothing about how they are to be examined. After all, the filleting, boning or skinning on a fish farm often takes place at sea and there is not a word about that, or wholesale markets, or anything of that sort.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-39_para13"></a>Far be it from me to pile more inspections on anybody, let alone myself, but there seems to be something rather incongruous about the fact. I cannot say it is not a level playing field when one is dealing with the sea, but it seems unusual. I shall listen again to the noble Baroness's answer, but I feel my addition is more adequate than she describes. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to the noble Earl. I apologise if I was not completely clear that I was urging the Committee to support Amendments Nos. 39, 41 and 43, which include &#147;premises, businesses or operations involved in fish farming", which perhaps gives the breadth of coverage to which the noble Earl was referring. I hope that when he looks carefully at what I said earlier as to his own Amendments Nos. 40 and 42, although on first sight it appears that they would be necessary to clarify that the only fish production with which the agency would <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>properly be concerned was that in relation to food, I am assured that the general governing of Clause 10 by Clause 8 means that there would be no question of the agency interfering in the production of farming; for example, of ornamental fish. Perhaps it would be most sensible if I suggest to the Committee that it adopts the government amendments, which I believe are generally welcome to extend properly to fish production for food the powers of the agency. I hope that the noble Earl will read what I have said in relation to his own amendment. We can if necessary come back to it on Report.

Like the amendments we have discussed earlier, this is a minor technical amendment to make sure there are no significant gaps in the agency's ability to gather information, to inform policy development and protect public health. It makes clear that the samples that may be taken during programmes of observation include samples from food sources such as live animals and plants. The existing text refers only to &#147;articles or substances". There is some doubt as to whether this would be sufficiently wide to cover any samples taken from animals and plants, which obviously could have effects on human health and food safety. For purposes of clarification I commend this amendment to the Committee. I beg to move.

(&#147;(e) reimburse any such business for reasonable costs incurred in copying or providing the information requested;")
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 in this grouping and my noble friend Lady Byford will speak to Amendments Nos. 46 and 47.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para1"></a>A business employing 3,000 people with photocopying charges down to less than 1p per page and a central print facility will regard the production of a few extra sheets of paper as trivial. A farmer or a small cheesemaker on the other hand, with a printer that costs 10p plus a page to run and a photocopying facility which is five miles away and charges 5p or 10p per sheet, will think differently. Moreover the businesses may well be making millions in profit while certainly in the current climate, the farmers will be lucky to be making hundreds, and may even be making losses.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para2"></a>In essence, Clauses 10 and 11 concern the agency's powers to carry out observation, gain knowledge, giving it the facility for checking information, deduced, supplied or summarised. These are perfectly reasonable requirements as long as their fulfilment does not result in yet another charge to agriculture and the food-processing industry, one more charge, moreover, which is likely to weigh most heavily on those least able to bear it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para3"></a>We note that the Bill empowers the agency to pay its members, to employ staff, to pay salaries and expenses, as it sees fit, to members of its advisory committees, and to receive moneys from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is therefore only fair to enable an authorised person, acting on its behalf, to reimburse costs from those from whom it seeks information, particularly small businesses. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 47. I have already referred to this clause as has my noble friend Lord Luke. The amendment asks the Government to insert after &#147;secret" the words &#147;or personal data". I have great difficulty with the amount of information that is likely to be required under this clause, which refers to observation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para4"></a>I find that the Government who have such strong public support do not appear to be concerned enough in the Bill about the private individual's privacy. The media have been broadcasting and writing for a long time now about the world-wide influence and powers of multi-nationals and about the control wielded over governments by global moguls. I am, however, saddened and surprised to read in the Bill that trade secrets are more valuable than personal private information and that, in addition, the former are to have special protection while the latter have none.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para5"></a>It need not be medical information that is to be revealed. It could, for example--and I say this in all humility--be someone who perhaps is paying for the support of a child which is not part of the family and <P>

<A NAME="91013-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I must apologise for not being present when my noble friend Lord Luke introduced the problem of being in the Committee next door and mental health problems at the same time.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para7"></a>I am extremely concerned about Amendment No. 44. We are asking for draconian powers to be given to this agency to &#147;inspect and copy any records" as is stated under Clause 11(4)(c). It does not state that those have anything to do with the problem that the agency is investigating at that particular time. Any records found on the premises may be copied and must be put into legible form. I have to admit that my computer always gives everything in legible form, so I am not quite certain why that does not work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para8"></a>I am concerned with this because it could amount to an enormous amount of paper, and it is essential that the owner of any business is recompensed if he has to produce records which do not seem to have anything whatever to do with the case that has been brought up, unless I totally misunderstand what is in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-40_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I shall respond to this group of amendments and take the separate issues that have been raised one by one.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para9"></a>I can quite understand the thinking behind Amendment No. 44. It would be wholly unreasonable for an authorised officer to put a business to huge expense in photocopying documents or finding information; but we have to look at this in context. The officers acting for the agency in carrying out observations will be under a general duty to behave reasonably and proportionately. We anticipate that the agency will provide general guidance to its officers to ensure that they behave reasonably. There is therefore no reason why this function should result in onerous burdens or costs. Indeed, it is hard to envisage circumstances where it might. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, pointed out, the agency has power to make disbursements and, if it were considered reasonable and necessary to do so, it would have the discretion to meet reasonable costs just as, for example, when carrying out a survey at retail level, the samples would be purchased. I hope that that is reassuring to noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para10"></a>I fully understand the concerns about burdens on businesses at the moment, and particularly burdens on small businesses, but the powers of the agency to ensure food safety by looking at records such as this are absolutely integral to its monitoring function. This may be a dangerous thing to say because everyone becomes keen to break with precedent, but it would not only be unusual but also unprecedented to provide reimbursement of a business for compliance with the law. That is what this amendment would require.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH90"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para11"></a>I hope therefore that noble Lords are reassured that we see no reason why that should normally present any large burden. It is part of the burden of being in a regulated industry and for that I make no apology. However, in circumstances where it was outwith the normal and proportionate costs, there would be some leeway within the agency to meet costs if that seemed sensible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para12"></a>Moving on to Amendment No. 45, it should be clear from the powers contained in Clauses 10 and 11 that the agency will need to be able to observe all aspects of food production and supply that are relevant to its remit of protecting public health. People employed by food businesses who carry serious infections that are transmissible through food pose a potential danger to public health and that has been evidenced in the past. Records held by businesses to monitor the suitability of employees for handling food destined for sale to the public are, therefore, relevant to the agency's work. Certain types of food businesses keep such records for the purpose of giving effect to the EU vertical food hygiene directives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para13"></a>However, I should like to make it clear to noble Lords that the records referred to in Clause 11(6) are quite different from personal health records as a generality. They are not a clinical matter and would not be sought by the agency. That is very specific on the particular health records that might be of relevance and are specific to the handling of food destined for sale to the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para14"></a>I should also make it clear that under Clause 11 the agency would only be able to obtain information that is reasonably necessary for the purposes described there. It would not routinely be seeking to publish information from records of this kind held by food businesses. Where access was necessarily obtained, there is no presumption that the agency would seek to disclose information on individuals since it would be obliged to take account of personal confidentiality as provided in Clause 19, and the advice is that this would be entirely consistent with the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para15"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 46 which will require the consent of individuals.

<P>

We now come to the amendments which relate to matters which we, on this side of the Committee, believe to be of fundamental importance--namely, the value to our society of maintaining our concern for respect of privacy.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para17"></a>Even in this day of electronic filing, medical records are confidential. Precisely because of electronic wizardry, it is even more important that they remain so.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para18"></a>It is right and proper at certain times--for instance, when applying first for life insurance--that we reveal our medical history in confidence to the insurer. But it is not right that our medical histories are revealed by a third party to a person carrying out observations designed to improve the general level of knowledge of a body whose members are bound by no form of personal privacy legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para19"></a>In the next subsection of this clause, we learn that anyone disclosing information regarding trade secrets is deemed to be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine. However, that same person could go out of the premises and reveal in a pub that the managing director's secretary was unwell, and there would be no redress.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para20"></a>If there is an outbreak of food-borne disease, we all expect and hope that the responsible qualified investigators will move in, find the source, eliminate the problem, and render the affected output safe once more. In those circumstances, people working in and for the food processors or retailers have to be prepared for an outsider to access their medical records. That access should, however, be denied in circumstances where there is no emergency; where there is no infection; or where there is only a desire for general background knowledge and where the observers or authorised persons may be anyone with no level of medical qualification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-40_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   It is helpful that the noble Baroness explains the concern around Amendment No. 46, which I understand. Let me reiterate that the records to which we are referring here are those that have a direct bearing on public health. They include the kind of information which is covered in the EU directive to which I referred and they are not the generality of personal health records, which would not be covered and would not be sought by the agency. Some of the general issues to which the noble Baroness made reference would not be covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para21"></a>We believe that it is right, in the emergency situation of an outbreak, that the agency should be able to gain access to those sorts of health data in fulfilment of its general function of keeping under review relevant information without having to obtain prior consent. That is because of the emergency nature of what we are doing and it is entirely consistent with the terms of the data protection legislation which, in such circumstances, does not require written consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para22"></a>In practice, the agency would only need access to even those records in rare circumstances. It would not routinely be concerned with the health of food handlers but with the safety of foods themselves. It is however right that it should have the appropriate powers to investigate if it is really necessary that it should do so to protect public health. Amendment No. 46 would make it unduly difficult so to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para23"></a>I accept that the important principle of respecting privacy should be observed by this agency, as it should be observed by government overall. But I hope that the <P>


<a name="column_CWH92"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness will be reassured that the data protection legislation covers the normal run of circumstances and that inserting a requirement for individual written consent here would be unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-40_para24"></a>Perhaps I may equally reassure the noble Baroness on her point concerning Amendment No. 47. The agency and its officers are not entitled to disclose personal information, except in the performance of public health duties. The example of talking in the pub about information gained in that way is protected under the terms of the Data Protection Act, with which the agency will be required to comply. That general protection of information, therefore, other than in the discharge of those public health duties--to stop people transmitting such information--is covered by the Data Protection Act. The circumstance that, quite rightly, is worrying to the noble Baroness is thus covered by the overarching protection of the Data Protection Act.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Our main concern here, once again, is with the small company and the family run business. It is quite reasonable, for example, for an observer to turn up at a farm halfway through an afternoon. It is also quite reasonable for him or her to seek assistance in gaining an understanding of, for example, livestock movements over the past two years to market or to slaughter. It is reasonable that he might find the two brothers away at a meeting with the accountants, or the wife shopping or fetching the children from school. It is not reasonable, in my opinion, that he should accost the cowman and demand access to office and papers contained therein.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para6"></a>In another context, it might be reasonable for the agency investigator to turn up on a Friday afternoon at a food processing plant which closes at 1.50 for the weekend.

<FONT SIZE=3>obviously alleviate these kinds of problems--any unpleasantness, costs and unnecessary delay. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 48A. This amendment would be an improvement in the detail to Clause 14 in one important respect. Clause 14 as it stands omits any reference to official laboratories. As presently drafted, it does not even recognise their existence, yet official laboratories, which are quite distinct from what one might call &#147;ordinary" or non-official ones, play a crucial role in the operation of food safety enforcement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para7"></a>In speaking briefly to this amendment, I should like to acknowledge the assistance of the Royal Society of Chemistry, which does an excellent job in putting issues of science and chemistry on the public agenda in their rightful place and helps people like me--who took science only to O-level--to feel that they might be more knowledgeable than they really are. I should like to thank the society. It has taken a close interest in the Bill. I am grateful to it for bringing this matter to my attention and to the attention of other noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para8"></a>I wish to explore whether the Minister might agree that the Bill will be strengthened if specific reference to official laboratories were included. What are we talking about when speak of official laboratories? They are the 31 analysts' laboratories; they are the laboratories of the government chemists, the central science laboratory of MAFF, and the 33 public health authority service food examination laboratories. I might add that all these bodies support and endorse this amendment, and I hope that the Minister will also appreciate that it has no financial implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para9"></a>So, who are we talking about? One example is the public analysts' service. They have a fundamental role in food safety enforcement. Every public analysts' laboratory is an official laboratory. Public analysts are very highly qualified scientists, the creme de la creme of their profession. The work of these laboratories and of these people is absolutely central to food safety and to enforcement, which this Bill should recognise. Moreover only official laboratories and laboratories empowered by European Union member states may carry out analyses for food control which are recognised by other European Union member states.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para10"></a>Recognition needs to be given on the face of the Bill to the existence of official laboratories because of the high professional and scientific standards that they embody. An official laboratory has to be accredited in accordance with standards that are prescribed by EEC measures directives. Every official laboratory has also to comply with criteria stipulated by MAFF, the Department of Health and the territorial departments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Official laboratories are thus accredited to the very highest professional and scientific standards. These criteria are demanding precisely because they are designed to ensure that food control to protect consumers is effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para11"></a>These standards apply to the staff of official laboratories, all of whom have to be properly qualified and trained; for example, all public analysts, a position <P>


<a name="column_CWH94"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enshrined in UK statues, are very highly qualified scientists. They are intrinsic to the running of official laboratories. Thus the quality control exercise in an official laboratory is of the highest standard, and the criteria of accreditation include scope for analyses to be undertaken. Surely, therefore, a Bill dealing with food standards should at the very least recognise the existence of the very official laboratories which themselves embody the highest standards in food safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para12"></a>It might be argued, perhaps, and indeed was in another place, that the current wording of subsection (5) of the Bill is deemed to include official laboratories. However, it seems to me that to suggest that just by putting in the word &#147;laboratories" covers official laboratories misses the point. For example there is the risk that official statistics on analyses of food safety which are required to be given by all member states to the EC might originate from non-official laboratories instead of official laboratories, and if so this could degrade the quality of the information submitted to the EC and put at risk the structure of food safety monitoring. Given the current situation with beef, that is an important and relevant point and we do not wish to do ourselves any more harm in these circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para13"></a>I venture to suggest that this very small amendment would resolve that situation and I beg support for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-41_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   I support the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in her Amendment No. 48A. It appears totally unnecessary to add the words &#147;official laboratory" when we have the words &#147;any laboratory", but it is not quite so simple. We have to recognise the status of an official laboratory both in the European Community and in this country. There is something a little diminishing, almost demeaning, about saying &#147;any laboratory or similar premises" when we do not differentiate specifically the role of an official laboratory. We have heard in the very comprehensive and helpful statement made by the noble Baroness just how important they are and how dependent both the agency and other enforcement agencies will be on the role of official laboratories.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para14"></a>If it is assumed that an official laboratory can be swept in with &#147;any laboratory or similar premises", which is the wording on the face of the Bill at the moment, there is a danger that food enforcement authorities might simply assume they are all one and the same and therefore bypass the official laboratories anyway. That clearly is not the intention of the Bill. It would be a highly unsatisfactory and quite disastrous implication.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para15"></a>This is a case where spelling it out in detail loses absolutely nothing. It reinforces once and for all the commitment to the official laboratories, their structure and their role within the European Union. I heartily commend the amendment to the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I strongly support my noble friend Lady Byford. I was talking about draconian powers on the previous amendment and this is where we really move into the realms of the sublime and the ridiculous. <P>


<a name="column_CWH95"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As the noble Baroness succinctly pointed out, to require a person present on the premises to provide such facilities and such records and information is ridiculous. I know that if I was absent from running my small business and came back to find that one of my employees, who knew little or nothing about the way the place ran, had allowed someone to go into my office and go through my computer files or any other files, I would take an absolute mad turn and would not be ashamed to do so. That is totally intrusive.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para16"></a>I would go even further than my noble friend. I would say that this inspection should not take place unless the owner of the business is present at the time. We have to be very careful in that regard. I am sure the Minister will say that I am using extremes, but unfortunately extremes can and do occur. Several people have written to me about things that Customs and Excise has done, which has the same sorts of powers to enter and do virtually anything that it wishes. It would be extremely unfortunate to have on the face of the Bill what we now have without this brake on someone misusing the powers which we are quite rightly giving. We must not ever allow those powers to be misused.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-41_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Radnor: </B>   I speak to my amendment, which is slightly different. I agree with much that has been said before, but this is a different point. It is to do with the behaviour of the authorised person and the authorised person's companion or assistant when they enter plants, particularly those that are processing food. That is what I had in mind. I have a plant which does just that. We run under strict rules imposed by the environmental health officer and then the health and safety officer. More important, however, they are imposed by the people to whom we sell our product and they get very upset if the rules that they laid down are broken. It is painful, because that just means one loses the order and one's business does not thrive so well.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para17"></a>The rules relate to simple things like wearing the proper hair protector, a properly laundered coat or properly cleaned boots. Where have they come from? Is their car clean? One would not want them to have come straight from a market and have manure all over the tyres or something of that sort. It is too simple to say that they should not be smoking. In our specific instance, it includes all the entrances into the building; where one washes and changes; where one moves through the link into the actual working area.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-41_para18"></a>I believe that all that should be on the face of the Bill. It is no good the inspector coming in and saying, &#147;I am from the food agency and this is my helper", and wanting to go in the back door to see what is happening. That is not allowable and may be extremely dangerous. It could also be very awkward for the owner of the business. I hope that notice will be taken of this point. It is important.

<A NAME="91013-42_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the Minister responds, I wish to support the amendment. Over recent weeks, I have made visits to poultry establishments as part of my Front Bench responsibilities. The one thing which <P>


<a name="column_CWH96"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is made abundantly clear is that you must wear clean overalls, boots and hair cover. It is even asked that earrings are removed. I support this amendment, which is of extreme importance. The noble Lord has spoken on the fish industry and I have mentioned the poultry industry, but I suspect that many other industries will be faced with exactly this problem. I hope that the Government will accept this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   I wish to speak to this amendment, too. When the Minister responds, it would be helpful to know how the producer stands if he tells the authorised person coming from the agency that, because he was not conforming, he would not be allowed into the premises--into the packing area. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether that would be justified in the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para0"></a>As I said yesterday, like my noble friend Lord Radnor I have a packaging plant for fruits--not fish--but I face the very same problem that we are meeting with these very specific, and very desirable, protocols determined by the multiples. They are nothing to do with the sort of regulations, necessarily, that the agency will insist upon, but they include covering hair and the like, which may not always be a requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para1"></a>If there were an instance which led to a loss of custom because a stray hair had found its way into a package, it would be very difficult to trace the person responsible, so there simply must be total standards maintained at all times. If that is what the protocol says, it must be enforced and it should surely be an absolutely essential requirement that the producer can forbid anyone--however authorised, and it might be by this legislation--to go into the relevant part of the processing plant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  This has raised a number of interesting points around the whole issue of monitoring enforcement. I agree with the general principles expressed by Members of the Committee that it is important that this process is conducted properly and in a reasonable manner. It is my intention to indicate to the Committee that I believe that this is covered by the Bill as it now stands.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para2"></a>I have no doubt that the monitoring of enforcement by the agency will be a very important function and an important tool for improving practice. Over time, I am sure it will lead to greater consistency in the application of food law. In that regard, it is significant that local authorities and the Local Government Association have welcomed this proposal and they are working with the Government in undertaking some preliminary work to ensure that it operates effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para3"></a>Let me turn to the particular issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in relation to Amendment No. 48. This would limit the power to require assistance to individuals who are competent to help those conducting enforcement monitoring. That seems to be common sense, but the effect that this amendment seeks to achieve is already provided for in the drafting of Clause 14(4)(d). This makes clear that <P>


<a name="column_CWH97"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an officer of the agency may only require a person to provide such facilities, information or assistance &#147;as he may reasonably request." In our view, this would limit any request for help to individuals who are competent to provide it since it would not be reasonable to do otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para4"></a>In response to examples already raised by Members of the Committee in this debate, it would not be reasonable to ask a cleaner to let the officer have access to computerised records, or a security guard to show him a production line. I hope I have made it clear that, in those circumstances, the agency must make reasonable requests.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para5"></a>Amendment No. 48A was spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, who, despite the lack of an O-level displayed considerable expertise in that area. I am pleased to be able to place on record our recognition of the excellent work of official laboratories and in particular the high standards maintained by the public analysis laboratories and the public health laboratory service. Maintaining an authoritative professional resource for the analysis and adjudication of enforcement samples remains a vital element in the enforcement process. The work of official laboratories will be of particular relevance to the agency's function of monitoring the performance of enforcement authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para6"></a>It is becoming common practice in our debates today to anticipate the Government's response to amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, anticipated the response. I can tell her and noble Lords that official laboratories were very much in mind when the Clause 14 provision concerning enforcement-related premises was drafted. I have thus included clearing within the morning any laboratory or similar premises at which work related to the enforcement of any relevant legislation has been carried out for the enforcement authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para7"></a>On that basis, I hope noble Lords will recognise that we embrace the spirit of Amendment No. 48A that we should not overlook the critical role played by official laboratories in the enforcement process, but believe that this is properly reflected in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para8"></a>I should say to noble Lords that the exercise of powers in the clause will be the subject of detailed guidance to authorised officers which will set out in more detail how they should operate and what would be reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para9"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 49 spoken to by the noble Earl, Lord Radnor. Again, the noble Earl has raised an extremely interesting point. I understand the point that causes concern to businesses and recognise the particular point about the implications for small businesses. I would again say that I believe this is already dealt with in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para10"></a>The agency will be required by virtue of Clause 23 to act in a reasonable and proportionate manner. I suggest that this would include observing hygiene requirements in conducting--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Radnor: </B>   Perhaps I may interrupt the noble Lord. The point that should be made is that <P>


<a name="column_CWH98"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people who have these food processing plants have rules put upon them which they themselves think are unreasonable, so someone behaving in a reasonable manner might not conform to the rules that are applied. If those rules are broken then the order is lost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath </B>  : That is extremely interesting, but in relation to the rules which have to be observed, it seems to me that the point I indicated in Clause 23 that the agency must act in a reasonable and proportionate manner still stands. Clearly it is self-evident that any authorised officer would have to comply with the law on hygiene matters, and furthermore, since it is the agency's responsibility and objective to protect public health, it will clearly be in breach of that if it fails to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para11"></a>Again, I say to the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, that since any person accompanying an authorised officer of the agency would have a direct interest in the public health purpose of the visit and will be present at the agency's behest, the same relations ought to apply to that person as well. I very much sympathise with the general principle he is aiming at, but the provision is unnecessary given the virtue of Clause 23 and the requirement for agency to act in a reasonable and proportionate manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_time0"></A><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, will be as disappointed as I am with the response given by the Minister to her amendment. It did not entirely take on board the concern that some of us have about the qualification of any laboratory or similar premises--and I quote now from Clause 14(5)(b):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;at which work related to the enforcement of any relevant legislation has been carried out for the enforcement authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-42_para12"></a>
The problem about an official laboratory is that it may not be working for an enforcement authority. It may be acting as a referee of standards. Therefore this qualification as to what is meant by working for an enforcement authority seems, on the face of it, specifically to preclude the laboratory of the government chemist. This is the issue which I ask the Minister to look at again very carefully, and perhaps to write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I will try to clarify this point. It is not the intention of the Bill to bypass the role of official laboratories. I agree they have a unique and important role in food law enforcement in the UK and in the EU context. The important point to recognise in relation to this clause is that it provides supplementary powers for the agency to carry out its enforcement monitoring role. It has no impact on the statutory role of the public analyst which is covered in Section 31 of the 1990 Act and the regulations made under it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para13"></a>While I follow the point that the noble Earl is making, the question of which laboratory is used is not relevant to this point. The point that we are talking about here is the ability of the agency where a <P>


<a name="column_CWH99"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>laboratory has been used--whether an official laboratory or not--to be able to pursue the monitoring of the enforcement authority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-42_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   I have not made myself entirely clear. If the laboratory is to be inspected in order to ensure, on behalf of the agency, that the enforcement authority is working to a certain standard, that is acceptable. I am sure that the legislation will cover that point and that any other laboratory would come into the same category. However, there comes a moment when you are imposing standards whereby the food standards agency will be required to assure itself that those who are setting the standards--which may be quite remote from a sample of food--have set standards with which it is satisfied. Therefore there will not be a sample of food involved in those cases. We are here trying to determine standards of food safety and monitoring how the official referee of standards has set about his role. The role of the official laboratory is quite distinct from the role of a laboratory which has taken a sample of food as regards determining whether or not it has achieved a certain standard. That is the issue which has to be addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-42_para14"></a>I refer to the qualification in paragraph (b). It specifically states that the laboratory must be one where work has been carried out for an enforcement authority. The example that I have tried to instance is where that would not apply. However, there will be occasions when the food standards agency will want to have access to the laboratory of the government chemist. Will the Minister assure me that if, for example, the food standards agency wished to assure itself that the official referee of food safety standards had done its job correctly, it would be qualified to inspect those premises?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I should like to take that point away and return to it at a later stage. The noble Earl has raised an interesting point which we need to consider. Nonetheless, if I may refer back to the general point, we are talking about the situation where an enforcement authority is using a laboratory to facilitate its work in these areas. This clause seeks to enable the agency to monitor the work of the enforcement authority and to have access to such a laboratory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Radnor: </B>   Perhaps I might say one last word on my amendment. The noble Lord has said that these people would act sensibly when visiting this hypothetical plant we are discussing and that they would keep well within all the laws relating to cleanliness and so on. The point I was making was that the rules of a plant could well be much stiffer than the law requires.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The test again, which the agency itself will have to consider when it is established, is whether in those circumstances its response to standards which might be higher than legislation enacted was reasonable and proportionate. <P>


<a name="column_CWH100"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I cannot really go very much further than that. I have tried to convey to the Committee that in general terms the agency will very much bear in mind those principles which the noble Earl has enunciated in terms of the expectations that one would have in relation to those officers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I am sorry to come back, too, but my noble friend Lord Radnor brought up a very important point. What is reasonable? I am still extremely concerned and in order that it appears on the record, I would like the Minister to say whether he considers that it is reasonable in any circumstances for an enforcement officer to talk to an employee of a firm without the owner of that firm being present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may take up two points. Could he define who decides what is a reasonable request? For example, we have had many problems within the Meat Hygiene Service over recent months--about which this House has had many debates--about reasonable behaviour of vets who operate there and we need to look at that very carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para0"></a>Again, the Minister spoke about detailed guidance to officers. In these three amendments we provide greater definition in the Bill. I hope the fact that so many of us have come back to raise important issues with him means that the Minister will perhaps go away and consider it and possibly come back to us at Report with greater definition.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para1"></a>It is a problem and I repeat that some of these units will not allow you on their premises, so it has to be written in the Bill. It is not a question of reasonableness; it is as of a right that if those are the standards that are applied, those are the standards that should be on the Bill. I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Radnor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Let me try to respond to that. Clearly, it will ultimately be for the agency to make a decision on the basis, as I have described it, of the test of reasonableness. It is difficult to go into all the circumstances in which such a test might be applied because that would not be possible. The guidance that we shall be producing, however, will obviously need to pick up some of these issues and the debate that we have had today will be extremely helpful in informing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para2"></a>In relation to the question about a visit of any member of staff in the absence of the owner, it again depends upon the circumstances. If the visit were an emergency it might need to take place in the absence of the owner but you come back essentially to the question of a test of reasonableness. As I have said, the whole of the agency's performance will be based on that test backed up by guidance which will try to reflect some of the points that noble Lords have made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-43_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I listened with great interest to what the Minister said and I hope that he will have listened to us and perhaps can come back at the Report <P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para6"></a>The Bill has been passing through Parliament at a time of considerable uncertainty over the future of the devolution settlement in Northern Ireland, It was therefore important that we should review the text of the Bill at the latest possible moment in order to ensure that references to Northern Ireland were all correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para7"></a>An important amendment in the group is Amendment No. 103, which ensures that powers will still take proper effect under the existing transfer of power once the devolution settlement has come into force and the Northern Ireland Assembly with it, and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister take their powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para8"></a>Most of the other amendments concern minor drafting points which clarify the references to Northern Ireland legislation. I met Members of your Lordships' House who took part in the Second Reading debate to explain the government amendments. I hope that their purpose is clear and that the reasons for making them at what I recognise is a late stage in the passage of the Bill is understood. On that basis I beg to move.

(&#147;(1) The Secretary of State on receiving a request by the Agency shall make orders under--")

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 53, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, which are consequential.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para18"></a>In Clause 17 we read that the Secretary of State shall authorise the agency to exercise on his behalf
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;the power to make orders under--(a) section 1(1) of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 ... and (b)section 13(1) of the 1990 Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-43_para19"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para20"></a>Whenever I see order-making powers my interest is immediately stimulated. It was stimulated sufficiently to table an amendment. I am afraid that my databank in far off Scotland was not up to looking at what the emergency orders in the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 entailed or those in the 1990 Act, but I assumed--and if I am wrong the rest of this argument falls--that they are orders as we would understand orders that are secondary legislation: they are orders that a Secretary of State can make that are laid before both Houses of Parliament and then either taken by the negative or the affirmative procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para21"></a>If I am right on that assumption, what we are seeing in this clause is the Government giving order-making powers to an outside body not directly answerable to Parliament. My puzzle is why that is necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para22"></a>In my amendment I have retained the power with the Secretary of State but I have said very clearly that I understand where the Government are coming from. They want the agency to have power to act quickly, I suspect because these are emergency orders. I have worded my amendment to say that on receiving a request by the agency he &#147;shall" make the orders, so that he would have no option other than to make them--but he, after all, is the Secretary of State. He is answerable to Parliament and he will be making the orders. I believe that is a much more sensible way of doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para23"></a>No doubt the Minister will tell me that other agencies have been granted order-making powers, and that may well be the case; but in a way I am not sure that just because we have a precedent that makes it right. We have an increasing avalanche of secondary legislation. If noble Lords looked at our Order Paper on Tuesday they would have seen three or four pages of secondary legislation which the Government have laid before Parliament since the Summer Recess began at the end of July. Those noble Lords who have heard me before will know that I am not entirely satisfied with the scrutiny that either House of Parliament gives to secondary legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para24"></a>My suspicions were doubly raised when I read that an agency is to be given that order-making power. I suspect that they will be negative rather than affirmative orders, so assuming for a minute that we <P>


<a name="column_CWH103"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wish to ask the Minister why these order-making powers have been taken then we pray against them. If we have a debate the agency that has exercised the power will not be able to come and answer. The Secretary of State will have to answer for something that he himself has not done.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para25"></a>I find this a difficult way for us to proceed. It is giving outside non-democratic bodies the right to make legislation. It may well be that the Government of whom I was a member have done it, but I honestly do not think that necessarily makes it right. We all owe a duty to watch secondary legislation; indeed this House and the other place ought to scrutinise secondary legislation in much more detail and far more effectively than at present, because very often the secondary legislation is what drives the legislation. It is not the primary legislation at all. I speak as someone who has made quite a lot of secondary legislation in my time, so I know that the devil is often in the detail of secondary legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para26"></a>I want the Government to explain why they have decided to go down this route. Why cannot they just leave the power with the Secretary of State and ensure that if requested to put in an emergency order the Secretary of State is obliged to do so? Perhaps they might give examples where they think this might not be a wise procedure, and perhaps they could answer the question as to who is answerable to Parliament for that secondary legislation. Is it to be the Minister or are we to look at a system where the agency will come before Parliament and answer for its secondary legislation?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-43_para27"></a>I have explained these amendments as much as I need. I am sure the Minister takes on the probing point I am making. I look forward to a reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, I am genuinely puzzled. Never having been a Minister I am not familiar with what is going on. As I read Clause 17(3), anything done or omitted to be done by the agency shall be treated as done or omitted by the Secretary of State. Then subsection (4) says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Nothing in any such arrangements prevents the Secretary of State exercising any power".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-44_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para1"></a>The noble Lord's amendments, especially Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, amend subsection (1). Is he basically tidying up and rearranging the prose, or is this a conversational point? This is what I am missing. My understanding of what he said is that someone is responsible to Parliament and it happens to be the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I can come back on that point and help the noble Lord. I did not realise when I was looking at this, but because of my first amendment subsections (2) and (3) are not needed. Subsections (2) and (3) are needed here because the agency has been given the power, but I will freely admit that I am by no means a draftsman. I <P>


<a name="column_CWH104"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>omitted (2) and (3) because I did not think they would be necessary if the power were still exercised by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, whether, when he was formulating the amendment, he took account of the 26th report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, and whether, in putting his amendment together, he thought its decision that this was both relevant and necessary should form part of his consideration?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I must admit I did not, and I am under no obligation to do so. I want to hear what the Government have to say on this issue. They must defend their decision to go down this road and I look forward to that defence. I know that the Liberal Democrats are used to giving the Government's defence but, on this occasion, I would rather it were the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that I was in no way seeking to defend the Government. I was merely interested in the spirit in which he had formulated the amendment and the knowledge he had had behind it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This has proved to be an extraordinarily exciting debate and we are most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, for allowing us to discuss it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para2"></a>I should say at the outset that we are talking, first, about food and environment protection orders which are used to deal with environmental threats--to prevent environmental contaminants such as lead or copper, radioactive matter or oil spillage from getting into the food chain--or orders under Section 13 of the Food Safety Act 1990 to deal with threats over the way in which food is provided. From that, Members of the Committee will see that we are talking largely about emergency orders which, by their nature, will be urgent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para3"></a>I can assure Members of the Committee that such orders are not to be used lightly, nor is the delegation of the agency to be used for administrative convenience. We envisage these to be emergency situations where the Secretary of State is not available.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para4"></a>For instance, in the case of an oil spill at sea, it might be necessary to immediately restrict fishing activity in the area. The agency would therefore exercise that right on behalf of the Secretary of State. As my noble friend Lord Desai suggested, however, the Secretary of State will still remain answerable to Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para5"></a>I should also say that there will have to be formal written agreements between the Secretary of State and the agency setting out the circumstances in which that would be undertaken. I might also point out to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH105"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord that the Select Committee on Delegated Powers, when considering this matter, felt that delegation to be both necessary and appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   When the agency has its agreement with the Secretary of State, will that agreement be publicly available? Will it be published?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am sure it would be right for that to be made available so that the circumstances in which delegation takes place are clear to everyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para6"></a>The actual wording of the amendment is probably defective and would end up giving too much power to the agency because the Secretary of State would have no discretion to refuse to make an order. However, I am sure that that was not the intention of the noble Lord, and that the intention was to probe the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para7"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, having considered this point, will see that this is a sensible arrangement. The Secretary of State remains answerable to Parliament ultimately but this is to ensure that, when urgent action has to be taken, it can be taken without delay. I believe that the formal written agreements are a safeguard in that sense, in relation to when those powers will be exercised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister and I am satisfied that he has put the procedures on the record and underlined the fact that the Secretary of State will remain responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para8"></a>I take the point that the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee thought that this decision was necessary and appropriate. Interestingly, the Minister gave no justification of why it was necessary. I am intrigued by that. The only example he gave was that in the case of an oil spillage it may be decided that fishing activity in that area should be stopped. I was not aware that there had ever been any problem where an oil spillage had happened and it was decided that fishing activity should be stopped. I was unaware that there was any great problem in Government bringing forward an order and stopping fishing activity. That is what they did around Shetland and what they did on salmon farming there as well. It is, after all, what we do on the toxins, which occasionally nature allows to bloom, which damage shellfish and we cannot have our oysters from the west coast of Scotland and such places for a little while. These things happen and the Government have a whole armoury to bring in orders immediately. The Minister has led me to be intrigued as to why the Government think it is necessary to give the agency these powers. Where have current or former Secretaries of State fallen down on the job?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I would not say that former Secretaries of State have fallen down on the job. The situation has been that where an order has to be signed with extreme urgency and Ministers are not available to do it, they have then had to be signed by officials. The situation there is that they do this under a convention arising from a legal case, which I understand is called cartona. The issue is that when the <P>


<a name="column_CWH106"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agency is established, the agency's members and officers will not be officials from the Secretary of State's department so cartona does not automatically apply, though it does apply between the agency's members and its officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para9"></a>If we do not delegate this matter to the agency in a situation where it is extremely urgent and no Minister is available, the orders would then have to be signed by officials of the Department of Health. Although this does not present a legal problem, the fact is that the expertise will be within the agency rather than within the department. On that basis, it seems sensible that delegation should be made to the agency which has the expertise, but within all the constraints that I have already mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-44_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that. It was very useful. I am glad that I put down the amendments because it has allowed him to make clear why this clause is needed. I do indeed recall that occasionally officials have to sign orders and I wondered whether perhaps the Government intended to give their Ministers more holidays in the future so that fewer of them would be available, but I will not pursue that argument. The Minister has been very helpful in explaining what the clause is about and indeed latterly he explained why the Government thought they should bring it forward. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

All of these amendments essentially address one issue; namely, the degree of openness that the agency is to have and how much it is obliged to publish or disclose. There are, however, some differences between the various amendments so I shall briefly explain some of the detail. It comes about simply because Amendments Nos. 57, 58 and 60 were tabled by my <P>


<a name="column_CWH107"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>colleagues in the Commons and were not debated because of the guillotine and, therefore, we tabled them again in your Lordships' House for discussion. Meanwhile, Amendments Nos. 57A and 60A, which are the same but go somewhat further, were provided by the National Consumer Council. Like a good hotelier, I felt it wise to give noble Lords a menu of choice, so we tabled them all.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para17"></a>I ask noble Lords, in looking at these amendments, not to be drawn into too much discussion on the detail. It is the substance behind them to which I draw attention and suggest that we debate the principle of just how open the agency should be in the performance of its duties.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para18"></a>I had an experience this morning at a meeting of the RNLI where we were discussing fundraising for crew training for the lifeboat in Thurso. At the end of the meeting the young lady to whom I had been speaking asked what I was doing this afternoon. I told her we would be in Committee on this Bill and she asked if I could explain to her what the food standards agency was going to do and what it would do particularly for her, knowing nothing whatsoever about it. I was put on the spot and had to explain in a few words what we are doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para19"></a>I said there are two things. The first is to regain the public's trust in food safety by the agency being open, independent and based on science. The other point, which is equally important, is for the agency to act--I almost use the words &#147;as an honest broker"--as an honest interface between the three partners which are the public, the Government and the industry. What came about through this discussion was the need for openness; the need for the agency to be transparent and the need for the agency to be fully trusted by the public in the main but also by the industry to make this all work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para20"></a>I believe the Government agree with that. I do not believe that there is any great difference and, indeed, it was on the Second Reading debate that the Minister for Agriculture, Nick Brown, said on 21st June that one of the agency's most important founding powers is openness. He stressed later on in the same debate the need for that openness and for it to be part of the agency's remit. In particular he referred to Clause 22(2) which goes some way towards doing that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para21"></a>In this clause and the amendments that I am addressing, we are back to our old friends &#147;may" and &#147;shall". As the Bill is currently worded, the power is given to the agency to disclose if it chooses to do so and we have already had one debate today on the importance of trade secrets and confidentiality. I believe that there has been too much emphasis on non-disclosure of information and that, for the agency to be successful and to achieve the objectives that we have all set for it, it is absolutely vital that it has a duty to disclose and that the exception should be non-disclosure rather than to have non-disclosure and the exception disclosure.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-44_para22"></a>As these amendments are going to be withdrawn anyway, I am quite happy to accept that they may well be technically deficient in all sorts of ways but we are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>seeking to establish with the Government the principle that the agency must be pro-actively open in order to fulfil its role; that it must be an honest broker and open with the public; and that it will presume in favour of disclosure and publishing of information rather than the other way round. If somewhere in the Bill it is required to do that anyway, that will be reassuring but, if not, I would seriously ask the Government to consider bringing forward their own amendment at a later stage which achieves that objective. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-45_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   My Lords, I briefly support what the noble Viscount has said. I think we have had too much of a culture of secrecy in many government bodies through the years, and I think this amendment if passed, or something like it, would help to roll back that secrecy. I think there is importance in the use of the word &#147;shall" in place of &#147;may". I also support what the noble Viscount said that since one of the chief purposes of this Bill is to reassure the public it would be rather ironic if it was seen in any way on the face of the Bill to be tight-fisted over information. I think this raft of amendments deserves support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-45_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I support Amendments Nos. 57 and 57A in the name of the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, for two reasons. First, I am a great believer in public bodies operating as openly as possible, and secondly, there is an important job to do--as has already been expressed--in rebuilding public confidence in decision-making about food.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para0"></a>The separation of the agency from the Government is part of its openness. The transparency of information flowing from the agency and the Government, particularly on advice, will be crucial. There should be a presumption of openness. That means that everything should be open unless there is a good reason for it not to be. Like the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, I do not think that the current wording--the use of the word &#147;may" rather than &#147;shall"-- shows a clear presumption in favour of openness. I therefore hope that the Minister will take this amendment on board.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para1"></a>Perhaps in her reply to the amendment the Minister could clarify how the food standards legislation will interact with the Government's proposed freedom of information legislation. There have been conflicting signals from different parts of the Government as to what legislation takes precedence as regards openness. For example, during the Committee stage of the Food Standards Bill in another place, the former Minister of State said that,

<A NAME = "91013-45_para2"></a>
However, that contrasts with what emerged during oral evidence to the Public Administration Select Committee on 22nd June.

This point was made by the head of the Home Office's Freedom of Information Unit, Lee Hughes, who said that,

Assuming we get the freedom of information legislation soon, two pieces of legislation will operate eventually. So perhaps the Minister could clarify how they will operate together and which legislation will have precedence.

<A NAME="91013-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   This group also contains Amendment No. 59 in the name of my noble friend Lady Byford.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para7"></a>I should like to say a few words about that amendment and about the amendment moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso. My noble friend's amendment makes clear that any information which is gained and published should exclude personal data. One of the problems of the concept of freedom of information is that the information may be about people, which quite frankly they have every right to think is private and personal to them. That problem has increased enormously with the advent of the computer, databanks and all the other things about which we know. I am fairly pessimistic about one's ability to keep one's personal data to oneself the moment they appear on any computer, no matter how secure anyone may tell me that computer is. I do not believe there is such a thing as a secure computer; I believe clever people can always find a way into it. It is an increasing problem.

<A NAME = "91013-45_para8"></a>Here we have an agency which in the course of investigating a food processor, perhaps, may be digging and delving quite deeply, and may well find personal information. It may, for example, find the income tax details of the individuals who work in the company. I fully accept that it does not seem very relevant to the agency, but the danger is that it might in the course of its report feel obliged, if things are drawn too tightly, to reveal all the information it has discovered, and that might go much further than I suspect any of us would like. That is why my noble friend has suggested that the words &#147;excluding personal data" should be added, to make clear that personal data, which are by definition relevant to the people employed in the factory, should not be made public.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para9"></a>Turning to the other amendments, I listened to the noble Lords who spoke to them and to my noble friend Lady Wilcox. I have some slight reservation which I should like to explain to the Committee. Many food processing plants do something to food which they think gives them a marked advantage over other people. There are many places that smoke salmon which believe they do so by some magical means which makes their product hugely better than everyone else's product. The same could be said about lots of other processes in the food industry. I can think of one very famous company which guards its recipes dearly, and would certainly not allow them to be known by anyone else. This agency may well have to obtain that information to work out what is happening inside a plant and how a product is created if it is looking at food standards in that product. I am quite sure the noble Viscount does not mean this, but quite clearly such information ought to be counted commercially confidential. I just have a slight reservation when I hear about openness and so forth. The noble Viscount wants to reassure me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-45_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   I am grateful. I do not want to get into a debate with the noble Lord on the subject, but he missed a debate we had a little earlier on. If he would refer to Clause 14(8), it specifically makes the point. If my memory is right it is a crime for a trade secret to be divulged, so my comments in asking for openness were in the full knowledge that trade secrets were protected. I totally accept everything the noble Lord is saying with regard to the flavour of smoked salmon.

<A NAME="91013-45_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I apologise for not being here earlier.

<a name="column_CWH111"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Viscount introduced it. It gives an opportunity to say something about the agency's power to publish information, which is an important tool in making this body open and transparent in its operations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para10"></a>He is right in thinking that I shall not say that the amendments are necessarily completely technically deficient, but I do not believe that they are the right way to go about ensuring that the commitment the Government have to the food standards agency being an open and transparent body is fully realised.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para11"></a>We know--and the point has been made by Members of the Committee--that this openness and transparency will be an essential prerequisite in restoring consumer confidence in food safety and food standards. That is a point to which we have referred several times in our deliberations. Even without the food standards agency being in existence, we have done a great deal to open up to the public and to interested organisations the workings of committees in this area, by giving access to agendas of advisory committee meetings, the papers that are considered by the committees and the minutes of those meetings. I am looking at other ways. For example, the advisory committee on novel foods and processes could open up its procedures at an earlier stage and allow participation by members of the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para12"></a>Some of the advisory committees are holding open meetings. Next week I shall be chairing a meeting of the consumer panel advising MAFF where there have been 80 expressions of interest of members of the public in coming along to attend that meeting. We have every expectation that the agency will build on and develop such practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para13"></a>When I look at the amendments I have to advise the Committee that I do not believe it would be sensible to change the Bill in this way. Amendment No. 60 is consequential on Amendment No. 57, and similar issues arise in respect of Amendment No. 57A. They would remove from the agency its discretion to decide what information and advice it should publish. Giving the agency an automatic duty to publish everything--the transfer from &#147;may" to &#147;shall"--would not, we believe, be the most effective way of creating a body that is open and transparent in its operations and also has the trust of those with whom it deals.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para14"></a>Clause 19 currently gives the agency discretion to decide what information and advice it should publish. Clause 22 says that the agency must keep records of its decisions and of the information on which those decisions are based, and that these have themselves to be available to the general public. We believe that these two clauses already provide a sound legal framework for an open and transparent body.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para15"></a>Although the amendment does provide for confidentiality to be taken into account, the Bill already provides a very clear test which would require the agency to take account of considerations of confidentiality which must clearly outweigh the public interest before it prevents publication. I believe that the test is more heavily weighted in favour of publication than the confidentiality provision <P>


<a name="column_CWH112"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contained in the proposed amendment. Making a duty on the agency in the way suggested would be both burdensome and bureaucratic because the agency would then have to publish everything as a matter of course, much of which would be routine and trivial, but not perhaps open to the public interest defence as it is normally interpreted because a great many things might be of interest to the public in terms of invitations that were addressed to agency members, officials' advice on whether to accept or not, rumours and hearsay, the press cuttings that are considered and the responses to them. I fear that if all this material were put out, even in the information age, it would clog up the agency's web site and the public pressures with irrelevant and even incorrect material of no help or no use to consumers. Moreover, it would mean that the agency staff would spend all their time preparing material for publication rather than doing the real work of improving food standards. I suggest, therefore, that the agency should remain free to decide what information should be published in the public interest. The public interest test that we have provided adequately deals with any confidentiality issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para16"></a>Confidentiality leads me on to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, when he spoke to Amendment No. 59. I agree with him that the agency's power to publish information and advice must not extend to personal data, but the Data Protection Act already protects personal information of that sort. Clause 19(2) specifically says that the agency may not publish anything that is prohibited by an enactment. It is therefore unnecessary to add those words since they are covered already by the prohibition which was referred to in the Data Protection Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para17"></a>I hope that that explanation of the way in which personal information, held or obtained by the agency, is already protected by the Bill as drafted, and the law as stated in the Data Protection Act, is reassuring to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para18"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with the intentions behind Amendment No. 60A. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that we have always said that the agency will operate openly and transparently, and the provisions of Clause 19 are designed to give a presumption in favour of openness. Equally, it was made clear that, where there are genuine grounds for confidentiality, information should not be published without first giving very careful consideration to whether or not that information should be released.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para19"></a>The provision in Clause 19(3) provides a test that the agency must carry out in deciding whether to publish any advice or information. That puts the emphasis on publication but, if there is strong interest in considerations of confidentiality which outweigh the public interest in the publication, that information might not be published. The judgment to be made against the presumption of openness is the agency's own--it has to decide where the balance lies. In doing so, however, it will clearly need to operate some general guidance, acting reasonably and proportionately, and taking legal advice.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para20"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, said on an earlier amendment, the devil is in the detail in all these things. I would certainly support the idea that that general guidance governing the operation of the agency's discretion in this area should be published. Indeed, I believe that the general duty on the agency under Clause 22 to operate transparently, so that the public can make informed decisions about the way in which it is carrying out its functions, would oblige the agency to put into the public domain the principles it is following in deciding what advice and information to publish. I therefore believe that this amendment is technically unnecessary and that the spirit it is trying to embody is already covered in the provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para21"></a>As has been pointed out, the agency will clearly need to take account of new developments including, for example, the new freedom of information Act, if Parliament approves it, together with existing legislation such as the Data Protection Act and existing guidance. The agency will, of course, be expected to go considerably further than much existing practice in terms of openness, bearing in mind the provisions we have made in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para22"></a>If we look at the way in which we have been developing these areas, the extension of openness--for which we are not always thanked--is already going on. The use and publication of brand names in the results of surveys has been controversial in some areas, but it is very much welcomed by consumers because it gives them the sort of information that they want.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para23"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked specifically about the draft freedom of information Bill and the differences as perceived between that Bill and the general presumption of openness--as I described it--in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para24"></a>It is easier to understand this if we think in terms of the proactive duties on publication of information that are put on the agency under this Bill and the reactive duties that are put generally on government organisations by freedom of information legislation. The proactive duties on publication are certainly much wider in this Bill than necessarily the draft freedom of information Bill at the moment. Those duties, as contained in this Bill, will govern the function of the agency in carrying out its work.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-45_para25"></a>Perhaps I may give an example that will make it easier to understand. Let us assume that an individual asks for a piece of information from the agency. It may well be that, when looking only at the freedom of information Bill provisions, the power of discretion not to accede to that request would come into play. However, the agency will function under the legislation in which it is being set up; namely, a presumption of openness in its dealings. In asking what takes precedence, therefore, the agency will have to conduct itself on the broadest and most open principles that are set out within the legislation setting it up.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-46_para0"></a>As the Bill is being set up before the freedom of information legislation comes into being, we are saying that what we decide in this Act will take precedence over the freedom of information Act. Is that what the Minister is saying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   It cannot take precedence over something that does not exist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   Only inasmuch as it will presumably be in place and enacted before the other Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   This legislation will come into force before any freedom of information legislation. So in that sense, there is not an issue of precedence. This legislation puts wider responsibilities of openness and a greater presumption of openness on the workings of the food standards agency than would be imposed by the freedom of information provisions that would govern the whole of government activity. I suggest again that the draft freedom of information Bill now being reviewed before coming before Parliament provides a discretion to Ministers to withhold policy advice to them when it is requested by an individual organisation, but is under no obligation to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-46_para1"></a>This Bill gives the agency--and this is the proactive as against the reactive situation--a general discretion to publish its advice to Ministers on its own initiative, together with a general presumption of openness. It therefore goes much further in fact than the provisions of the freedom of information Bill and, on my reading of it, it would not be possible. If the agency chose to publish its advice to Ministers--it has the power to do so and there is a presumption that it will do so--it would not then be open to Ministers to exercise a discretion to say that they did not want that advice published. Although even listening to myself it does not sound as though I have made it very clear, I hope that some of the interactions between the draft Bill, the freedom of information legislation and this particular Bill have made the position clear. Although I understand the reasoning for suggesting these amendments, they go too far in terms of putting the burden of publishing everything on the agency. I have given some reassurance about the commitment to that presumption of openness and the mechanisms both for ensuring it and for public access to examine the way in which the agency is conducting itself in these areas.

<A NAME="91013-46_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may ask a question. I may be dim on this, but I have been looking very carefully as she was speaking at Clause 19. I cannot myself see any presumption in the wording either way. I may have missed something or there may be other parts of the Bill which say it. Speaking for myself, I can accept some of the criticisms of these amendments because I take the point she made about having to publish everything. But on the point of where the presumption lies, I should be grateful if she could point to where it <P>


<a name="column_CWH115"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does presume one way or the other. It does not seem to me that subsection (3) raises any presumption there which amplifies one in any way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Clause 19 must be read in conjunction with Clause 22(2), which together give the presumption of openness.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   I do not want to make a meal of this, but I did have a look at Clause 22 and, again, I cannot see any presumption from this. I hear good intentions and it may be the way it works, but I still feel something a bit stronger is needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   I remarked on the fact that Clause 25(1) was a very unusual statement, allowing the Secretary of State to remove the prohibition on certain disclosure of information, and that is a very forward way of saying information will be made available even though otherwise it would be prohibited from publication. I remember remarking that at Second Reading and I thought that that was a very good indication of openness in the agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-46_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Perhaps I may help the noble Earl. Although the word &#147;presumption" does not occur in Clause 22, in Clause 22(2)(a) and (c) the use of the word &#147;securing" puts that responsibility very firmly on the agency. It is from the use of that terminology that the presumption of openness comes. It is a drafting point, but the use of the word &#147;securing" in those particular paragraphs--in (a) where the activities are the subject of consultation with those affected and members of the public and in (c) where,

I do not doubt that the Government's intention is to be open. Where I perhaps have a little difficulty is in how much that intention will be translated into reality as time goes by. There was one marvellous defence that I could see being drafted; the &#147;Oh, we will flood you with paper" defence. I was looking across at that seat over there and thinking that if the noble Countess, Lady Mar, were in her place, she would be my best defence to that because I understand there is one official permanently employed to answer the parliamentary questions. In fact, if you just published it all, it would probably save one employee. However, I shall skip merrily over that.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-46_para4"></a>The heart of what we are talking about is what is required as opposed to what can be done voluntarily and there are two points. The Minister said that my amendments would remove discretion, which is absolutely right. I want to remove discretion. Where I agree that I was probably wrong was in going too far. I certainly do not want totally to remove discretion and I certainly do not want to flood anybody with paperwork. However, I would like to see on the face of the Bill somewhere a requirement for a certain amount to be published or disclosed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-46_para5"></a>My second point--which is about freedom of information and this Bill--is that freedom of information is about the right to access. No government department or Minister has to do anything except make available that which is requested, whereas what we are asking for here is a duty to publish or disclose.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-46_para6"></a>It would be helpful if we could discuss this matter, perhaps not this evening but after we have all had a chance to read the debate. First, is there a right of access irrespective of whether a freedom of information Act is published? Should we in this Bill allow a right of access to information, and if so to what information? Secondly, what should we oblige the agency to publish or disclose? I do not wish to go any further than that now. It may be that when we have all had a chance to read what has been said and perhaps had a meeting to see where our minds might meet, we could come back to the matter at a later stage. Those are the two core points that I wish to make. I thank the Minister for her response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The first three amendments amend the definition of &#147;subordinate legislation". Basically we have taken the definition of &#147;subordinate legislation" out of the interpretation clause, Clause 36--which relied on the Interpretation Act 1978--because there was some doubt as to whether that definition would work properly in a devolved context. As regards most of the rest of the Bill, the term is adequately defined already.

<A NAME = "91013-47_para5"></a>This is to cover the event of a crisis such as an outbreak of widespread food poisoning. The agency must certainly be free to act quickly. However, in much of its work it will be assessing evidence collected over time and devising methods of improving food safety. Many of the methods will employ relatively small measures on a par with, for example, date-stamping egg boxes. No big deal-- to use a modern parlance--but for those who have to buy the stamps, rearrange the packing process, add a step to the inspection process, train their staff and perhaps even negotiate an adjustment to a job description, some time is needed in which to do it.
<P>

Turning first to the concern that guidance would reach the public or the media before the authorities that were going to be asked to consider it or to put it into effect, I take the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Luke, about issues in relation to, say, food poisoning. He also talked about the issue of meningitis and vaccination and the information which he said was not available to GPs before it reached the media.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para7"></a>Those are not the kinds of cases that would apply to Clause 20. Clause 20 is associated with the agency's power to issue general--I stress general--guidance on the management of outbreaks of food-borne illness. In other words, the agency might from time to time issue guidance material on the management of outbreaks much as we issue codes of practice under Section 40 of the Food Safety Act. The guidance that is covered in this clause, therefore, should not give rise to panic amongst the general public or enquiries from the media necessarily.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para8"></a>I agree with the principle that bodies like the agency should ensure that addressees receive guidance in time to deal with inquiries from the public or the media, or indeed other local bodies with an interest. I would certainly expect the agency to run its affairs efficiently and take all possible steps to ensure that people who need to have the information get it quickly as well as operating in a generally open and transparent manner. In relation to the clause I hope that what I have said reassures the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para9"></a>I turn to the publication of a notice period of not less than 20 working days. I reiterate the comments that my noble friend has made on a number of occasions this afternoon. We expect the agency to act in an open, transparent and consultative way. The amendment would require the agency to publish a written notice before it could do anything except issue guidance to local authorities and health authorities on the management outbreaks of food-borne illness. I am sure that is not what the noble Baroness intended. I assure her and other noble Lords that the agency will not be able to rush into things with undue haste. It will need, of course, to respond instantly in an emergency. Otherwise, it will generally be required to consult widely. It will always need to operate openly in relation to all those affected. Clause 22 ensures that. There is also a statutory duty to consult before making regulations under the Food Safety Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para10"></a>This amendment would be impractical to operate. in the spirit of the comments I have made, I would invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-47_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his answer to Amendment No. 62. I beg leave to withdraw.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments, Amendments Nos 64 to 68, attempts to make a number of changes to Clause 22, relating to publication by the agency of its general objectives and the other objectives contained within Clause 22(2).
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para18"></a>First, we believe that subsection (1) should place a duty on the agency to prepare and publish a statement of general objectives, only after consultation with interested parties. That should be a mandatory requirement under this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para19"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 65 extends the general objectives to ensure that not only its activities but also any administrative arrangements, such as the concordats between government departments and agencies, should be the subject of consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para20"></a>Thirdly, in that self-same Clause 22(2)(a), the consultations should again be mandatory. The words &#147;where appropriate" should be deleted and members of the public should have the right to be consulted on those concordats.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para21"></a>Fourthly, in Amendment No. 67, with regard the keeping of records in Clause 22(2)(c), the duty should not only extend to making sure that the records of the agency's decisions are kept and made available with a view to enabling members of the public to make informed judgments and so on, but also those decisions should be those of the committees of the agency and representatives of the agency. There are a number of differing intentions behind that group of amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para22"></a>Finally, in Clause 22(7), there is again a belt and braces provision regarding consultation with members of the public. We believe that the agency should consult all interested parties, including members of the public, before the statement is finalised. It should also be ensured that the agency consults not just on its activities but on its administrative arrangements and those concordats. It is also important that the public should be consulted on those concordats as a right. I beg to move.

<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para23"></a>Setting up a large, monolithic-like food standards agency is a mammoth task. We are very much exercised about the hows and the wherefores and the workings of it. We should not forget, however, that we need to look forward and envisage the future.

<A NAME = "91013-47_para24"></a>Were all produce to be labelled by country of origin and processing and packaging, with nutritional values measured, published and known down to the amount of the salt in a pre-dinner crisp, and were hygiene standards the envy of the world, the FSA would surely need, even then, to find new objectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para25"></a>Joking apart, most organisations require a view of their objectives on a regular basis, partly to ensure that they do not have too many to meet them adequately, and partly to ensure that they keep up with change. In the agency's case, the outcome of each regular review should be laid before Parliament and hence be open to informed scrutiny and discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para26"></a>We feel that it is essential to match a statement of objectives with an assessment of the methods and resources which will be necessary to meet them. Hence it follows that any restatement should be accompanied by a matching section on how matters will be progressed. Indeed, in an earlier amendment we talked about a five-year review on pesticides and animal feeds, and I advised noble Lords that I would return to this issue later.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-47_para27"></a>It is fair to remind your Lordships that schools, for example, are required to draw up an annual development plan which is scrutinised as part of the Ofsted inspection process. The Government have now added to that requirement that each LEA must also prepare an annual development plan which is also subject to an Ofsted examination, and this is behind the thinking and the reason why I speak to this amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-48_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 67. In addressing this amendment, I should first like to express my support for the sentiments of the wording in Clause 22(2)(c). The openness of the decision-making process is crucial to restoring public confidence in decision-making about food. Consumers need to be sure that all the factors and interests have been properly balanced in the decision-making process. Having it specified in legislation that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;records of [the agency's] decisions, and the information on which they are based, are kept and made available with a view to enabling members of the public to make informed judgments about the way in which it is carrying out its functions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-48_para0"></a>
is a considerable step forward. I recall that the National Consumer Council proposed to the Select Committee looking at the draft freedom of information Bill that such sentiments should be included in a &#147;purpose" clause for that legislation. The purpose of my amendment, however, is to ensure that this important provision will apply to a range of decision-making by the agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para1"></a>Perhaps the Minister will kindly respond to the following. Will the provision relate to decisions taken by the advisory committees of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as established in Clause 5 of the Bill? Will it cover the decisions of the agency's advisory committees? The agency is due to provide the secretariat for some of the advisory committees, including those on the Microbiological Safety of Food and on Novel Foods and Processes. Will this provision apply to them?
<P>


<a name="column_CWH121"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para2"></a>How will the provision apply to committees where the agency is providing the secretariat jointly with a government department? For instance, the agency and Department of Health jointly will provide the secretariat for the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA). Will they be open about the decisions taken there? Will the provision cover decision-making of bodies on which the agency has a representative? For example, the agency will nominate members on to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and the Veterinary Products Committee; will this provision apply to them?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para3"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify these points. The decisions taken by many of these committees will be of considerable interest to consumers and have consequences for public health. Therefore I submit that the decision-making process should be as open as possible for them as well as for the agency's board itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-48_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This is an important and interesting debate. We all share the desire that this agency will work effectively and restore public confidence. We all agree that one of the ways that public confidence will be restored and maintained is that the agency needs to act in an open, consultative and transparent way. I very much share that view. It is the philosophy that the Government have expressed in the White Paper and in terms of the drafting of this Bill. Although I would not recommend acceptance of the amendments that have been proposed in this debate, the spirit expressed by the movers of them are in fact going to be very much reflected in the practice of the agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para4"></a>I turn first to Amendment No. 64 which is concerned with the suggestion in relation to statements and the question of consultation. I am confident that the agency will wish to consult relevant parties during the preparation of the statement. As I have already said, we expect the agency to operate in a consultative way by virtue of Clause 22 and the current drafting of the clause certainly allows it the option of deciding to go for formal consultation. It is right, however, that we should give the agency some discretion in deciding whether or not to do this. It is also worth making the point that once the statement is published, people will almost certainly comment upon it. I would also expect, as has been referred to in previous debate, that the agency will review the statement from time to time and that there will essentially be a developing, dynamic process of statements, working out in practice, feedback and revision of statements, which will be developing during the lifetime of the agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para5"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 65. I am glad to have the opportunity to say something about administrative concordats because they have been the subject of much interest. I should stress that these will not be legal documents. The purpose is to ensure effective working relationships between the agency and other government departments with which it deals regularly. Essentially, they are about the nuts and bolts of the agency's daily dealings with other departments and they will set out the way in which officials will deal with <P>


<a name="column_CWH122"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>each other. Similar documentation has already been prepared and published between the devolved authorities and government departments. We would also expect the agency to develop similar good working relationships with a whole range of outside organisations such as consumer bodies, the Consumers' Association, local authorities, professional interest such as the Local Government Association and industry bodies as well and public health bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para6"></a>The agency's own concordat documentation will be published. I expect the agency, which as I said will be open and consultative in its way of working, will want to have informal discussions with relevant bodies in the course of preparing those concordats. However, one should bear in mind that these are about internal working practices which are clearly mainly a matter for the two parties who will sign them. In any case, these concordats are, as I already said, nuts and bolts documents, by their nature administrative and not a matter to be mentioned in primary legislation. Subsection (2)(b), taken with subsection(2)(a), has already achieved the aim behind the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para7"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 66, which also concerns consultation with members of the public. I recognise how important it is for the general public to be properly involved in the agency's activities. I expect that they will be consulted on all possible occasions and certainly wish to see that happen. I have no doubt also that the agency will wish to use a variety of methods to involve the public, including the Internet, conferences, market research, open meetings and all the other paraphernalia of consultation and involvement that is used by modern organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para8"></a>That will obviously provide a rich source of information and views to the agency. One has to say, however, that there will be some occasions when it will be impossible for the agency to consult the public on a particular issue and take the proper action to protect the public health. I am thinking here of an emergency where there is an imminent threat to food safety. On these occasions, it would still be possible for the agency to invite some consumer representatives for discussion but, clearly, it would not then be able to consult the public at large. I hope the Committee will agree that the phrase &#147;where appropriate" is, for good reasons, a practicality and a necessary qualification in this part of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para9"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 67. I welcome the debate about the transparency of the agency and its advisory committees and particularly the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. Let me stress again that the agency's decision-making processes will be open, transparent and consultative in order that the interested parties, including representatives of the public, can see the basis on which decisions have been taken and are able to reach an informed judgment about the quality of the agency's processes and decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para10"></a>Although this applies to the agency itself, there is no reason why the principles should not apply to the advisory committees. In practice they will because the <P>


<a name="column_CWH123"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committees are already operating with a much greater degree of openness, for example publishing agendas, papers and minutes and holding open meetings. The agency will have to take the advisory committees' advice into account in taking its decisions. Therefore the information they provide will be the type of information that the agency will make publicly available under Clause 22.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para11"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 69 which concerns the submitting of the agency's statement of objectives--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-48_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I was responding to Amendment No. 67. There are two other points I should make on this. The noble Baroness raised the issue of a committee such as COMA and asked what the position is there. This is a Department of Health-led committee where the agency will have a share of the secretariat. My understanding is that the general principles that I have enunciated will apply to that committee. It is more difficult to comment on the other area the noble Baroness mentioned which concerns committees or bodies to which the agency nominates representatives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-48_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I hope I may stop the Minister there.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para13"></a>I hear what the Minister is saying but I hope that he will discuss the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food and the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes because they are food committees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-48_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The principles that I enunciated would apply to those committees. Where I have some difficulty is in relation to the other point the noble Baroness raised which concerned committees to which the agency nominates representatives.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-48_para14"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 69 which concerns the laying of the agency's statement of objectives before Parliament. I agree with the aim of the amendment. First, the agency cannot simply produce its statement and never review or revise it. As I said earlier, I see this as a dynamic process where the statement is subject to revision. I also agree that the statement should be laid before Parliament. Clause 22 already gives the agency power to revise the statement and submit it to the appropriate authorities. I believe that it is right to allow the agency some discretion to decide when to go through the whole process of revising the statement, rather than to make it a duty to do this each year. We should also bear in mind that this is a statement of the agency's general objectives and principles, in effect its guiding principles, which will not necessarily change each year. Its detailed work programme will each year be set out in an annual business plan which will be published so that members of the public will be able to find out about the agency's plans and how it intends to put those into effect. I hope that what I have said reassures noble Lords about the statement of general <P>


<a name="column_CWH124"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>objectives and principles. It is not something which will be produced just once and then put on the shelf. I am confident that it will provide the framework for the agency's work, and as such it will be revised from time to time and the results will be considered in an open and transparent way. I hope that I have given the assurances that noble Lords require in this area, and would invite noble Lords to withdraw their amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-49_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down I would like to come back to him on his response to my Amendment No. 69. While I accept that he is pleading for flexibility on this review, schools--which I mentioned in my comments to him--have no such flexibility. The food standards agency which we are setting up is a very important body, and I felt quite strongly that there should be a review on an annual basis. My amendment sought to provide nothing other than that. While I hear what the Minister has to say, I am not inclined to change my enthusiasm for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-49_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   It may be helpful if I say that the business plan of the agency will be published annually, and therefore that might be more akin to the kind of report about which the noble Baroness is talking. The agency may decide that the statement of general principles needs to be revised at very frequent intervals, or it may decide that those principles hold good for a period of time. It is there that we need the flexibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-49_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I take a moment to read exactly what my amendment had said, and the kind response of the Minister. I admit that I thought I would be very lucky if I had agency representatives on other committees. I can quite see why other committees might wish to do other things their way, but I suspect I do not have committees of the agency either. At this stage I should have liked an assurance which is better than that which I have been given. A little more clarity would be helpful.

<P>
<A NAME="91013-49_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   No, it is not necessary for that to happen. Clause 23 of the Bill already provides that the agency has to take into account the advisory committees' advice in making decisions and that the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>information they provide will be the type of information that the agency will make publicly available under Clause 22.

<P>

<A NAME="91013-49_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I shall of course withdraw the amendment, although I must say that anything that closes down rather than opens up anything at all to do with this new food agency will be a retrograde step.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-49_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   This has been a very interesting debate and I should like to thank all who have contributed to it. I thank the Minister for his &#147;curate's egg" reply, and I shall explain that in a minute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para0"></a>First, I welcomed his statement that he believes the spirit of the amendments will be reflected in the practice of the agency. That is a good statement to make. Then in reverse order of welcoming, I welcomed some of the definite statements that he made. He said that the agency concordats will be published, although at the same time he said that these were rather &#147;below stairs" arrangements and not something one would wish to include in primary legislation. I am not quite sure whether one could see those as purely administrative. As to the way in which the responsibilities are shared out, it is rather important that members of the general public know how this is done--it should be made public. However, I welcome the fact that he said they will be published.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para1"></a>Secondly, I welcome the definite statement from the Minister with regard to the committees. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, tried to tease out the precise nature of the Minister's undertaking, but I heard the Minister say that, in practice, the agency will make available the information of the committees. I welcome that unequivocal statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para2"></a>It is when I come to other areas that I become rather less satisfied with the Minister's reply. When he was talking about the way in which the public are to be consulted, he was confident that the agency will do something--he expected that they would. The clause allowed the agency to do something and he had no doubt that the agency would do something. Those are all flags to me, indicating that we can say what we like during the passage of this Bill. I have no doubt at all that Minister's intentions are absolutely genuine, as were the statements in the White Paper, but it is not enshrined in legislation. The Minister was quite frank and said they must have discretion, and that there are some occasions when that kind of consultation will not be possible. In a sense, he has not minced his words. However, all those areas of uncertainty give rise to doubt about whether the primary legislation is sufficiently specific. While we will withdraw this amendment at this stage, we shall read Hansard very carefully and it may well be that we will want to come back at Report stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-49_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This is where we come to the important meat of this Bill. That is not intended to be a pun, but there are so many English metaphors relating to food and--I dare say?--the last thing we want to mention at this time of night is food!
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para8"></a>Clause 23 is important and I welcome the existing contents, but it needs further amplification. Amendment No. 70 adds on to the likely costs and benefits of the exercise or non-exercise of the power, in any manner which the agency is considering, as one of those matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the agency's power, the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;including any potential long-term costs to public health".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-49_para9"></a>
In view of the history of food safety in this country, this is of enormous importance. It is important that the agency considers the potential long-term costs to public health in the exercise of all of its powers. It needs to take a long-term view and it cannot afford, in public health terms, to take the short-term view. Indeed, one could say that Amendment No. 72 says the same thing in a different way--the precautionary principle is trying to take the long-term view. It is taking the cautious view, not a balance of probabilities view. In a sense, particularly in the realm of novel foods or GM foods, it is placing the burden of proof on those who wish to introduce novel foods or genetically modified foods, for instance. I put it no higher than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para10"></a>Those fall into the same category and I believe they put an essential additional duty on the agency. I believe that that is necessary not only on their own merits but also to give public confidence in the agency itself. It is the case that on a number of occasions, certainly in reply to questions from myself, Ministers have stated that a precautionary principle is applied by both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture. I do not believe that that is something novel; I do not believe it is something that is not already applied; but I believe that it should be made explicit on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para11"></a>The second major area for us is the whole question of impact on the small producer. I must apologise to the Committee that Amendment No. 73A is so late. It is late by oversight, not because it is an afterthought. It is central to our thinking on the exercise of the powers of the agency.

<A NAME = "91013-49_para12"></a>On Second Reading I took the liberty of discussing the issue of the Ducket's Cheese case at some length. It seems to me that although at the end of the day the department did not overreach itself, the issues raised by that case are of sufficient importance to give rise to an amendment to the Bill. The facts behind that case were that a stock of cheese valued at &#163;50,000 was destroyed when no sample of that cheese showed the presence of E-coli. That demonstrates to me the need for a safeguard of the type that is introduced. The small food processor, craft producers and small food <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>retailers must have the confidence that those powers will be exercised proportionately. That is a European legislative word, but it is exactly the phrase that best describes the way that these powers should be used. I look forward to the Minister's reply. This is a vital part of the way in which the agency should exercise its powers, we believe. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91013-49_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   I hope the Committee will forgive me. I have a longstanding engagement at a dinner that has already begun as a farewell to the hereditaries among the Cross Bench Peers. It is a pity I mentioned that in the context! I have had a word with the noble Baroness and she does not mind if I pick up her reply in Hansard afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para13"></a>I shall be as brief as I can. I am looking particularly at Amendments Nos. 70 and 72 to which I have put my name and at the short-term timeframe that is usually considered with food safety, when I think we need to be certain that we look at the longer-term things with public health: the chronic, long-term problems which are much harder to track down and a good deal more difficult to treat. I am thinking of things like the cocktail of low-level additives and colourings and pesticides in our diet where even the best efforts of toxicologists cannot give us all the information we want. I am thinking of GM foods and all that they entail. There was room for a precautionary principle with BSE. All these things are very important.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para14"></a>If we look beyond the toxicology to the broader field of nutrition, we come up against the evidence of the harmful effects of the standard western diet. Yesterday I quoted from a recent WHO report on that. It is worth noting that primitive people never got the cancers, the diabetes, the tooth decay that modern industrial man and woman are prey to. Heart diseases can take half a lifetime to manifest themselves. As with cancer, the seeds are sown long before in the kind of diet that young people choose.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para15"></a>There was a particularly interesting thing during the summer. I wrote a letter to The Times about it which it did not publish. It has just occurred to me that I can get it published in Hansard at no cost:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;Sir, You report that researchers have shown that a low-calorie diet may slow down the ageing process. This may 'lead to the development of drugs' to make us live longer.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-49_para16"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Why not just eat a low calorie diet?"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-49_para17"></a>
My point obviously was in my concern that we are a very drug-orientated society in terms of medicine, but the point for this Committee is that there is some interesting research--admittedly, it has not got very far-- suggesting that if we consumed far less calories we would be healthier and live longer. That could be something that the agency could possibly look at. It would be most unfortunate if the food standards agency did not take that on board. The message is not getting across.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-49_para18"></a>It is not popular of course. We dealt with the business of advice to the public yesterday, but it is a nettle that needs to be grasped and the sooner the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>better before we go too far down the wrong track. Of all the long-term risks to public health, the refined, packaged, animal-based, salt-laden, nutrient-rich western diet is possibly the greatest and, on past evidence, this is not an easy message for governments to trumpet. So the incorporation of these amendments would make it more likely that we get the information we need to live to a healthy old age.

<A NAME="91013-50_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I speak to my Amendment No. 71 which asks the Government to include the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;whether it is possible simultaneously to reduce the burden or cost (or both) of bureaucracy elsewhere".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-50_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para1"></a>As the Bill stands, the agency has no duty to attempt to control either its own costs or the costs caused to others by its requirements, unless I misread the Bill and perhaps the noble Earl, Lord Baldwin of Bewdley, will tell me I have.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para2"></a>We feel that is wrong from the point of view of the taxpayer who, particularly in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will be able to see an annual sum of money paid over to the agency for the support of those activities that cannot be funded by the levy. It is also wrong from the point of view that the levy payer needs to know that he will not be paying an ever-widening and deepening black hole. For instance, on 29th June this year, in a Written Answer to me, the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, confirmed that it was some 36 months since any spinal cord was found attached to a bovine carcass during an abattoir inspection. That is indeed good news that we all welcome. However, I understand it to mean that the measures put in place to stop any BSE-infected meat leaving abattoirs have been successful. I hope that powers will be considered even now as to how that burden of measures can be reduced without risking the increase of infection.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para3"></a>We believe it is both possible and reasonable for the agency to have continuous regard to the control of costs without jeopardising the successful pursuit of food standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para4"></a>Perhaps I may pick up on a point that was raised earlier. I too would like to speak briefly on the effect that some of the requirements will have for businesses in long-term planning. It is not easy to switch and direction needs to be given so that they can plan ahead. It affects small businesses more than larger businesses. I should like to include those as well in my remarks.

It prescribed five principles against which regulations and their enforcement should be measured--transparency, accountability, targeting, consistency and proportionality.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para5"></a>The Minister has already acknowledged the importance of transparency in a previous response. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, mentioned proportionality. It would be a good thing to see all those five on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-50_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   This is an interesting group of amendments. I have some sympathy with most of the points that have been made and the issues raised. I hope that I can reassure the Committee that it is not necessary to amend the Bill in order to ensure consideration of the broader points that have been brought forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para6"></a>I start with the issue of the long and short-term costs to public health. The noble Earl was right to point out to us that the long- term effects of nutrition and the effects on public health are something that all of us, throughout the debates on this Bill, recognised must be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para7"></a>I have to say in my boring draftsman role, that since potential long-terms costs to public health are by their nature costs as well as being risks to public health, they are specified in subsection (2)(a) of the Bill as it stands. The agency will of course be required to consider all of those before exercising any power. It would be wrong to give greater emphasis to one type of cost rather than another. I hope that the Committee will be reassured that the agency, when assessing costs, is not only taking account of immediate costs to business, which is one side of the debate that we have had on this group of amendments. Also and equally it must take account of the costs to public health, both long and short term, if it fails to take action.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para8"></a>By virtue of its main objective of protecting public health, the agency will have a clear remit in relation to all risks connected to food consumption. It should ultimately be for it to determine its priorities within that framework and to do some balancing of the different risks. That is one of the problems which confronts decision-makers all the time. If one were dealing only with one set of risks on one plane, then one can see quite simple directions of decision-making. It is when one is trying to balance and deal with different types of risk over different time frames that come together in the same set of decision-making that the difficulties occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 71, 73 and 73A are all, in various ways, about the principles of good regulation. As the noble Lord, Lord Luke, suggested, principles of better regulation have been established. I hope that it will reassure him to know that the agency, as a government department, will be required to observe the principles of better regulation, including the need to take a balanced and proportionate action to draw up a full regulatory impact assessment in proposing new legislation to Ministers. The Bill goes significantly further than that, however, by expressly giving force to these principles. In particular, Clause 23(2)(b) requires the agency to take account of the likely costs and benefits of the exercise or non-exercise of any power. This, together with the duty in Clause 22(2)(a), to consult wherever possible before acting, should ensure that the agency is alert to the consequences of its <P>


<a name="column_CWH130"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposed action, in particular the likely burdens on business. Indeed, in Clause 22, the requirement to take account of risks goes further still, since that would include risk to businesses as well as to health.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para10"></a>The better regulation principles to which the noble Lord, Lord Luke, referred will represent an important basis for assessing the effectiveness of the agency as a regulatory body. Where they are not already given explicit force in the Bill, we expect the agency to make use of its statement of objectives and practices to expand upon them as necessary. We made clear that this would be done when we consulted on the draft Bill at the beginning of the year. However, in some respects the Bill as drafted already goes further than the better regulation principles themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para11"></a>Turning to the issue of small producers and the need to encourage small businesses, the Government certainly recognise both their importance and the particular difficulties that regulation can impose on them. There was a short reference to that when we were talking about the costs of photocopying, for example, falling on a small rather than a large business. Amendment No. 73A adds nothing, however, to the substance of the Bill. Clause 23 already requires the agency to take account of risks, costs and benefits, which would include the probable effect on small businesses. There is, thus, a mechanism for taking into account the risks to businesses as well as those to public health. The agency would be accountable for any failure to observe these requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para12"></a>When speaking to these amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the issue of Ducket's Cheese, as he did on Second Reading. He recognised that the appeal judges agreed with the judicial review judge that the cheese that was held in that case was reasonably regarded as unsafe and that an emergency control order was indeed a proportionate response. We have discussed that issue of proportionality. Of course, we recognise the effect that an emergency control order may have on a small business but the power is used very rarely. Ultimately, however, that power is needed to protect public health. I have to say to the noble Lord that he should consider his argument about the proportionality principle which may sometimes not be immediately at one with the issue of preventing burdens on small businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para13"></a>This is the difficulty to which I was trying to refer earlier when suggesting that, if one were only dealing with one set of risks at any one time and there were only one set of factors to consider, decision-making would be greatly simplified. A precautionary approach to issues of food safety is, as the noble Lord suggested, absolutely the right approach to take. It is certainly the approach that the Government are taking now. It is the approach that we would expect the food standards agency to take.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para14"></a>However, I would suggest to the noble Lord that it is not sensible to insert the words &#147;the precautionary principle" into the Bill. There are definition problems here. The &#147;precautionary principle" describes the process by which we pursue the protection of public health, a process by which we approach decision-making, but it does not have a clear definition or <P>


<a name="column_CWH131"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ground rules for its application. This means that if we placed his amendment on the face of the Bill, there would be unconditional acceptance of the precautionary principle as such.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-50_para15"></a>We would all be aided by some greater definitions other than the one relating to the environment from which we are working here. We are looking at this point and I believe it will be considered sometime next year by the codex alimentarius. Common understandings of terms like the &#147;precautionary principle" would be very helpful. However, I hope it will be reassuring to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, if I make clear that we believe this clause already provides the necessary basis on which to follow the kind of precautionary approach that I have described. Subsection (2)(a) reads that the agency shall take into account:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;the nature and magnitude of any risks to public health, or other risks, which are relevant to the decision (including any uncertainty as to the adequacy or reliability of the available information)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-50_para16"></a>
That is one of the issues at the forefront of the precautionary principle. In simple language, if there is any doubt about the evidence or lack of it, the agency should proceed with caution. So while I very much accept and agree with the noble Lord's argument that this is the type of approach that we should adopt in the workings of the agency, it is envisaged in the legislation as drafted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-51_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Perhaps I may add one point to what my noble friend has said. She has already anticipated the conflict between the two amendments introduced by the noble Lord. The precautionary principle says when in doubt, do not worry about financial cost; just worry about public health. It is very tempting to worry about financial cost. The precautionary principle would say, &#147;To hell with the &#163;50,000, stop, destroy it".
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-51_para0"></a>Secondly, I want to make one point about the precautionary principle and its applicability. This is just a little plug for my own institution. The London School of Economics is setting up a centre for risk and risk management where we will come to terms with how we define and manage some of these difficult issues. It is not an easy matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-51_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for that very useful reply, which unpacked for me quite a lot of the clause. It was a very helpful explanation. In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Desai, it is traditional in this House for people to make conflicting statements, quite often in the same speech, and indeed to table conflicting amendments at the same time, so I am following a perfectly proper tradition in this respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-51_para1"></a>I recognise that in certain duties of the agency there will be a need to balance conflicting principles, and this is the essence of what most decision-makers have to do. On the one hand one is trying to achieve things for consumers in terms of openness and making sure that one does not prejudice the future, and on the other hand there are other interests which have to be upheld, whether they are those of large or small producers, scientists or whoever. That is the difficulty about legislating in this area.

<A NAME = "91013-51_para2"></a>My thrust was directed not towards the principles adopted but to the behaviour in practice. I do not want to argue the toss on the Ducket's case--the department had the legal decision in its favour--but there was still an argument to be had about the heavy-handed nature of the behaviour involved. Being a lawyer I certainly do not believe that winning a legal case always proves you are right. That is absolutely not the case and it allows us to chew over the facts of the case well after either plaintiff or defendant has won, and we can still have a view about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-51_para3"></a>I thank the Minister and I shall consider her response extremely carefully. I suspect that she is entirely correct about the fact that the proportionary principle is already enshrined in Clause 23(2)(a)--the uncertainty point--but we will have a look at that and consider whether we shall come back at Report stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "91013-51_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Minister did not make any comment in response to my Amendment No. 71 and I should be quite grateful if she would. Obviously it has implications to require the agency to look and see whether some of the practices in which it is currently involved could be redressed, taken back, and that is why I spoke about it particularly. The example I gave was with regard to abattoirs, but it could be other issues as well. Perhaps I could give the Minister a chance to reply. I shall not move Amendment No. 71.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-51_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I apologise to the noble Baroness if I did not make it clear, but in my dealing with the issue of better regulation I was applying those to Amendment No. 71, because the purport of that amendment is ensuring the agency takes full account of the possible cost burdens on those potentially affected by its activities, and takes balanced and proportionate action to draw up a full regulatory impact assessment in proposing new legislation, looking at the costs and benefits of the exercise or the non-exercise of any power.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-51_para6"></a>Those governing principles are the same for the workings, for example, of the Meat Hygiene Service. I believe she gave the example where there is specified risk material whether the same level of inspection was necessary given that the level of inspection we have at the moment is proving effective. You can argue that one either way, but if you reduce the level of inspection you might reduce the level of compliance; or if the level of compliance is very high you might reduce the level of inspection. Those decisions can only be taken when you apply the principles of better regulation, so that you are not overweening in the regulatory process but you are sufficiently rigorous to ensure that regulation is taken through. We have a framework within the Bill, and within the principles of better regulation, for ensuring that that takes place.

Inevitably, there will be those who feel aggrieved, unfairly treated, or even victimised. I have been told that the recourse to law is open to every adult in the UK.

<FONT SIZE=3>taking action. If it fails to do so it can be judicially reviewed. Moreover, the Bill provides for Ministers to intervene where the agency has deviated from those principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para0"></a>I quite understand the concern that those affected by the agency's actions should have access to an adequate system of redress. As we discussed earlier, the agency will certainly be transparent and open in its operation, and I believe that that should apply particularly to how it deals with complaints and representations about its decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para1"></a>I agree that the agency should have procedures for dealing with complaints about the way in which it works, not only about the decisions that it has reached. I assure your Lordships that the agency will establish and publicise a procedure for dealing with such complaints, which would in any case be required by the service first principles of government. There will be in that sense a separate mechanism for people who are aggrieved about the workings of the agency to take up their complaints.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para2"></a>We do not believe, however, that we need to provide a separate new appeals mechanism in the Bill. There will be various routes to challenge the agency's decisions and actions, depending on the circumstances. The coverage of the procedures is fairly comprehensive, although the right route depends on exactly what the complaint or appeal relates to. That is why it is important that there is a complaints procedure for the whole agency which can, as necessary, refer people to the appropriate mechanism.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para3"></a>The agency's own complaints procedure is of course one of those mechanisms, but complaints may be made directly to ministers or they may be made via Members of Parliament. Complaints can also be made, if necessary, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Appeals may be made to a Crown Court against the judgment given by a magistrates' court in a prosecution relating to regulations made under the Food Safety Act 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para4"></a>There are also appeals under Section 37 of the Food Safety Act 1990 against the action of enforcement authorities. This would include local authorities and might cover matters such as appeals against food safety improvement notices and appeals against decisions to remove prohibition orders and notices. There is judicial review of any decision taken by the agency, and there could also be defamation action.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para5"></a>This illustrates that the range of fields and legislation with which the agency is dealing is varied, and we must recognise that there may be separate and distinct appeals procedures already in existence. The spirit of those moving the amendments is that there should be an over-arching channel by which complaints can be made as well as the appropriate mechanism for formal appeal, and I can assure Members of the Committee that that will take place.

<A NAME = "91013-52_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, in speaking to Amendment No. 111, referred to the Meat Hygiene Service and to the enforcement of dairy hygiene legislation for which the agency will resume policy responsibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. I did not refer to those things at all. Amendment No. 111 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;The decisions of the agency when acting as an enforcement authority shall be subject to the appeals procedure".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="91013-52_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord. When acting as an enforcement agency, the agency will be undertaking the responsibilities of the Meat Hygiene Service and the dairy hygiene business. That is when it will act as an enforcement authority rather than a food authority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Perhaps I might ask the Minister another question, which may be unfair. In terms of the local authority powers which can be taken over by the agency, is an appeal through the magistrates' courts equally available against the agency's enforcement actions?
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_time0"></A><H5>8.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   As I understand it, there is an appeal when a local authority acts as a food authority in those areas. In the limited circumstances when we envisage the food standards agency would take over the role and act as a food authority, as I understand it, it would be subject to the same appeals procedure as if a local authority were taking that action. I should like to verify that, if the noble Lord will allow me, and write to him if I am incorrect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para7"></a>The reason I misunderstood the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Luke, was not only the technical issue, but because of the practical issue regarding the concern about the operation of the Meat Hygiene Service and the way in which appeals, reviews and complaints against that body could be undertaken. In fact, the chief executive of the Meat Hygiene Service recently established a working group to review the existing service's appeal procedures in co-operation with representatives of the meat industry. I understand that there have been good discussions at initial meetings of how the procedures might be improved.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para8"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Countess, Lady Mar, in her absence because she has been assiduous in following up this issue; in discussing how the Meat Hygiene Service's internal appeals procedure could be made more transparent and give reassurance to those who use it. On that basis, I would suggest that whatever the outcome of the exercises which are taking place to look at the MHS's internal appeals procedure, the critical point is that the appeals procedure laid down in Sections 37 and 39 of the 1990 Act already applies to the key elements of the enforcement of meat hygiene legislation. That power is also available to Ministers to extend that to licensing as appropriate. It <P>


<a name="column_CWH137"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is an important issue and I hope that we can make progress in the specific area of the Meat Hygiene Service. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that we shall be looking to the agency itself to have an adequate system of redress both for complaints against its operations and its decisions and to set up a complaints procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para9"></a>I hope too that by describing the other avenues that are open in specific circumstances, I have illustrated that it would not be sensible to set up one single separate appeals process for all the varied functions and responsibilities. There are quite technical differences, as we discovered, between food authorities and enforcement authorities as suggested by these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Perhaps I may quickly make a point before the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, responds. The Minister has made some very valuable points here in terms of unpicking some of the elements. From my point of view, however, it would be helpful if she could expand on that, perhaps in correspondence. Particularly in the exercise of the direct enforcement powers, there seems to be a great deal of uncertainty and worry about the state of the appeals system. In fact, the Minister has clearly set out that in many of those areas the agency is treated as if it were a local authority, or the meat hygiene service and so on. It steps into the relevant shoes and those provisions apply. It would be useful if the Minister were able to elucidate on that. Clearly, it would be marvellous if she were able also to talk about what form of complaints system is envisaged; what degree of independence it would have from the agency and so on. We are probably too early in the process for that but it would be helpful if we could have clarification of some of the more legal aspects, perhaps by way of correspondence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-52_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that interjection. It very much follows on from our concern that the appeals procedure should be totally separate--and seen to be so--from the agency itself. That is why our amendment suggests that the appeal should be upheld by the Secretary of State at a hand's distance away.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-52_para10"></a>My next amendment, sadly for everybody, goes on to deal in a little more detail with the Meat Hygiene Service. It would seem more sensible, therefore--in view of the lateness of the hour and not because I would not wish to speak more to this--if at this stage I withdraw the amendment but say that we shall deal with it in more detail at Report Stage. Any further dialogue between us in relation to that may be extremely helpful.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#147;shall be assumed directly by the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91013-53_para4"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para5"></a>In the amendments I have listed for this Bill I have tried not simply to revisit issues that were aired in another place. Rather we consider that most of these items have been rejected by the Government and have already received sufficient attention to make sure that the Government know their own mind and are happy to accept the consequences of their actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para6"></a>However, the Meat Hygiene Service is both essential to the production of safe meat and highly contentious in its method of operation and charging rates. It is moreover the subject of much argument in the methods and operations of the varying charging rates. We welcome the Government's decision to postpone the extra charges which were due to have been imposed in April this year which Nick Brown announced recently, but of that &#163;150 million, &#163;149 million would have been charged directly to producers to pay for inspections. In the short term this is welcomed, but in the long term it does not solve the overall problem on charges.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para7"></a>The Meat Hygiene Service is the subject of much argument over the implementation of the European directives. In the circumstances it is not right that such a service should answer directly to the agency responsible for both setting standards and enforcement of their implementation. This clause, if accepted, would mean that the food standards agency does the research and sets the standards, the Meat Hygiene Service implements the standards in the workplace, and the local authorities inspect the quality <P>


<a name="column_CWH139"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the work done in the workplace. The food standards agency monitors the work which the local authorities do, and where necessary takes action to enforce the original standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para8"></a>Such a system would operate through a series of checks and balances which would help to ensure that our meat is safe to eat, but the safety has not been bought at unreasonable cost as the result of unnecessarily long-winded procedures. I hope that is clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-53_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   I fully accept what I believe the noble Baroness was suggesting; that her Amendment No. 111A could sensibly be discussed in the context of this amendment if Members of the Committee were comfortable with that. Then it would need to be moved at a later stage, but the two do hang together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-53_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister and I apologise to Members of the Committee, because it was an oversight that they were not together. I had not picked up the fact that it was due to come later.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para9"></a>In Section 40, the term &#147;food authorities" should be amended to read &#147;enforcement authorities", which should be defined as including food authorities, the Meat Hygiene Service, the Dairy Inspectorate, and any other enforcement agencies which the Minister, or the Secretary of State, may designate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para10"></a>On appeals, the essential requirement for the appeals system is that it should make enforcement of Section 40 codes more accessible and transparent. At the moment, the only enforcement is by the direction of a Minister, but any person aggrieved by the failure of an enforcement authority to obey the provision of a code has no redress of right. He or she must rely on the grace and favour of the Minister, short of a judicial review, which as we know has its own limitations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para11"></a>The idea, therefore, is that a person subject to the activities of an enforcement authority, which are in terms subject to a Section 40, code should be able to appeal to an independent tribunal in the event he or she believes that the code has not been obeyed or properly applied. The issue can then be heard by that tribunal and its findings conveyed to the Minister following which a direction could be made. There should be provision for an award of compensation to anyone who has been materially affected by a failure to obey the code. Arguably, the enforcement action, which is subject to abuse, should be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal with the proviso that the Minister may direct the implementation of any measures which he believes necessary to safeguard public health.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para12"></a>Additionally, it is essential that the decisions of the food standards agency, including the provision of advice, should be open to appeal by an independent tribunal. Also a refusal to withdraw advice should be capable of appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para13"></a>To avoid complication, it would be useful to have a unified appeal system but with the discretion afforded to the tribunal chairman as to the panel members on any specific issue to permit specialists to hear a specific <P>


<a name="column_CWH140"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>case. Given the butchers' licensing provisions which are to come into force, it would be useful if licence refusal or revocation appeals were also heard by this tribunal rather than by magistrates' courts as proposed. Equally, the Meat Hygiene Tribunal of England and Wales could be brought into this system and I thank the Minister for allowing me to bring this up at this stage. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-53_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   My Amendment No. 77A is grouped with these amendments but, given the lateness of the hour and the debate we have already had, I do not intend to move it and I will come back to it at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_time0"></A><H5>9 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013-53_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   Meat hygiene enforcement is a key element of food safety and a major factor in public confidence about food. The agency's main objective will be the protection of public health and excluding meat hygiene enforcement from its control would leave a major gap in its remit. The noble Baroness is right to say that this issue has been debated at some length and there is strong feeling on both sides.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para14"></a>We have come to the conclusion that it is right that the agency should retain oversight of both policy and enforcement in relation to meat hygiene. Separating them would be both artificial and unnecessary. There is an essential synergy between policy development on meat hygiene and its delivery through the enforcement process and we believe that it is important to retain close links between the two. Experience of recent years, I suggest, has surely taught us that if nothing else.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para15"></a>Because it is an executive agency without any separate identity, the Meat Hygiene Service does not need to be mentioned in primary legislation. Powers are provided, however, in Schedules 3 and 5 of the Bill, to enable the Secretary of State to name the agency as an enforcement authority. This, together with parallel amendments to the relevant meat hygiene regulations, will enable the agency to assume formal ownership of the MHS and carry out meat hygiene enforcement on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para16"></a>It might help Members of the Committee if I explain now how we propose to provide for control over the MHS, because the first amendment begs the question of what we mean by responsibility. In practice, day-to-day running of the Meath Hygiene Service will be the responsibility of its chief executive. He will be answerable for its executive decisions to the agency's chairman and members who, having overall responsibility for the agency's activities, will be publicly accountable for all aspects of the Meat Hygiene Service's work. The agency's chief executive is also liable to be summoned to appear before the Public Accounts Committee to give evidence on the discharge of its responsibility as accounting officer for the MHS. These activities will come under the general control of the Secretary of State who will be responsible for the key policy and legislative decisions governing the way in which the MHS operates.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH141"></a>

<B>13 Oct 1999 : Column CWH141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para17"></a>While he will be publicly accountable for those decisions, he will not automatically be answerable for the executive operations of the MHS. We consider an important feature of the agency's arm's length relationship with Ministers, which the noble Baroness was supporting, is that it will take direct responsibility for those matters. On the basis of those considerations, I suggest that it would be misleading to provide in the Bill for the Secretary of State to take direct responsibility for the MHS. In particular, it would confuse the lines of accountability that I have already described and could raise unwarranted expectation about the level of involvement that the Secretary of State should have in operational matters. I believe also that it would be an inappropriate and serious erosion of the agency's ability to act in the interests of public health to keep the MHS outside the agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para18"></a>I hope, however, that what I described earlier in terms of the agency's own work--for example to set up a complaints' procedure with an element of independence in it--will reassure some of those who have had concerns about the workings of the agency. On that basis, I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, will feel able to withdraw that particular amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para19"></a>In relation to manuscript Amendment No. 111A, there is some misunderstanding as to the drafting. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred to appeals mechanisms in relation to Section 40 codes. We have already debated the question of appeals fairly fully, and, as was suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I undertake to write to them setting out precisely how those appeal mechanisms would work. I will pick up the points made about Section 40 codes in that reply, but I simply add now that a court would normally take into consideration the contents of a code of practice in considering any particular case.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para20"></a>I believe that the amendment is designed to ensure that the enforcement work of the Meat Hygiene Service is susceptible to the same powers of direction currently applicable to local authorities. However, there are a number of serious difficulties with the amendment as it is currently drafted both in terms of what it seeks to achieve and in the drafting.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para21"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, may be aware that a technical government amendment in another place to the Bill was made that corrected the provision originally empowering the agency only to direct enforcement authorities on the implementation of Section 40 codes of practice. The problem with that was that Section 40 codes apply only to the work of food authorities--that is local authorities--and not to central enforcement authorities such as the Meat Hygiene Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-53_para22"></a>Amendment No. 111A would have the effect of reversing that correction, and leave a factual error in the Bill because there would be a faulty reference to the Food Safety Act. It is not only on the matter of the technical deficiencies. On my earlier point about appeals in relation to Section 40 cases, in view of the lateness of the hour, my feeling is that neither my explanation nor people's understanding of it is <P>

<A NAME = "91013-54_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: We are getting to the final furlong so I will be extremely brief. It is a straightforward amendment.

<A NAME="91013-54_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   This is an issue of the need for the Civil Service lexicon, to which I have referred in other debates with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. The issue is whether &#147;regularly" or &#147;from time to time" gives greater assurance to the Committee and legislators that the consultation will actually take place, and at reasonable intervals, as the noble Lord was anxious to ensure. I have to assure him that &#147;from time to time" does not necessarily mean infrequent or irregular contact. It is intended to give the flexibility to consult as often as circumstances require. That is preferable to &#147;regularly" which could mean, for example, quinquennially, which I am sure would not be what the noble Lord would wish.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013-54_para10"></a>These are drafting points, but I am assured that one can ensure regularity better by putting &#147;from time to time" rather than &#147;regularly" in the Bill, counterintuitive though that may seem. It may be reassuring to the noble Lord if I tell him that there will be working agreements on how these consultations will take place within the concordat between the agency and other government departments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What requests they have received from the Government of Antigua for assistance in the training of police officers in crisis management for contingencies such as hostage taking and terrorist crime; what reply they have sent; and what action they are taking.[HL4114]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  The Government of Antigua have approached us on a number of occasions for such assistance. The FCO is currently considering a request for the training of police officers in crisis management. We remain in close touch with the Government of Antigua on this subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Windlesham </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>On what dates the provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 were brought into effect prescribing (a) mandatory life sentence on conviction for the second time of a serious sexual or violent offence (Section 2); and (b) a minimum sentence of seven years for a third class A drug trafficking conviction (Section 3).[HL4130]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office  (Lord Bassam of Brighton): </B>  Sections 2 and 3 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 were both brought into effect on 1 October 1997.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Windlesham </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many convicted offenders have been sentenced under Sections 2 and 3 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 since commencement; and in how many cases did the sentencing courts make use of the exceptions contained in Sections 1(2) and 1(3) of that Act.[HL4131]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Comprehensive information is not currently available centrally. However, Prison Service records confirm that there are 103 prisoners currently serving life sentences imposed under Section 2 of the Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013w01_para0"></a>Arrangements are being made to monitor cases arising under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act from December of this year, when Section 4 is commenced. This will provide information about eligibility for a mandatory sentence and whether such a sentence was in fact imposed.

<A NAME = "91013w01_para1"></a>Section 1 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 was repealed by Schedule 10 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The relevant exceptions are now contained in Sections 2(2), 3(2) and 4(2).
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Windlesham </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they intend to bring into force Section 4 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (minimum of three years' imprisonment on third conviction for domestic burglary); and what are the reasons why the commencement of this section was delayed for a longer period than the other mandatory sentences in the same Act.[HL4132]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced in January this year, Section 4 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 will come into force in December this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013w01_para2"></a>Like their predecessor, this Government made it clear that implementation of Section 4 depended on the capacity of the Prison Service and available resources. We are now confident that the Prison Service has the capacity to cope with the increase in the prison population to which Section 4 will give rise.


<A NAME = "91013w01_sbhd2"></A><H4><center>Political Donations: Tax Relief</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>In view of the statement in paragraph 6.3 of the response of the Home Office to the Fifth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life that the tax relief scheme on donations to political parties as proposed by the committee would be expensive for the Inland Revenue to administer, what would be the estimated annual cost to the Inland Revenue of administering such a scheme.[HL4143]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The reasons given in the White Paper for not allowing tax relief on donations to political parties are that it would amount to general state aid by another route; that it would be expensive for the Inland Revenue and political parties to administer relative to the likely level of take-up; and that the Government have to balance the loss of revenue against other spending priorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91013w01_para3"></a>The administrative costs have not been estimated precisely either in the Neill Committee's report or subsequently. It is, however, clear that they would significantly offset the benefit, particularly in relation to smaller donations. The Neill Committee recognised in paragraph 8.21 of its report that below a certain level it would be uneconomic for a party to claim tax relief on a donation.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  The blood services in Scotland and England issued heat treated blood products in December 1984 and February 1985 respectively to eliminate HIV transmission. We now know that intensive heat treatment also inactivated hepatitis C, which was not specifically identified until 1989. The heat treatment used in Scotland between 1984 and 1987 was less intensive than that used in England and while it inactivated HIV it did not fully eliminate hepatitis C transmission through blood products. When this became evident the blood service in Scotland increased the level of heat treatment to eliminate hepatitis C transmission as well. Our general policy remains that compensation or other financial help to patients is given only when the National Health Service or individuals working in it have been at fault.
 
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>In view of the recent disclosure that haemophilia treatment in Scotland was not inactivated against hepatitis C until up to a year after that produced elsewhere in the United Kingdom:
<P>
(a) how many English, Welsh and Northern Irish patients with haemophilia were given clotting factor treatment produced in Scotland between 1985 and 1987;
<P>
(b) what steps the Department of Health is taking to trace and inform such patients that they may have been infected with hepatitis C through clotting factor products made in Scotland after 1985; and

(c) whether they will reverse their decision not to conduct a full inquiry into the effects of <P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   One hundred and ninety vials heated at less than the current conditions of 80 per cent centigrade were sent to England and Wales between 1985 and 1987. Northern Ireland was, and continues to be, supplied routinely with clotting factors manufactured in Scotland. Most people with haemophilia requiring treatment visit their haemophilia centre at least once a year for an annual review which includes consideration of possible past hepatitis C infection. However, we are asking UK haemophilia centre directors to ensure that all those who might possibly have been infected with hepatitis C are offered counselling, testing and, where appropriate, treatment. We do not propose a further inquiry.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_wqn7"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will urgently review the treatment for patients with haemophilia who have been infected with hepatitis C by contaminated NHS blood products so that patients are not denied
the only available licensed treatment (interferon/ribavirin) on grounds of cost.[HL4117]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91013w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   We have made it clear that care is to be provided for all medical conditions on the basis of clinical need and effectiveness. The combination therapy interferon/ribavirin received a marketing authorisation in May 1999. The NHS Health Technology Assessment is funding research to establish the effectiveness of the early treatment of hepatitis C with alpha interferon or with interferon and ribavirin. We are also funding the Royal College of Physicians, the British Society of Gastroenterology and the British Association for the Study of the Liver to develop evidence based clinical guidelines for the management of patients with hepatitis C. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is likely to consider treatment for hepatitis C in early 2000.
