Clerk of the Parliaments:</b> My Lords, I can now
announce the result of the election for the office of Lord Speaker.
Details of the votes cast are being made available in the Printed Paper
Office. The successful candidate was the Baroness
Hayman.</p><p><a name="06070448000011"></a><b><a name="06070448000644"></a>Lord
Luce:</b> My Lords, I have the honour to notify your
Lordships that Her Majesty the Queen, having been informed that your
Lordships have elected the Baroness Hayman to be Lord Speaker, has
pleasure in confirming your Lordships&#146; choice of her as your
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06070448000012"></a><b><a name="06070448000645"></a>The
Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b> My
Lords, I rise on a significant and special day for this House, that of
the election of a Lord Speaker. As the House knows, the Lord Speaker
replaces the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on the
Woolsack.</p><p><a name="06070448000013"></a>I begin by paying
tribute to my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton. He is
known for his unfailing good humour, patience and pragmatism, and he
has helped to steer the House through a period of important change. My
noble and learned friend has the distinction of being the last Lord
Chancellor to act as Speaker in the House of Lords, and I am grateful
to him for ushering in a new era with his customary charm. I have to
say to the House that there have been occasions when I have seen my
noble and learned friend on the Woolsack and have despaired because,
despite the efforts of many, his wig never seemed to stay on straight
for very long. I am delighted that my noble and learned friend will now
continue to contribute to the business of this House from the
Government Front Bench as Secretary of State for Constitutional
Affairs.</p><p><a name="06070448000014"></a>Some Members of your
Lordships&#146; House will know that Robert Moy, the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s Purse Bearer, and Norah Dobinson, the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s Train Bearer, are due to retire after more
than20 years of service to the department. Their service has
been exemplary. I am sure that all noble Lords will wish to join me in
thanking them for their service and wishing them a long and happy
retirement.</p><p><a name="06070448000015"></a>I now turn to the
new Lord Speaker. I am delighted to welcome the first elected Speaker
of the House of Lords. The House now has its own representative as
Speaker, who has been chosen by its Members. I have known and worked
with my noble friend for many years. She has enormous respect for this
House, its traditions and its contribution to the working of our
bicameral Parliament. I am sure that, as she has said, 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_122"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>she will be an energetic, diplomatic and persuasive ambassador for the
House, its value and its values. We all look forward to working with
our new Lord
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06070448000016"></a><b><a name="06070448000646"></a>Lord
Strathclyde:</b> My Lords, on behalf of the
Opposition, it gives me the greatest pleasure to congratulate and
welcome the noble Baroness on her election as Lord Speaker. She will
know that it is a mark of the respect she has in this House and our
confidence that she will represent this House with distinction outside
and respect its authority and self-regulation
inside.</p><p><a name="06070448000017"></a>I hope she will
understand that in the past I had some reservations about the necessity
for and the cost of this new role, but I fully accept the
House&#146;s decision and share the feelings of the whole House,
demonstrated this afternoon, that this first term of a Lord Speaker
will be successful, as I am certain it will be in the noble
Baroness&#146;s hands.</p><p><a name="06070448000018"></a>It would be wrong to
allow the passing of the historic role of Lord Chancellor to go without
comment. It was a unique office, a typically British anomaly that
worked wonderfully well, one that protected the judiciary and lent
grace and authority to this House. It was held by that remarkable
succession of individuals whose Arms surround us in this Chamber. I
will not list them all, but I confine myself to the names of Becket,
More and Bacon, among Lord Chancellors of England, and Hardwicke,
Halsbury, Birkenhead and Hailsham among chancellors of Great Britain.
The roll-call of the centuries speaks for
itself.</p><p><a name="06070448000019"></a>Now no more Lord
Chancellors will follow in that distinguished line. The noble and
learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has achieved what he undertook
on the day his predecessor resigned. Now the House can let him disrobe
and depart in peace. He may now be able to enjoy a rather longer lunch
than he has been able to until now, but we hope that we will see much
more of him on the Front
Bench.</p><p><a name="06070448000020"></a>I echo the words of the
noble Baroness the Leader of the House in giving our appreciation to
Bob Moy and Norah Dobinson, who held the posts of Purse Bearer and
Train Bearer with such dignity and grace over so many
years.</p><p><a name="06070448000021"></a>Now we must close that
book and turn to the future. Let us hope that, led by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayman, a line of Speakers as long and distinguished as
the line of Lord Chancellors now opens up. Let us pray that this House
goes on in unity and common purpose to serve our country for many
centuries to
come.</p><p><a name="06070448000022"></a><b><a name="06070448000647"></a>Lord
McNally:</b> My Lords, I echo the optimism with which
the leader of the Opposition finished his tribute. We on these Benches
were enthusiastic supporters of this change as part of making this
House, to use the current phrase, &#147;fit for purpose&#148; in
the 21st century.</p><p><a name="06070448000023"></a>I can take
great pride in assuring the new Lord Speaker that I voted for her,
which demonstrates the inherent cunning of the House of Lords in
devising such an election method. It is also a real pleasure, and 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_123"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I hope that she took great encouragement from the growl of approval from
all parts of the House. I have known her a longish time and have always
seen her as a kind of Julie Andrews figure in politics. It may well be
that in her new role, she needs something of the skills of a nanny and
of a singing nun&#151;we will have to see. But it is the beginning of
a new era and I can think of no one more fitting to start us on that
road.</p><p><a name="06070448000024"></a>We say farewell to the
Lord Chancellor. When I first came here, 40 years ago, the Lord
Chancellor was Gerald Gardiner. I cannot remember anyone referring to
him as &#147;Gerry&#148;. But it says something for the way in
which the Lord Chancellor has humanised the role that many call him
&#147;Charlie&#148;&#151;and they do so with a familiarity and a
fondness for the way in which he has carried through his task. I hope
the speed at which the wig was removed does not mean that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer has already put it on eBay. He will be
remembered not only as the last Lord Chancellor to occupy that position
but as one who has done great service to the House as its Speaker. We
wish him well in his new position as a member of the government Front
Bench.</p><p><a name="06070448000025"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord
Strathclyde, said, this is a new and exciting beginning. We could have
no better person to lead us into
it.</p><h5><a name="06070448000330"></a>2.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06070448000026"></a><b><a name="06070448000648"></a>Lord
Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords,
the choice by the House of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, as our new
and first elected Speaker will be very widely welcomed in Parliament
and, on behalf of almost 200 Cross-Benchers, I very warmly join in that
welcome. The noble Baroness is more than qualified by her long
experience in committee work, as a former MP and as a Minister in three
testing jobs, in health, transport and agriculture. It is a particular
pleasure for me, who served for many years in the Ministry of
Agriculture, to see on the Woolsack the noble Baroness, who had a very
hard dossier there and emerged from the Ministry of Agriculture safe
and sound. Her work on charities and other organisations gives us
complete confidence that she will fulfil the role that we now foresee
for our Lord Speaker in representing our interests outside Parliament,
and she will be, as she said in her own short statement, an energetic,
diplomatic and persuasive ambassador for the
House.</p><p><a name="06070448000027"></a>I also wish to express
the Cross-Bench Peers&#146; appreciation for the noble and learned
Lord the Lord Chancellor and, with him on this occasion, the Train
Bearer and Purse Bearer. I pointed out when I spoke about the
Speakership in January that the title of Lord Chancellor can be traced
back to Angmendus in 605 AD. It is rather sad that the noble and
learned Lord with that title will, from today, no longer sit on the
Woolsack. But the noble and learned Lord&#146;s ability and personal
qualities&#151;apart, of course, from a certain tendency to reform
the House&#151;have always been appreciated by my Cross-Bench
colleagues, and when we say goodbye to his occupation of the Woolsack
we again record our appreciation to him at the same time as we welcome
our new Lord Speaker, the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayman.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070448000028"></a><b><a name="06070448000649"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Chester:</b> My Lords, we on these
Benches add our thanks to the Lord Chancellor for his duties on the
Woolsack in recent years and our congratulations to the noble Baroness
on her election as Lord
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06070448000029"></a>There were nine
candidates from all sides of the House, apart from these Benches. That
does not mean that the duties of the Lord Speaker will be in any sense
unspiritual; quite the opposite. It seems to me that the role bears
something of a spiritual trust for the great traditions of this House,
and I know that the noble Baroness is ideally placed for this important
task.</p><p><a name="06070448000030"></a>I am told that one or two
Bishops gave at least a passing thought to standing and were
tempted&#151;though without sin. In fact, any Bishop who did stand
and was successful would immediately have had to resign their bishopric
and from the House, so that is perhaps why they did not stand in the
first place.</p><p><a name="06070448000031"></a>But to what might
we compare the role of the Lord Speaker? The noble Lord, Lord McNally,
suggests Julie Andrews; I had wondered about the Archbishop of
Canterbury, who also presides, with much honour and influence but not
much direct power, over a self-regulating institution known as the
Church of England. One might have forgiven the Archbishop in recent
weeks if he had indeed thought of
standing.</p><p><a name="06070448000032"></a>The Archbishop's task
in the Church has been likened to trying to manage a herd of cats: the
harder you try, the more they scatter. The new Lord Speaker will not
have quite such a difficult task, but it will be a sensitive and
delicate task. We all wish her well as she settles down to the
task.</p><p><a name="06070448000033"></a>The Jewish and Christian
faiths hold the Psalms in common, although they are, of course, of
Jewish origin. I end by adapting a verse from the Psalm that I read
during Prayers, to the task of our new Lord Speaker: her work is worthy
to be praised, and had in honour, and may her righteousness endure for
ever.</p><h5><a name="06070448000331"></a>2.50

Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord
Falconer of Thoroton):</b> My Lords, this is a hugely
important day for your Lordships&#146; House. For me, it has been one
of the greatest privileges of my life to serve your Lordships' House as
its Speaker for the past three years. This House is one of the great
institutions of our country. Despite how it may appear to some outside,
it has always proved able to change and to adapt and, for the good of
the country, to secure its place at the heart of our constitutional
legislative arrangements.</p><p><a name="06070448000035"></a>Today
is one of those days of change. Rarely do we have such days when the
change is so visible. These are days of great sadness. For centuries a
Lord Chancellor has sat on the Woolsack and 345 years ago his position
was formalised in Standing Orders. Throughout those years the role of
the Lord Chancellor has changed dramatically. My great17th
century predecessor, the Earl of Clarendon, sought to ensure that
judges never exhibited signs of independence and the Lords did the
Crown&#146;s bidding. Now the judges rightly look to the Lord
Chancellor to protect their independence and the Lords look on the
Executive as someone constantly in need of a 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>critical friend. I often wish the emphasis were more on
&#147;friend&#148; than &#147;critical&#148;.</p><p><a name="06070448000036"></a>We change with the times. These changes
carry with them the seeds of our future. We are a respected, effective
second Chamber, constructive in our approach and keen to do as good a
job as we can in scrutinising legislation and holding the Executive to
account. Today, the House loses two of its most popular and effective
servants, my Purse Bearer, Bob Moy, and my Train Bearer, Norah
Dobinson. The House has always held them in the highest possible
regard. Between them, they have served five Lord Chancellors,
stretching back 20 years. They have ensured both the dignity of the
office and that the office has been fully informed of all current
gossip in the House. I thank them profoundly for all that they have
done.</p><p><a name="06070448000037"></a>Others have supported me
in my role as Speaker of your Lordships' House. The Clerk of the
Parliaments has ensured that I am properly briefed on the business of
the day. He always arrives promptly at 2.15 pm each day; I invariably
arrive late. The Doorkeepers and the security staff ensure that we can
work in a safe and orderly environment. They carry out their duties
with such diligence that they have, on occasion, halted my procession
and asked for my security pass, which I have not had. Finally, the
staff of the House work to ensure that the business proceeds
efficiently and that your Lordships are well supported.</p><p><a name="06070448000038"></a>We are indeed lucky to have as our first
elected Speaker the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman. She carries the
support and good wishes of the whole House. She will both respect our
traditions and look with new eyes on the office of Speaker.</p><p><a name="06070448000039"></a>This is a very different place from when
I joined. No doubt it will change further as a result of today&#146;s
changes. Our voice has changed; we stand for new and more varied
things; our membership has changed so much; our viewpoint and our voice
frequently differ from the Government&#146;s and also from the
Opposition&#146;s. It is the voice and viewpoint of this House; it
connects to the world outside. Despite the very sincerely held
opposition to the changes to parts of this House, throughout the three
years this place has been consistently warm and affectionate to me and
to my family. I thank every Member of the House profoundly for that.
Life for me will never be the same again. The most important
&#147;thank you&#148; is to the House for all it has done to
support me in my role as Speaker. I thank the House for giving me the
honour of serving
it.</p><p><a name="06070448000040"></a><b><a name="06070448000651"></a>Earl
Ferrers:</b> My Lords, may I be permitted to make an
observation? As one who has been against the change from the beginning,
I nevertheless congratulate the noble and learned Lord the Lord
Chancellor on achieving what he set out to achieve. It was a very
considerable task. He persuaded your Lordships' House; he persuaded the
other place; Parliament agreed. We congratulate him on that. However, I
have a sneaking feeling that, somewhere in the depths of his heart, a
little tear is being shed for the role which he played and for the
office in which he participated, which is now to be no more.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070448000041"></a>I congratulate the noble Baroness, the new

achievement. She has been chosen by the whole House and she will be
warmly welcomed and warmly supported, whatever views we might have had
about the change in the past. We wish her the greatest success. She
will do her task with elegance and charm, and great graciousness as
well. I know that she will rely on the goodwill and the friendship of
all of us in your Lordships'

Lord Speaker (Baroness Hayman):</b>
My Lords, nobody could take up the position that I
have done today without a sense of honour and a sense of history. It is
customary on these occasions to say that your predecessor is a very
hard act to follow. When you have to talk about several centuries of
predecessors who are enormously hard acts to follow there is a
tremendous sense of responsibility. I feel that sense and I will do my
utmost to live up to the responsibilities with which the House has
entrusted me.</p><p><a name="06070448000046"></a>One of the things
made very clear to me during the debates about the change to a Lord
Speaker was that the last thing that the House wanted inside its
confines was long speeches from the Woolsack. That mistake I will not
make today. However, I wish to add my thanks for, and my tribute to,
what has been said already and the very kind words that have been
addressed to me.</p><p><a name="06070448000047"></a>I am always
slightly nervous when one is congratulated and told of one&#146;s
qualities, even if they are about being a singing nun, in advance of
having performed any function whatever. However, they are very
gratefully received. I am grateful even to the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, although when he spoke about voting for me, I was reminded
that, on election day, I met one of his Front-Bench colleagues going
into the Moses Room to vote. He said, &#147;The alternative vote,
it&#146;s a wonderful system. You start with the bottom number and
the person you really dislike most&#148;. So even if that was the
spirit in which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, voted for me, I am
seriously aware that the wonderful thing about this election was not
only the spirit in which it was conducted&#151;and I pay tribute to
everybody who stood and everybody who was involved in the
election&#151;but also that, your Lordships' House being what it is,
what it was and what it will be, no candidate could have won it without
support from all round the House. That is what will sustain me in the
time ahead, when I try my very best to do the job well and when,
inevitably, I do not do it perfectly at the
beginning.</p><p><a name="06070448000048"></a><b><a name="06070448000656"></a>Lord

Secretary of State has had these discussions, a measure of success
would be that Independence Day was no longer celebrated and
&#147;Interdependence Day&#148; in our globalised world was
celebrated instead? Before that stage is reached, would he agree that,

Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords,
when the Secretary of State discusses issues with the American
Administration, might the most practical course be to concentrate on
energy security? Is it not the position that the Americans are, at
last, beginning to take very seriously the need to reduce radically
their oil consumption&#151;both oil imports and oil production
generally? Of course, that is a first achievable step, which, if
successful, will vastly reduce carbon emissions in the long term and
achieve two objectives in one: it will increase energy security and
give our children and grandchildren better control over climate
change.</p><p><a name="06070448000054"></a><b><a name="06070448000662"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I agree. There is conspicuous
evidence that energy security has risen rapidly up the agenda of the
United States. At state level and often at municipal level, leaders in
the United States speak about the issue with increasing frequency.
President Bush himself has described the reliance on oil as akin to an
addiction. The reality is that the United States will have to look at
ways in which their use of energy not only is secure and more efficient
but accords with the need to decrease carbon emissions to the
atmosphere.</p><p><a name="06070448000055"></a><b><a name="06070448000663"></a>Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
accept that part of our problem with the United States is that
substantial chunks of American opinion, including in Congress, are
still in denial about climate change and pollution? I understand, for
example, that half the world&#146;s car emissions come from within
the United States. Given that we have a special relationship with the
United States, is it not important that Ministers, including our Prime
Minister, appeal to American public opinion, rather than just
consulting the US

395 tonnes of gold were sold from the reserves between July 1999 and
March 2002. The total proceeds were around$3.5 billion,
equivalent to around &#163;2.3 billion, using exchange rates at the
time of the sales. On 3 July, the current market value of the gold sold
was around$7.9 billion, equivalent to around &#163;4.3
billion. The programme was part of a restructuring of the foreign
currency and gold reserves aimed at achieving a better balanced
portfolio. As a result of the programme, a one-off reduction in risk of
approximately 30 per cent was achieved as measured by value at
risk.</p><p><a name="06070448000081"></a><b><a name="06070448000689"></a>Lord
Swinfen:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, the proceeds from
the sales were invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets in
proportion to the then held reserves: 40 per cent dollars, 40 per cent
euros and20 per cent yen. The current aggregate position of
the reserves is included in the exchange equalisation accounts, which
are published annually, and there is a monetary report on the reserves.
It is not possible at this stage to unpick the particular transactions
from that time, but the accounts show the aggregate position and do so
on an annual basis.</p><p><a name="06070448000083"></a><b><a name="06070448000691"></a>Lord

an unremunerated, risky and volatile asset like gold is better reduced
in the foreign reserve portfolio. Indeed, there is a case for reducing
it even further. Does my noble friend accept that we made an agreement

than 2,500 tonnes over five years? What proportion of that total would
be available for us to sell over the next five
years?</p><p><a name="06070448000084"></a><b><a name="06070448000692"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I
agree with the first part of what my noble friend said. This was about
change and getting a more balanced portfolio. We achieved that 30 per
cent reduction in risk as a result. It is wrong to evaluate the success
of the programme in terms of the short-term movements in gold prices.
The Government have no plans for further disposals of gold. We think
that the arrangement in the portfolio is now about
right.</p><p><a name="06070448000085"></a><b><a name="06070448000693"></a>Lord

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, my noble friend

the reserves of this and other countries has lessened. So far as the UK
is concerned, because we have a strong monetary and fiscal framework,
we allow the market to determine what exchange rates are going to
arise.</p><p><a name="06070448000087"></a><b><a name="06070448000695"></a>Lord
Newby:</b> My Lords, the Minister will be aware that
at the time the Treasury said that the decision on gold sales did not
involve taking a view on gold prices. It was vastly mistaken to sell
off gold when the price was at a 20-year low. Does he accept that, had
the Treasury held on to it until the market rose, it might now have
been able to sell it to realise an additional&#163;2
billion?</p><p><a name="06070448000088"></a><b><a name="06070448000696"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I
believe that is the wrong analysis to make, as I have said earlier.
Gold is extremely volatile in its price. It was about $100 above its
current price a month ago, and$45 below its current price when
the first draft Answer was produced for me to give to the noble Lord.
That underlines the volatility of gold
prices.</p><p><a name="06070448000089"></a><b><a name="06070448000697"></a>Lord

If the noble Lord is inviting me to say something about this
Government&#146;s stewardship of reserves in comparison to their
predecessors, I am happy to do that. We do not need to go back very
far. On16 September 1992, we sold &#163;28 billion of
reserves on a single day and &#163;40 billion of reserves were sold
in August and September of that year. Information released fairly
recently under the Freedom of Information Act shows that the cost of
that mismanagement of the economy was &#163;3.3
billion.</p><p><a name="06070448000091"></a><b><a name="06070448000699"></a>Lord

entry?</p><p><a name="06070448000092"></a><b><a name="06070448000700"></a>Lord

the case, and we were looking to enter, the last thing that we would

That would be our functional
currency.</p><p><a name="06070448000093"></a><b><a name="06070448000701"></a>Baroness
Noakes:</b> My Lords, the Government claim to have
removed about 30 per cent of risk from their reserves portfolio, but
the other side of reducing risk is reducing returns. Do they think that
giving up more than &#163;4 billion of gain in the value of their
gold reserves represents a good risk/reward
calculation?</p><p><a name="06070448000094"></a><b><a name="06070448000702"></a>Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, you have to make
that evaluation in the long term. The process of dealing with risk does
not always mean that you have a less risky portfolio with smaller
returns. Part of the process of evaluation is to get the best of both
worlds.

current extradition rules. If there is such an offence, the treaty
would bite and, applying those provisions, the extradition would take
place. We have benefited greatly from those provisions, as do our

Subject to prescribed conditions, regulations under subsection (1)
shall provide that where a vehicle is being used by no more than one
person at a time, even if it is a place of work, it is not
smoke-free.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06070454000034"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a slightly amended version of an
amendment moved on Report by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Partly because
of the lateness of the hour&#151;it was after 9.30 pm&#151;and
partly because the Minister had pointed out a small, but significant
drafting defect, the noble Earl decided not to press his amendment at
that stage, while reserving the right to return to it at a later stage.
In the end, he decided not to do so, which is why some of us have
picked up the baton after altering one small, but significant, word in
the drafting.</p><p><a name="06070454000035"></a>Perhaps I can
explain. The Minister had argued that the original amendment was
superfluous, since powers already existed in the Bill to enable the
Government to relax slightly the very severe restrictions set out in
Clause 5 if they chose ultimately to do so, at the time of the
regulations being framed. This amendment therefore ensures that the
restrictions in question will indeed be slightly relaxed so that it
will no longer be illegal for people to smoke in vehicles used for
business, provided that they are only occupied by one person at a time.
Although, of course, companies, unincorporated businesses and
partnerships would still have the freedom to impose their own
restrictions if they so chose. The restrictions that remain in Clause 5
would still be very severe compared with the status quo or with the
laws that prevail in continental
Europe.</p><p><a name="06070454000036"></a>The Government seem to
be arguing that second-hand smoke is not only disagreeable&#151;few
would quarrel with that&#151;but also that it is one of the most
deadly poisons known to man and that it remains poisonous hours after
the last smoker has left the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_139"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scene. That is ridiculous and it is certainly not borne out by the
everyday experience of well over 99 per cent of the population. As the
noble Earl, Lord Howe, said on 19
June:</p><ul><a name="06070454000055"></a>&#147;To say that there
is a potentially lethal health risk from someone getting into the cab
[of a lorry or tractor] after the previous driver has been smoking
there seems ... ridiculous. If there is any residual smoke
present, it will disappear rapidly ... there should be a
common-sense cut-off point in these
matters&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/06/06; cols.
603-04.]</ul><p><a name="06070454000037"></a>Despite that, the
Government argue that, although employees in prisons, residential care
homes and hotels will have no protection, all other employees must be
protected from the slightest exposure at all costs. But, even on this
basis, the law will be defective. An employed salesman, for example,
who flies from London to Newcastle for a day, picking up a hire car
from the airport, could well find that car reeking of the smoke from
the previous occupant. The same could apply if he had to spend the
night in a hotel room. Moreover, the clause does not confine its
tentacles to employees. As I have pointed out at earlier stages, it
will hit a partnership consisting of two people who may well be a
husband and wife team, both of whom smoke and neither of whom has the
slightest desire to be protected from each other. To quote the noble
Earl, Lord Howe, once again, the Government are ignoring
&#147;reality and common sense&#148;. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070454000038"></a><b><a name="06070454000064"></a>Lord
Naseby:</b> My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord
Monson. The implementation of Clause 5 reflects all that is wrong with
the Bill because nowhere is the Government's response proportionate to
the risk. It does not matter whether you look at the global situation
or the fact that 25 per cent of the adults of this nation smoke and
still want to smoke&#151;no provision is made for them. The noble
Lord mentioned passive smoking, but not once have the Government
conceded an iota that the alleged death sentence from passive smoking
is highly speculative and highly unlikely to happen.</p><p><a name="06070454000039"></a>In this case, the Minister rightly says
that this is a mobile place of work and that, in this circumstance,
drivers must snuff out their cigarettes. But the question that
Parliament has to ask itself is: who is going to enforce this
situation? Will it be the police? We know that the answer is that the
police are not the least bit interested in enforcing this
position&#151;understandably, as we read daily in the press how
stretched they are. Will it be the local authorities? I have spoken to
my local authority and it is not in the least bit keen to take on this
new
burden.</p><p><a name="06070454000040"></a>The
conclusion&#151;the Minister has not yet said this but it is the only
logical conclusion&#151;is that we are going to have a whole host of
mobile community protection units, presumably on motorcycles and
mopeds, checking on whether those who are smoking in their cabs are
sole drivers. It is totally unworkable, and that is the problem with so
much of the Bill. The central thrust of the Bill is fine; it is the
unworkability of certain sections that, frankly, makes a mockery of
what this is all about. We all know what happens with seat belts in
taxis&#151;no one fixes their seat belt in a taxi.

down the country, and now we are going to add another restriction. It
is a farce. The issue of long-distance drivers, who have a place behind
them in the cab where they sleep, is still unresolved. Is that a place
of work or is it a home? I do not know. The Minister does not know.
Nobody
knows.</p><p><a name="06070454000041"></a>Instead of
slavishly following Scotland&#146;s left-wing, do-good and frankly
pretty useless Government, why can we not just for once take a close
look at what they do all over the continent, find out which is the best
procedure for this situation, and implement that? That seems a sensible
way forward. That is why I very much support the amendment moved by the
noble Lord, Lord Monson. I hope that the Minister will respond
positively, and that he will not do what happened after Report. In the
newspaper the next morning I read that we will have &#147;no
smoking&#148; signs in every bus shelter in the United Kingdom, 98
per cent of which are open to the air. But perhaps the Minister was
misreported. I very much support the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06070454000042"></a><b><a name="06070454000065"></a>Lord
Russell-Johnston:</b> My Lords, I take the
opportunity afforded by this amendment&#151;which I support because I
think it is sensible&#151;to make one short, final intervention in
this debate, which has gone on for a long time. A number of
colleagues&#151;notably the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, across the
Floor on the Labour Benches, to which we know he always shows great
loyalty; the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, who has just spoken from the
Conservative Benches; and myself from the Liberal Back Benches, my
Front Bench having given the Government unequivocal support&#151;have
consistently opposed the part of the Bill dealing with smoking, which I
regard as draconian and repressive legislation quite unnecessarily and
unjustifiably restricting freedom of
choice.</p><p><a name="06070454000043"></a>None of
us&#151;including the noble Lords, Lord Naseby and Lord
Monson&#151;has denied that smokers, despite the pleasure that they
derive from the habit, of which there has been little mention in the
debate, face a risk of cancer. That is a fact that we accept. None of
us has denied the right of non-smokers to enjoy smoke-free conditions
in their workplace, in public places and on public
transport&#151;although bus shelters, as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby,
said, may be slightly different. But I think that all of us continue to
believe that the extent of damage to health from so-called passive
smoking, difficult as it is to quantify and evaluate, is, in the terms
of the Scottish legal verdict, non-proven. Nevertheless, our amendments
have accepted that which we doubted, in the interests of seeking a fair
and balanced solution. Separation, we have argued, provided both
protection and choice. This has been uncompromisingly rejected with
uncompromising zealotry&#151;though the Minister is not really a
typical zealot; it&#146;s a bit out of character. But it is the same
logic: the same logic that led to alcoholic prohibition in the United
States and that led to the burning of shops which sold alcohol in
Beirut. It is an intolerant logic and it is wrong.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070454000044"></a>I know that the majority are against me

Palmer:</b> My Lords, I have put my
name to this amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Monson. I could
not agree more with him. It is the degree of inconsistency of the
Government&#146;s smoking policy&#151;in that one is allowed to
smoke in old people&#146;s homes and in prisons but not
elsewhere&#151;that seems so extraordinary. I hope that the Minister
will accept this very small
amendment.</p><h5><a name="06070454000058"></a>3.45

Howe:</b> My Lords, having tabled a similar amendment
at previous stages of the Bill, and having argued at some length in
favour of it, I am more than happy to give this amendment my support
for the reasons so eloquently expressed by other noble Lords.
</p><p><a name="06070454000047"></a>The root premise of the Bill is
that prolonged and substantial exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
carries with it unacceptable risks to health. To say that the cab of a
lorry in which a single driver has previously been smoking presents an
unacceptable health risk to anyone subsequently getting into it seems
absurd. No arguments have been advanced by the Government to persuade
me that we should take that proposition seriously. Indeed, it seems to
me that in this matter the Minister has relied much more on assertion
and arbitrary demarcation lines than on sound
science.</p><p><a name="06070454000048"></a>We have said before,
and it is worth saying again, that this is not a Bill to protect the
public from any quantity of environmental tobacco smoke, no matter how
tiny. It is a Bill that attempts to address what one might call the
larger picture. We are at risk of taking the Bill to unworkable
extremes if we insist that a farm worker on his own in the cab of a
tractor, or a company executive driving alone in a pool car, may not
have a cigarette. The Government have made it clear that work vehicles
that are only ever used by one person will not have to be smoke-free.
How it will be possible in all cases for enforcement officers to
distinguish that situation from the kind that I have just mentioned is
not at all clear. I, for one, would argue that for the law to seek to
make that distinction is
pointless.</p><p><a name="06070454000049"></a><b><a name="06070454000068"></a>Baroness
Barker:</b> My Lords, I want to make just three
points to make the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench position clear. I do
not regard my noble friend Lord Russell-Johnston, of whom I am very
fond, as politically incorrect; he is just incorrect on this matter. As
we have said in previous debates, residual smoke stays for a very long
time. The level of danger which that poses to an individual who goes
into a confined space, of which a car is one, may vary, partly on the
condition of the person, such as whether he has an asthmatic condition
which triggers it. Nevertheless, the smoke is present for some
considerable
time.</p><p><a name="06070454000050"></a>My
second point concerns the accusation&#151;I think it was an
accusation&#151;that the Scottish Executive, of whom the Liberal
Democrats are part, are do-gooders. 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_142"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I think that doing good in this case is right, as it does good for the
many people who wish to have clean
air.</p><p><a name="06070454000051"></a>My final point, which is
the one that sways me, is that people at work often have to put up with
other people's behaviour, such as other people&#146;s smoke. They
often feel that they are not in a position to challenge it, but they do
not want it because it is unpleasant, irritating or damaging to their
health.</p><p><a name="06070454000052"></a>For those three reasons,
it is right for us to come down on the side of caution in this matter
and to support a measure that will make life healthier and more
pleasant for a great many
people.</p><p><a name="06070448000115"></a><b><a name="06070448000723"></a>Lord
Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, at first sight this
amendment looks acceptable, but it is acceptable only in a superficial
way. Although I can understand fully the arguments that have been posed
by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, and supported by the noble Lords, Lord
Naseby and Lord Russell-Johnston, let us think, for example, of a
hospital car transport service, where in between transporting patients
to and from hospital the driver decides to have a smoke when he or she
is alone. The car is then filled with smoke before the patient gets on
board to be taken to or from the
hospital.</p><p><a name="06070448000116"></a>Let
us look at a taxi driver or a driver of a private hire vehicle who,
between taking individuals from one place to another in the course of
his or her work, fills that car with smoke. Let us think of a school
bus driver who, having taken a group of children to school, fills the
bus with smoke while driving back to the depot and picking up another
group of schoolchildren to take them to school. It is possible to argue
that the level of pollution remaining in those vehicles could well be
below that likely to be hazardous to the individual, as the noble Earl,
Lord Howe argued, but we cannot be certain that that is the case. I
entirely agree with the view that if a vehicle is only ever used by one
individual at work or at other times, it is perfectly acceptable for
that individual to be able to smoke in that vehicle, but when it is
also used to transport others, this amendment falls, and I would not
support
it.</p><p><a name="06070448000117"></a><b><a name="06070448000724"></a>Lord
Monson:</b> My Lords, would the noble Lord not agree
that there is nothing in my amendment to prevent health or local
education authorities making it a condition of employment that drivers
of ambulances and school buses do not smoke when they are in their
vehicles?</p><p><a name="06070448000118"></a><b><a name="06070448000725"></a>Lord
Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, as the noble Lord

and from the point of view of an independent Labour Member of this
House rather than that of a Labour
Member.</p><p><a name="06070448000119"></a>This is such a mild
amendment that I would have thought that the Government would try to
retrieve some of their reputation for authoritarianism by agreeing to
it. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, outlined the circumstances when it
might be used: when a car which might be used during the course of work
is then used out of work by the driver and perhaps his daughter, and
because it is a place of

is carrying things to the height of absurdity. It is a lunatic
proposition.</p><p><a name="06070448000120"></a>I believe that the
whole Bill is lunatic in concept, but this amendment brings it into
complete and utter disrepute. I cannot understand why the Government
will not accept reasonable amendments. I do not smoke, and the reason I
am opposing the Bill is because of its intolerance and its removal of
personal freedoms that people have enjoyed for hundreds of years. That
is why I and many others have been opposing the Bill&#151;not because
we are smokers or have an interest, but because we believe that smoking
is legal and that people should not be harassed as they are
being.</p><p><a name="06070448000121"></a>The
Bill is supposed to be about protecting people from second-hand smoke.
There is no real clinical evidence that second-hand smoke hurts
anybody, but even assuming that it does in some way, the propositions
that have been put forward throughout the Bill are to protect
non-smokers&#146; health&#151;and indeed, their
inconvenience&#151;and at the same time to protect the right of
people to assemble in public places, if they wish, provided there is
separation. I know that the amendment is not totally about separation,
but I want to emphasise the fact that the opponents of the Bill have
been trying to be fair to both sides of the argument. However, the
Government and the anti-smoking lobby will not listen to what is
reasonable under all circumstances in what is supposed to be a
democratic country.</p><p><a name="06070448000122"></a>I should
have thought that, this afternoon, the Government would at least say to
the noble Lord, Lord Monson, &#147;We are prepared to make this tiny
concession to you at the end of the Bill&#148;, but judging by the
look of the Minister, he has absolutely no intention to do so. He will
stand by his extremist view that he has echoed throughout the passage
of the Bill, the view that the House of Commons and the Government have
supported&#151;despite the fact that it was not a manifesto
commitment&#151;and that this House must accept it as it came from
the House of
Commons.</p><p><a name="06070448000123"></a>Frankly,
I think&#151;I believe&#151;that this has been a wholly
disreputable exercise in this House. Those people whose bigotry over a
long period has demonised smokers and made them pariahs have based the
Bill on junk science and are now allowing what is a most irrational
measure to go through this House. I am thoroughly ashamed of this House
and the House of Commons for what they are doing in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070448000124"></a><b><a name="06070448000726"></a>Lord
Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, it was certainly
not my intention to intervene, but having been, I assume, one of the
people to whom the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, refers as bigoted and a
zealot on these matters, I think that I should come to the Government's
defence and say that I very much hope that my noble friend has no
intention of accepting the amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000125"></a>References were made to
the science on second-hand smoke. The danger is that we will repeat
earlier debates on the Bill&#151;indeed, Second Reading
debates&#151;but I commend to the House the very latest report from
the United States Surgeon General, published last week, 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_144"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in which he states that the science is clear: tobacco-smoke pollution is
a serious health hazard. He identified a series of illnesses,
especially those caused to children, as a result of second-hand smoke.
Exposure of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effect to
the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung
cancer. The scientific evidence indicates that there is no safe level
of exposure to second-hand smoke. Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces
fully protects people from exposure to second-hand smoke. Separating
sections, air-cleaning systems and ventilating buildings cannot
eliminate the risk of exposure to second-hand smoke. The Surgeon
General stated:</p><ul><a name="06070448000298"></a>&#147;The
debate is over. The science is clear. Secondhand smoke is not a mere
annoyance but a serious health
hazard&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070448000126"></a><b><a name="06070448000727"></a>Lord
Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, will the noble
Lord give
way?</p><p><a name="06070448000127"></a><b><a name="06070448000728"></a>Lord
Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I am sorry but I
shall continue, if the noble Lord does not
mind.</p><p><a name="06070448000128"></a>This attempt to imagine
that we should exclude work vehicles, such as refuse vehicles where a
gang of people may be at work and where people are coming and going all
day long, because it is somehow safe if a couple of people smoke and it
will not do any harm to the others is just absurd. The science does not
support that point of view.</p><p><a name="06070448000129"></a>The
Bill is about freedom&#151;the freedom of people to enjoy clean air
when they work. The sooner that we defeat the amendment and pass the
rest of the Bill, the
better.</p><p><a name="06070448000130"></a><b><a name="06070448000729"></a>Lord
Geddes:</b> My Lords, I apologise
for not being here at the beginning of the debate on the amendment, but
I am so incensed by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner,
that, with the leave of the House, I must speak. He quoted a long
spiel, which I am sure that he read accurately, but the significant
point that he cited, which I heard very clearly, referred to indoor
spaces. Is the noble Lord referring to a vehicle as an indoor
space?</p><h5><a name="06070448000336"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06070448000131"></a><b><a name="06070448000730"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Lord
Warner):</b> My Lords, as someone who was described
by one journalist as part of the anti-smoking Taliban, I suppose I
should be quite pleased to be described by the noble Lord, Lord
Russell-Johnston, as a zealot behaving untypically. That is a kind of
promotion really.</p><p><a name="06070448000132"></a>We have
accepted all reasonable amendments, if I may say so to the noble Lord,
Lord Stoddart, but we do not regard this amendment as one of those that
we should accept. We have examined the Government&#146;s intentions
in this House in respect to smoke-free vehicles in much detail during
both the Committee and Report stages of the Bill. Again I make it
absolutely clear that the Government have no intention to include
private vehicles&#151;including rental vehicles for private
use&#151;under smoke-free legislation. The Government will propose in
regulations that the only vehicles to be required to be smoke-free will
be those used for the transportation of members of the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_145"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public or for work purposes by more than one person. This means, as I
said on Report, that smoking will be permitted in vehicles that are for
the sole use of the driver and are not used for work purposes by anyone
else, either as a driver or passenger. We have been absolutely clear
and consistent on that throughout the passage of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070448000133"></a>The
Government have listened very carefully to the arguments that have been
brought forward about smoke-free vehicles and remain entirely convinced
that vehicles used for work purposes by more than one person,
regardless of whether they are in the vehicle at the same time, should
be required to be smoke-free at all times. I thought the noble
Baroness, Lady Barker, put the point extremely well. The reasons for
this are logical and simple: we wish to create consistency in the level
of protection from second-hand smoke that this legislation would
provide between people working in vehicles and those working in
non-mobile workplaces.</p><p><a name="06070448000134"></a>Through
this amendment, people could still be exposed to second-hand smoke.
Some suggest that windows could be wound down to let in fresh air.
Perhaps they could be&#151;but how can an employee be assured that
the person before him who had smoked in a work vehicle would let in
fresh air? Indeed, what would happen when the smoking employee handed a
vehicle over to a non-smoking employee at the end of a shift? Are the
noble Lords who propose the amendment suggesting that there should be
some time lag before the vehicle can be used again, to let the smoke
clear? That would also require windows to be left open, which could
present problems with security. What would be the cost to
industry?</p><p><a name="06070448000135"></a>The noble Lords who
tabled the amendment are suggesting that people who use a vehicle for
work should be given less protection from the risks of second-hand
smoke. I fail to see a single defensible reason why a person who uses a
work vehicle should be at risk of exposure to hazardous second-hand
smoke when an equivalent worker in a non-mobile workplace is protected
from these proven health risks. I emphasise again that they are proven
health risks.</p><p><a name="06070448000136"></a>I shall provide
two examples to demonstrate my point. Let us look at a security guard
who works alone on shift in a security cabin. At the end of his shift,
another security guard takes over. If in this example the cabin was not
required to be smoke-free at all times, smoking by the first security
guard in the cabin would result in the second security guard being
exposed to the health risks of second-hand smoke. For this reason, we
have made it clear that the workplace needs to be smoke-free at all
times.</p><p><a name="06070448000137"></a>Let us now look at a
driver working alone on shift in a delivery van, which is his
workplace. At the end of his shift, another driver takes over. If in
this example the van was not required to be smoke-free at all times,
smoking by the first driver could result in the second driver being
exposed to second-hand smoke, as there can be no guarantee that
second-hand smoke would have cleared entirely from the cabin. For this
reason, we have made it clear that the mobile workplace needs to be
smoke-free at all times. The 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>situation between the delivery van driver and the security guard is
exactly the same: one is in a mobile workplace; one is not.</p><p><a name="06070448000138"></a>We have examined exhaustively the
scientific and medical evidence for this legislation. I recognise
again, despite giving all the sources to a number of noble Lords, that
we have failed to convince them. I shall not go through all the
evidence again. People can read the sources in the reports of the
Committee and Report stages.</p><p><a name="06070448000139"></a>My noble friend Lord
Faulkner has drawn attention to the most recently published
report&#151;over 700 pages&#151;by the United States Surgeon
General. He examined in great detail the evidence and made a number of
conclusions. He made it absolutely clear in those conclusions that
second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular
system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer. That report
confirms and adds to the extensive body of evidence of the health risks
associated with second-hand
smoke.</p><p><a name="06070448000140"></a>We also know that
second-hand smoke, even in small quantities, is the second most common
asthma trigger in the workplace. Asthma UK found
that:</p><ul><a name="06070448000299"></a>&#147;20 per cent of
people with asthma feel excluded from parts of their workplace because
other people smoke there. This inhibits their daily life as well as
opportunities for promotion and development&#148;.</ul><a name="06070448000294"></a>Suppose someone
with asthma had to use a work vehicle in which someone had previously
smoked and where second-hand smoke was still present. Given that there
are over 5 million people living in the UK with asthma, and given that
we know that second-hand smoke can linger often for extended periods in
enclosed spaces, there could be a real health
risk.<p><a name="06070448000141"></a><b><a name="06070448000731"></a>Lord
Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
agree that the incidence of asthma has increased and that at the same
time the incidence of tobacco smoking has decreased? Explain
that.</p><p><a name="06070448000142"></a><b><a name="06070448000732"></a>Lord
Warner:</b> My Lords, I do not have
to explain it. I have already explained that second-hand smoke is a
trigger for asthma. That is all we need to know in the context of this
Bill. Second-hand smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals in the form of
particles and gases. The WHO and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency have both classified tobacco smoke as a known human
carcinogen. We must remember that 85 per cent of second-hand smoke
consists of invisible, odourless gases.</p><p><a name="06070448000143"></a>It is absolutely
essential to retain the Bill as it is to protect people in their
workplaces. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, about Scotland.
In Scotland all vehicles that are for use for work purposes by one or
more persons must be smoke-free at all times. We have not modelled this
piece of legislation on Scotland. We propose offering leeway for
smoking in vehicles that are for the sole use of the driver and are not
used for work purposes by anyone else as a driver or passenger. That is
different in content from the Scottish position.</p><p><a name="06070448000144"></a>The Government&#146;s intention on
smoke-free vehicles has been made absolutely clear. It is right to give
workers who share a vehicle that same protection from second-hand smoke
exposure as people who share other kinds of workplaces. I explain to
the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Naseby, who raised the subject of lorry drivers with a
bed in the back&#151;as I believe he put it&#151;that if the lorry
is used by just one person, smoking would be allowed. However, if it is
a workplace for more than one person, it would have to be smoke-free.
We are absolutely consistent on
that.</p><p><a name="06070448000145"></a>One
can see that the Government&#146;s intention on smoke-free vehicles
is entirely consistent with our approach towards smoke-free public
places and workplaces. The amendment, as I believe I have made clear,
would be totally unacceptable to the Government and could leave workers
in vehicles at risk from the hazardous effects of second-hand smoke in
the workplace, which is wrong in principle and wrong in practice when
having regard to people&#146;s health. The Government do not accept
the amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000146"></a><b><a name="06070448000733"></a>Lord
Monson:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to all noble
Lords who have spoken in favour of the amendment from almost all
quarters of the House. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Naseby, for reminding us that this part of the Bill will largely
be unenforceable and, accordingly, will bring the law into contempt,
which is surely not desirable. I am grateful too to the noble Lord,
Lord Stoddart of Swindon, for reminding us of the value of fairness,
surely a particular British virtue. But the Minister stands totally
firm and unyielding, sadly but not surprisingly. I point out to him and
to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, that if second-hand
smoke in motor vehicles were as lethal as they claim it to be, I and my
siblings would have been dead long before we reached our
teens.</p><p><a name="06070448000147"></a>Alas, the sensible Dr
Reid is no longer in the driving seat on this matter. The present
incumbent seems to prefer a doctrinaire and unyielding position to
flexibility and common sense. It is true that even if this amendment is
agreed to, the Bill will remain much more severe and draconian than
anything proposed in the Labour election manifesto. Still, even a minor
move in the direction of genuine liberalism, as represented by the
noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnson, his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord
Steel of Aikwood, and by many noble Lords on other Benches in this
House, is better than total illiberalism. Accordingly, I wish to test
the opinion of the
House.</p><h5><a name="06070448000337"></a>4.11

noble Lord said: My Lords, I have read with great care and interest
what the Minister said last week. I should also like to place on record
my thanks to him for his very full follow-up letter. He will, I am
sure, be delighted to see that I have slightly changed the wording of
my amendment for this afternoon&#146;s proceedings.</p><p><a name="06070448000154"></a>I remind the House that the purpose of
this very simple amendment is twofold: to encourage patients to finish
their prescribed drugs and to realise what outstanding value for money
they are getting. I have consulted widely on this subject&#151;it
appears to have met with support from the medical profession and,
indeed, from all the pharmacists with whom I have spoken. I do so hope
that, with the revised wording, the Minister will now be able to accept
the amendment. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06070448000155"></a><b><a name="06070448000735"></a>Baroness
Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My Lords, I
commend the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, on tabling the amendment, which
has a great deal of merit in it. He is right that many patients obtain
repeat prescriptions without thinking about whether they need them and
accumulate boxes of different drugs, some of which are expensive. The
trouble is that some of the most responsible and sickest patients will
look at the price of their drugs, feel horrified and feel honour bound
to the rest of the population to stop them. Therefore, there is a
tension between this action coming out of the blue and remaining with
the status quo. As far as I know, there has never been a large scale
study of the merits or otherwise of pricing up the drugs for patients.
There are merits too in terms of giving information to
patients.</p><p><a name="06070448000156"></a>I hope that the noble
Lord, Lord Palmer, will accept that the amendment is probably a little
before its time and that when a definitive study has been carried
out&#151;many people have the hunch that he will be proved
right&#151;it may then be a good measure in terms of informing the
public about the drugs that they are taking and openness of
information.</p><p><a name="06070448000157"></a><b><a name="06070448000736"></a>Earl
Howe:</b> My Lords, on Report I was happy to support
the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, in the case that he made for transparency
of pricing on medicines. Having listened to him again I still think
that the idea has merit. Indeed, I was encouraged that the Minister
himself acknowledged that there is benefit in patients having access to
as much information as possible. However, the noble Baroness, Lady
Finlay, has made an extremely important point. We are to a large extent
treading into the unknown and it would be nice to have more information
than we do on some of the key issues rightly raised by the Minister in
his letter to the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_151"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, notably the reaction of patients to seeing prices on the
medicines that they were taking. Some patients indeed would react by
adhering to the medicines all the more rigorously. On the other hand,
other patients might not do so: they might be deterred from seeking
medical help in the first place. We would not wish to see that second
result.</p><p><a name="06070448000158"></a>While the noble
Lord&#146;s idea has more than a germ of merit to it, it is perhaps
premature to consider it seriously in the context of the Bill.
Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister will consider the idea seriously
as he takes the Bill away.</p><p><a name="06070448000159"></a><b><a name="06070448000737"></a>Lord
Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, at first sight I
too found this an attractive amendment. One of the problems that we
have encountered over many years in the National Health Service is that
patients have had little information or understanding of the cost of
many of the procedures to which they are subjected, not least in
relation to the cost of drugs that they receive. At the same time I
share some of the anxieties expressed by my noble friend Lady Finlay
about the amendment. It seems to me that the Minister might consider
the possibility that at the right moment a limited pilot study of the
effects of something similar might be well worth carrying out in order
to inform the public and to inform government policy at some time in
the future.</p><h5><a name="06070448000339"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06070448000160"></a><b><a name="06070448000738"></a>Baroness
Barker:</b> My Lords, I indicated
during our earlier discussions that we, too, have a great deal of
sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Palmer. I believe that he has the
basis of an extremely good idea here. I support it not because it is
likely to dissuade patients from taking medicines that they are
prescribed but because it might enable them to have a far more informed
discussion with the different people in different parts of the NHS who
are involved in prescribing medicines and taking medicines away and who
frequently give patients conflicting instructions that do not seem to
make sense. Anything that informs patients is positive. Some patient
groups are incredibly well informed about medication, while others are
not. But if this enables that to happen and sometimes presents a
challenge to clinicians, it is not a bad
thing.</p><p><a name="06070448000161"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Walton, suggested the setting up of a pilot study. Would that require
primary legislation or could a pilot study go ahead without
it?</p><p><a name="06070448000162"></a><b><a name="06070448000739"></a>Lord
Warner:</b> My Lords, as I indicated on Report, I had
a good deal of sympathy with the thinking behind this
amendment&#151;and I still have that sympathy. I must acknowledge
that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, has made some effort to improve the
amendment and has taken on board my comment that it would be easier to
indicate the cost of medicines to the NHS than the full retail cost. As
I said on Report, I agree that patients should be as well informed as
possible about NHS services that they receive. However, as a number of
noble Lords have 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_152"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said, my greatest concern is that this measure could lead to some
patients, especially older people, stopping taking or failing to
reorder vital medication that they know to be expensive because they do
not wish to be a burden on the NHS. We simply do not know. We do not
have the evidence about how people would react and it is not
appropriate to put a change of this kind in primary legislation before
we have that evidence.</p><p><a name="06070448000163"></a>I shall
not repeat all the points that I made in my letter and to some extent
on Report about some of the practical issues. There are a number of
practical issues involved in implementing a system of this kind. It is
not quite as simple as one might think. There are issues about
prescriptions coming from different sources and how you deal with
those; there are issues about appliances, prescriptions from walk-in
centres and resulting from patient group directions, and so on. We know
that there would have to be a consistent system of computer upgrades to
cope with a system of this kind, the cost of which would certainly run
into tens of millions of pounds. We are not saying that that makes it a
showstopper or that it makes it impossible, but we need to consider the
practicalities before going forward.</p><p><a name="06070448000164"></a>We also have some doubts as to whether
amending the NHS charges regulations is the correct vehicle for a
change of this kind. This is not the most obvious place to make a
change of this kind. However, to give some comfort to the noble Lord,
Lord Palmer, and to other noble Lords who have indicated a degree of
qualified support for the amendment, I can say that my colleague, Andy
Burnham, the Minister of State for delivering quality, who is actually
responsible for this policy area in the Department of Health, is
considering, outside the Health Bill, further work to see whether
indicating the cost will discourage patients from taking vital
medicines and, if it does not, will look to see whether it would be
justifiable to introduce a similar but more limited flexible
arrangement to that which would be established by the proposed
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000165"></a>The noble Lord has
certainly gained Health Ministers&#146; attention with the amendment.
We want to take the issue forward with a proper study and I
congratulate him on pursuing with some tenacity his views on the issue,
with which, as I said earlier, we have some sympathy. In that context,
I hope he will be willing not to proceed with his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000166"></a><b><a name="06070448000740"></a>Lord
Palmer:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
reply and I thank my noble friend Lady Finlay for her comments. I have
often been called premature in my life.</p><p><a name="06070448000167"></a>I am heartened by what
the Minister said about his colleague in another place looking into
this whole subject. It has concerned me for at least 20 years,
particularly the terrible wastage of the amount of drugs that must
simply get thrown away. On the premise that the Minister will give me
his unqualified support and ensure that something will be done about
looking into this issue, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000168"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Warner for his kind comments and congratulate him on the
skill, patience and good humour with which he has taken the Bill
through the House. I think he would agree that his task would have been
rather more difficult if the Bill had come to this place in exactly the
same form in which it entered the House of Commons, with the exemptions
it then contained. Now, though, we have a Bill which in my view, and, I
think, in the view of the great majority of noble Lords, will do more
for the public health of our country than almost any other measure
since the introduction of the Clean Air Acts. I am delighted to support
it.</p><p><a name="06070448000188"></a>Because we are passing a
Bill that contains comprehensive smoke-free provisions, I am able to
tell the House that the private Bill I introduced on behalf of the city
of Liverpool to make it smoke free will no longer be needed, and the
formal steps to withdraw the Liverpool City Council (Prohibition of
Smoking in Places of Work) Bill will be taken by the promoters&#146;
parliamentary agents. I understand that formal Member approval is
required first, and that that will be obtained later this
month.</p><p><a name="06070448000189"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, will make a similar
statement in respect of the London Local Authorities Bill which she
introduced. She and I and the promoters believe that these two Bills
played some part in winning the debate for smoke-free provision, and we
are grateful to all noble Lords who supported us at Second Reading on
20 July last year.</p><p><a name="06070448000190"></a>I should also mention
the third local authority private Bill on smoking, the Merseyside Local
Authorities (Prohibition of Smoking in Places of Work) Bill, which was
introduced into this House on 23 January. The promoters of that Bill
also propose to withdraw it on the basis that the Government&#146;s
Health Bill achieves virtually all they hoped for from theirs. That
Bill would have been the responsibility of the late Lord Chan, whose
untimely and sudden death earlier this year was widely mourned in this
House and across Merseyside.</p><p><a name="06070448000191"></a>Lord Chan&#146;s
greatest legacy lay in developing child health in the developing world,
and the work he started is being continued by the countless number of
students he trained. He will be most remembered on Merseyside for his
commitment to tackling health inequalities and helping those who
suffered from deprivation. He saw the provision of smoke-free
workplaces as an essential element in that. Lord Chan would have been
as delighted as I am to see this Bill pass
today.</p><p><a name="06070448000192"></a><b><a name="06070448000746"></a>Baroness
Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I am happy to
follow the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, in his celebration
of a full ban on smoking in the Government&#146;s Bill. I also
celebrate the role played by the Liverpool and Merseyside private
Bills, and particularly the role of my friend, the late Lord Chan, whom
I miss greatly in this House.</p><p><a name="06070448000193"></a>I remind the House of
the role of the London Local Authorities (Prohibition of Smoking in

authorities in London through the Association of London Government. The

gave this House an extensive opportunity to discuss the merits of a
full ban on smoking in places of
work.</p><p><a name="06070448000194"></a>Credit
should be given to the London boroughs, as well as to the Liverpool and
other Merseyside local authorities, for their work in pushing forward
the debate in favour of a full ban. We must remember, as the noble
Lord, Lord Faulkner, has mentioned, that at the time of the debate on
the London and Liverpool Bills the Government had not yet brought
forward legislation and were suggesting a partial ban. I was personally
delighted that the Government listened2 and changed their mind for the
better&#151;that is what modern democracy is truly about.</p><p><a name="06070448000195"></a>Now that we will have a
Health Bill providing for a full ban, I have been advised by the
Association of London Government, speaking on behalf of the London
boroughs, that it will take steps to instruct the withdrawal of the
London local authorities Bill from Parliament. I thank this House and
the Government for ensuring that legislation exists to protect all
workers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. In particular, I
thank the Minister for his extraordinary patience through this long
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070448000196"></a>On Question, Bill passed,

to oppose Schedule 2 standing part of the Bill, as I retain significant
concerns about several aspects of the schedule. We had a full debate on
those matters on our first day in Committee and I do not intend to
repeat what was said. We covered such matters as the way in which BCUs
would be organised and their coterminosity; the possibility of a change
to operational technique that might not be to the benefit of the

I agree, but I also made it clear at the end of our many debates on the
last occasion that I would not divide the Committee when we reached

have been made to the operation of the 1996 Act and the plethora of
centralising powers that are being placed in the hands of the Home
Secretary. We have severe concerns about the whole matter of governance
under the schedule. The changes envisaged around BCUs and,
particularly, the many changes to police authorities, where the
Secretary of State may, by regulation, make provision in relation to
the membership of any police authority, aim to alter the way in which
police authorities function. That will interfere with local priorities
and police authorities&#146; plans and reports and it would alter
their consultation duties.</p><h5><a name="06070448000341"></a>4.45

do more or less whatever he wants. He should not have power to
intervene directly in forces and bypass police authorities. That is
politicising policing to a sort of tabloid-headline level and is
entirely wrong.</p><p><a name="06070448000209"></a>The schedule was
put into the Bill because of the anger of the former Secretary of State
at not being able to sack a chief constable as easily as he had hoped.
It is for police authorities to do that&#151;and to do so within
rigid guidelines and the law. They should be left to do so, should that

the desire to alter the 1996 Act, which has served us well.

take my word for it. Ken Jones, the president of ACPO,
states:</p><ul><a name="06070448000317"></a>&#147;At stake is
unwise and unnecessary erosion of the tripartite system of police
governance which has served this country extremely well. The system,
already under strain, is there to serve the public interest and it is
from that perspective that I write to you today. Greater powers are
taken to the centre at the expense of Police Authorities and Chief
Constables.</ul><ul><a name="06070448000318"></a>Effective policing
in this country relies very heavily on the consent and support of those
we serve. Vital consent and support

politics, vested interests and other parts of the executive; and to the
essentially local nature of policing where its roots, and proper
accountability to Police Authorities, best
thrive.</ul><ul><a name="06070448000319"></a>We have argued that
aspects of the Bill effectively undermine the existing conventions to a
great extent and that the case for such fundamental shifts has not been
made out. For example crucial checks and balances which currently exist
in the 1996 Police Act are to be swept away. To date we have failed to
persuade government and, rarely for ACPO, feel that such is the
importance of this matter that we must now engage more actively with
the decision making processes
underway&#148;.</ul><a name="06070448000295"></a>That is why
we on these Benches oppose the Question that Schedule 2 stand part of
the

Scotland of Asthal:</b> Since we
had the advantage of discussing the detail of the Bill, I had hoped
that we would have arrived at a better understanding of the import of
this part. Of course I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Harris,
says&#151;her view is that this is &#147;meddling, fiddling,
irksome legislation&#148; and that it gives <I>carte blanche</I> to
the Secretary of State. I firmly disagree with that assessment. We will
have further opportunities in subsequent amendments to discuss much of
the detail of these provisions, so, in this debate, perhaps I may say a
few words about some of the recurring themes that we have encountered.
I hope that, in doing so, I shall meet the issues raised by the noble
Baroness.</p><p><a name="06070448000212"></a>I know that the noble
Baroness suggests that the provisions in the schedule are evidence of
an overly centralising tendency and that this is somehow the last swipe
of the departing Home Secretary. However, that is an unjust assessment
of the way in which Charles Clarke behaved. One thing that we are all
able to rejoice in is that he was very reflective, considerate and
considering in the way in which he addressed these issues. I can assure
the noble Baroness that her concerns about his approach are not
accurate.</p><p><a name="06070448000213"></a>If one looks at the
provisions in the
Bill&#151;</p><p><a name="06070448000214"></a><b><a name="06070448000751"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for giving way. It was in fact a former Secretary of State, not the
last one.</p><p><a name="06070448000215"></a><b><a name="06070448000752"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> There have
now been three, but the comments that I make are equally applicable. I
remind the noble Baroness that we are doing a number of things in the
schedule that do not centralise but go quite the other way. For
instance, we are abolishing the statutory national policing plan;
reducing the Home Secretary&#146;s role in the appointment of police
authority membership; removing the requirement on police authorities to
send three-year strategy plans to the Home Secretary; removing the
requirement on crime and disorder reduction partnerships to send an
annual report on their performance to the Home Secretary; and
transferring a number of operationally focused functions of the Home
Office to the National Policing Improvement Agency. The noble Baroness
has applauded all these moves and I hope that she will accept that they
are decentralising in
nature.</p><p><a name="06070448000216"></a>Moreover,
we are empowering local communities by strengthening the effectiveness
of police authorities and CDRPs, introducing the community call for
action 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and ensuring that police community support officers and local
authorities have the powers that they need to tackle anti-social
behaviour. All these measures give more power to those who wish to take
action. I therefore cannot accept the charge that the measures in the
Bill undermine the tripartite relationship between the Home Secretary,
police authorities and chief officers, through which policing in this
country is governed. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
tripartite relationship is founded on the respective roles and
responsibilities of each of the partners. The Bill does not
fundamentally alter the balance of these responsibilities, nor does it
tip the scales in favour of the Home Secretary. Indeed, we are
strengthening the functions of police authorities and taking steps to
ensure the resilience of the command structure in strategic police
forces.</p><p><a name="06070448000217"></a>I
take as an example the membership of police authorities. The Bill
simply confers a power on the Home Secretary to prescribe the
membership of police authorities in secondary legislation. There is
nothing particularly unique or remarkable in that. Legislation in the
health and education spheres provides for the detailed arrangements for
appointments to primary care trusts and school governing bodies to be
similarly set out in
regulations.</p><p><a name="06070448000218"></a>Moreover, it is
already the case that certain aspects of the arrangements for the
constitution of police authorities are subject to secondary
legislation. For example, the size of a police authority may already be
varied by order. The key point is that councillor members should
constitute the majority of the membership; this principle continues to
be provided for in primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06070448000219"></a><b><a name="06070448000753"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I am grateful to the noble
Baroness for giving way. What she is trying adduce here is that there
are other circumstances where it has been perfectly proper in statute
that the Secretary of State for other departments has been allocated a
power that he or she may or may not apply in particular cases. However,
there is a feeling on this side of the House that, when it comes to the
policing of this country, we are in a different circumstance. We all
jealously guard the delicate balance in the tripartite relationship and
believe that that balance could be undermined. Perhaps that does not
pertain in the health and other services to which she referred. Would
the Minister reflect on
that?</p><p><a name="06070448000220"></a><b><a name="06070448000754"></a>Lord

consistently taken this position on a number of reforms. This is not
the place to go into all the details, but I am grateful to the Minister

this matter to tease out what the Government have in mind and where we

probably all say &#147;Amen&#148; to that if the noble Baroness,
Lady Anelay, is of a similar view. I reassure her that we, too,
jealously guard the delicate balance of this tripartite relationship
and our intent is not to disturb that. The relationship has endured to
the benefit of the citizens of our country because we have a better
opportunity to do what needs to be done for their better protection. I
understand what the noble Baroness says about that, but similar
arguments about the need to be careful and judicious were also made in
relation to the other situations, as was made clear by the noble Lord,
Lord Dholakia. It is something that we are going to work through. I
hope that the noble Baroness is encouraged, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Harris, should be, by the fact that we are ready to give the
recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
on this provision favourable consideration, as I indicated earlier. I
hope that we can move in the direction of the committee&#146;s
proposals in time for Report.</p><p><a name="06070448000222"></a>I think that we have
all very much enjoyed the fact that we have had a real debate during
this Committee stage. We have given real consideration to some of the
issues, which have been seriously taken on board, and we will be able
to come back to see how well we can do.</p><p><a name="06070448000223"></a>A number of noble Lords
echoed the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, about the Home
Secretary&#146;s reserve powers to intervene in poorly performing
police forces and authorities. I want to reiterate one point: these are
not new powers but a simplification and modification of the powers
first introduced 12 years ago in the Police and Magistrates&#146;
Courts Act 1994 and updated four years ago in the Police Reform Act
2002. As is now the case, those are powers of last resort, and I think
that the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, will agree that, except on one
occasion, they have never had to be used, as we would expect.</p><p><a name="06070448000224"></a>The Bill seeks to improve on the current
powers, based on recent learning, to better reflect how policing
failings are identified and addressed. As is already the case, these
provisions allow the Home Secretary to require a chief constable or
police authority to take specific steps to address any serious failing
which has been identified.</p><p><a name="06070448000225"></a>The
non-statutory process by which the Police Standards Unit supports
underperforming forces will continue as before. That will not change,
and I assure the Committee that there is every expectation that the new
inspectorate will continue, as now, to provide professional advice to
the Home Secretary when an intervention decision is being considered.
On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will withdraw their opposition
to Schedule 2.</p><p><a name="06070448000226"></a>Schedule 2

leave out subsection (3).</ul><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070448000229"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the
amendment, I do not wish to appear ungrateful. Clause 3 removes an
existing anomaly in the law whereby police authorities, unlike local
authorities, cannot at present delegate any of their functions to an
area committee or to members; nor can they co-opt members to assist
them.</p><p><a name="06070448000230"></a>I know that the
Association of Police Authorities, of which I currently have the honour
to be president, and many of my authority colleagues, particularly in
Wales but elsewhere too, have been calling for some time for the
anomaly to be removed. The prospect of strategic authorities and forces
has strengthened the case for that, because it will be important that
any strategic authorities are not seen as remote from the communities
that they serve. Mechanisms such as this, which will enable very local
decisions to be made locally, will be the key to that. This is
obviously of some importance to those of us in Lancashire, given that
we are currently going ahead with a voluntary merger with
Cumbria.</p><p><a name="06070448000231"></a>During our first day in
Committee we had much discussion about the growing importance of basic
command units as the delivery engines for local policing. Equally, the
service is now rolling out neighbourhood policing, which is welcomed
and supported by all. It is therefore right that police authorities
should be able to delegate to an area committee at BCU level, or in
some cases even neighbourhood level, decisions local to that area. I
have in mind, for example, decisions about how best to communicate with
local people about their policing, about the arrangements for
consultation or about signing off the local community safety strategy
for the area. The substance of Clause 3 is therefore very welcome.
However, having given police authorities the same flexibility as other
local authorities, the Home Secretary then seeks to tie their hands
through regulation.</p><h5><a name="06070448000342"></a>5
pm</h5><p><a name="06070448000232"></a>In its first sitting, all
sides of the Committee stressed the fundamental importance of the
tripartite relationship. But that relationship will be strong and
healthy only if there is mutual respect among the partners for each
others&#146; roles and responsibilities. Taking extensive powers
under subsection (3) to regulate how police authorities exercise their
delegation functions seems to show little faith in the capacity of
police authorities to manage their own affairs responsibly. Police
authorities already have extensive powers to delegate action to the
chief constable or their own officers, and to my knowledge there have
never been any questions raised about how authorities use those powers
at present. Indeed, I know my police authority colleagues take very
seriously decisions about what and when to
delegate.</p><p><a name="06070448000233"></a>I am fairly confident
that my noble friend will tell me that this is simply a reserve
power&#151;a power of last resort to be used only as the nuclear
option. But there are other powers elsewhere in the Bill for police
authorities to be inspected and for the Home Secretary to intervene if
things are going awry. Why are further powers needed here to regulate
how authorities manage their own work? This strikes me 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_161"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as unnecessary and unwarranted interference. Police authorities are
mature bodies and should be treatedas such.</p><p><a name="06070448000234"></a>As I said, the main
thrust of Clause 3 is welcome, and in the spirit of mutual exchange I
would like to return the favour. My amendment is therefore designed to
assist this and future Home Secretaries. As we all know, once one has a
power, it is very difficult to resist using it. My amendment would put
the Home Secretary out of harm&#146;s way by removing the temptation
for him to interfere with how police authorities go about their
day-to-day business. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070448000235"></a><b><a name="06070448000757"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> The Minister will not be at
all surprised to hear that I support the amendment tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Henig. We support the amendment because we want to take
out a subsection which once again allows the Secretary of State wide
discretion to specify police authorities&#146; powers. Such provision
is completely unnecessary, inappropriate and undemocratic. It does not
give police authorities parity with other local authorities which
already have powers of delegation without central powers being reserved
in this way. This is about delegating powers&#151;probably to BCU
level in order that decisions can be taken at the appropriate level;
for example, projects involving community participation or CDRP
projects. These are local issues and need to be dealt with locally, so
that delegation is actually
beneficial.</p><p><a name="06070448000236"></a><b><a name="06070448000758"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I am going
to complete the trio of assent and support the noble Baroness, Lady
Henig. When I saw her amendment on the Marshalled List, and then looked
into the Explanatory Notes, it was a revelation regarding the
Government&#146;s intent. Here we have a consequence of the
Government&#146;s own plans to force mergers on police forces: they
have had to recognise in statute the fact that police authorities,
which will now cover extra large areas, will need some way of
delegating powers to smaller areas. There will have to be more
bureaucracy; and I certainly hope that the Government will think again
on mergers. But if those mergers are to take place, particularly when
they are voluntary, it is essential that no remoteness is felt by the
old areas that comprise the smaller constabularies. They still feel
they have an important part to play in the wider police
authority.</p><p><a name="06070448000237"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Henig, was right to point out two facts, in
particular. First, police authorities are mature bodies. We entrust
them with significant responsibilities, which they fulfil remarkably
well. We are very fortunate in the service that we have from them. It
will undermine our apparent confidence in them by saying, &#147;Yes,
you can delegate powers, but we are not going to treat you on a par
with local authorities; we are going to tell you how you may delegate
those powers&#148;. The Minister may say that it is last resort and
that the Government will not really intervene, but the difficulty is
that it sends a signal, saying, &#147;We are putting you out on a dog
leash but we will tug you back when we need
to&#148;.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070448000238"></a>This part of the Bill is misguided. The
second point made by the noble Baroness was that there are other
last-resort powers that the Government could call in, which I think
would be more appropriate. It is right that our attention has been
drawn to this subsection, and I hope that the Government will look
carefully at the proposal made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Henig.</p><p><a name="06070448000239"></a>Perhaps I can offer the
Government some succour, too. If the noble Baroness is worried about a
lovely big fat juicy Home Office Bill shrinking, I have amendments
later on that would add extra clauses, so if she takes this subsection
out, I could extend the Bill with other
matters.</p><p><a name="06070448000240"></a><b><a name="06070448000759"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> Will the Minister explain why, if
Section 107 of the 1972 Act is working effectively, it is necessary to
introduce further powers? Is it again the previous argument about
establishing much more control from the Home Office, rather than
allowing police authorities to function as they have been doing
adequately and effectively so far?</p><p><a name="06070448000241"></a><b><a name="06070448000760"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords,
on these occasions one should always start with a positive, if one can.
I welcome my noble friend Lady Henig&#146;s support for Clause 3,
which, as she rightly acknowledges, will allow police authorities
greater flexibility to delegate their functions to area committees of
the authority or to individual members&#146;
offices.</p><p><a name="06070448000242"></a>In
making this change to the Local Government Act 1972, we have made it
clear that we would be concerned if this additional flexibility led to
a proliferation of bureaucratic area committees, which also overlap
with the role of crime and disorder reduction partnerships, which we
acknowledge and celebrate as working extremely well. We do not want
additional overlap with the local overview and scrutiny
committees.</p><p><a name="06070448000243"></a>Clause 3(3) contains
a reserve power designed to guard against such a possibility. It will
enable the Home Secretary to regulate the functions that may be
delegated to area committees and the membership of such committees. We
hope that it will not be necessary for this power ever to be exercised,
but we believe that it is necessary to include it in the Bill to guard
against things malfunctioning. I am sure that we can think of one or
two occasions in history when sometimes these things have not worked as
they should. In a perfect world they would quickly correct themselves,
but the world does not work like that.</p><p><a name="06070448000244"></a>This reserve power is not without
precedent. A similar power is contained in Section 18 of the Local
Government Act 2000, which relates to the delegation of functions by
local authorities operating under similar executive arrangements. It is
not unknown in local government. The world of local governance is
actively familiar with it, and acknowledges that there is some value in
it.</p><p><a name="06070448000245"></a>It is not
a power that we want to use; it is there to be used <I>in extremis</I>.
It is a reserve power that we hope will not have to be activated. My
noble friend, like me and others involved in these debates in your
Lordships' House, would expect that when things go slightly awry they
can be properly corrected at a local level without

important to guard against the odd occasions when that reserve power
will be necessary.</p><p><a name="06070448000246"></a>I hope that,
with that assurance on the reserve nature of the power, my noble friend
will feel able to withdraw her
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000247"></a><b><a name="06070448000761"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> Two
questions have arisen as a result of the Minister&#146;s response.
First, with regard to the laudable objective of not having too many
bodies doing the same job, does the Minister accept that if we trust
police authorities to know their patch and its needs, we should trust
them to decide what functions should be carried out by an area body
that they nominate? Would it not be strange if they wanted to take over
the functions of partnerships that are working well? Furthermore, is
the Minister saying that the Government do not want the area
organisations that are to be created in this way, to which functions
are to be delegated, to cross over with other bodies&#146; functions
or to cover the same geographical area as those bodies? Are the limits
that the Secretary of State will be able to control functional or
geographic?</p><p><a name="06070448000248"></a>The Minister said
that one does not want things to go wrong locally and that this power
would be a matter of last resort. In the best of all possible worlds,
organisations can set off on their own course, and it is difficult to
rein them back, but how quick is quick? What do the Government see as a
quick response to put things right if this is to be a power of last
resort? Are police authorities to be given the Wayne Rooney red card
immediately or will they be given time in which to redraw their plans
before the Secretary of State imposes his will upon them? I appreciate
that that will be part of guidance, but we need to have a flavour of
what the Government intend because the Secretary of State is giving
himself direct power over police
authorities.</p><p><a name="06070448000249"></a><b><a name="06070448000762"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> I will endeavour to answer
the noble Baroness&#146;s questions as best I can. Her final point
related to rapidity of response. In such a situation, there will
clearly be some sensitivity. I am sure there will be a history to what
has emerged; there always is. In those circumstances, the response
would have to be measured. I am sure that will create the time for
dialogue between the centre and the locality. If something is obviously
not working, there will be a need for swift action, but such matters
will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. I do not think it
would be reasonable to respond in any other way. The response will be
determined by the circumstances.</p><p><a name="06070448000250"></a>The noble Baroness also
asked about functions and geography. Primarily, we are concerned with
overlapping functions. In a previous life, I was involved in local
government for long enough to know that there are benefits and beauties
to complementarity and additional activities being taken on by
different bodies and organisations, but when working at local level it
is irritating when it is impossible to get to the root of who is
responsible for what. It is important to ensure that there is not too
much overlap. But these things can be considered. We need to avoid
rushing in to 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make an order under Clause 3(3). If we had concerns, we would want to
discuss them in the first instance with the Association of Police
Authorities because that would make a lot of sense and would ensure
that we understood what was happening in the locality. That underlines
the trust we have not only in the APA but also in local organisations
to sort themselves out.</p><p><a name="06070448000251"></a>That
may not be an answer laced with precision, but I am trying to look at
this in a workable way. One must consider what actually happens on the
ground in the locality to feel how a power such as this may be used
sensitively and intelligently to produce an outcome that I am sure most
of us want.</p><h5><a name="06070448000343"></a>5.15

important that there rests with the Home Secretary an opportunity to
help to sort things out, when that is what is required to enable the
organisation better to perform its duties. If you like, it is a benign
reserve power. I really do not think that the Committee should get hung
up on the notion of there being a desire for creeping centralisation.
That is not the purpose. It is a reserve power designed to sort things
out and be
helpful.</p><p><a name="06070448000254"></a><b><a name="06070448000765"></a>Baroness

carefully to everything that has been said in this very interesting
exchange. My noble friend may not be surprised when I say that I am not
really very reassured. If the problem is now of the sort about which we

believe firmly that a Home Secretary's role in general terms is
strategic. If there are problems such as those to which my noble friend
referred, they should be dealt with through tripartite discussion with
ACPO and the APA. I hear what he says about this being a benign power.
I must say, as a historian, that a benign power today can become an
antagonistic, centralising or, even worse, autocratic power tomorrow.
That is also my concern.</p>

<p><a name="06070448000262"></a>The noble Baroness
said: The amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord
Dholakia. As I said at Second Reading, we object to the clause on the
grounds that it will give police authorities a duty to secure best
value, but no power to enforce that duty. The Bill will remove the
ability to commission best value reviews. However, we accept the
Government's view that the best value process has become unwieldy and
bureaucratic. Our amendments would give authorities the flexibility to
scrutinise force activity in a way proportionate to the
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06070448000263"></a>Best value
legislation needs to remain applicable to police authorities,
especially provisions relating to inspection. That will give the Audit
Commission the locus that it needs to participate in joint inspections
with the new CJS inspectorate envisaged in paragraph 12 of the
schedule. We are, in any event, seeking to have this paragraph removed
from the Bill. We do not support the involvement of the Audit
Commission in police authority inspection because it does not have the
necessary experience and expertise in this area. If the Government are
determined to involve the Audit Commission in police authority
inspection, the commission has wide enough powers under other
legislation which would enable this, and it is always open to the
Government to include specific provisions about this in the relevant
part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070448000264"></a>However,
the Government rejected these amendments in another place because,
while committing police authorities to continuous improvement, they
disapplied all of best value and shut out the Audit Commission. That is
exactly what I intend.</p><p><a name="06070448000265"></a>The
Local Government Act 1999 required councils and police and fire
authorities to pursue continuous improvement, but, because there was no
real understanding of how to make best value work&#151;reflected not
least in inspection&#151;they pursued a sort of paper chase. The
annual cost in missed service improvements and savings is hard to
judge, but a CBI estimate of March 2005, based on Treasury figures,
supports the view that it runs into billions of pounds. 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p><p><a name="06070448000266"></a>A well run
value programme should yield a combination of improved services and
savings worth 10 times its costs. Continuous improvement methods to
review products and services and secure best value can be sought from
relevant trading organisations through the marketplace. It is out there
and it is not the Audit Commission which supplies it. We have permitted
a two-tier system of continuous improvement practice to evolve: the
practice of the private sector, for which this work is imperative; and
a lesser standard in the public sector, which has muddled along. It is
therefore extremely important that police authorities are free to
secure the advice of any number of the organisations specialising in
this field and to demonstrate to the rest of the public sector how to
manage continuous improvement and secure best value. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070448000267"></a><b><a name="06070448000769"></a>Baroness
Henig:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with the
amendment and I endorse much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Harris,
said.</p><p><a name="06070448000268"></a>Based
on my experience as a former chair of a police authority, the best
value duty was an important one. It enabled police authorities to
scrutinise and become familiar with detailed aspects of policing which
some chief officers would previously have guarded as matters of
operational independence. It gave us access to some of those dark and
dusty corners which had previously escaped rigorous scrutiny. Indeed,
police authority involvement in best value reviews actually helped to
strengthen relationships with the force and gave officers greater
confidence that authority members understood the issues and challenges
facing
them.</p><p><a name="06070448000269"></a>Of
course, it also involved a great deal of red tape and bureaucracy. This
was mostly due to the guidance issued by the then Office of the Deputy
Prime Minister. When the APA and the Home Office together produced some
guidance specifically for the police service, much of that was swept
away.</p><p><a name="06070448000270"></a>Best
value, as such, may now have had its day; I know that colleagues in,
for example, the Metropolitan Police Authority are using other forms of
scrutiny very powerfully to achieve the same ends. However, the
difficulty with what the Government are proposing is that it places
police authorities between a rock and a hard place. They will still
have a duty to secure best value; they will still be measured against
best value measures, or SPIs, as they are now called; and they will
still be inspected against the duty. But they will no longer have the
levers or the tools to fulfil that duty&#151;that is, the power to
carry out best value reviews. If best value is dying, let us kill it
off altogether. We do not want to leave authorities with a duty and no
power. Powers to inspect police authorities are already being taken
elsewhere in the Bill. The Government continue to have powers under the
Bill to set strategic priorities and appropriate measures. Why do we
need to continue to apply these
provisions?</p><p><a name="06070448000271"></a><b><a name="06070448000770"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> The amendment is best
described as rather curious. As I understand it, the noble Baroness,
Lady Harris, and my noble friend Lady Henig have explained that police
authorities continue to support the notion of best value and want it
retained. It has been argued fairly that leaving in 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_167"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>place the overarching duty to promote best value while removing the
tools provided for best value reviews and best value performance plans
might leave police authorities somewhat hamstrung.</p><p><a name="06070448000272"></a>The
noble Baroness's solution is simply to disapply the entire best value
regime for police authorities. That is a strange solution to what is
seen as a problem. I do not see it as a problem at all. I cannot accept
the analysis. In repealing the duty to undertake best value reviews,
all we are removing is fairly acknowledged as an overly bureaucratic
and resource-intensive process. Those are terms and words that I would
have thought would be more than a little familiar to the noble
Baroness, Lady Harris; I recognise them as terms that she might use to
describe best value at its worst, when best value becomes more
overbearing than useful in getting good value for money from any
organisation. As I understand it and as I attempted to make it work in
my time in local government, that is what best value is
about.</p><p><a name="06070448000273"></a>Of
course, police authorities, as with any other statutory body corporate,
may do anything consistent with the exercise of their functions. They
do not, therefore, need express statutory powers to undertake reviews
in order to do so. I would have thought that an element of good
practice in any organisation involved in local government or in police
authorities is that it is important at all times to review the way in
which the organisation operates to secure good value for money.
Furthermore, police authorities can continue to draw on their powers in
Section 22 of the Police Act 1996 to request a report from their chief
officer. In other words, the chief officer has a continuing commitment
and obligation to ensure that good value is provided through the police
authority.</p><p><a name="06070448000274"></a>Police authorities
will still be able to discharge their general duty to secure continuous
improvement in the delivery of police forces&#146; functions. That
general duty is well worth retaining without the cumbersome bureaucracy
that best value can have associated with it, although it has often been
shown to be positive. In those circumstances, I am puzzled why the
noble Baroness, Lady Harris, takes agin what I would have thought would
be recognised as a government move that provided for some freeing
up.</p><p><a name="06070448000275"></a>My noble friend Lady Henig
has acknowledged that the Metropolitan Police Authority is using other
tools of scrutiny to secure best value. In a sense, that makes the
argument for the Government. If that is the case, what is to stop other
police authorities acting in a similar way? They do not need the
cumbersome nature of some best value practices to carry out reviews or
assess performance plans. I would have thought that this would be a
welcome change of approach, because it would enable some scope and some
use of imagination in how reviews can be carried out to benefit the
police authority and ensure that it continues to deliver the services
that it is asked to provide at good
value.</p><h5><a name="06070448000344"></a>5.30

speaking to the amendment. It is still very important for police
authorities to secure best value, but the Bill will remove the power to
enforce that duty. I heard what the Minister said about police
authorities&#146; ability to get other forms of help in securing best
value, but one of my main points was the power of that extraordinary
body, the Audit Commission, to inspect the authority. Will it have the
wherewithal to say what sort of best value it ought to apply to police
authorities? Will it advise them on how they should best seek this
advice? It certainly does not have the experience to do
that.</p><p><a name="06070448000277"></a>When the Minister looks
again at what I have said, perhaps he will consider a little more
carefully what encouragement I am trying to give the
Government.</p><p><a name="06070448000278"></a><b><a name="06070448000772"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not know whether this is
the right thing to say, and it is certainly not in my brief&#151;I
know it is always risky&#151;but having heard what the noble Baroness
said, I am thinking back to a time when I had the privilege and good
fortune to act as the leader of my local authority. Every year, we used
to receive something called the auditors&#146; management letter,
which the noble Baroness will no doubt be familiar with. This was long
before the days of best value and during what I thought was a rather
heavy-handed regime called compulsory competitive
tendering&#151;although I freely acknowledge that it had its
benefits. What I used to find particularly helpful was not so much the
letter itself, but what preceded it: external invigilation and review
of important functions of the local authority, including, perhaps, its
housing benefits system, occasionally its poll tax or council tax, or
whatever regime it was. That acted as a catalyst for a good deal of
internal thinking about processes and good management.</p><p><a name="06070448000279"></a>I did not require a
regime for that to happen. I enjoyed the fact that there was some
pressure on the organisation and management to think about how we
procured and secured and how we made organisations, functions and
processes work. I guess that in this case we are aiming to achieve
something not entirely dissimilar. So, yes, police authorities will
have a duty to secure best value, but they will have some freedom and
responsibility to do it in a way which is most appropriate. That is
what we are trying to get at. I hope those comments are helpful and
give some colour and understanding to what we are
about.</p><p><a name="06070448000280"></a><b><a name="06070448000773"></a>Baroness

said: Clause 5, as the Explanatory Notes tell us, inserts a new power
into the list of powers in the 2002 Act that may be conferred on
persons designated as community support officers. The Explanatory Notes
go on to state:</p><ul><a name="06070448000325"></a>&#147;If
designated with the power set out at new paragraph 4C, CSOs will have
the power that constables already have under section 16 of the Crime
and Disorder Act 1998 to deal with truants. This power would allow CSOs
to remove young people of school age that they believe are absent from
school without lawful authority from specified areas and to take them
either to their school, or to a place which has been specified by the
local authority".</ul><a name="06070448000296"></a>The
amendment in my name and that of my noble friend would insert a new
subsection into Clause 5 to make certain that,
<ul><a name="06070448000326"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State shall
have regard to the desirability of maintaining the discretion of chief
officers of police to designate the powers of community support
officers to the extent they

in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, refers specifically
to,</p><ul><a name="06070448000327"></a>&#147;the power to use
reasonable force to detain or control a
person&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070448000288"></a>The
amendments to some degree overlap, the aim being to probe the nature
and extent of the powers which the Secretary of Sate might want to
introduce in standardising the powers and duties of CSOs under this
clause. The Home Office&#146;s consultation demonstrated that there
was general agreement that some standardisation of powers is desirable.
However, a range of organisations have expressed concern about whether
too much standardisation is proposed. Indeed, the APA argues that the
consultation that it undertook last year demonstrates that police
authorities support only a minimum set of standard powers and maximum
local flexibility.</p><p><a name="06070448000289"></a>I commend
CSOs for the work that they do. It is clear that they bring some
reassurance to the public by their presence on the street and help
provide local flexibility. Indeed, they can adopt a targeted approach
to each area in which they work. I will discuss their important role
with children in the next
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070448000290"></a>Organisations
such as the APA, however, are worried not only that, by increasing the
CSOs&#146; automatic powers, particularly the power of detention, the
Bill will erode the cost differential of training for full officers and
CSOs, but also that the latter will spend less time on the streets and
more time behind desks completing paperwork. ACPO has made similar
noises, stating that,</p><ul><a name="06070448000328"></a>&#147;the standardisation of powers
for CSOs will bring some clarity to the public as to what CSOs are for.
However, we need to guard against them being given powers that lead to
abstraction from 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their major role in providing high-visibility contact with the public.
More powers mean more training, equipment, and office time dealing with
those powers and Chief Constables must retain discretion in how best to
deploy them&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070448000291"></a>I remind
your Lordships that the Home Affairs Select Committee commented that a
reduction in the street presence of CSOs would be counterproductive. I
hope that the Minister will explain to the Committee in full the powers
that the Government wish to standardise and those that they do not, and
to what degree standardisation is removing more discretion from chief
constables.</p><p><a name="06070448000292"></a>Perhaps
I may use this opportunity briefly to discuss truancy. I know that some
organisations such as the Police Federation welcome the extension of
the power to deal with truants to CSOs&#151;indeed, they highlight
the enormity of the problem and the time it consumes. But do these
powers really answer the question? The Children's Society has
questioned the efficacy of truancy sweeps as a way to tackle
non-attendance at school, highlighting that the National Foundation for
Educational Research concluded that, while sweeps had raised awareness
of the issue, it was,</p><ul><a name="06070448000329"></a>&#147;less certain of the long-term
impact on individual pupil
attendance&#148;.</ul><a name="06070448000293"></a>Despite
a plethora of initiatives, national rates of unauthorised absence have
not changed in 10 years and they increased in 2004-05 to more than 0.8
per cent of available school days. I hope that the Minister will inform
us what the Government are doing to re-examine their strategy for
tackling truancy and to shift the balance away from enforcement
measures in favour of more strategic initiatives that respond to
children&#146;s and young people&#146;s reasons for not attending
school. They should focus more on some of the good early-intervention
initiatives which address family difficulties such as those seen in
Kent and recognise that this is one of the more likely roots of the
problem. If we can address the causes of truancy, we can help cut the
amount of time our officers and CSOs need to spend addressing it. They
can then focus on other areas that require more skills. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06070460000001"></a><b><a name="06070460000067"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> I rise in support of
Amendment No. 82 and will also speak to Amendment No. 84, which stands
in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dholakia. Amendment No. 82
raises the argument about whether it is better to have standardised
powers&#151;which the Secretary of State would be able to impose
anyway&#151;or the power of a chief constable to allow local
flexibility in determining what powers a CSO should
have.</p><p><a name="06070460000002"></a>We know that the power to
detain will be made standard, so that everyone will recognise that all
CSOs, like police officers, have this power. I am opposed to their
having this power, because I think it could cause immense problems,
especially if an energetic and enthusiastic CSO gets it wrong. There is
greater likelihood of that, because their training is minuscule and
their experience far less than that of a fully fledged police officer.
However, as the Government seem to think it is a good idea to allow
power to creep to them, let us at least make sure that they all
understand what is expected of them.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070460000003"></a>I much prefer the stance taken by the APA,
which would give chief constables discretion to decide whether their
CSOs should be deployed in this manner. I hope chief constables would
decide that in consultation with their police authorities. In 2002,
when we discussed the powers of CSOs&#151;how well I remember
that&#151;ACPO said that CSOs
were,</p><ul><a name="06070460000060"></a>&#147;best seen as a
complement to, not a replacement for, the role of sworn police
officers&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070460000004"></a>In its view
it was only for sworn police officers to deal with circumstances
where,</p><ul><a name="06070460000061"></a>&#147;there is a
clear likelihood that a confrontation will arise ... where there
is scope for exercise of a high degree of discretion&#151;for
example, where a situation is complex owing to a number of different
parties involved ... where police action is likely to lead to a
higher than normal risk of harm ... where there is a clear
likelihood that police action will include any infringement of a
person&#146;s human rights ... where the incident is one which
is likely to lead to significant further
work&#148;.</ul><a name="06070460000005"></a>We can see
that there are clear boundaries to the role of police CSOs. Local
flexibility is the key to using them. I hope the Minister will agree
that this amendment helps forces get the best out of their CSOs and use
them as local policing style dictates. That can only be decided by each
force and police
authority.<p><a name="06070460000006"></a>Amendment
No. 84 is a probing amendment intended to discover the nature and
extent of the powers that the Secretary of State might want to
introduce under the clause. It is rather strange that extremely
detailed powers are included in Schedule 4 to the Police Reform Act
2002, explaining exactly what powers CSOs can exercise: issuing, in
effect, fixed penalty notices; detaining, for up to 30 minutes,
suspects who fail to give details; and using reasonable force to detain
people in those circumstances. As I said, I am opposed to the power to
detain anyway. It always assumes the use of force, however light, and
the repercussions of that could be horrendous, even litigious. Apart
from the fact that CSOs are not trained sufficiently&#151;nor will
they be&#151;in the gentle art of detention, it is entirely wrong
that they should be given the power to use force to enable them to
undertake it. Apart from anything else, their own safety could be badly
compromised; far better that this power be given to a fully trained
police officer, who knows when and how to apply force
appropriately.</p><h5><a name="06070460000064"></a>5.45

this amendment is to pay tribute to the Home Office. Heaven knows that
in recent weeks the Home Office has not had many friends in this House.
I want to take this opportunity to point out that CSOs have been one of
the big success stories of the last three years. The Home Office has to
take some of the credit for that, both for securing the finance and for
making sure that all police authorities came on board and realised
their usefulness. That has to be said, and I wanted to begin by saying
it.</p><p><a name="06070460000008"></a>In Lancashire we saw very
early on the value of community support officers. We asked for a lot of
them right at the start. I think we had the highest number outside
London and Manchester. We used

extended police family. In the next three years, community support
officers will be an invaluable and integral part of the rollout of the
neighbourhood policing initiative, which both sides of the Committee
will welcome. That is why it is so important that we look at that role,
see how they have been used, and use them most effectively. They have
been successful and will be even more so.</p><p><a name="06070460000009"></a>Lancashire was one of the forces to have
a pilot scheme in relation to detention powers. CSOs operated with
powers of detention in two divisions in Lancashire. In one division it
worked very effectively; in the other division it did not.
Interestingly, at the end of that experiment, Lancashire Constabulary
felt that it did not want powers of detention for CSOs. I think that is
a point worth making, because it tried all this. My own
preference&#151;although I would not push it too
vigorously&#151;would be for the chief constable to have discretion
over these areas. I say that only because, as I have already argued,
these community support officers are going to be an absolutely
essential community resource in the next few years. We need to try, as
far as we can, to get the relationship and powers right so that we can
use them to maximum effect. While I would not strenuously oppose what
is suggested, I would like it noted that I think maximum flexibility
and discretion may well be the most effective way forward
here.</p><p><a name="06070460000010"></a><b><a name="06070460000069"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> That is precisely the reason why my
noble friend said that this is very much a probing amendment. We really
want to see exactly which powers will be vested in community support
officers. This was discussed very substantially during previous
legislation. We certainly support everything the noble Baroness, Lady
Henig, has said.</p><p><a name="06070460000011"></a>It might be
useful to cast our minds back to look at the extent of the conflict
police officers find themselves involved in when detaining people. Many
of us are used to seeing this on CCTV and many programmes on
television. If those powers are to be used by community support
officers it is vital that they are properly trained for that purpose,
rather than be expected to perform a task that needs years of police
training. If we do not tread carefully, the sympathy that exists at the
moment in relation to community support officers will gradually
disappear if there is a confrontation between them and the individual
being arrested. It might be very helpful if, at this stage, the
Minister could indicate two things. First, will community support
officers receive adequate training&#151;meaning as good as that given
to police officers? Secondly, will they also be subject to the
discipline of the Independent Police Complaints
Commission?</p><p><a name="06070460000012"></a><b><a name="06070460000070"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I thank my noble friend Lady
Henig for the compliment she paid the Home Office. It is a rare moment
and I will savour it for a long time. May I say with all humility that
on this occasion it is perhaps justified only because of what has been
said by other Members of the Committee, not all of whom were as
enthusiastic 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_173"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when CSOs were originally introduced but who have now become stalwart
converts to their benefits. I had the great pleasure last week of
speaking to a head teacher who had been extremely antipathetic to the
thought of working with police officers or indeed with CSOs, and is now
extolling their virtues and benefits. We have converts it appears not
only all over the Committee but all over the country, which we must of
course celebrate.</p><p><a name="06070460000013"></a>It is right that people
are jealous of that success, because PCSOs have added colour, flavour
and intimacy to the way in which the community can respond, which we
value. I wish to reassure the Committee that our seeking to standardise
some of the powers under which CSOs will operate is only to bring
clarity. It is not to bring rigidity or to try to undermine the
efficacy of the way in which they work. It would therefore be right to
make it plain, in response to the question of the noble Viscount, Lord
Bridgeman, that the list of the powers that the Government propose to
confer are set out as standard in annexe B of the Explanatory Notes.
None of the proposed powers is inappropriate to CSOs. They are already
in legislation, which is what the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of
Richmond, indicated, so we should not see PCSOs abstracted from the
community as was feared. I understand what the noble Viscount says
about their visibility, accessibility and importance. An approach that
took them away from that front-line role would be extremely
regrettable.</p><p><a name="06070460000014"></a>I am not sure
whether I misheard, but I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia,
referred to powers of arrest. I remind the House that CSOs do not have
a power to arrest, although they have a power to detain. I thought that
he did not intend that. The power to detain is worded as a requirement
to wait with the community support officer for up to 30 minutes. The
use of force is therefore not inevitable. It has been piloted
successfully. The power to use reasonable force is separate and will
not be a standard power. I particularly endorse the views expressed by
my noble friend Lady Henig that the way in which it can be delivered
has been found successful in many situations, and on other occasions
not so. The power to use reasonable force is a separate power that
needs to be judiciously used.</p><p><a name="06070460000015"></a>I turn to the truancy
sweeps that the noble Viscount raised. They are only one element of the
strategy that we intend to use: there are issues on how we respond to
truancy in terms of educational welfare, the assessments made at
school, parenting orders, the attempts to engage the parents in
relation to it, and the now greater connection between the wraparound
services and the agencies working together in partnership to identify
need and interventions which will encourage children to remain in
school. Special programmes for children are being developed. Some of
the groups teach them in a slightly different way, which is more
interesting and likely to retain their presence at school, one hopes.
All those matters have to be undertaken. This is but one extra step,
which cannot ever be a panacea but can be an additional
support.</p><p><a name="06070460000016"></a>Children who are
truanting are disproportionately likely to be engaged in anti-social
behaviour and disproportionately often at risk. The training for PCSOs 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_174"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not minuscule; it is often around four weeks and the chief officer
has a statutory obligation in that regard to ensure that they have
proper training. Training is an issue to which we will return on a
number of occasions. It is also right to say that the reason why we are
not persuaded that Amendment No. 82 adds value to Clause 5 is that
there is, as I have already indicated, provision in the clause that
requires the Secretary of State to consult police authorities and chief
officers prior to exercising the order-making power. In putting our
proposals for consultation, the Secretary of State will in any event
need to strike a balance between the benefits of a standardised set of
powers for community support officers and the advantages of according
chief constables a degree of local flexibility, which has already been
echoing around the House as one of the benefits that we have been able
to derive to date.</p><p><a name="06070460000017"></a>The Home Secretary will
then have to consider carefully the comments made in response to that
consultation. We have been candid about the whole process since last
summer. The proposed set of standard powers for community support
officers has been formulated following a formal public consultation in
which the Association of Chief Police Officers was specifically invited
to comment. Our intentions, which will be subject to debate in this
House, are set out in annexe B of the Explanatory Notes. The Bill
recognises that it is desirable for some powers to be standard and for
some to remain available at the discretion of individual chief
officers. In deciding which powers should be standardised, the
Secretary of State will take into account the relevant factors and
views. We believe that the duty to consult achieves the ends sought by
Amendment No. 82, and I hope for that reason the noble Baroness, Lady
Harris&#151;at whom I am looking, but my remarks are also intended
for the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman&#151;will be content not to
press the amendment, as it is not necessary. As I said, we understand
why it was tabled.</p>

<p><a name="06070460000018"></a>Amendment
No. 84, which was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, who has
spoken to it, and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, singles out one
particular power that will for ever be excluded from the standard set
of powers. That is at odds with the approach taken in Clause 5. All
powers remain at the discretion of chief officers of police, save those
designated as standard powers. We see no reason to single out the power
to detain for special attention. If, as Parliament accepted in 2002,
CSOs should be capable of exercising a power of detention, that power
should be one that could be included in a standard suite of
powers.</p><p><a name="06070460000019"></a>We have already
indicated that we will omit the power to use reasonable force to detain
an individual from proposed standard lists of powers for community
support officers. That power should remain in the discretion of chief
officers of police, but detention is a key enforcement power that can
contribute to the effectiveness of community support officers. The
clause as it stands provides flexibility while ensuring that any order
is subject to full consultation and parliamentary scrutiny through the
draft affirmative procedure, which provides

Training for Community Support Officers must include training on the
common core of skills and knowledge for the children's workforce
developed by the Department for Education and
Skills.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06070460000023"></a>The noble Viscount said: This probing
amendment in the names of my noble friend Lady Anelay and myself
follows on nicely from the debate on the potential new powers that CSOs
may be given under this clause. Amendment No. 83 inserts a new
subsection after subsection (6) to make it certain that CSOs receive
adequate and appropriate training in working with children and young
people.</p><p><a name="06070460000024"></a>The Standing Committee
on Youth Justice&#151;SCYJ&#151;and APPG on Children have expressed
the view that the standard set of powers for CSOs introduced by Clause
5 must be accompanied by statutory requirements for training in order
for these powers to be implemented appropriately. I am sure that all
your Lordships believe this is essential to ensure the safety and
well-being of children and young people who come into contact with
CSOs.</p><p><a name="06070460000025"></a>A recent Home Office
evaluation of CSOs identified that they spend a lot of their time
working with children and young people, dealing in particular with
anti-social behaviour and &#147;youth nuisance&#148; on a regular
basis. Indeed, as I highlighted in the previous debate, some areas
designate their CSOs solely to carry out this role. The survey reported
that dealing with youth disorder/nuisance was one of the tasks they
most frequently carried out, with over half saying they did it daily
and 81 per cent at least
weekly.</p><p><a name="06070460000026"></a>The report also
identifies the important role that CSOs can play in getting to know and
engaging local children and young people, introducing diversionary
activities in the community and ensuring that the voices of under-18s
are included in the discussions and debates about anti-social behaviour
in the community. It is clear that CSOs in their daily work are highly
likely to be working with children and young people. However, there are
concerns among many children's groups that CSOs may not possess the
appropriate skills and knowledge to communicate 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_176"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and work effectively with children and young people. As such, we believe
that there is a strong argument that the safeguarding duty set out in
Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 should be extended to cover CSOs
explicitly.</p><p><a name="06070460000027"></a>Section 11 of the
Children Act 2004 places a duty on key persons and bodies to make
arrangements to ensure that in discharging their functions, they have
regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.
The police are one of the key bodies covered by this duty, and the
guidance on Section 11 states that in order to meet the requirements of
this duty, among other things, the police should ensure senior
management commitment and accountability; have clear statements of
responsibility; ensure that police officers and police staff at all
levels are aware of their statutory requirements to protect and
safeguard the welfare of children; and ensure that appropriate
training, processes and procedures are in place to enable all staff to
be best able to support the aims and objectives of the Children Act
2004. While it may be implicit in the guidance that the Section 11 duty
falls on &#147;police and police staff&#148;, I hope that the
Minister can provide a clear statement and assurance that CSOs are
included under the Section 11 safeguarding
duty.</p><p><a name="06070460000028"></a>The
national evaluation report highlighted that many CSOs themselves have
expressed concerns about the training they had received and many felt
that it inadequately prepared them for their role, and they wanted more
practically based teaching methods. Only 38 per cent of CSOs felt that
their initial training had prepared them well enough to do their job
and 59 per cent of CSOs felt they had encountered situations they did
not feel properly trained to deal with. So there have been numerous
research studies that have identified difficulties in the relationship
between the police and young people. Research by the Home Office with
Docking, and Bradley in 1998, identified that young people feel
intimidated, disrespected and stereotyped by the police and that the
police lacked sympathy and understanding towards them. Research by the
Children's Society identified that police are often lacking in the
skills needed to communicate effectively with black young people in
particular.</p><p><a name="06070460000029"></a>In
interviews with young people about their experiences of stop and
search, many expressed a lack of trust in policing generally and
specifically they paint a picture of conflict and confrontation in
their daily dealings. Some also reported being frightened by such
encounters. The consequence of this is that many young people often
lack confidence in the police and some report that they have largely
withdrawn from any voluntary involvement with
them.</p><p><a name="06070460000030"></a>With the
proposed increasing role and functions of CSOs, there is a danger that
the same problems will arise, worsening the overall relationship
between young people and those responsible for promoting community
safety. In order to avoid this situation and to ensure the successful
implementation of this clause, resources will need to be made available
to ensure that CSOs receive adequate and appropriate training about how
to work effectively, safely and appropriately with children and young
people. Reverting to the remarks made in 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_177"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>connection with the previous amendment, it is so important that the
initial success of CSOs is safeguarded in that respect.</p><p><a name="06070460000031"></a>It has been suggested
that the best way to achieve this would be to make it a statutory
requirement for CSOs to be trained on the Common Core of Skills and
Knowledge for the Children's Workforce developed by the DfES. As your
Lordships know, this sets out the basic skills and knowledge needed by
people, including volunteers, whose work brings them into regular
contact with children, young people and families. As part of its
<I>Every Child Matters</I> children's workforce development programme,
the DfES has recommended that all relevant practitioners should
undertake the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge, which consists of
improving skills in the following six areas: effective communication
and engagement with children; young people and families; child and
young person development; safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the
child; supporting transitions; and multi-agency working and sharing
information.</p><p><a name="06070460000032"></a>In Committee in the
other place, the Minister gave an assurance that CSOs
will,</p><ul><a name="06070460000062"></a>&#147;receive proper
and adequate training to deal with young
people&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing
Committee D, 21/3/06; col.
126.]</ul><a name="06070460000051"></a>However, she did not
specify what this training would involve. I hope the Minister can
confirm that this training will at the very least adhere to the Common
Core of Skills and Knowledge for the Children's Workforce, thereby
enabling CSOs to be more equipped to communicate and work positively
with the children and young people they come into contact with. In
doing so, I hope that she can also clarify whether in line with Section
11 of the Children Act CSOs will receive training in child protection,
safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people. I
beg to
move.<p><a name="06070460000033"></a><b><a name="06070460000073"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> I rise to support this
amendment whole heartedly. I hope noble Lords will forgive me if in
some respects I echo what the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, has said.
Although she is no longer in her place, I echo the very favourable
remarks that the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, made about the development
of CSOs, which is clearly very important, constructive and
necessary.</p><p><a name="06070460000034"></a>We
are all agreed that the presence of CSOs can make a very positive
contribution to policing and potentially represents a bridge between
disaffected young people and the police. We also know that a great deal
of CSOs&#146; time is spent with young people. Over half do so daily
and 81 per cent at least weekly. It follows therefore that it is vital
that they are properly equipped for this role and for the appropriate
exercise of their powers. The noble Viscount referred to their
safeguarding duty. It is vital that that should be properly discharged
and explicitly included under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004. We
hope to get some reassurance on
that.</p><p><a name="06070460000035"></a>Training
is clearly central, as is consistency of approach. The Common Core of
Skills and Knowledge, published by the DfES, is the obvious starting
point. Indeed, without it, it is likely that many CSOs will be
significantly 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disadvantaged, and the chances of failing to deal properly or adequately
with what are often very challenging situations can be very high. As we
have heard, many CSOs do not feel adequately trained or prepared and as
many as 59 per cent have been in situations that they felt not
adequately prepared to deal with. This is very
pressing.</p><p><a name="06070460000036"></a>The Common Core of
Skills<I></I>consists of six basic areas. They are excellent areas.
People have spent a lifetime doing PhDs on each one of those basic
areas, which go to the heart of what is involved in dealing with young
people. None of them can be acquired without considerable time and
thought. That raises questions about the time, level and intensity that
will be applied to the training of CSOs. We need reassurance from the
Government that they will commit explicitly to a training programme for
all CSOs and tell us what it will consist of.</p><p><a name="06070460000037"></a>It would also be helpful to know what
plans are in place for training not only the current CSOs but the
24,000 new ones that are planned to be recruited. Does the Minister
have a timescale for that? What is the figure for the financial
resources that will have to be committed, as they will be quite
considerable? What will the training programme be, and how long will it
take? Without clarity for such plans, the expansion of the number of
CSOs&#151;on the face of it, a potentially very positive
development&#151;is likely to lead to serious
problems.</p><p><a name="06070460000038"></a><b><a name="06070460000074"></a>The
Earl of Listowel:</b> I strongly support this
amendment. If I may, I will speak from my script in the interests of
brevity.</p><p><a name="06070460000039"></a>Given their close
contact with children and young people, it seems vital that community
support officers are equipped with the common core skills already
described. I seek assurances from the Minister on the other elements of
a community support officer&#146;s development that will enable him
to set good, clear boundaries for children and young people: mentoring
for these officers; the initial training, which has been referred to;
and good supervision.</p><p><a name="06070460000040"></a>I hope it
will assist your Lordships if I give a little psychological and social
background to the work of these officers. Speaking very simply, boys
growing up without interested fathers or other important positive role
models are particularly at risk of developing dissocial behaviour. The
Commissioner for Racial Equality, Trevor Phillips, has spoken of his
particular concerns that black boys lack sufficient positive male role
models, and that not enough black fathers are involved with their sons.
I acquainted myself with some young black men in such a position. I am
concerned that some of these boys face uncertain futures for lack of
such a positive male role model. I know this is also a problem among
white families, but it seems particularly apparent in black
communities. It seems most unfair that some of these children may grow
to be lawless and be punished for that, when they have had no father to
show them the right path.</p><p><a name="06070460000041"></a>The Home Office
assessment report finds that CSOs have a greater ethnic mix than the
police force. They tend to be older individuals with a wide range of
experience. The report, as has been made clear around 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_179"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Committee, is positive about what the CSOs have already achieved,
but it highlights inconsistencies in their training and development. In
particular, the mentoring, which many found so helpful, was available
only to 60 per cent of them. One CSO, who received no such support,
said:</p><ul><a name="06070460000057"></a>&#147;I was thrown in
at the deep end ... they didn&#146;t know what I was supposed to
do ... it was an absolute nightmare&#148;.</ul><a name="06070460000052"></a>I quote further
from the report:
<ul><a name="06070460000058"></a>&#147;while there is clear support
for it&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06070460000053"></a>that
is,
mentoring&#151;<ul><a name="06070460000063"></a>&#147;views
in case study reports were mixed regarding the feasibility of mentoring
large numbers of CSOs. One force thought formal mentoring would be
useful with the imminent rise in CSO numbers, while another thought it
would be unsustainable on a larger scale&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070460000042"></a>In my view, that mentoring support for
the first one or two months of a CSO&#146;s placement in a community
is vital, for this reason: if these men and women are to be successful
at setting boundaries for children and young people, they must know
their own professional boundaries. I
quote:</p><ul><a name="06070460000059"></a>&#147;It was also felt
that more clarification of the role in terms of what CSOs can and
cannot do was required. For example, one officer said: &#145;They
need more training about boundaries ... they haven&#146;t been
given clear training.&#146; This view was reinforced by other force
personnel (constables, duty inspectors and BCU commanders) during the
fieldwork&#148;.</ul><a name="06070460000054"></a>Perhaps that reflects
in part police officers&#146; understandable concerns at the
undermining of their own professional status, but it also carries with
it what would be my paramount concern in this matter: that CSOs
properly inhabit their particular role and do not seek either to
overreach themselves or to neglect their duty to provide discipline.
Good initial training, adequate mentoring and good continual
professional development, including expert supervision, are required to
build on the initial success of this new role.
<h5><a name="06070460000066"></a>6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06070460000043"></a>I should be grateful if the
Minister could say in her reply what the normal expectations will be of
the amount of individual supervision a CSO should receive. The Home
Office assessment reports that over 40 per cent of CSOs, many of them
younger and male, had joined as a stepping stone to joining the police.
The relatively high number of CSOs wishing to become sworn officers
raises a number of issues for the stability, diversity and morale of
the workforce.</p><p><a name="06070460000044"></a>It occurs to me
that some development of career progression within the CSO force itself
might be part of a response to concerns about the workforce. If there
were a recognition of certain CSOs&#146; experience and expertise and
their special role as supervisors and mentors, that might aid retention
and morale and keep some of the young men in the force&#151;these
important role models, one would hope&#151;rather than leaving the
force consisting predominantly of elder women, those who currently seem
most likely to be retained, according to the report.</p><p><a name="06070460000045"></a>If the Minister might consider it helpful
to convene a meeting between interested Peers, herself, police
commanders or their deputies, the relevant Minister with direct
responsibility and civil servants to discuss the development of this
CSO role at some time during 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_180"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the course of the Bill, I would certainly wish to attend. It would be
very helpful, from my point of view, to learn the direction of travel
for CSOs at this critical time from those responsible.</p><p><a name="06070460000046"></a>In conclusion, I support the call for
common core training for CSOs. I finish at this point, but I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p><p><a name="06070460000047"></a><b><a name="06070460000075"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I say again how pleased I am
at the supportive comments that have been made from all around the
Committee. I hope I will be able to reassure noble Lords about the
benefit of the way we are dealing with this important issue.</p><p><a name="06070460000048"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, is
right. A large number of our community support officers are doing
sterling work with young people. Indeed, when I went to Oxford, I had
the pleasure of seeing two CSOs riding around on their bicycles, with a
number of children chasing them because they all knew their names and
had something to tell them. They are certainly well integrated into the
community, and one of the benefits is that they are not frightening
figures. They become well known and accepted, and they have a huge
opportunity to gather information. I will not say that the two ladies
involved were Pied Pipers, but I saw the similarity.</p><p><a name="06070460000049"></a>It is important, if CSOs are going to
continue to do this work, that they do it well. I say to the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, that one of the important things is not to see the
CSOs in isolation. They are going to be very much part of the
neighbourhood policing team. If an officer graduates out of the CSO
role into an officer role, that officer will not necessarily be lost
from the team. I am sure the skills and the community approach will
inure to the benefit of any police officer having gone through
that.</p><p><a name="06070460000050"></a>There has been a lot of
concern about the training, but I can reassure noble Lords. To make it
clear, the community support officers in the survey&#151;which a
number of noble Lords have referred to, but the noble Viscount, Lord
Bridgeman, referred to them first&#151;were those who had been
trained prior to the national training package, first launched in 2004.
Noble Lords will remember that when CSOs were introduced there was no
standardised training, but that has now been brought
in.</p><p><a name="06070463000001"></a>As
we have said, the Police Reform Act 2002 already places a statutory
duty on chief officers to ensure that all community support officers
are adequately trained to perform the duties and exercise the powers
that have been designated. There is already provision in the Police and
Justice Bill at new Section 38A(6) to reaffirm this responsibility in
relation to the standard powers and duties of community support
officers.</p><p><a name="06070463000002"></a>I hope that it will
please noble Lords to know that the Central Police Training and
Development Authority has developed a national package that addresses
every element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> report. This will be
available at the end of the month, and has been fully incorporated into
both the regular police officer training package and the community
support officer training package. Community support officers already
receive training in youth and child

in the common core of skills and knowledge for the children&#146;s
workforce, recommended as a result of the <I>Every Child Matters</I>
report. There is no difference between the training that community
support officers will receive under this module and the training that
their regular police officer colleagues receive. We thought that this
was important and it is going to be
delivered.</p><p><a name="06070463000003"></a>There is nothing to
suggest that community support officer training is in any way
inadequate. To enshrine for police training such a specific project in
primary legislation would be, we respectfully suggest, unnecessary and
would in due course fall into obsolescence as we change and move
forward&#151;considerations that your Lordships rightly take into
account when scrutinising Bills before the House.</p><p><a name="06070463000004"></a>I hear what the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, says on mentoring and supervision. I have already
said that the CSOs will be part of a team, and we will be able to look
into those issues more closely. The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, is
right that we hope to increase the number of CSOs. We are committed to
having 16,000 CSOs in place by April 2007, up from the current figure
of 6,000. The Chancellor announced in his Budget a further &#163;91
million to facilitate this improvement. The training&#151;and the
opportunity for us to get better and to deliver a high-quality
service&#151;is certainly
there.</p><p><a name="06070463000005"></a>The noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, talked about line management roles. CSOs should always be
tasked and debriefed in accordance with the national intelligence
model, as part of a neighbourhood policing team. On a daily basis, they
discuss with the team leader the issues and incidents that they come
across. There is some evidence that young people relate better to the
community support officers than to police officers, which may be due to
the difference of the role. Community support officers tend to get to
know their patch well. We hope that police officers will be better able
to emulate that approach when neighbourhood policing teams, which we
all encourage and endorse, come more on stream.</p><p><a name="06070463000006"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman,
raised a question on Section 11 of the Children Act. I confess that I
do not have that with me. I could guess, but it is safer if I write to
him on that particular point. With that, I hope that the noble Viscount
will feel it appropriate to withdraw this
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070463000007"></a><b><a name="06070463000310"></a>Lord

That needs to be encouraged. Being a CSO is in many ways a form of

84B, 84C and 85A. These amendments relate to conditions of bail for
children under 17 and to the amendments to the Police and Criminal
EvidenceAct 1984 in part 2 of Schedule 4 and in Clause 8. It
is proposed in the Bill that, where bail is granted not in a police
station, the police will have the powers to impose conditions. These
amendments exempt children under 17 from these provisions other than
the condition to attend a police
station.</p><p><a name="06070463000019"></a>This is an issue of the
appropriate protection of children and young people. The Standing
Committee for Youth Justice has clearly expressed concerns about how to
guarantee their protection if they are granted bail on the street and
not in a police station, and without the presence of an appropriate
adult. Home Office guidance stipulates that the decision to grant
street bail to a juvenile should be based on an assessment of the level
of risk to the safety and welfare of the young person, and requires
that contact should be made as soon as practicable with the parent,
guardian or other carer. This is really not good enough; it is well
known that a high proportion of young people who get caught up in
offending 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_183"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>behaviour&#151;including of a low level&#151;can be very vulnerable.
Many have health issues, including mental health issues, domestic
issues of a wide and complex kind, learning difficulties, and the
like.</p><p><a name="06070463000020"></a>The assessment of the
level of risk to the safety and welfare of a young person on the street
is extremely difficult, if not impossible. It may simply not be
apparent in such a situation that a young person is, for example, on
the autistic spectrum, has a learning difficulty or is mentally unwell.
However well trained and experienced the policeman or CSO might be, to
make a snap assessment of that kind is really asking too
much.</p><p><a name="06070463000021"></a>Where street bail is the
issue, where the police are concerned enough to be considering bail at
all&#151;and we are talking about situations that are of
concern&#151;appropriate assessments of that kind become even more
difficult. Even where none of those difficult background issues
applies, it is likely that a child&#151;and we must remember that we
are considering children&#151;will simply not understand what is at
stake, particularly the failure to comply with conditions. So the only
possible appropriate condition should be that the child attends a
police station.</p><h5><a name="06070463000084"></a>6.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06070463000022"></a>If conditions are attached to
a bail decision, all those concerns are greatly increased. Even if
there is the most scrupulous training and experience, the proper level
of child protection requires that an appropriate adult, or, at the very
least, a station sergeant with the necessary level of detachment,
should be present. When a child is given the choice of bail, the fact
that failure to meet its conditions could result in the child being
taken into custody is reason enough for him or her to be taken to the
police station.</p><p><a name="06070463000023"></a>I asked the
Minister at Second Reading, and I ask her again: what is the
Government&#146;s position on the proposition that the current PACE
protections be extended to 17 year-olds, as the Standing Committee for
Youth Justice has been urging and which we heartily endorse? At every
stage, we must do everything to ensure that custody is avoided for
young people in our community, for we already have far too many
vulnerable 17 year-olds in custody. They may seem large and grown-up on
the streets, but they are still very young people. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070463000024"></a><b><a name="06070463000314"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady

its briefing on this and other matters and, in particular, for coming
along as a group last week to brief noble Lords on a range of issues
covered by the

come to a difficult issue. Certainly, we on these Benches do not oppose
the use of street bail. It can be extremely useful, not only to the
police, for obvious reasons, but to the person who receives it. If I

have been out, or perhaps I was out because I had been at
work&#151;who knows? But it may not be convenient for me to appear at
a police station immediately. So, street bail has its practical good
uses. However, as soon as conditions are applied to it, we get into
greater difficulties. I shall not stray into the issues that I shall
raise in my AmendmentNo. 85, but this amendment focuses our
minds on the appropriateness of making a wide range of conditions
available to the police to apply to young people, for the reasons that
the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, has
adduced.</p><p><a name="06070463000026"></a>We
can all underestimate the ability of young people. They can be
perfectly able to commit the most amazing and gratuitously wide range
of crimes and can be unable to remember, apparently, something that
they have been told a moment before about a condition that they may
need to obey. But we have to cope with all those who may fall foul of
street bail. We have to realise that some may genuinely be unable to
understand conditions and that, for them, such conditions may be
inappropriate. It is important that the Minister should explain how
this power will be used proportionately in relation to young
people.</p>

Dholakia:</b> Can the Minister
elaborate on the position of a responsible adult? I understand that it
is almost impossible that in all circumstances a responsible adult can
be present when a person is being granted street bail, and the
Government state that a responsible adult should be informed as soon as
is practicable. Do the Government envisage that a constable would have
power to alter the bail conditions, following representations by a
responsible adult, because sometimes young people cannot understand the
conditions, whereas a responsible adult may be able to help
further?</p><p><a name="06070463000028"></a><b><a name="06070463000316"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> Before I give a detailed
response, perhaps I may say that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is
absolutely right about the possible benefits, both to the officer in
dealing with these matters expeditiously and properly, and to the
person who is stopped. It may not be necessary to take a child even of
17 to a police station and there could be an important opportunity to
do something that may better safeguard the child. There is a positive
approach in that, and I thank the noble Baroness for what she
said.</p><p><a name="06070463000029"></a>I will go through the
amendments, but I wish to mention how we see these steps working in
practice. If a child is stopped, they may expect first to be asked to
phone an appropriate adult, if a mobile telephone or telephone is
available. If they do not have a means of getting home, would it be
appropriate for the officer to take them home to see whether there was
an appropriate adult there to take charge of them? So, there is an
issue of safety for the child. Street bail should be looked at in a
practical way.</p><p><a name="06070463000030"></a>I shall deal with
Amendments Nos. 84A, 84B, 84C and 85A together, but I ask the Committee
to bear in mind the practicalities of the issue. I absolutely
understand the sentiments behind the points made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Linklater, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, regarding the
balance that is 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_185"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>required. We intend to consult this summer on the potential for
extending to 17 year-olds the PACE safeguards that are currently
available to those under 17. I am sure that noble Lords will wish to
contribute to that consultation.</p><p><a name="06070463000031"></a>I do not seek to
minimise in any way the fact that the potential for a young person, or,
indeed, any person, to spend time in a police cell is a crucial
consideration, because I know that the noble Baronesses, Lady Linklater
and Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, have often debated
the importance of avoiding that, unless it is really necessary. The use
of street bail is specifically intended to reduce the need for a person
to be taken to a police station, put before the custody officer and
placed in detention. Where street bail can be issued, it means that the
officer can determine a date which best suits the needs of the
investigation; pre-arrange for legal advice, appropriate adults or
interpreters to be available when the person answers bail; remain on
the street rather than spending time travelling to the police station,
processing the suspect and travelling back to their area of duty; and,
equally important, remove the need for the person to be taken into
custody&#151;and to spend less time in custody when they answer bail,
as the officer can better plan the investigation, particularly if there
is vulnerability through
age.</p><p><a name="06070463000032"></a>PACE and the PACE codes
significantly recognise the special considerations and protections for
people under the age of 17&#151;and I know why the noble Baroness,
Lady Linklater, raised that issue. We recognised that in guidance, in
Home Office Circular 61/2003, which was issued when street bail was
introduced. The circular emphasises the need for special consideration
to be given when dealing with a juvenile or other vulnerable person.
The same emphasis will be made in guidance accompanying the
commencement of this measure; in particular, the importance of risk
assessing the individual and of ensuring that conditions are
proportionate will be emphasised. Again, as in 2003, we will consult
the Children&#146;s Charities&#146; Coalition and others on the
content of the guidance.</p><p><a name="06070463000033"></a>It has
already been indicated in the other place that we would not envisage
electronic tagging as a condition of street bail. However, attaching
other conditions to street bail is about raising officer confidence
that steps can be taken to minimise the opportunity for the person to
further offend while on bail or to interfere with victims or
witnesses.</p><p><a name="06070463000034"></a>As I explained,
street bail aims to keep people out of police detention unless they
really need to be there. Attaching conditions proportionate to the
offence will increase the use of street bail and should lead to fewer
situations when it is considered necessary to lock up a juvenile in a
cell. We believe that that is an important objective. With that
reassurance, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070463000035"></a><b><a name="06070463000317"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> I
thank the Minister for her reassuring response. In relation to the
presence of the appropriate adult, which is a crucial element when
dealing with children, I said that the one acceptable condition is
attendance at a police station.

any kind of custodial situation for young children. I am delighted to
hear about the consultation that is being proposed and, in particular,
about the review of the PACE conditions as they apply to 17 year-olds.
On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="06070463000036"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06070463000037"></a>[<I>Amendments Nos. 84B and 84C not

an appropriately trained officer.</ul><ul><a name="06070463000076"></a>( ) For the purposes of the above
subsection, &#147;appropriate training&#148; means training
equivalent to the training given to a custody sergeant regarding the
proper imposition of conditions of bail.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06070463000040"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 85
would require constables to have the appropriate training before they
impose conditions on street bail. Currently, a police officer may
attach conditions to bail only when a person has been charged or
referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision to charge.
Clause 8 and Schedule 4 would change that to enable the officer
granting bail to consider attaching conditions that the Government
intend should be relevant and proportionate to the suspect and the
offence. In her response to the previous group of amendments, the
Minister made that point with regard to younger people, to which it
would also apply&#151;that is the Government&#146;s
intention.</p><p><a name="06070463000041"></a>The conditions that
can be imposed must be necessary to secure that the person surrenders
to custody, does not commit an offence while on bail, and does not
interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
Where the offender is under the age of 17, conditions may also be
applied for their own welfare or in their own interest.</p><p><a name="06070463000042"></a>The Government argue that there is no
need to be concerned about the extension of the process of imposing
conditions on to street bail because the proposed measures reflect the
bail provisions already available at the charging stage of the process.
That is exactly why we think there should be concern about extending
this power to the street, away from the custody sergeant, at the time
of the charging process. When bail is granted in the police station,
the custody sergeant, who has specialist training and expertise,
performs a semi-judicial role in deciding whether bail conditions are
justified. By definition the custody officer would not be present when
street bail is given and instead the officer responsible for deciding
on the conditions to be imposed would be the investigating officer, who
would not necessarily have the training and experience of a custody
officer. It is this matter of deciding whether to impose
conditions that concerns us.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070463000043"></a>We shall pass on from the matter of street
bail, which we support in its broadest sense. If one imposes
conditions, it is a decision that involves difficult judgments about
the suspect&#146;s likely behaviour and about the proper balance
between the aims of the conditions and the rights of the suspect.
Officers who impose conditions on street bail should have the training
to enable them to make these decisions effectively. That seems only
common sense.</p><p><a name="06070463000044"></a>When the matter
was debated in another place, the Minister said that she accepted the
argument that training would be
needed:</p><ul><a name="06070463000077"></a>&#147;Of course we

that, given that extensive training is expected, there is no reason why
that should not be included in the Bill, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Anelay, said. The crucial area is the powers that the custody officer
has&#151;some of us have visited police cells. The custody officer
makes an important judgment balancing what the constable says with the
rights of the individual. It is a very difficult decision in many
circumstances, and he does not necessarily follow everything police
officers say. In this instance it is important that that element is
specified in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06070463000048"></a><b><a name="06070463000320"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I understand the concerns of

However, there is a difficulty because training in all areas is
important. We have just spoken about training in <I>Every Child

available at the end of this month and will form part of the training
of officers and CSOs. From time to time there will be additional
issues, each of which will need training, have their own merit and
therefore will have to be undertaken. I am sure that the noble Baroness
would not suggest that we list in a schedule every single element of a
police officer&#146;s training. If we did, we would probably have the
Centrex introductory list, and we would have everything&#151;all of
which is important, all of which Ministers will say is essential, and
all of which has to have priority.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_188"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070463000049"></a>Chief officers are
required to ensure that their officers and staff are suitably trained,
competent and able to carry out the range of tasks required. Not just
training but guidance will help officers know how to discharge that
duty. In the same way, we had interesting discussions about the sort of
training that officers should have to issue fixed-penalty notices,
cautions and such matters. Guidance and training in these areas are
absolutely necessary and I wholeheartedly support that sentiment, but I
do not think it would be necessary or right to specifically create a
statutory provision for a single area of training nor do I think that
street bail would be the only aspect to which such a provision would
relate if we were to do so. Attaching conditions is not the exclusive
domain of street bail; the noble Baroness is right to say that the
station sergeant quite often does that.</p><p><a name="06070463000050"></a>We are left in an interesting situation

when it is safe and in the interests of justice for it to be undertaken
as regards both the potential victim and the offender. We certainly see
the merit of that.</p><p><a name="06070463000051"></a>If we were
to take the provision further, we would have to ask who would give the
direction. Would it be the chief constable, the BCU commander or the
officer&#146;s immediate line manager, and what would happen if such
an officer were not immediately available? There is no provision in the
Bill to provide a power to detain in order to await the attendance of a
trained officer in command. We would hope that all officers who were
able, and asked, to discharge this duty would have the appropriate
training.</p><p><a name="06070463000052"></a>The aim of street
bail is to minimise the time that an officer spends dealing with a
situation on the street and, importantly, to limit the period that a
person has to be detained by the police. I hope that the noble Baroness
and the noble Lord will be reassured by that and by the fact that we
very much understand their concerns about getting the conditions right.
I have indicated that we do not propose to have tagging or matters of
that sort, which would put us into a slightly different league, but, as
the noble Baroness rightly said, asking someone to attend, to live at
an address and not to commit further offences in the interim all fall
within the Bail Act. I respectfully suggest that it is reasonable to
expect anyone given bail to comply with those minimum conditions so
that we know where to find them if they do not happen to honour their
duty and turn up.</p><p><a name="06070463000053"></a><b><a name="06070463000321"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I am grateful to the
Minister. As I said originally, we do not oppose the idea of street
bail, but I think that we make a step-change when we apply conditions
to bail. I recall my time as a magistrate&#151;it now seems a distant
memory&#151;when one considered whether bail should be granted. Of
course, the circumstance was different but the same kind of
constructive approach still has to be taken when one considers the
safety of the public&#151;and the safety of the individual being
bailed, because any breach of bail conditions can have significant
consequences for that person.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_189"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070463000054"></a>I assure the noble
Baroness that I do not want the Centrex list of when certain training
should or should not be given. However, there are moves in the Bill to
take us forward to an unknown and untried area which could cause
difficulties, and this is one such move. The noble Baroness very
properly puts on the record that the Government do not intend one of
the conditions to be electronic tagging. But we are left with the
practicality of the officer on the beat, and we all want him to be able
to do his job effectively, dealing with a person and moving on. But
when he goes through the decision-making process, presumably he has to
try to deal fairly with a number of people. That decision is highly
complex, involving a judgment of the precise conditions.</p><p><a name="06070463000055"></a>In that respect, and only because I have
concerns about the whole issue of conditions on street bail and how
they may be applied proportionately in these circumstances, I will,
unusually on these matters, seek to press the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070463000056"></a><b><a name="06070463000322"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> Before the
noble Baroness does that, I should like to understand better why she
would do so. The whole point of making street bail possible with
conditions attached is that the officer is likely to be risk-averse. If
there were a question of either the safety of the individual or the
safety of the public, it would be appropriate not to grant bail on the
street but to remove the individual to the police station and to carry
out an assessment there. Street bail should properly be restricted to
cases where it can be delivered safely, speedily and efficaciously
without the risk of it being improper. It is a risk-averse process,
which will be assisted with training and guidance. I ask the noble
Baroness to think very seriously about taking the opinion of the
Committee on this matter. She is of course absolutely free to do so but
it would be unusually perverse of her in view of her good sense, which
normally prevails in such circumstances.</p><p><a name="06070463000057"></a><b><a name="06070463000323"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> My good sense is going to
remain and I will need to press the matter. I entirely agree with the
noble Baroness&#146;s intervention. The whole point is that the
officer must indeed be able to make a risk-averse decision for his own
safety and that of the public, but he also needs to be confident about
making the decision to impose the conditions where that is the right
thing to do.</p><p><a name="06070463000058"></a>This will be one
of a rolling number of amendments on which we shall need to express our
concerns, although not necessarily by pressing them to a Division.
However, this is not a matter to which I intend to return and I wish to
resolve it. The noble Baroness has done her own Benches a great service
by giving the Whips a little time in which to page people to ensure
they are in position and not caused too much discomfort by having their
meals interrupted. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the
Committee.</p><h5><a name="06070463000086"></a>6.55

hours from the time at which he was released on
bail.&#148;&#148; <p><a name="06070463000065"></a>The
noble Lord said: Our amendment would restrict the maximum duration of
conditions on street bail. It specifies that a condition will expire
either three days after the person was released or when he attends a
police station, whichever is earlier. We do not object to the use of
street bail, which has existed since January 2004. It can be beneficial
for both the police and the suspect. We do not wish to see people taken
to a police station at times that are inconvenient for them or the
police. Neither would the amendment stop conditions being imposed on
street
bail.</p><p><a name="06070463000066"></a>The
Joint Committee on Human Rights concluded that these provisions would
not give rise to a significant risk of incompatibility with the rights
in the Human Rights Act 1998, in the light of the legal right of
the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suspect to apply to have bail conditions varied. Regardless of whether a
convention right would be violated, as a matter of strict legal
interpretation, we consider the power to impose a condition of an
unlimited duration to be unacceptable and to give rise to a serious
risk of abuse, for a number of reasons.</p><p><a name="06070463000067"></a>First, the conditions attached to street
bail could severely restrict an individual&#146;s liberty, including
curfews, tagging or restrictions on who they can speak to or meet. As
street bail is likely to be used in relatively minor cases, it would be
disproportionate to impose these kinds of restrictions for lengthy
periods. The conditions themselves could have a more severe impact on
the suspect than any sentence imposed for the minor offence. Secondly,
there is a risk that these conditions could be used in lieu of a
criminal charge and prosecution. If reasonable time limits were
imposed, it would remove that risk, requiring the police to investigate
the case as quickly as possible and to decide whether to charge the
suspect.</p><p><a name="06070463000068"></a>The suspect may not
appreciate the right to appeal against the condition. If they did
understand their rights, they may feel unable to initiate such an
appeal for fear that it would jeopardise their case. Including a time
limit in the Bill would ensure that the suspect attends a police
station, where they will receive legal advice and the quasi-independent
involvement of the custody
officer.</p><p><a name="06070463000069"></a>These concerns were
raised in the Commons but the Minister failed to provide satisfactory
answers to them. Indeed, she accepted them,
saying:</p><ul><a name="06070463000081"></a>It is
clearly important for our police service to be able to get cases moving
along as quickly as possible, and to make sure that cases are referred
to the Crown Prosecution Service and that charging decisions are made
as quickly as possible&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons
Standing Committee D, 21/3/06; col.
138.]</ul><p><a name="06070463000070"></a>It is precisely for these
reasons that we believe that time limits are needed: to ensure that
there is an incentive for the police to investigate crimes as quickly
as possible, and to decide whether to charge a suspect. The Minister
also suggested that the Home Office circular on street bail would
provide safeguards. In reality, the circular illustrates the risk that
the conditions will be used as long-lasting measures if reasonable time
limits are not imposed in legislation. The circular poses the
question:</p><ul><a name="06070463000082"></a>&#147;What length
of time should a period of street bail cover?&#148;</ul><a name="06070463000072"></a>It provides the following
response: <ul><a name="06070463000083"></a>&#147;As long as
is necessary to carry out investigations but we would not anticipate
any period longer than six weeks and, in most cases, much
sooner&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070463000071"></a>Those are our
concerns. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070479000001"></a><b><a name="06070479000044"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I shall speak to Amendment
No. 87, which is a probing amendment grouped with Amendment No. 86 that
would impose a generous time limit of four weeks on all pre-charge bail
from a police station. We are simply suggesting that that is more than
enough time for the police to carry out investigations and ascertain
whether there is enough evidence to charge a suspect. In moving his
amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, referred to some of the
issues that have to be taken into account when we have pre-charge bail
conditions.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_193"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070479000002"></a>Charging is a significant stage in the
criminal justice process, and it is only at that stage that the police
need to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute. The
power to impose restrictions on a person's freedom, whether as a
condition of bail or detention in police custody before that evidential
hurdle has been reached, must be limited. It is important that suspects
should know the nature of the case against them and that they will
ultimately appear before a court. The Magistrates&#146; Association
stressed the importance of a safeguard as it applies to post-charge
bail, pointing out
that:</p><ul><a name="06070479000039"></a>&#147;Magistrates
consider bail conditions very carefully in court and require as much
information as
possible&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070479000003"></a>We are trying
to attach a reasonable period, and within the context of 28 days. In
the context of the terrorism Bill of 2005, Parliament rejected
arguments for more than 28 days&#151;the number should be burned in
my brain. Indeed, tomorrow the relevant statutory instrument will put
that 28-day limit into effect. Parliament rejected arguments for more
than 28 days&#146; pre-charge detention in terrorist cases. If more
than 28 days&#146; detention is not justified in terrorist cases, we
do not see why more than 28 days&#146; pre-charge conditional bail
would be needed to enable the police to investigate a non-terrorist
case to determine whether a suspect should continue to have those
conditions applied.</p><p><a name="06070479000004"></a>I note that
when the then Minister&#151;Hazel Blears&#151;in another place
responded, she said
that,</p><ul><a name="06070479000041"></a>&#147;street bail
should be for as short a time as possible, and states that
we&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06070479000037"></a>the
Government&#151;<ul><a name="06070479000042"></a>&#147;should
look to a maximum of four to six weeks&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee D, 21/03/06; col.
140.]</ul><a name="06070479000038"></a>We therefore think
that our amendment fits in rather nicely with the Government&#146;s
intentions and hope that it would be adequate time to satisfy the
Minister.<p><a name="06070479000005"></a><b><a name="06070479000045"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I would be delighted to be
satisfied by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, but I regret that on this
occasion I cannot accept her offer. Neither can I be seduced into
accepting the offer made by the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia.</p><p><a name="06070479000006"></a>Amendments Nos. 86 and
87 both relate to time limits. Bail in the context of street bail and
pre-charge bail is used respectively to prevent the need to bring a
person immediately into custody or to enable the release of a suspect
from custody while allowing the police to continue with their
investigation.</p><p><a name="06070479000007"></a>Attaching
conditions is about raising the ability and confidence of the police to
release people from custody for a period sufficient to enable the
necessary further inquiries to be completed. I appreciate that the
amendments reflect your Lordships&#146; rightful concern that bail
conditions issued by the police rather than court may be seen as an
arbitrary use of
powers.</p><p><a name="06070479000008"></a>That
is why, in the case of street bail, we have made provisions which allow
a person the right of appeal to a custody officer in the first instance
and then to a magistrate. In the case of pre-charge bail, the person is
entitled to appeal to the magistrate. That right will be made clear to
the person at the time at which the bail is 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>granted and conditions imposed, and a written notice of these rights
will also be provided. The police focus must be on progressing cases
and determining whether there is sufficient evidence to refer matters
to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision.</p><p><a name="06070479000009"></a>The application of conditions must be
proportionate and stand up to scrutiny. The period for which conditions
apply must be relevant to the progress of the investigation. I can see
little benefit in applying an arbitrary time limit to the lifetime of
bail conditions, although I understand and endorse what my right
honourable friend said in the other place in relation to the normal
expectation, which might be for that time, but we want to do things as
expeditiously as possible and not bring people back unnecessarily early
if that would be for no good purpose. We would simply have to bail them
again to a time when the investigation was
complete.</p><p><a name="06070479000010"></a>I
respectfully say to both the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, that it would be preferable if the officer had
discretion to enable a person to be released on bail either with or
without conditions rather than holding the person in custody when they
can quite safely be released. Placing an imposed time would in effect
result in the officer having suspects return to or enter custody at a
time when there may be no real prospect of the investigation being
proceeded with sufficiently, or when the decision can be made on
whether or not to proceed.</p>

<h5><a name="06070479000043"></a>7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06070479000011"></a>The point is, if one likes,
to reverse the current burden where people are overcautious and
therefore engage the individual in the court process when that is not
absolutely necessary. We have to be balanced in our approach and ensure
that those who go through the process are people who are identified as
properly needing to be there. That will give greater confidence to
people that proportionality is appropriate. As I said in relation to
the other amendment, in cases where there is ambiguity or things are on
the cusp, we can anticipate that the police will revert to type. We are
all recidivists; we go back to the safe position, and the safe position
is not to grant
bail.</p><p><a name="06070479000012"></a>Home
Office circular 61/2003 sets a maximum period of six weeks for
answering bail, save in exceptional circumstances. We consider that
retaining that operational flexibility will benefit both the
investigators and avoid bringing people back unnecessarily. I am very
grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s indication that the amendment
is merely
probing.</p><p><a name="06070479000013"></a><b><a name="06070479000046"></a>Lord

88:</p><ul><a name="06070479000040"></a>Page 5, line 5,
at end insert &#147;for no more than three
hours&#148;</ul><p><a name="06070479000019"></a>The noble Lord said:
This is another amendment that was brought to our attention by Liberty.
It would prevent people being detained for more than three hours
pending a decision by the CPS on whether to
charge.</p><p><a name="06070479000020"></a>On Report in the
Commons, the Government added Clause 9. It expressly allows the police
to detain a suspect pending a decision by the CPS on the appropriate
charge. The only time limit that would apply to the power is the normal
time limit for detention pre-charge, designed to enable the police to
detain a suspect to secure or preserve evidence relating to the offence
for which he was arrested, or to obtain such evidence by
questioning.</p><p><a name="06070479000021"></a>These purposes are not
appropriate after a custody officer has decided that there is
sufficient evidence to charge the person and has referred the case to
the CPS for this purpose. The evidence relating to the offence would
already have been secured and the witness already interviewed. The only
purpose for detention in this context is to ensure that the person who
would be detained post-charge does not need to be released while the
CPS is making a charging
decision.</p><p><a name="06070479000022"></a>We
agree that it is sensible to clarify that a person can be detained for
these purposes. We would not wish to see those suspected of serious
offences released pending a decision by the CPS because of a possible
loophole in the law. However, a time limit is needed so that this power
is not used to keep people in custody for longer than necessary. It is
also needed to ensure that a person is not kept in detention because of
the failure of the CPS to make a charging decision as soon as possible.
Three hours may not seem a very long time but, in the Commons, the
Minister suggested that the power should not be used when the officer
thought that the CPS would take more than three hours to reach a
decision. Referring a case to the CPS will frequently involve little
more than a telephone call to the duty prosecutor or the out-of-hours
duty prosecutor service, which is designed to ensure a 24-hour
service.</p><p><a name="06070479000023"></a>There is understandable
concern that the police should not be required to release someone who
they consider to be a danger simply because the CPS has failed to
provide a charging decision within three hours. To deal with that,
there is already an emergency power for a custody officer to charge a
person in cases that would normally be determined by the CPS. That
applies where the officer is unable to consult the CPS, a time limit is
about to expire, and if the suspect were not charged it would require
his release in circumstances where that would not be appropriate. If
the specified time limit elapses, a person can also be released on
conditional pre-charge bail.</p><p><a name="06070479000024"></a>The
need for this safeguard was accepted by the Minister in the Commons,
Liam Byrne MP. He also acknowledged that the power should not be used
if a decision were expected to take more than three hours. However, he
suggested that the safeguard should be included in guidance rather than
in the Bill. When 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_196"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>something as fundamental as individual liberty is at stake, it is
unsatisfactory to leave safeguards to non-statutory guidance. As in the
case of conditional pre-charge and street bail, strict time limits must
be included in the Bill. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070479000025"></a><b><a name="06070479000048"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I understand the noble
Lord&#146;s concern, and he is right to say that three hours was the
time limit referred to by my honourable friend in the other place. The
only difference between us is whether the limit should be on a
statutory basis or in guidance, and I shall explain why. The noble Lord
will know that, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, a custody
officer is required to charge a person if there is sufficient evidence
to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence, or to
refer that person to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration
under the statutory charging
process.</p><p><a name="06070479000026"></a>A sensible reading of
PACE allows detention for a relatively short and reasonable time, for
the purpose of referral to the CPS for a quick charging decision to be
made. However, as the noble Lord knows, PACE is not explicit in
providing for that detention, and we introduced a government amendment
on Report in another place to provide that clarification. We could have
left the position as it was, but we did not think it
right.</p><p><a name="06070479000027"></a>We then indicated that
guidance would be issued making it clear that such a period of
detention awaiting a decision from the detention officer would be for a
maximum of three hours. We remain of the view that guidance is the most
appropriate vehicle for dealing with this issue. There may be occasions
when the decision takes, say, 10 or 15 minutes more than three hours.
If the matter is laid down in legislation, the person would have to be
released prior to the expiry of the three-hour period, bailed and asked
to return at a later date. That is bureaucratic and benefits neither
the police nor, for that matter, the suspect. I am sure the noble Lord
will be familiar with circumstances when that has
happened.</p><p><a name="06070479000028"></a>The basis of the
guidance and the three-hour suggested maximum is to require the custody
officer and the prosecutor to consider at the very earliest stages the
likelihood of a decision being reached within that period. If a
decision is not thought likely, the presumption must be to bail that
person at that time and not wait until the three-hour period has been
reached.</p><p><a name="06070479000029"></a>The guidance will make
it clear that this is not simply a means to keep a person in police
detention and that suitability for bail is to be given first
consideration. It will also place a requirement on the custody officer
to provide the reasons for any period of detention in which bail was
considered suitable but for which the person was detained for up to
three hours to await a decision, and for those cases in which a
decision was not reached within that period and the person was detained
further or granted bail.</p><p><a name="06070479000030"></a>Setting a statutory
time limit has its attractions, but as we are seeking to ensure that
suspects are dealt with quicker and more effectively, we see merit in
providing a degree of flexibility and allowing an element of discretion
on the part of the custody officer when it is of benefit to the
detained person. The way we see it is 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that if it is going to mean that we see a person more quickly, we should
let him go and require him to come back at an appropriate time. That
must be to everyone&#146;s benefit, and we do not want to be
unnecessarily bureaucratic when an extra five minutes may mean that the
person can be charged, bailed and dealt with without having to come
back again. Although I understand why the noble Lord has brought this
matter back for us to debate, I invite him to withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070479000031"></a><b><a name="06070479000049"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b>I thank the Minister,
but the difference is that custody officers still have powers to take a

Dixon-Smith</b> rose to move, That an humble Address
be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid before
the House on 23 May, be annulled (S.I.
2006/1380).</p><p><a name="06070487000004"></a>The noble Lord said:
My Lords, in rising to move this Motion for an humble Address, I hope
that the Minister will be able to resolve my concerns over certain
parts of these regulations. We accept the need for proper control of
contaminated land and the necessity of preventing water pollution, if
at all possible. That said, there are one or two matters about the way
in which these regulations are drafted that require
clarification.</p><p><a name="06070487000005"></a>I shall first
raise two relatively small matters about the drafting. On page 1, there
is a list of the sections of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and
the Contaminated Land (Enabling Powers) (England) Regulations 2005 that
authorise the contents of the regulations. That is completely
understood and is a normal and helpful clarification. My problem
relates to paragraphs 4(1)(i) and 4(1)(j) on page 4 that state that
guidance is issued under Section 76(F) and Section 78(F), which are not
mentioned at the start of the regulations. It may be that that is not
necessary because of the context, but I ask the Minister for an
assurance that there is no problem with that.</p><p><a name="06070487000006"></a>The second drafting
question arises in Regulation 5 on page 5&#151;it is interesting how
the numbers run together in this. Paragraph (2)
reads:</p><ul><a name="06070487000105"></a>&#147;Where it appears
to the enforcing authority that the contaminated land in question is in
such a condition by reason of substances in, on or under it that there
is imminent danger of 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serious harm or serious pollution of controlled waters being caused, the
enforcing authority must send any copies of the notice pursuant to
paragraph (1) as soon as practicable after service of the
notice&#148;</ul><a name="06070487000103"></a>My view is
that that is tautology. If that is not written into the Act, I would be
very surprised. It does not really matter whether it is
there&#151;that may be a peccadillo, but it seems very peculiar to me
that that should be written in the regulations when I would have
thought that, in these circumstances, it was absolutely standard
procedure and did not require to be stated in the
regulations.<p><a name="06070487000007"></a>The questions of
substance that I want to raise are, of course, more serious. On page 2,
in Regulation 2, we are dealing with land that is required to be
designated as a special site. Sub-paragraph (l) deals with land that is
adjoining or adjacent to land which is contaminated land by substances
which appear to have escaped from designated land. As far as it goes,
that is absolutely fine and I can understand the problem. The real
question is: how far does &#147;adjacent&#148; go? In Essex, about
five years ago, we had rainfall that was a one in 800-year event, as
described by our local people responsible for rivers, river basins and
flooding. The consequence of that was&#151;I merely mention it as a
statement of how severe it was&#151;that six inches of water fell in
three hours and buildings were flooded that had never been flooded in
the500 years since they were
built.</p><p><a name="06070487000008"></a>That is the case. It has
nothing to do with the issue here, but the issue here is that if you
get that sort of precipitation on a contaminated site, it is almost
certain to leach out of the contaminated site, properly designated,
into the adjacent area. Then the question is: how far can the
designation be extended, bearing in mind that the pollution is likely
to be relatively slight and possibly temporary? I know that it was an
extreme event that brought this to my mind&#151;it is difficult when
you consider extreme events, but extreme events happen. Regrettably,
pollution is a movable commodity in particular circumstances,
especially if it is soluble. So there is a question there. If the
Minister could give me some reassurance that any extension of the
contamination designation would be temporary, on the basis that the
pollution would be likely to be temporary and that the designation
would last only as long as the pollution could be identified, that
would help.</p><p><a name="06070487000009"></a>On page 3,
Regulation 3 deals with the pollution of controlled waters.
Sub-paragraph (a) deals with waters being used for human consumption
and refers to where they are affected by the land and, as a result,
require a treatment process or a change in the treatment process. My
concern is whether that argument could be used as an argument against
nitrate run-off from agricultural land, which would of course have
profound implications, which the Minister will understand as rapidly as
I do.</p><p><a name="06070487000010"></a>The difficulty is that
concentrations of nitrates above a certain level are properly required
to be removed from the water before it is supplied to the mains system.
The question then is: because that requires a particular process, could
the argument be reversed so that it is said that because of the 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_199"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particular processes required, the land should therefore be designated
as contaminated?</p><p><a name="06070487000011"></a>I hope that the Minister will tell me
that there is absolutely no intention that that could possibly be the
case or that the argument could possibly be turned around in the way
that I suggested. Given the present state of agriculture, a farmer
faced with such a proposition would be on a very quick road to ruin. I
look forward to the Minister's reply and hope thathe will give
me the assurance that I seek. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070487000012"></a>Moved, That an humble
Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid
before the House on 23 May, be annulled (S.I.

Dixon-Smith</I>.)</p><p><a name="06070487000013"></a><b><a name="06070487000126"></a>Baroness
Maddock:</b> My Lords, the House will no doubt be
pleased that I shall be brief. I first came across the regulations as a
member of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. As they passed
through our committee, we saw no problem with them. As I understand it,
they consolidate several sets of regulations. One of the things the
committee has said is that we want more of that because one of our big
worries about regulations such as these&#151;in a sense, the noble
Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has highlighted this point&#151;is the
ability of people outside this place to understand exactly how they
work and what they are about. The process of consolidation is an
attempt to help that.</p><p><a name="06070487000014"></a>As I
understand it, the regulations make provision for an additional
description of contaminated land that is required to be designated as a
special site&#151;land that is contaminated as a result of
radioactivity in, on or under the land. I also understand that they
extend Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and that it has
been a long-standing ministerial commitment to extend that part of the
Act to apply it to land contaminated by radioactive substances. I also
understand that part of the provision is to comply with obligations
under directives from the European Union. We on these Benches accept
what the Government are trying to do. I understand that the changes in
respect of radioactivity do not alter the way in which Part 2A
currently works for non-radioactive
contamination.</p><p><a name="06070487000015"></a>I know from
studying the regulations as a member of the Merits of Statutory
Instruments Committee that consultation was carried out with local
authorities, environmental regulators, industry and many other
stakeholders, including radiological specialists and environmental
groups. We accept that they felt that this was the right way to
go&#151;notwithstanding the fact that the noble Lord, Lord
Dixon-Smith, has also considered the matter in great detail. As I said,
it is often difficult to get to grips with the legal language and
exactly how the regulations will work.</p><p><a name="06070487000016"></a>Although I am not an expert on legal
matters, we have a lot of rather good legal brains on the Merits of
Statutory Instruments Committee. In this instance, they were not able
to point out to us any great

what the Minister has to
say.</p><p><a name="06070487000017"></a><b><a name="06070487000127"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Lord Rooker):</b> My Lords, I am
pleased to confirm that all the understandings of the noble Baroness,
Lady Maddock, are correct. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked
about the list at the beginning of the order. It sets out the powers of
the Secretary of State to make regulations in the exercise of the
powers conferred upon him by all those sections. The fact that
Regulation (1)(i) refers to Section 78F (6) is not relevant because
that is a reference to a section in an Act. It is not the provision
that gives the power to make the regulations. The power to make the
regulations comes from that other list, but it does not mean to say
that the regulations will not refer to other sections in Acts of
Parliament. I think that I have that correct; if I have not, I shall be
corrected.</p><p><a name="06070487000018"></a>I hope to address
the noble Lord&#146;s concerns. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock,
made a far more succinct speech on the regulations than the one I have
in front of me. As she said, the regulations honour a long-standing
government commitment with regard to land contaminated as a result of
radioactivity and bring the law into line with what we are required to
do. To the best of my knowledge they have been fully consulted on and
there is nothing controversial about them. But, nevertheless, that is
what this place is for&#151;to scrutinise the
Government.</p><p><a name="06070487000019"></a>This
is one of a series of regulations dealing with the extension to
radioactivity of Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
These particular regulations deal essentially with procedural matters.
They do not affect the scope of the contaminated land regime in terms
of the seriousness of harm or pollution which is covered, nor do they
affect the remedies or the liability of individuals. The regulations
are substantively the same as those originally made in 2000 when Part
2A was brought into effect, with a limited number of changes. The
clarifications being sought relate to the features of the regulations
unchanged from 2000.</p><p><a name="06070487000020"></a>We are not
opposed to these regulations or the&#151;I am sorry, my note does not
make sense and I will not read it. That is my
fault.</p><p><a name="06070487000021"></a>However,
to clarify the specific points, the noble Lord has had discussions with
officials and has told us of his concerns in relation to Regulations 2,
3, 4 and 5. Regulation 2 provides descriptions of land which, if and
when they are found to be contaminated land as defined in the Act, are
to be regarded as &#147;special sites&#148;. The approach of the
Act is that it is always the local authority&#146;s job to identify
and formally determine the land as contaminated land. If, in addition,
the land meets a description in Regulation 2, then it must designate it
as a &#147;special site&#148;. This simply means that it becomes
the job then of the Environment Agency rather than the local authority
to take the subsequent steps of enforcement, which are, notably,
identifying who is to pay for remedial work and ensuring that it is
undertaken.</p><p><a name="06070487000022"></a>There
may be special sites where the condition of the land is also leading to
adjoining or adjacent land being contaminated by substances migrating
or escaping 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the special site. Regulation 2(1)(l) simply ensures that these
problems are also handled by the Environment Agency, rather than being
regarded as a separate case to be handled by the local authority,
which, of course, may have other priorities or views. This is simply a
matter of good administration and ensuring that there is only one
regulator at work enforcing in such cases&#151;namely, the
Environment Agency&#151;rather than two. It does not bring with it
any differences in, for example, who might be liable for remedial work
or the remedial standards which would apply.</p><p><a name="06070487000023"></a>This mirrors what will happen in any
other case under Part 2A where the condition of one piece of land leads
to substances leaching or migrating onto another piece of land and
causing a problem. Here, too, the approach is to regard this as a
single case to be addressed because, of course, land contamination does
not respect property boundaries and action may need to be taken in
respect of both locations. The term &#147;adjoining or
adjacent&#148; is not defined, so the words will carry their normal
dictionary meanings. Of course, if a row occurs about that, it will be
a matter for the scientists to go before my learned friends and explain
matters.</p><p><a name="06070487000024"></a>Regulation 3 sets out
the special site descriptions in respect of contaminated land which is
causing pollution of controlled waters. The effect is to provide which
&#147;contaminated land&#148; cases, once found, are then taken
over and enforced by the Environment Agency rather than by the local
authority. In the case, for example, of chemicals such as nitrates used
on a farm, if these escape from the soil and into ground waters, or
into surface waters, then it has long been the case that this may
amount to &#147;pollution of controlled waters&#148;. The
regulations here do not change that
situation.</p><p><a name="06070487000025"></a>In
some of these pollution cases the Environment Agency is better placed
to enforce under Part 2A than the local authority. Regulation 3
provides the description of such cases. Broadly, these include cases
where a source of drinking water supply is affected so badly that the
test of wholesomeness of supply can no longer be met; where a statutory
environmental quality standard can no longer be met; or where a
classified dangerous substance is getting into a strategically
important aquifer.</p><p><a name="06070487000026"></a>The
Government intend to limit the scope of the Part 2A regime in future so
that it would not apply to a case of trivial pollution of controlled
waters but only to pollution which is &#147;significant&#148;. Work
on this is proceeding and there will be a public consultation on
detailed proposals in due
course.</p><p><a name="06070487000027"></a>Regulation
4 sets out the matters which are to be included in a remedial notice,
in addition to those matters set out in the Act itself, in more general
terms. The power to prescribe the additional content is provided by
Section 78E(6), and this power is cited on the front of the
regulations. The power of the local authority to treat someone as not
being an appropriate person to bear the cost of something by way of a
remedial action, in certain circumstances, derives from Section 78F(6).
This is the reason that Section 78F(6) did not need to be cited as a
power on the face of the regulations. 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I knew that I had read it somewhere, and I worked it out as the noble
Lord was
speaking.</p><p><a name="06070487000028"></a>This
is because the regulations are merely concerned with what has to be
shown in a remediation notice in order for the recipient to know what
he is required to do and on what basis. The content of a notice simply
reflects the outcome of the allocation of liability, which is governed
by the primary legislation and its related statutory guidance, not by
the regulations.</p><p><a name="06070487000029"></a>The final
regulation questioned by the noble Lord, Regulation 5, concerns the
sending of copies of a remediation notice to people additional to the
&#147;appropriate persons&#148; upon whom notices are formally
served under the Act. The additional copies are provided for
information purposes. In the cases where a remediation notice is served
in respect of imminent danger, there is a requirement that the
additional copies are sent as soon as practicable after service of the
notice itself on the appropriate persons.
</p><p><a name="06070487000030"></a>It would have been possible to
deal with the service of these additional copies in the Act, but,
generally, the approach taken is that matters of a procedural
nature&#151;which is what I have said these regulations
are&#151;are often elaborated in regulations under the Act rather
than in the primary legislation itself. This appears to have been the
approach adopted here in 1995 when the Environment Act was first
enacted.</p><p><a name="06070487000031"></a>I hope I have answered
the noble Lord&#146;s points and that it will be quite useful for
people who are subject to these regulations to have this explanation on
the record in
<I>Hansard</I>.</p><p><a name="06070487000032"></a><b><a name="06070487000128"></a>Lord
Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, the Minister has been most
helpful. The concern, of course, was immediately for the people who are
adjacent to sites of this nature and, therefore, might be caught. The
Minister said that nothing in these regulations changes the position
that existed in law before they were promulgated; nor, indeed, do they
change anything. That is the reassurance that I was seeking and I am
most grateful to him for
that.</p><p><a name="06070487000033"></a>As to his remarks on the
additional notices, I hear what the Minister says. But if we have to
put into regulations what should be an automatic and standard procedure
anyway, I find that slightly touching but also slightly peculiar and,

(a) for the area to be sealed off; and
(b) for the searching for firearms of any people or
vehicles in that area, by whatever means he considers
appropriate.&#148;<p><a name="06070487000042"></a>The
noble Lord said: This is the third occasion on which I have tabled an
amendment to give greater and clearer powers to the police to fight gun
crime, and it may not be the last. Fortunately, the Home Office brings
forward so many new Bills that there is no problem finding an
appropriate legislative slot. This Bill is particularly appropriate for
my amendment for a new clause, to be inserted after Clause 10, to
empower the police to seal off an area and search people for illegal
guns.</p><p><a name="06070487000043"></a>I make
no apology for my persistence because, as the situation develops, the
case for deterring and preventing gun crime becomes more urgent. Not
only is the murder rate in England and Wales increasing dramatically,
by over 30 per cent in the past 10 years&#151;that compares with an
increase in the total population over the same period of only 2 per
cent&#151;but in 2004-05, the latest year for which figures are
available, 77 murders were committed with guns, which is 12 per cent
more than in the previous year. Nearly one in 10 murders is classified
as killing by shooting.</p><p><a name="06070487000044"></a>I also
remind the Committee, and the Government, that during the same 10 years
the number of offences involving firearms rose from 13,000 to 23,000,
an increase of 77 per cent. Of course, much worse than the number of
shootings actually committed&#151;many of which are the result of
gang warfare that is often linked to drugs&#151;is the fear that the
spreading gun culture engenders among the general population. In
certain areas of Britain, there is a widespread belief, whether
justified or not, that guns are routinely carried on our streets. In my
view, the Government have an obligation to which they should attach the
highest priority to reduce, indeed to minimise, such
fear.</p><p><a name="06070487000045"></a>There can be no more
corrosive influence on the quality of life, for rich or poor, young or
old, male or female, black or white, than fear for personal safety.
Many years ago, in quite another context, President Roosevelt tried to
encourage the American people with his famous
exhortation,</p><ul><a name="06070487000120"></a>&#147;the only
thing we have to fear is fear itself&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="06070487000122"></a>8.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06070487000046"></a>The risk of
carrying a gun must be made unacceptably high. Fortunately, the remedy
is simple and cheap. I refer of course to metal detectors. Most of the
population are fully familiar with metal detectors from their everyday
lives, particularly at the entrances to many buildings and before
boarding all flights. Who of us, however foolish, would presume to
attempt to pass through security at an airport carrying a gun? Not only
is the hand-held metal detector rapid to use, but it does not involve
touching the persons of those subject to the check&#151;that is 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important. It is a great deal easier to search people for guns than it
is for drugs. The police are already familiar with the use of such
detectors.</p><p><a name="06070487000047"></a>My amendment would
allow the police to seal off any area and check for those who are
illegally carrying guns. They could use the power as and when they
thought proper. I am well aware that there are concerns, fuelled by
recent events&#151;particularly perhaps at Forest Gate on 2
June&#151;about the judgment of the police in using their existing
anti-terrorist powers and the adverse consequences that there can be
for race relations if these powers are not used sensibly and
sensitively. I recognise that the power that I propose could, if used
inappropriately, result in problems of that sort. I believe that the
police understand these dangers and learn from every unfortunate
accident. If, however, the drafting of my amendment could be improved
to reduce further that risk, without affecting the purpose of the
powers that I want the police to have, I would be delighted to consider
changes.</p><p><a name="06070487000048"></a>I wish to deal with two
other points. First, would the police like to have these powers?
Secondly, do we need them? When we last discussed the issue,
on22 May, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, who is sitting in his
place, quoted the noble Lord, Lord Condon, as having said in March 2002
that the view of the police service was that there was an adequate menu
of powers in relation to gun
crime.</p><p><a name="06070487000049"></a>I fear that, as so often,
the Home Office is unaware that things have moved on in the past four
years. Earlier this week, I discussed my amendment with ACPO. It
confirmed that it does indeed have powers under a number of Acts of
Parliament, but that those powers vary and have to be used in specific
circumstances. ACPO told me that it always welcomes simpler powers and
that my amendment seemed to be, and I quote their words, &#147;ideal
from our
perspective&#148;.</p><p><a name="06070487000050"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, a most experienced and respected lawyer,
got it exactly right when, speaking from the Liberal Democrat Front
Bench on 22 May, he
said:</p><ul><a name="06070487000109"></a>&#147;The considerable
merit of the amendment... is that it is a very simple statement of
powers. I have no doubt that the powers exist, but they are to be
extracted from a number of legislative
instruments&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/5/06; col.
647.]</ul><p><a name="06070487000051"></a>My amendment seeks to
reassure those of our citizens who live in fear of gun crime that the
police have the clear means to make it far more risky than it is today
for anyone to carry an illegal firearm anywhere. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070487000052"></a><b><a name="06070487000131"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has
been very consistent in his concern about this matter. I well recall
supporting some of his moves in respect of registered firearms. He is
quite right to point out that my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford
supported one of his amendments and that we voted for that amendment.
The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has tried a number of avenues to bring
attention to this very serious problem, including during discussions on
the Violent Crime Reduction Bill. I say to him and the Minister that we
support the principle behind this amendment. As the noble Lord 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rightly points out, gun crime has grown at an alarming rate in this
country, doubling since 1997. The number of crimes involving imitation
firearms has quadrupled.</p><p><a name="06070487000053"></a>The
vast majority of gun owners use them legally and responsibly. The aim
of further changes to the law must be to tackle the threat from weapons
held or used illegally. Gun crime is obviously a complex matter;
tackling it requires a holistic approach. We need intelligence-led
policing to attack the organised criminal gangs responsible for many
shootings. In order to achieve a better conviction rate, we need to
improve the protection offered to vulnerable witnesses to encourage
more people to come forward.</p><p><a name="06070487000054"></a>I
have studied this amendment carefully. While its aim is to be
commended, I have some reservations about its wording, although, as I
said, not its principle. We worry that the amendment, as currently
phrased, may be too broad. The police, quite rightly, already have the
power to stop and search people of whom they are reasonably suspicious.
However, the amendment appears to give them the ability to stop and
search anyone living near or standing beside the person of whom they
are suspicious. Given that the area that the police may seal off for
this purpose is completely undefined, this stop and search could be
extremely extensive.</p><p><a name="06070487000055"></a>Setting
all these issues aside, I believe that we need to take forward and
discuss this matter. Bearing in mind our concerns, I ask the Minister
whether she would consider it appropriate&#151;in order to tease out
some of the issues reflected in this amendment&#151;for the noble
Lord, Lord Marlesford, and a number of us who share his concerns to
discuss this matter further and to see whether the existing provisions
are appropriate. If not, is there anything else that we can do to draw
attention to the serious problem that we face in this country and
together to reach a solution on Report? To do anything at this stage
could be counterproductive. We are aware that there are laws, but I
think that we need meetings in which the situation is explained so that
we can take this issue forward. So, the support is there, but we need
far more information from the Minister. This may not be the appropriate
time to talk about these issues. I press the Minister to say how she
will respond on this matter.</p><p><a name="06070487000056"></a><b><a name="06070487000132"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I strongly support this
amendment, to which I have added my name. My noble friend Lord
Marlesford has indeed shown admirable persistence in bringing this
matter forward for debate and he is absolutely right to do so. He has
raised the matter on three previous occasions: in March 2002; in
October 2003, during discussions on the Criminal Justice Bill, which
was the first occasion on which I had the opportunity to take part in
these important debates; and, most recently, during our debate on the
Violent Crime Reduction Bill, just before the Whit
Recess.</p><p><a name="06070487000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, is right to stress that the majority of firearms are legally
held and responsibly used. None of us is trying to target legislation
at those groups. My noble friend Lord 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Marlesford was also right to point out how real the fear of gun crime
and the illegal use of guns is for people in some areas. It makes life
unpredictable and, sometimes, unbearable. Firearms used for illegal
purposes are the scourge of a generation in some areas. They are
perceived to be a great threat. Even if that is not true in all areas,
it is certainly perceived as such. Often it seems that guns are used on
our streets by criminal gangs, often those trading in drugs or
people-trafficking. They have no regard for their trading
enemies&#146; lives and little if any regard for the safety of the
public on the street. It is that by-product of their violence that we
also seek to contain.</p><p><a name="06070487000058"></a>The
considerable merit of the amendment is the simplicity of the statement
of the powers that my noble friend seeks to confer on the police. I
know that there is always a tension in legislation and that one wants
to achieve a clearly defined result by giving a simple body of
powers&#151;it gets more and more difficult to define such powers
effectively so that one does not give rise to unintended consequences.
I am aware that powers already exist that enable the police in certain
circumstances to search people, but those powers are to be extracted
from a number of legislative instruments. If the Government wish to
give a clear message about crime&#151;perhaps I should say
&#147;continue to give&#148;, because I know that they, especially
the Minister, have been trying to give that message&#151;my noble
friend&#146;s amendment would assist them to do precisely
that.</p><p><a name="06070487000059"></a>I am interested to hear
that my noble friend has been in contact with ACPO and that he has had
a positive indication from its members that they would welcome a
clarified and simpler power. I appreciate the difficulties that police
officers face in trying adequately to protect the public while at the
same time responding rapidly to violent circumstances. It is the
prevention of crime that is so important and that my noble friend is
trying to achieve by his amendment. I know that the Government in other
measures are seeking to prevent the carrying of weapons. We can see
that in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, in which they are giving
teachers greater and welcome opportunities to search pupils for bladed
weapons. I was interested to read in the press this weekend that Mr
McNulty, the Minister in another place, is minded to see whether he can
widen the provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that have
already gone through Committee stage in this House. We await his
proposals with interest.</p><p><a name="06070487000060"></a>The
Government will not find us churlish in responding to measures that
they put forward that will properly give powers of search, whether to
the police or to other responsible and appropriate bodies. It is right
that we should focus our attention on my noble friend&#146;s
amendment for its positive attributes, but I also fully respect the
view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I am grateful to hear
from him that he supports the principle behind the amendment and that
he is keen to work with my noble friend to see what can be achieved by
way of better drafting. I understand what he says with regard to his
concerns about the power appearing to be too broad. I say
&#147;appearing&#148;, because I know that my noble friend&#146;s
intention is that the power would not be too broad 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that there would not be leakage across the border of a defined
area&#151;I know that he is trying to get a carefully targeted area
in which the police can operate. I am sure that my noble friend will be
at one with the noble Lord on that
point.</p><p><a name="06070487000061"></a>Of
course it is absolutely vital that in giving any new power to the
police in sensitive times&#151;and, indeed, on any occasion&#151;we
should ensure that we do nothing to inflame sensitivities in various
communities about how they may be treated differently or
disadvantageously as opposed to other communities. There is no way that
one wants to upset community relations. On the other hand, the best
communities are well regulated, secured and protected from people who
carry weapons.</p><p><a name="06070487000062"></a>I look forward to
hearing the Minister&#146;s response, even if she is not able to
accept the amendment tonight. Given her past responses, I think that we
are going to be disappointed, but I hope that instead of full
disappointment we will receive some encouragement. I hope that we will
hear from the Minister that she wants to engage in discussions over the
summer so that we can by agreement come up with an amendment that can
go in the Bill in the autumn to achieve on Report what my noble friend
justifiably wants: the greater protection of the
public.</p><h5><a name="06070487000123"></a>8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06070487000063"></a><b><a name="06070487000133"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I immediately add my voice to
those of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Anelay, in commending the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, on his
perseverance in bringing forward this amendment, which, as others have
mentioned, he most recently tabled in the passage of the Violent Crime
Reduction Bill. This is the fourth time that we have had the enjoyment
of considering this issue. I am afraid that I am unlikely at this stage
to be able to give him very much comfort, for the reasons that my noble
friend Lord Bassam outlined when debating that
Bill.</p><p><a name="06070487000064"></a>I absolutely accept that
the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, accepts that there are provisions in
the various legislative frameworks that we have created which would
enable what he seeks to be done. Section 47 of the Firearms Act 1968
already provides a police officer with a range of enforcement powers to
tackle the issue that the noble Lord has highlighted. For example, the
following wide-ranging powers are available to the police: they can
require a firearm or ammunition to be handed over for examination; they
can search a person and detain them for the purposes of doing so; when
a vehicle is involved, they can search the vehicle and require the
person driving to control and stop; and for the purpose of exercising
these powers, a constable can enter any premises. Those powers are
generally available.</p><p><a name="06070487000065"></a>I am
grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s confirmation that we are as
one in our abhorrence of gun crime and the strenuous efforts that we
have made all round this Chamber and the other place to bring forward
provisions that will effectively bite on the scourge of gun
crime.</p><p><a name="06070487000066"></a>I do not know whether the
noble Lord may have miscalculated, but I shall correct one statement
that 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he made. He suggested that fatal deaths through gun crime had risen by
30 per cent; in fact, they have fallen by 30 per cent. In the 12 months
to December 2005, fatal shootings fell from 73 to 51, a reduction
of30 per cent. There has also been a reduction by about 3 per
cent in firearms offences, a decrease of 313. But even saying that, I
quickly assure him that we cannot be satisfied with any such decrease,
because all of us would like the figure to be nil, and so long as it is
not nil there is a great deal for us to
do.</p><p><a name="06070487000067"></a>This Government have made
that strong commitment to tackle gun crime clear by virtue of the
Violent Crime Reduction Bill, strengthening the existing
legislation&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, rightly
highlighted. I am very grateful to her for the indication that noble
Lords opposite will be supportive of and look in a sympathetic light at
provisions that we propose. I can reassure her that I understand the
form in which the sympathy normally takes place&#151;followed by a
series of Divisions on amendments in all
Bills!</p><p><a name="06070487000068"></a><b><a name="06070487000134"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> Well, I
never like to disappoint the Minister. I carefully couched the general
welcome of protection of individuals. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, who
has been handling the Bill so ably from the government
Benches&#151;from their point of view and ours too&#151;knows that
I asked about searches by teachers, as one subsection appeared to give
a general power of search. I did not receive an answer. It sounds as
though the power that Mr McNulty may outline will be a reaffirmation of
that. If the Government are going to introduce a much wider power of
search, everybody will have to look at the implications. So the
Minister is right: I welcome the objective but I look at the means to
get there very carefully, with no hostage to fortune quite yet, I
hope.</p><p><a name="06070487000069"></a><b><a name="06070487000135"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I rather feared that that
might be the case. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, was right to pinpoint
the issue with this power as one of scope. I understand what the noble
Baroness says about not wanting it to bleed into other issues. I very
much appreciate what the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, said about being
content to look at the provisions again and seek to narrow them. I
cannot give any hope in that regard, but I was very interested to hear
the results of the noble Lord&#146;s meeting with ACPO.</p><p><a name="06070487000070"></a>We appreciate the benefit of making
legislation simpler and clearer, and we welcome ACPO&#146;s views in
that respect. However, we have not received any request or indication
from ACPO that it wishes an extension of the existing powers in this
area. I should be frank in saying that, to date, we have received the
opposite impression. However, bearing in mind this new expression of
its views through the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford&#151;and we are
very conscious of recent events, and therefore the sensitivities with
which we should view this&#151;it might benefit us to have a meeting
with the noble Lord, the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, if that was felt appropriate, to explore what avenue, if any,
there is in this matter. That could not be predicated

amendment, because of the difficulties we have experienced to date in
trying to narrow this field.</p><p><a name="06070487000071"></a>One of the
difficulties we have had on all provisions&#151;and the noble
Baroness has been one of the main architects of ensuring this&#151;is
that we have a whole series of specific restraints on each exercise of
each power in each Bill, which would have to be consolidated in some
way that I cannot envisage. A discussion about those issues, however,
may be very helpful, as we may all be content thereafter that we have
done our best with our existing legislation, and if not, we can see how
we could do a little better.</p><p><a name="06070487000072"></a><b><a name="06070487000136"></a>Lord
Marlesford:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply.
I shall deal first with the figures. I did not say that murder by guns
had gone up by 30 per cent. I said that the murder rate in England and
Wales has increased by 30 per cent in the past 10 years, and that the
number of people killed in the most recent year for which figures are
available is up by 12 per cent compared to the previous year. My source
for that is a Written Answer given in the House of Commons to Mr Iain
Wright on 29 June 2006, so it is pretty recent. It is in <I>Hansard</I>
at col. 660W.</p><p><a name="06070487000073"></a><b><a name="06070487000137"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> I understand now the basis on
which the noble Lord makes his assessment. In dealing with firearms we
are looking at murder or deaths created by the use of a firearm, and
that part has fallen.</p><p><a name="06070487000074"></a>Noble
Lords will know that a very large percentage of unlawful killings, be
they murder or manslaughter, are committed by people known to the
victim. This year, for instance, we have had 100 deaths occasioned by
domestic violence, the killing by one partner of another, while the
year before there were 120. That issue is unrelated to the use of
firearms. Deaths occurring from firearms have, by the grace of God,
gone down by 30 per cent.</p><p><a name="06070487000075"></a><b><a name="06070487000138"></a>Lord

instrument&#148;, &#147;Hitting, kicking, etc.&#148; and
&#147;Strangulation&#148;&#151;there is a category for shootings.
The figure for 2003-04 was 69, and for 2004-05 it is 77. I am just
reading from <I>Hansard</I>, it is as simple as that. The overall
figure of 30 per cent is the difference between the 632 in 1994 and the
820 in 2004-05. These are the Home Office&#146;s own
figures.</p><p><a name="06070487000076"></a>I am not wholly
surprised that the Home Office is not always up to date with its own
figures. I had not planned to mention this but I will now: only last
week the Minister signed a Written Answer to me on whether foreign
prisoners who had committed offences could apply for asylum on their
release. I put that Question on 26 April, and the reply was given to me
last week&#151;nine weeks later. I could not understand it, and am
told that it had been written wrongly, which was why to my untutored
eye it was gibberish. One of the technical words used was incorrectly
written. That is so casual; one does not have great confidence in the
Home Office if it can make a silly mistake like that after nine
weeks.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_210"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070487000077"></a>The other point is on ACPO. Yesterday I
spoke to that part of ACPO responsible for firearms. All I can do is
quote what it told me: it may not have asked the Home Office for
powers. Nobody is asking the Home Office for anything at the moment
because of its internal problems. Let us not take too seriously the
judgment of the Home Office at this particular period in our
history.</p><p><a name="06070487000078"></a>I am
glad the Minister is prepared to join our discussions. I understand
that she can give no undertaking to accept an amendment. Equally we on
these Benches, and possibly the Liberal Democrat Benches too, cannot
give any undertaking not to bring forward on Report a further amendment
on which we will seek to test the opinion of the House. As is often the
case with amendments that the Home Office does not like, it will
probably attempt to reverse it when it goes back into the Commons. All
I am saying, fundamentally, is that the people of this country who live
in fear of firearms would understand and welcome a simple change to the
law that they could see as enabling the police to protect them. They
would welcome that more than a lot of shilly-shallying at the Home
Office, using its &#147;not invented here&#148; approach to
anything that anybody suggests from outside. Having said that, I will
withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06070487000079"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Ireland.&#148;<p><a name="06070487000081"></a>The
noble Baroness said: This amendment has also had a previous incarnation
earlier this year in the context of the Civil Aviation Bill. Some
people thought that this was possibly not the most appropriate vehicle
for it. There can be no doubt that the Police and Justice Bill is an
entirely appropriate vehicle, or that this amendment will fit well
within it.</p><p><a name="06070487000082"></a>It
is a simple amendment, seeking to give appropriate powers to the police
to search any aircraft at any airfield if there is suspicion that the
aircraft may be, or had been, involved in the odious practice of
extraordinary rendition. It seeks to ensure that the UK could not in
the future be in any way implicated in the practice of extraordinary or
unlawful rendition, and would reassure the public that the UK will not
condone any aspect of unlawful rendition. Given the volume of news
comments and the resulting unease about suspected UK involvement, by
adopting this amendment the Government could provide immediate public
confidence.</p><p><a name="06070487000083"></a>Clause 10 addresses
the perceived gaps in existing legislation, in particular the existing
restrictions on police powers to stop and search staff, visitors and
members of the public at airports to deter theft and smuggling. The
Bill also seeks to extend the power to question anyone in or near
restricted zones of an airport. The emphasis in the Police and Justice
Bill seems to be on confronting criminal activity. It does not enable
the police to investigate any suspected breaches of international law
governing human rights. This is a serious gap, and one which would be
addressed by the amendment we are
discussing.</p><p><a name="06070487000084"></a>Since
the amendment was first moved in December last year&#151;it was moved
again in March this year&#151;there has been much more evidence of
the practice of rendition and strong circumstantial evidence that the
UK has, wittingly or unwittingly, been complicit in the use of its
airfield facilities and airspace. I refer to the recent report of an
exhaustive inquiry by the Swiss senator, Dick Marty, the report by the
Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Terry Davis, and the most
recent Amnesty International reports on extraordinary
rendition.</p><h5><a name="06070487000124"></a>9
pm</h5><p><a name="06070487000085"></a>To
summarise this new evidence, I cite the case of Bisher al-Rawi and
Jamil el-Banna, in which the UK&#146;s involvement in their detention
in the Gambia and subsequent rendition to Guantanamo Bay was confirmed
by a series of revelations in the course of a judicial review by the
High Court of England and Wales. It appears that the UK security
services provided detailed information to the Gambian Government and
thence to the CIA, enabling the detention, torture and rendition of
those two British citizens. Amnesty International, in its report
<I>Partners in Crime</I>, <I>Europe&#146;s role in US rendition</I>,
concluded that the UK was not only 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_212"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>instrumental in the detention of those men, but complicit in their
rendition and resulting
torture.</p><p><a name="06070487000086"></a>Another
case concerns Binyam Mohammed, an Ethiopian, who was given leave to
remain in the UK, and was seized by the Pakistan authorities and
interrogated in Pakistan by both American and British
officials&#151;and then transferred to Morocco by the Americans,
where he was detained and tortured over an 18-month period. From
Morocco, he was rendered by the Americans to Afghanistan for five
months, where he was again tortured, and finally transferred to
Guantanamo Bay. The only disclosed evidence against Mr Mohammed is
statements extracted under torture. Mr Mohammed states that at every
stage of his incarceration the British were implicit in interrogation,
collusion with the Moroccan authorities and in providing detailed
information.</p><p><a name="06070487000087"></a>Those
cases stand apart from the large amount of evidence of CIA or
CIA-leased aeroplanes using UK airfield facilities over a prolonged
period. Over 200 identified CIA flights have passed through the UK over
the past five years, giving rise to reasonable suspicion that at least
some of those flights were involved in extraordinary rendition. Indeed,
on 17 March this year, the Transport Secretary of that time revealed
that six US planes alleged to be involved in extraordinary rendition
had used UK airports 73 times since 2001. Mr Terry Davis remarked in
his report
that:</p><ul><a name="06070487000118"></a>&#147;European skies
appear to be excessively open ... very few countries seem to have
adopted an adequate and effective way to monitor who and what is
transiting their airports and airspace ... existing procedures do
not provide adequate safeguards against
abuse&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06070487000088"></a>Given the
UK&#146;s obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture and
other international instruments that bind human rights provisions, it
would appear that the Government are obliged to look into those
allegations and to refute them with evidence. However, this amendment
does not ask for investigations of the past or for recriminations on
any cases, but simply seeks to set up proper arrangements to ensure
that there is no further complicity and, therefore, to provide public
confidence that we should be seen to be conforming with our
international obligations and international law. I beg to
move.</p>

Archer of Sandwell:</b> I was
unable to participate at Second Reading, and my noble friend has made
the case for this amendment so compellingly that I would not have been
moved to intervene at this stage were it not for the hope of
disentangling some of the legal disputations that arose in the course
of our debates on the Civil Aviation Bill.</p><p><a name="06070487000090"></a>Perhaps I may make it clear at the outset
that I offer no criticism of my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham. In
fact, my heart went out to him. He came prepared to discuss the flight
schedules of aircraft and found himself, at short notice, involved in
discussions about the torture convention. Nor do I complain at all
about his officials, who were plunged into unfamiliar waters and found
themselves steering between the Scylla of international comity and the
Charybdis of being accessories to torture. But today the situation is
different. The Home Office team are

noble friend on the Front Bench.</p><p><a name="06070487000091"></a>May we begin with recognising what is
common ground? I have no doubt that my noble friend is as horrified by
torture as is the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza. We all agree
that it is not a legitimate instrument for detecting and convicting
terrorists, nor indeed a very effective one. It came as a shock to me
to learn that personnel&#151;and I hope maverick personnel&#151;of
certain intelligence agencies of some Governments take a different
view.</p><p><a name="06070487000092"></a>Secondly, I hope that
there is no discord among us as to the existence of a problem. The
concern that motivated the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, to move
this amendment is not a wild fancy. The shocking instances we discussed
on the Civil Aviation Bill, and some of the cases to which she referred
a few moments ago, are well documented and I will not seek to repeat
them now.</p><p><a name="06070487000093"></a>Of course, it does
not follow that all members of American intelligence services or
security services behave in that way. Some of them I am privileged to
know, and I am sure that they would be as horrified as we are. The
difficulty may well be maintaining control over personnel operating
abroad. What is perhaps as significant as the allegations is the
reaction of the United States Government, and it gives me no pleasure
to say this. They did not say, &#147;Oh, if this has happened, then
we will take every appropriate action. We will co-operate in any
inquiry&#148;. When the Canadian Government established an inquiry
into the rendition of Maher Arar, the United States declined to
participate. In effect, they pleaded the Fifth
Amendment.</p><p><a name="06070487000094"></a>My friend and former
colleague Terry Davis, quoted a few moments ago by the noble Baroness,
Lady D&#146;Souza, said on 1 March that most of Europe appears to be
a happy hunting ground for foreign security services. We know from the
National Air Traffic Services that two aircraft which, from their
registration numbers, appear to have been chartered by the CIA have
passed through the UK some 200 times. There is a problem and it is a
matter of deep concern.</p><p><a name="06070487000095"></a>The Government&#146;s
response in the earlier stage was threefold. First, they said we would
fall foul of our obligations under international conventions. If that
were true, the sooner the conventions were renegotiated the better. But
as our debates continued, it appeared that they were under a
misapprehension. I hope that that issue has now disappeared from
discussions.</p><p><a name="06070487000096"></a>I hope that it is
accepted that any state aircraft&#151;an expression which includes
aircraft in military, customs and state service&#151;is provided
under Article 3 of the Chicago Convention as not entitled to fly over
or land on the territory of another state without authorisation. Surely
that would entail giving details of who the operators were and the
purposes of the flight. Article 3bis permits that a state which has
reasonable grounds to believe that an aircraft flying over its
territory is being used for a purpose inconsistent with the aims of the
convention may require it to land.</p><p><a name="06070487000097"></a>The Government&#146;s second objection
to the amendment was that it was unnecessary, an objection 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_214"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which my noble friend advanced a few moments ago in a different context.
It is not unusual from the Home Office&#151;it is frequently
justified and I do not complain. What was said on this occasion was
that there was already power under the domestic law of this country for
a constable or other authorised person to enter an aircraft on the
ground. We discussed that in the debates on the Civil Aviation Bill. We
all agreed that under Section 23 of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act &#147;premises&#148; includes aircraft, and my noble friend
Lord Davies referred to Section 17, which gives a power to enter
premises for certain purposes, the most important being the making of
an arrest. Section 1 empowers a constable to search premises if he has
reasonable grounds to suspect that he will find stolen or prohibited
goods, and Section 8 empowers a justice of the peace to authorise a
search of premises if there is evidence of a serious arrestable
offence.</p><p><a name="06070487000098"></a>The
problem is that none of those provisions is designed specifically for
the situation that we are discussing, and it may not be possible to
squeeze that situation like a piece of mosaic into any of the spaces
created by those provisions. My noble friend's amendment would provide
a power designed to deal with a case where an aircraft may be used for
extraordinary rendition. We have legislation specifically to deal with
terrorism. Why do we not have legislation to deal with
rendition?</p><p><a name="06070487000099"></a>The third objection
was that it is no light matter to search an aircraft using landing
facilities in this country or to require it to land. If we were to do
so, said my noble friend, it might provoke resentment and retaliation.
It was pointed out that the existing provisions that we have been
discussing all require reasonable suspicion.</p><p><a name="06070487000100"></a>The first response to that is that my
noble friend's amendment contemplates requiring an aircraft to land
only if the Secretary of State is aware of intelligence that the
aircraft is being, has been or may be used for unlawful rendition, and
that the aircraft will be searched only if the Secretary of State or
other responsible person is so aware. The action would need to be
intelligence-based. The standard of suspicion required may be rather
lower than that required, for example, by the powers under PACE, but
that is because it is difficult to know what is going on within an
aircraft without going aboard to see&#151;an aircraft is not
transparent. In a matter of such importance, risking a failure to
detect may be risking a human life, or at least very serious
consequences for the victim.</p><p><a name="06070487000101"></a>The
second response to the argument about inconvenience and delay is that,
if an aircraft is required to land, there will be very little
difficulty in having a constable ready and waiting to conduct a search.
It would not be a technical operation requiring a highly trained
operative. Constables are not all that difficult to find. If the
aircraft is already on the ground, the delay is likely to be minimal.
My noble friend's amendment is not mandatory; it is enabling. It would
confer a power of search and not make a search compulsory in a
situation where it was wholly unreasonable.</p><p><a name="06070487000102"></a>Mr Terry Davis, announcing some of his
findings on behalf of the Council of Europe, declared:</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_215"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06070487000119"></a>&#147;While most of our member states
have mechanisms to supervise the activities of their domestic
intelligence agencies as well as the presence of foreign police
officers on their territory, hardly any country, with the clear
exception of Hungary, has any legal provision to ensure an effective
oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their
territory&#148;.</ul><a name="06070487000104"></a>That is a
deeply disturbing indictment. The amendment moved by my noble friend
would at least be a step towards rectifying
that.<p><a name="06070489000001"></a><b><a name="06070489000030"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> I support the amendment in the name of
the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Archer, and my noble friend Lord Garden. I shall be very brief because
a number of arguments have already been put forward. Suffice it to say
that not only was a similar effort made during the passage of the Civil
Aviation Bill but a similar amendment was introduced during the passage
of several other Bills by my noble friend Lord Garden and, at one
stage, by me as well.</p><h5><a name="06070489000029"></a>9.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06070489000002"></a>The noble and learned Lord,
Lord Archer of Sandwell, is right in specifying the scope of the
amendment. It creates a power that allows a Minister to require any
plane using UK airspace to land if he has information that it is being
used for unlawful rendition. It also creates a specific duty requiring
planes which have been required to land to be searched. It is also in
keeping&#151;and this is probably the most important
point&#151;with the Government&#146;s obligations under, and
commitment to, the convention against torture and the prohibition of
torture contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. Examples
have been given, especially in the investigation carried out by Terry
Davis, which amount to an alarming report. The explanation on controls
over aircraft allegedly used for rendition shows that existing
procedures do not provide adequate safeguards against abuse.</p><p><a name="06070489000003"></a>The amendment therefore
creates a power for the Secretary of State to require planes in UK
airspace to land at a designated airport. Once a plane has landed, a
chief constable or other senior figure is required to order the plane
to be searched, and any items can be removed from the plane to
establish whether it is being used for unlawful rendition. If the plane
is already using UK airport facilities, there is a similar power to
search but no obligation to do so. In the light of the observations
made by the noble Baroness and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer
of Sandwell, we certainly support a provision that enables us not only
to examine why certain flights are stopping in this country, and
whether they are stopping for a lawful purpose, but to meet our
international obligations.</p><p><a name="06070489000004"></a><b><a name="06070489000031"></a>Lord
Judd:</b> I did not participate at Second Reading,
but I am very glad to have an opportunity to say a word of support for
this amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza.
The principles behind the concern are clearly spelt out in the
conviction of the Government against torture&#151;I do not in any way
question it; I am absolutely certain that it is a genuine and honest
commitment. What lies 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_216"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>behind the amendment is the repugnance of our whole society at the
concept of torture. I always think that we are getting into difficult
waters when we start quoting our obligations under conventions, because
it begins to say, &#147;We are doing things because we have agreed to
a convention which says that we must do them&#148;. The convention is
there because we believe these things are wrong. We need to go back to
first principles and say that the conventions spell out our judgment on
what is and is not acceptable behaviour.
</p><p><a name="06070489000005"></a>All of that
is important, but there is one other point to be made. I hope that the
Minister will forgive my repeating in this context an argument I have
used before, but I passionately believe it. I believe that the battle
to contain and to defeat terrorism is ultimately one to be won in
hearts and minds. It is a battle to create a situation in which people
are not open to manipulation and recruitment by militant extremists.
The difficulty about rendition is that, in a way, with the best
intentions, the Government may inadvertently compound the
problem&#151;the danger. They say that they are against torture but
do not then take the opportunity to follow through, in a tangible,
effective and demonstrable way, their commitment to get under control a
situation in which torture may be happening. The failure to do so plays
into the hands of the extremists, who say, &#147;There you are:
double standards. All this is just empty rhetoric. When it comes to
putting muscle into the commitment, it&#146;s not
there&#148;.</p><p><a name="06070489000006"></a>That is why the
amendment is so important in the whole strategy to defeat terrorism and
extremism.</p><p><a name="06070489000007"></a><b><a name="06070489000032"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> First, it is unusual to have
to respond to a debate that was ably undertaken by my noble friend Lord
Davies on 28 March. I add my voice to that of my noble and learned
friend Lord Archer in saying that that debate appears to have been very
full, and my noble friend did remarkably well, not being burdened as I
am by the disadvantages of being a
lawyer.</p><p><a name="06070489000008"></a>It is absolutely clear
that this issue has excited a huge amount of proper concern and
attention. I reassure my noble friends, the noble Baroness, Lady
D&#146;Souza, and the noble Lord opposite that we agree with the
sentiments on the abhorrence of
torture.</p><p><a name="06070489000009"></a>I
shall not repeat all the arguments which my noble friend so ably
outlined on 28 March, save to make three key points. First, the
Government have made it clear on numerous occasions that we do not, and
will not, grant permission for the United Kingdom&#146;s airspace or
territory, including our overseas territories, to be used for any
unlawful rendition.</p><p><a name="06070489000010"></a>Secondly, as my noble
friend Lord Davies of Oldham made clear on 28 March at col. 717, we
already have sufficient powers under existing legislation to take
action of the sort envisaged in this amendment, if it were ever
possible or necessary to do so.</p><p><a name="06070489000011"></a>This amendment would
therefore add nothing to existing legislation. I hear what my noble and
learned friend Lord Archer says about that, but it is right to note
that he, too, did not identify a gap. He clearly says, together with
the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, that it would be clearer to
have this provision.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070489000012"></a>Thirdly, in any case, the possibility of
using such powers in situations envisaged in this amendment is largely
theoretical. As my noble friend Lord Davies suggested, if a jet
aircraft is merely passing through United Kingdom airspace, it is
unlikely to be in the UK airspace for more than, say, two hours. The
suggestion that it would be possible to receive and analyse relevant
intelligence, and then take action on the basis of it, is simply not
realistic.</p><p><a name="06070489000013"></a>These points mean
that if the security and law enforcement agencies ever did receive
intelligence that could give rise to the type of actions envisaged in
the amendment on a time scale that would permit such action, they would
already be able to undertake it. The chances of that happening are
largely negligible. Of course, I agree with my noble friends and the
noble Baroness in whose name the amendment stands that we must do our
best to ensure that United Kingdom airspace and territory are not
abused in support of unlawful rendition, but that could only be done
effectively through international engagement, and long before any
hypothetical flight set
off.</p><p><a name="06070489000014"></a>We are
satisfied with our position in this context because there is no
credible evidence that United Kingdom airspace or territory have been
involved in unlawful rendition. We are also satisfied that at a
domestic level we have all the powers we need should we ever become
aware of any such flights once they are in transit. I must stress that
the Committee should therefore be content with that position. I know
that the Council of Europe report has caused a great deal of concern.
Perhaps the important thing to remember is that it provides and
contains no new evidence relating to the United Kingdom&#146;s
position. Your Lordships will have had the benefit of the Foreign
Secretary&#146;s Written Ministerial Statement of 20 January. These
issues were carefully dealt with at that point.</p><p><a name="06070489000015"></a>I am conscious of the time and that the
noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, made it clear that she does not
want me to go back into the history and deal with those matters, so I
do not propose to do so. However, it is important for me to reassure
the House that my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell was
right to refer to Sections 8, 17 and 23 of PACE and Section 4 of the
Public Order Act in relation to powers that, we maintain, still
apply.</p><p><a name="06070489000016"></a>I am not confident that
this point was made, so I should say that constables throughout the
United Kingdom enjoy additional powers under Part III of the Aviation
Security Act 1982 in respect of non-military airports that have been
designated by order of the Secretary of State. Those powers give the
chief officer of police for the police area in which the airport is
situated responsibility for the general policing of the airport and are
without prejudice to other powers enjoyed by the police.</p><p><a name="06070489000017"></a>For flights, Article 3(c) of the Chicago
Convention states:</p><ul><a name="06070489000028"></a>&#147;No
state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the territory of
another State or land thereon without authorization by special
agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms
thereof&#148;.</ul><a name="06070489000027"></a>An
authorisation to overfly for a normal, innocent purpose would not
include authority to overfly for an 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>undeclared extraordinary rendition; therefore, if the evidence justified
it, any authority to overfly could be withdrawn and the aircraft could
be required to land. The Government therefore believe that the police
have all the powers envisaged in this amendment. Of course, whether it
would ever be possible to use such powers in practice is, as has been
noted, a different
matter.<p><a name="06070489000018"></a>There
are various offences relevant to rendition. The unacknowledged
deprivation of liberty by any person would constitute a crime, such as

being insufficient evidence that extraordinary rendition is taking
place using the UK&#146;s facilities is tricky. For the moment, I

On the question of evidence, I would think that it is not possible to
prove that these flights have not taken place. For that reason, it
seems logical to try to put together some kind of mechanism in the
Bill, or amending other Acts, to ensure that that is impossible in
future. Surely it must be possible to devise a workable mechanism that
allows aircraft that are already on the ground and which are using
refuelling facilities to be searched.</p><p><a name="06070489000025"></a>I know that it is late. The war on terror

General</I>]:</p><p><a name="06070492000002"></a><b><a name="06070492000024"></a>Lord

leave out paragraph
(d).</ul><p><a name="06070492000003"></a>The noble Lord
said: This is a probing amendment that we have tabled in response to a
briefing from the Reed Group plc. I make it clear that I have no
commercial or any other interest in the Reed Group, which provides
products and services that enable the direct marketing industry to
cleanse their databases of obsolete records. Its understanding is that
the purpose of Clause 11, specifically Clause 11(1)(d), is to enable
the release of the Registrar General&#146;s death registration data
to, among others, credit reference agencies to aid the prevention of
deceased identity fraud. From its extensive knowledge and expertise in
data from the direct marketing industry, the Reed Groups has serious
concerns about the release of data, especially given the unspecific
nature of Clause 11(1)(b), which does not ring-fence the users of the
data sufficiently tightly.</p><p><a name="06070492000004"></a>Any
information that the Registrar General controls, especially about
deaths, is of significant value to many organisations involved in the
data and direct marketing industry, as well as to less scrupulous
organisations. Although the initial intention is for that data to be
released only to credit reference agencies, direct mail sent to the
deceased is recognised as a tool for deceased identity fraudsters.
Therefore, any individual or organisation could easily argue that they
send direct mail or clean direct mail databases and have a right to
access those sensitive data. That would, at best, enable private
organisations to generate substantial income but, most
worrying&#151;surely the Government are worried about this&#151;it
would leave the bereaved exposed to abuse and targeted fraud when they
are at their most vulnerable. I will be very interested to hear the
Government's reaction to the amendment. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06070492000005"></a><b><a name="06070492000025"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> We support the proposal that
the registrar should be given the legislative power to disclose
information given on the registration of a death, both quickly and in
bulk to specified public and private sector organisations, on the basis
that it is to be used for the prevention and detection of crime. Even
if the amendment were not put forward as a direct response to a
briefing from the Reed Group, I would have some sympathy with it on the
basis that it is right to probe which organisations the Government
intend to give access to such information in this expedited
way.</p><p><a name="06070492000006"></a>The amendment would delete
paragraph (d), which gives the Government the right to extend by order

thought have the Government given to the types of organisation that
should benefit from that express service? Is it intended to cover all
banks and building societies that issue credit cards and set up bank
accounts? In that case, will organisations be given the power in a
generic sense, or will those organisations specified by business name
be given the power to get that
information?</p><p><a name="06070492000007"></a>I
note that the new clause was introduced in another place only at Report
stage so that, of course, debate was necessarily truncated. The
Minister, Mr Liam Byrne, stated that the primary purpose of the new
provision is,</p><ul><a name="06070492000022"></a>&#147;to
allow the police and other organisations to identify attempts to
perpetrate identity fraud&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
Commons, 10/5/06; col.
365.]</ul><a name="06070492000020"></a>Of course, that is
sensible enough. It would also be sensible for the Government to tell
the Committee what plans they have to open up this expedited procedure
to organisations other than banks and building societies in addition to
the police services that are named in the Bill. There is a need for a
general steer on this.<p><a name="06070492000008"></a>Of
course I appreciate that the information that is registered on a
person&#146;s death becomes public property anyway. Indeed, I have
been awarded probate for three of my closest relatives, so I know what
happens and have been through the legal procedure. I realise that the
clause is merely about how quickly that information enters the public
domain in the sense that it becomes available first to a favoured group
of people as opposed ultimately to being available to
everyone.</p><p><a name="06070492000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, referred specifically to the briefing from the Reed Group,
which I have before me. Like him, I have no financial or other
interests to declare as far as that company is concerned. It has
expertise in the area and I think that it makes an interesting point. I
note that its letter was sent to Dr Reid on 12 June. I appreciate that,
by his own admission, he has had a little work to do since then and
that he may not yet have had the opportunity personally to respond to
the Reed Group. But, here we are, the opportunity is available to the
noble Lord, Lord Bassam, to help Dr Reid out of a
hole.</p><p><a name="06070492000010"></a><b><a name="06070492000026"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not know that I will
necessarily be involving myself in helping anyone out of a hole; I am
just going to try to respond to the
points.</p><p><a name="06070492000011"></a>The noble Baroness and
the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, obviously well understand the purpose of
Clause 11 and so I am not going to recite it. The primary purpose, as
both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord know, is for the supply of
information to allow the police and other law enforcement agencies to
identify attempts to utilise the personal details of those who have
recently died to perpetrate fraud. This will help to combat
impersonation of the deceased fraud, as it is commonly known, and to
reduce the impact on the bereaved relatives of the recently 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_221"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deceased who have to deal with the consequences of the identity of their
loved ones being stolen.</p><p><a name="06070492000012"></a>As the
noble Baroness acknowledged, deaths registration information is already
in the public domain. More specifically, of course, any person can
obtain a copy of an entry in a death register in the form of a
certificate, provided that they can identify that entry and pay the
statutory fee for that certificate. However, under current statutory
provisions, information about all deaths is not available quickly
enough to those organisations with an interest in the prevention and
detection of impersonation of the deceased fraud, nor is it available
in a format that would necessarily assist them for those
purposes.</p><p><a name="06070492000013"></a>This is important for
this reason: identity crime is on the increase. CIFAS, the UK&#146;s
fraud prevention service, estimates that there were some 70,000
instances of impersonation of the deceased fraud in 2004, at a cost of
some &#163;300 million to the economy, and that at the current rate
of growth we will see this reach perhaps 100,000 instances per year by
2007. Those are fairly horrifying and staggering statistics. This
provision will help to reduce the existing levels of, and stem the
predicted increase in, impersonation of the deceased fraud by allowing
the Registrars General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland to
supply death registration information to particular organisations as
soon as it becomes available. It will also be supplied in a format that
can be used effectively by the police and others to help to detect when
an attempt is being made to steal or use the identity of a deceased
person.</p><p><a name="06070492000014"></a>I am
sure that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, knows well that the effect of
the amendment would be to limit the scope of the provision so that the
Registrars General could supply information only to the police, special
police forces and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The noble
Baroness asked the important question, echoing the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, about to which other organisations we might want that
information supplied. Clearly, other organisations will want to
contribute to the fight against impersonation of the deceased fraud.
Indeed, it is those very organisations that can probably have an even
greater impact on the prevention of this type of fraud. Those
organisations might include government departments or agencies or an
organisation in the financial services industry&#151;that is much
more likely, I would have thought, given that there are apparently big
opportunities in that sector&#151;such as banks, building societies,
insurance companies or credit reference
agencies.</p><p><a name="06070492000015"></a>Timely notification of
a person&#146;s death person can provide the means by which, for
example, a marker can be made against that person&#146;s record, his
account, his mortgage or his insurance policy so as to reduce the risks
of an improper transaction leading to fraud. The disclosure of that
information does not raise any data protection issues, as the Data
Protection Act 1998 applies only to the living. The Information
Commissioner's Office has been consulted on the proposals and has
raised no concerns.</p><p><a name="06070492000016"></a>A detailed
implementation strategy is being developed by the Registrars General.
The plan is to have an application process that will establish, from 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_222"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all organisations that have requested to be supplied with information,
how that information will be used, how it will be processed, where it
will be stored and other relevant issues. When applying organisations
have satisfied these requirements, information will be supplied only
for use in connection with the prevention, detection, investigation or
prosecution of offences and for no other
purpose.</p><p><a name="06070492000017"></a>It is anticipated that
successful applicants will be subject to a regime that will include a
licence agreement and appropriate compliance arrangements. It is likely
that any misuse of the information may lead to the supply of further
information being suspended or ultimately withdrawn. In summary, the
proposed compliance arrangements will provide assurance that
information will not be supplied to inappropriate organisations and
that misuse will be dealt with
firmly.</p><p><a name="06070492000018"></a>It is worth noting that
the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not in its
report on the Bill pass comment on the order-making power that the
noble Lord&#146;s amendment would remove. We can take it from the
committee&#146;s silence that it did not view either the order-making
power or the level of parliamentary scrutiny as objectionable. I am
sure that noble Lords will agree that impersonation of the deceased
fraud is a real problem that needs to be tackled in the most effective
way. We believe that this clause provides an important step in the
fight against this most pernicious and insidious of
crimes.</p>

heard what I have said&#151;including that we will ensure that a
series of processes is put in place and that there will be a limit on
the organisations that will have access to this information and a
proper operable scheme&#151;I hope that the noble Lord will feel able
to withdraw the

Anelay of St Johns:</b> Before the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, returns to the fray, perhaps I may ask one or two more
questions. The Minister referred to the report of the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee. He will appreciate that this amendment
was put forward not because we disagree with the committee&#146;s
conclusion that the order-making power was appropriate in this form. We
tabled the amendment to challenge how that power is to be used, and not
the manner in which orders are to be put before the
House.</p><p><a name="06070494000003"></a>The Minister grasps the
point about how one ensures that expedited information does not reach
inappropriate organisations and he gives an assurance that there will
be proper processes. He talks about organisations making an application
and that perhaps there will be a licensing system. The difficulty is
that, because of the way in which Clause 11(1) is currently drafted, we
do not have the result to which the noble Lord is directing us. In
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) we have a description of organisations that
is so closely drawn that we know who will get the
information.</p><p><a name="06070494000004"></a>Under paragraph
(d), the information may be supplied to,</p><ul><a name="06070494000053"></a>&#147;a person or body specified, or
of a description specified, by order&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_223"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06070494000044"></a>The description is generic. Will it just
be building societies or credit reference agencies? We do not know what
the body will be. It will not be a closely identified group of
companies. Is the noble Lord saying that paragraph (d) will be used to
set up a licensing system without it being specified in an order that
building societies will be enabled? Will an order state, &#147;We
will set up a licensing system whereby other organisations can now
apply&#148;? That is what we need to know. If there is that kind of
reassurance, that is very acceptable. As Reed points out in its
subsequent briefing, in all of this, we have to bear in mind that once
information is out there, you cannot get it
back.<h5><a name="06070494000054"></a>9.45

been primarily positive in nature, with rehabilitation and reparation
being their chief purpose. They were part of the armoury of prevention
and a way of keeping people out of the criminal justice system, which
is a truly important goal.</p><p><a name="06070494000020"></a>Clause 15, however, introduces a third
element, that of &#147;punishing the offender&#148;. The purpose of
the amendment affirms that punishment on its own is unlikely to be
productive; reparation or rehabilitation is needed in conjunction with
punishment for a positive outcome. This, after all, is the sort of
thing we all teach our children from a very early age. It is absolutely
fundamental.</p><p><a name="06070494000021"></a>The amendment
would achieve the goal of always combining the positive with punishment
and it would statutorily endorse the Government&#146;s stated support
for this approach. While this is an apparently simple and small change,
the implications go wide and deep in terms of how vulnerable children
in particular are dealt with, how their relations with the police and
offending in general are managed constructively, and, most importantly,
how we keep such young people out of the criminal justice system. I beg
to
move.</p><p><a name="06070494000022"></a><b><a name="06070494000059"></a>Baroness

which I thought would not be with us until
Thursday.</p><p><a name="06070494000023"></a>We now reach one of
the most contentious parts of the Bill, where the Government seek to
extend significantly the way in which conditional cautions may operate.
I shall speak to my Amendment No. 92, which is grouped with Amendment
No. 91E.</p><p><a name="06070494000024"></a>The
Minister in the other place, Hazel Blears, acknowledged in Committee
that this was a &#147;radical departure&#148; from current law, at
col. 167 on 23 March. The risk is that summary justice could
increasingly be meted out in inappropriate cases by the police and CPS,
instead of by the courts. I say that with some trepidation with the
noble and learned Lord who has responsibility for the CPS before me. He
is a redoubtable defender of its ability in this House. I was extremely
fortunate to be able to have a meeting with the DPP a short while ago.
I feel sure that he will do everything in his power to make sure that
the CPS is indeed fit for purpose, to use a favourite phrase of the
Government. That is not said snidely; I was certainly very impressed by
his determination to lead the CPS
forward.</p><p><a name="06070494000025"></a>Amendment
No. 91E raises interesting questions about what should be the
objectives of conditional cautions. Amendment No. 92, in my name, seeks
to develop that debate. It would ensure that, if punishment is to be
accepted as a new condition in the terms of this Bill, then the
punitive conditions that can be imposed should be confined to those
specified in the Bill. Conditional cautions were, of course, introduced
in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. How could I forget? I sat through the
whole Bill over its many months in this House. It specifically confined
the imposition of cautions 
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_225"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to rehabilitation or reparation. Of course, those are currently being
piloted. Clause 15 of this Bill now proposes that conditions can be
attached for the purpose of punishing the offender. The Bill includes
financial penalties and community service as examples of punitive
conditions that could be imposed on cautions. It does not prevent other
conditions being imposed in future.</p><p><a name="06070494000026"></a>If this clause is to be in the Bill, the
punitive conditions should be confined to those included in it now. I
do not believe that the Government have yet justified the case for
allowing an extension of punitive conditions in future by order. There
has been no public debate on the matter. What consultation has there
been of those who represent the interests of victims on the future
extension of punitive conditions to other disposals? When and what was
their response? What consultation has there been with the
Magistrates&#146; Association on these specific matters? Again, what
was its advice?</p><p><a name="06070494000027"></a>We are taking a
very serious step by accepting Clause 15 wholesale; it is a clause that
should not be taken lightly. I have sought to group my amendments in
four separate groups, in order that we may have&#151;I hope&#151;a
constructive debate on the major issues we need to face in deciding
whether we accept all the provisions of Clause 15. I very much look
forward to the debates we will have tonight and, in particular, on
Thursday and at later stages. I hope that by the end of those debates
we will have a conditional caution system that is robust and fair, but
does not seek to encroach too far on the proper role of the
courts.</p><p><a name="06070494000028"></a><b><a name="06070494000060"></a>Lord

did&#151;reinforces that. What I propose to do therefore, at five
minutes before 10, is to focus particularly on the two amendments in
this group, rather than deal with the broader issues indicated by the
noble Baroness opposite. I have already noted the questions she raised,
and I am sure that we can come back to those. Let me therefore deal
with these amendments on the working assumption that there is to be a
scheme of conditional cautions, which will include some form of
punitive possibility.</p><p><a name="06070494000030"></a>Amendment No. 91E seeks
to ensure that any conditions attached to a conditional caution must
have at least two of the following three objectives: facilitating
rehabilitation of the offender; ensuring the offender makes reparation
for the offence; and/or punishing the offender. The problem with that
amendment is that, overall, the conditional caution scheme will need to
be appropriate, achievable and proportionate in relation to the
particular offender. I am looking forward to the opportunity of
developing more why it is necessary to include a punitive
condition.</p><notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_226"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06070494000031"></a>In many cases it may be appropriate to
attach more than one condition. That is one of the reasons why we want
to include a punitive condition. Let me give an example: at the moment
a conditional caution can be used for someone who has committed a
low-level offence but a typical problem might be where one can see that
part of the way of dealing with that offender, and therefore the
problem that that offender is causing to the community, is perhaps to
encourage that person to deal with an alcohol problem. In Lancashire
some alcohol treatment programmes are used through the conditional
cautioning system.</p><p><a name="06070494000032"></a>In some cases, we might
say that that is all very well but there needs also to be a modest
punitive element to recognise what has taken place. At the moment, for
example, for drunkenness the police could simply serve a fixed-penalty
notice. That would have a punitive element and the case does not go to
court. Or under a conditional caution one could encourage someone to
obtain treatment for the problem by imposing a condition, if the
offender accepts it&#151;these are all voluntary schemes&#151;that
they take some form of alcohol treatment. What we cannot do at the
moment is both: we can have either a fixed-penalty notice or a
condition for treatment. So it may well be appropriate, if the House
ultimately accepts the scheme, to enable one to have both in a
particular case.</p><p><a name="06070494000033"></a>However, it does not
follow that in all cases it would be appropriate to have both
objectives. For example, it might be appropriate to encourage an
offender as a condition of getting a caution to engage in treatment or
to pay compensation but not to do something else. The difficulty with
the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is that it would stop that taking
place. For example, a drug-using prostitute might need help with
rehabilitation from a drug problem but we do not want to impose a
financial penalty as well because that may only drive her back on to
the streets in order to pay the fine. The amendment would not help us
to meet the requirement of having something appropriate and
proportionate to the offender.</p><p><a name="06070494000034"></a>Amendment No. 92, in
the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, would limit the types of
punitive condition to the two specified in Clause 15: a financial
penalty or required attendance. Clause 15 specifies those two as part
of a range of options that might be attached to a conditional caution.
The reason that those two are spelt out is because of the provisions
that follow, which fix the amount of the penalty or the number of
hours&#146; attendance at the specified place.</p><p><a name="06070494000035"></a>Any number of other conditions could be
imposed. Let me give one example, which might be an appropriate moment
to leave this part of the debate. At the moment, you could impose a
reparative condition that someone deals with a piece of private
property that has been damaged, for example where someone has come back
from a pub and kicked in a door or something of that sort. If, on the
other hand, the property in question does not belong to an individual
or is community property in a park and has been fixed by the time the
matter is dealt with, because the local authorities dealt with
it
<notus-date day="4" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_227"></a><b>4 July 2006 : Column 227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>straightaway, you cannot have a reparative condition related to it; it
has already been dealt with or there is no specific victim. There you
might want to have something broader in terms of reparation, such as
doing some work for the community. That would fall under the heading of
punishment, but it is not a financial penalty.</p><p><a name="06070494000036"></a>What the noble Baroness
wants to know is that safeguards will be in place to prevent any abuse
of the new punitive object. The primary way of doing that will be
through the conditional cautioning code of practice, which makes it
clear that any conditions imposed have to be proportionate, achievable
and appropriate to the offending&#151;but particularly, finally, that
the offender accepts them. The whole scheme is built on the premise
that if the offender does not accept the conditions, they simply do not
operate. The offender says, &#147;I am not prepared to accept
them&#148;, and the matter goes to court. That is an important
safeguard as
well.</p><p><a name="06070494000037"></a>That may
be no more than a taster of the rest of the debate to come, but on the
basis of those two amendments,

today.</p><p><a name="06070469000007"></a>This is the third report

delay in producing the report, which was caused by the need to validate
the results it contains in the light of a number of changes to the
underlying methodology. While this has provided greater confidence in
those results, the Comptroller and Auditor General has not been able to
validate all the data in the report. The department&#146;s aim is to

October 2007, private and voluntary sector providers will start to help
to deliver the Pathways service, extending to the remaining 60 per cent
of new and repeat incapacity benefit customers by April 2008. We will
use providers because our good partnership working with them on other
initiatives has shown to be very effective, particularly when we offer
them outcome-based contracts and payment by results. Providers will
engage with customers after their initial work-focused
interview.</p><p><a name="06070469000015"></a>Providers
will start delivering the pathways service to customers in 15 Jobcentre
Plus districts in October 2007. The 15 districts are Greater Manchester
east and west, Cardiff and Vale/South-East Wales, Forth Valley Fife

introducing a new employment and support allowance (ESA) to replace
incapacity benefits for new customers in 2008 and improving the gateway
to the benefit; piloting employment advisers in GP surgeries to support
GPs and primary care teams, revising the format of the medical
certificate, and simplifying statutory sick pay; piloting the new

tackling worklessness; increasing the frequency of work-focused

There are no specific regulations that govern the

Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as
amended). If DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological
agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations
2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level
of protection for human health and the environment (including animal
and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order
1998 (SAPO), administered by Defra, regulates possession of nucleic
acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all
