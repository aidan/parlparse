What is the Government&#146;s view on the contrast between average wage increases and the escalating pay rises once again enjoyed by company directors in 2007, when a record 1,445 directors received a salary of more than &#163;1 million? That is 40 per cent more in number than in 2005. That is basic pay, before bonuses, share options or other perks. Does the Minister think that this annual contribution to rising social inequality by corporate executives who sit on one another&#146;s remuneration committees is a suitable practice today? Would it not merit at least a word of advice to some of the super-rich gentlemen who fly around the globe with the Prime Minister?</p>

Let us please get this into perspective. Every day, people remind the private sector of its responsibility to set an example to include all in society. Every day, it is aware of its responsibilities. Please do not let us put up a sign over UK plc that people cannot aspire for the sky. We need an economy that the world wants to come to where people earn as much as they can from working as hard as they can and bringing their skill to this country.</p>

Bonuses come out of increased profits for shareholders. Shareholders have an interest in ensuring that these so often talented people earn more money for the company. In 2009, there will be an obligation on companies to go much further into their pay policy and how they reach their levels of pay.

That, of course, has been done by free collective bargaining. Why is it that the Government are seeking to remove from public employees the right to free collective bargaining, which is enjoyed by the private sector?

I am very anxious to ensure that everyone in both the public and the private sectors earns as much as the country can afford. I remind the House that if the country does not earn the money, then tax is not paid; and if tax is not paid, we do not get schools and hospitals.

The main aim is to ensure the continuity of existing general practitioner services and to develop further primary care services for the benefit of patients across Northumberland. It is appropriate that the Northumberland Care Trust should review its personal medical services contracts to ensure quality of services as well as value for money, in parallel with all primary care organisations in the north-east.</p>

The formula is weighted against rural practices. Indeed, it is envisaged that the cuts would be 24 per cent at the Bellingham surgery. That would mean the closure of that surgery, which covers the largest land mass in England&#151;1.6 per cent of England. If it closed down, those living in Byrness would have a 70-mile round trip just to see a GP in Hexham. Should the Government not review the Carr-Hill formula, considering that Professor Carr-Hill does not himself support it for rural areas?</p>

It is of interest that the Northumberland Care Trust is one of the only PCTs in the country that has these deficit challenges. I assure the noble Lord that the fair funding formula considers rurality in its calculations and certainly takes into account a number of factors, including local poverty, distances and geography.</p>

In this widely dispersed area, was it right to consider cuts that might at the outset have resulted in the closure of general practices? Does the Minister accept that the recent consultations with the trust have happily come up with a much more acceptable formula? Nevertheless, does he agree that there is a widespread feeling in the north-east that this trust is underfunded, particularly given that the health service is on course for a surplus at the end of the financial year?</p>

However, I am sure that we would all agree that value for money is also an issue. It is of interest that, of the 49 primary care providers in Northumberland, 42 are on PMS contracts and seven are on GMS contracts, which runs counter to the national configuration of 60 GMS to 40 PMS. It transpires that there is currently a differential within the PMS contracts of about &#163;5.2 million. The PCT, in collaboration with primary care providers, is looking at exactly the types of services that are provided for that differential.</p>

We have made our continuous commitment to this clear in this year&#146;s operating framework, which charges primary care trusts with setting and publishing stretching local plans for improvements in this area.</p>

If a developing country can do it, and many do, why is it impossible in this country?

That was 15 years ago&#151;I remember practising in them as a trainee. However, medicine has moved on and, as it has, the design of wards in the health service is based on the disciplines, expertise and competencies of the staff working in those wards. As a result, the commitments that the Government made in 1997 were met in 2002 and 2004, with 95 per cent of patients in single-sex accommodation.</p>

The current guidance looks at three different principles: the annual healthcare check, which looks at a number of different standards; the patient environment action teams, which is the PEAT score; and, more recently, the Healthcare Commission, which looks at the in-patient surveys.</p>

However, we are talking about separate bays within wards. This is an interesting question that has been debated in this House for many years. The only way that we can have single-sex wards in the NHS is to build the whole of it in single rooms. Transforming a ward into a single-sex ward is not achievable. That aspiration cannot be met. We are talking about single-sex accommodation within wards&#151;in other words, different bays for different sexes.</p>

Since that can be done in other countries, why can we not meet that aspiration in this country? Is the Minister aware that in 1995 this House passed a Bill outlawing the practice of treating people in mixed-sex wards? Since then, many promises to phase them out have been made, but they are still there and we are still getting many complaints. On 22 January, the Minister answered a Written Question from me:</p>

We have guidance that we need to increase the number of single rooms by at least 50 per cent of any new build. We have made slow but steady progress since 1997. The number of single rooms has increased from 22 per cent to 27 per cent across the National Health Service. We measure single-sex accommodation through the trio that I referred to earlier: the annual healthcare check, the patient environment, and the Healthcare Commission&#146;s in-patient survey.</p>

The DfT concluded that this proposal provided significantly less value for money compared with the likely outcome of the refranchising exercise scheduled for completion in 2012. The department is currently preparing proposals to increase capacity on the west coast main line.</p>

It is important that negotiations between the Government and Virgin Trains reach a successful conclusion. Will the Minister ask his noble friend in another place, the Minister with responsibility for railways, to take personal charge of the negotiations? I think that officials are stalling those because they rather like to interfere continuously in franchises.</p>

We have to continue to improve services and to ensure that we deal with capacity issues, not just in 2012 but as we speak.

If you add on two extra carriages, you have to ensure that all the platforms are sufficiently long to take them into account. It has to be subject to detailed negotiation.</p>

Quite frankly, the department felt that the benefits to be gained in extra capacity would not be sufficiently great to justify giving Virgin Trains an extension in its franchise. However, Virgin is doing a remarkable job. It is an extremely successful service. We are delighted to see so many new passengers using trains in the new age of rail.

There have been previous debates on the need to define what supportive parents do rather than, as is currently the situation, simply what parents do not do, so we felt that this amendment would be an important addition to the legislation. At previous stages, this amendment and the idea of defining supportive parenting had a great deal of support. Indeed, at the close of proceedings on the previous day of Report, the Minister gave an assurance in relation to this amendment. I hope that today he will be able to confirm that I and my noble friends are correct in our understanding that the wording of this amendment, which reflects the wording in the letter sent round by the Minister, will be incorporated into the code of practice that goes with this Bill. On 21 January, the Minister said that the Government,</p>

In an adoption hearing that kind of assessment is made, but when a family goes for treatment for fertilisation it is unusual for that depth of assessment to be made, so I would be interested to know how the Minister sees this operating in practice.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="0801288000110"></a><b><a name="80128-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0801288000356"></a>Lord Winston:</b> My Lords, it might also be helpful if the Minister could tell us whether this kind of assessment will apply to those infertile couples receiving not only in vitro fertilisation but other treatments for infertility.</p>

<a name="0801288000111"></a><b><a name="80128-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0801288000357"></a>Lord Harries of Pentregarth:</b> My Lords, perhaps while we are in the business of further clarification we could have an assurance that supportive parenting, spelt out in the terms of this amendment, is to be looked at against the background of risk assessment. When the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority looks at the welfare of the child, it will be looking at whether there is in some way a significant risk that it has to examine; it will pursue the issue further only if there is sufficient risk. I have had one or two e-mails from people involved with this work who are concerned that this supportive parenting amendment will put an extra burden on clinics if it is not seen against the background of proper risk assessment.</p>

<a name="0801288000112"></a><b><a name="80128-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0801288000358"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, we have discussed the welfare of the child at length on previous occasions. It might be helpful, however, if I reiterate some of the important points about the need for supportive parenting. I am sure that everyone accepts the importance of supportive parenting in the context of the child&#146;s welfare. I also recognise that, for many noble Lords, how supportive parenting is defined is a key issue. We consider that a supportive parent would be willing and able to make a long-term commitment to safeguard and promote the child&#146;s health, development and welfare and, in a manner appropriate to the age and development of the child, to provide direction and guidance. This definition is as suggested in the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0801288000113"></a>As I made clear in our earlier discussion, our opinion is that an Act about fertilisation and embryology is not the appropriate place to have specific statements or definitions about parenting, as it would need to have relevance to parenting generally and not just in this specific context. We fully recognise the importance of knowing the meaning of the term, particularly for clinicians who carry out the assessments. Therefore, we believe that it would be appropriate to have the explanation of this term in the guidance produced by the HFEA, which is in its code of practice and is subject to approval by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0801288000114"></a>The Bill makes it a statutory requirement for the HFEA to produce guidance on the need for supportive parenting in the context of the welfare of the child. People embarking on assisted reproduction are fully committed to having a child, having given it a great deal of thought, and, in general, it would be expected

But, as part of the consideration of the welfare of the child, in the rare situations&#151;as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, highlighted&#151;when treatment providers are aware of evidence or indications that this is not the case, they should take this into account when considering whether to provide treatment. All patients need to consider how they would provide supportive parenting and provide for the needs of that child. What is critical is that the welfare of the child is safeguarded. We believe that this is achieved by referring to the need to have supportive parenting. I hope that I have reassured the House and that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0801288000155"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I return to an issue I raised in Committee about the right that the Bill grants to a donor-conceived person to make a request to the registrar for identifiable and non-identifiable information about his or her donor parent. This right is entirely appropriate and worthy of our support. In Committee, I raised the question of whether this right should be extended to a child of a donor-conceived person in certain circumstances. There could be a situation in which a woman with children of her own discovers that she was donor-conceived, but dies before she has the chance to make an information request. In those circumstances, there would appear to be no means for anyone at all to obtain the relevant information from the authority.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0801288000156"></a>I maintain that the child of a donor-conceived person has a very strong claim to that same information, not simply to satisfy his curiosity but to enable him to discover any information about heritable illness, about which his dead parent would have had a right to know. He also has a direct interest in wanting to avoid entering into an intimate relationship with a close blood relation. I have reworded my Committee amendments so as, I hope, to avoid the unwelcome possibility flagged up by the Minister that it could give rise to a request for information from all the children of a donor-conceived person, as opposed to just one of them; my intention being that the right to make an inquiry should be extended only once, either to the donor-conceived person or to a child of his.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0801288000157"></a>I believe that the Bill as currently drafted is unnecessarily restrictive and I hope that the Minister will look at the amendment more favourably than she did before. I beg to move.</p>

There may be occasions when it is extremely important for the future welfare of the child of the donor to know who the donor is in order to know whether some sort of preventive medicine or other necessary course is taken. I hope that the Government will listen carefully to the proposal.</p>

The noble Earl has put a very good case to the House. It builds on a case he made in Committee and that we have discussed in various contexts since then. I suspect that overwhelmingly we would all agree that where genetic issues and illness may be involved, it must be right that people have access to that information. Increasingly, with DNA testing becoming routine, these things will come to the surface. Therefore, I think that the cause of truth is served by this being done as early as possible and that we will have to move away from the right to know to the duty to tell&#151;a matter we discussed at earlier stages. Even though we have not been able to find a comprehensive solution to this problem&#151;let us hope that when they debate it in another place they will discuss some of the issues we have looked at and perhaps will think further on the question&#151;as a discrete question, this is a good one for the noble Earl to have brought to the House. Certainly it has my support.</p>

It is an important amendment for exactly the reasons he gave. I hope that the Government will be able to support it.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="0801288000161"></a><b><a name="80128-0003.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="0801288000376"></a>Lord Patten:</b> My Lords, I will not go through the arguments so fluently advanced by my noble friend on the Front Bench and by my noble friend Lord Elton. I shall simply add a footnote. Just as I think it is very important for a child in such a circumstance to have a sense of place and knowing where they belong, it is even more important for them to know not just for genetic reasons but for genealogical reasons where they come from. That is why I support this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_94"></a>

Access to non-identifying information at age 16 is a new provision. The Bill also re-enacts existing provisions that allow an 18 year-old donor-conceived person to retrieve identifying information about their donor following the removal of donor anonymity in 2005.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0801288000163"></a>The amendment seeks to enable the children of donor-conceived people to contact the HFEA to obtain information from the register regarding their parent&#146;s donor, in the situation where the parent did not contact the HFEA themselves. We recognise that this information is likely to be of interest to the children of donor-conceived people if the donor-conceived person themselves has not accessed it. It would be a piece of information about the child&#146;s genetic history, one step removed.</p>

<a name="80128-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0801288000164"></a>However, the purpose of allowing donor-conceived people access to information about their donor is to fill a gap in the knowledge they have about themselves. Many donor-conceived people feel that they are missing important information about who they are and where they came from because one set of genetic information is missing. Information, including identifying information, about the donor is intended to help address that. For that reason provisions are made to allow such people to find out about their donor, and donors sign up to donate on the understanding that such information will be made available. The Government believe that this sense of a gap would not apply in the same way for the children of donor-conceived people. Though they would have an interest in their genetic grandparent, they would not have the same sense of a gap in their knowledge about where they came from. They would know who their parents are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0801288000165"></a>We also have to consider the donor-conceived person themselves. The amendment would enable their children to request information about the donor while they themselves are still alive. What impact would this have on the family? How will the donor-conceived person feel if they themselves have made a decision not to ask for information and their child takes a different view? We need to consider all the interests and balance them. Since the removal of donor anonymity in 2005, donor-conceived children are able to get identifying information about their donor from the HFEA register.  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_455"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This includes the donor&#146;s last-known address. If they are not conceived as a result of an identifiable donor, but were conceived after the HFEA register began, they can as a minimum find out non-identifying information about their donor. This information is rightly accessible to donor-conceived people and has a direct impact on them. The information is likely to be of interest to their children, but it does not have the same immediacy.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0801288000166"></a>All those arguments still stand but I heard the persuasive argument put forward by the noble Earl about the children of donor-conceived adults who may have died. While the Government have considered this issue carefully and reached the conclusion that access to the HFEA register should continue to focus on those directly affected and that it should be a matter for personal decision by the donor-conceived person whether to access the information available, I am persuaded to take this back and look at the issue of the children of donor-conceived adults who have died. That is a particular case. I do not know what, if any, movement there might be on this, but I am willing to take it back. We have one week before Third Reading, so I am certainly not going to say I will come back by then, but I will ask my colleagues to look at this.</p>

I apologise to my noble friend for not being in the House at the moment he rose. There are quite a lot of donor-conceived children who are born after treatment approved by the authority when the woman becomes pregnant. Thereafter, no information from the clinic may actually reach the authority, and even the clinic may not know whether a child has been born from that treatment. In her further consideration, can the noble Baroness confirm that there is no obligation on either the parents or the clinic to let anybody know that it was successful and a child was born?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0801288000174"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I spoke to this amendment, which addresses confidentiality, in Committee. Many clinicians working in the field of in vitro fertilisation have found this measure difficult to work with in practice. Professor Peter Braude from St Thomas&#146;s Hospital has raised it with the Department of Health. He received a letter clarifying some of the issues raised by this amendment. Among other things the letter explains that there is a further exception to the prohibition on disclosure in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, which was added by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Disclosure of Information) Act 1992. This Act allows a patient to consent to the disclosure of information for the purposes of their own treatment. The letter also explains that the restrictions in new Section 33A introduced in this Bill apply only to information held by HFEA licence holders in their capacity as such, and that the restrictions in the 1990 Act are designed to comply with the requirements set out in the European Union tissue and cells directive.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0801288000175"></a>I confess that I remain unclear as to why the consent of the person to whom the information relates is not sufficient for it to be disclosed for any purposes the person chooses, subject, of course, to the privacy of any third parties, or why the restrictions on medical information pertaining to licensed IVF treatment are so much more onerous than those applicable to other forms of treatment, including infertility treatment that does not need to be licensed. It has always seemed anomalous to clinics as well as to the majority of patients that specific consent to disclose details of their treatment to others has been a requirement. Indeed, explaining the issue to patients is often greeted with surprise given that they have been used, in the preliminary assessments of their infertility and in the provision of first line treatment, to normal lines of communication between those who are involved in their care&#151;for the most part hospital clinicians and general practitioners&#151;being established without their permission being sought.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0801288000176"></a>Clinical problems which could be in breach of the law include: gynaecological referrals of patients treated by the licence holder and their clinics; communication with other health professionals; admissions with complications after IVF treatment; antenatal care&#151;which is where I mostly come across these patients&#151;referral for screening; neonatal care and even clinical care in later life. All working in the sector would prefer a system that allowed the routine nature of IVF treatment to be acknowledged and for clinical staff to be able to communicate with colleagues routinely without fear of prosecution.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0801288000177"></a>In other areas of sensitive medical practice such as mental illness, HIV and abortion, confidentiality issues do not seem to require the same degree of legislative imposition.

She was 26 weeks pregnant and informed me and the air hostesses that the pregnancy resulted from in vitro fertilisation. She even told me the name of the team looking after her during her pregnancy. The problem was solved very easily but she had no qualms telling everybody on the plane about her infertility problems. So patients do not require this degree of confidentiality.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0801288000178"></a>I wonder how we might move this forward. It might be possible for the HFEA to provide guidance in its code of practice for clinicians to follow, particularly on patient safety issues. They would thus avoid breaching confidentiality laws, which carry draconian penalties if they are found guilty of breaking them. I beg to move.</p>

Numerous Members of your Lordships&#146; House have made pleas for us doctors to take account of patients&#146; abilities as parents and the need for a father, or whatever phrase we have discussed, when assessing a patient&#146;s suitability for in vitro fertilisation. With confidentiality as it is now it is inevitable that, if alarms are raised about some aspect of the past childcare of a person seeking in vitro fertilisation, we could not go to another individual without the permission of that person, who would clearly not give that permission. That is a very good example of why the confidentiality clause is, right from the beginning, a total nonsense. It goes against accepted medical practice in every other form of medicine. If your Lordships really want doctors to assess patients for their suitability to be good parents in the future, there has to be an acceptance that a patient&#146;s confidentiality is at stake. That has not been grasped during the discussion of this Bill, and it seems a very important principle indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0801288000181"></a>These women have gone through huge emotional trauma in trying to conceive, about which we have heard much.

In my mind, that could be a red flag indicating that they might be particularly at risk in the future, because it would suggest that they had not come to terms with the situation&#151;unlike the patient treated on the aeroplane by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, who was not in a state of denial.</p>

In France, of course, under the <I>Code Napol&#233;on</I>, medical confidentiality is absolute. However, over many years the General Medical Council&#151;of which I once had the privilege to be president&#151;struggled with medical confidentiality issues and came up with the recognition that there are circumstances where it is perfectly proper for a doctor to breach confidentiality, not least in a situation such as assisting the police in the investigation of a serious crime. Even in a lesser situation, such as where an individual continues to drive against his or her doctor&#146;s advice despite having repeated epileptic attacks, the doctor has the right, after explaining everything to the patient, to report them to the licensing authorities. Many other exclusions can arise.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0801288000185"></a>One of the principles of medical care is that it is proper, usually with the patient&#146;s consent, to share medical information with other members of the healthcare team involved in the medical care of that individual. In that situation, because the rules relating to the HFEA and the disclosure of information about individuals who have undergone IVF treatment are so clear, so precise and so restrictive, there is every likelihood that a doctor involved in clinical practice&#151;not least in gynaecology or in giving advice on other infertility issues in the course of ordinary clinical practice&#151;may inadvertently breach the HFEA rules. That is particularly the case if the individual in question not only practises, say, as a gynaecologist or as someone interested in the problem of infertility, but works in a HFEA-licensed centre as a clinician. They could well be in breach of the Act and liable to criminal prosecution for revealing information about IVF treatment that had previously been undertaken, which would be clearly very important in the management of that individual&#146;s care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0801288000190"></a>My question is not in relation to the patient him or herself, which is obviously a matter to which noble Lords on all sides of the House have given attention. The problem is that, as I understand it, the amendment is anxious to use the information for the benefit of patients generally, for the practice of medical care and for everything that is in the amendment. I would have thought that of course the rest of the team will know who the patient is, but if you wish to disclose information about a particular case that could be of wider interest to the professions involved, surely anonymity is a protection.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0801288000191"></a>We had this over and again in debating the Human Tissue Act, which I am sorry to come back to again. It is the question of how far anonymising data would be a protection. If one is going to provide information, even to the extent of writing an article for a medical journal, you would not dream of mentioning the patient&#146;s name or anything else about him or her, because it would be anonymised. At the same time, there might be valuable information that should be available to the professions.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0801288000192"></a>The puzzled look on the face of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, suggests that I am barking up a very wrong tree; in which case I will sit down.</p>

I have always been slightly surprised that the issue is so powerful and emotive. Clearly, that was so when the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, did her report; and we have had the legislation that we have had. I say that because the first successful IVF treatment resulted in such huge coverage in every newspaper in the world. The birth of Louise Brown and the way in which it was reported sent a general feeling throughout the land about this treatment. I firmly believe it is in part because of that that today, informally, this is not a great matter of shame; it is very commonly talked about. I say that because, apart from the issues that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has rightly raised about the damaging limitations that these strictures place on care&#151;particularly the antenatal care of individual woman&#151;it is wise, when considering this matter, to take into account public opinion, which if anything has become much more open and well disposed towards disclosure over the past 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0801288000194"></a>In 2005, the department, as part of its review of the HFEA Act 1990, proposed that confidentiality provisions should be revised so that information about assisted reproductive treatment was treated in exactly the same way as any other medical information. That element of the consultation brought forward general agreement. People could not, in general, understand why this information should be treated differently. I note the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about anonymised data, but my understanding is that the amendment would simply replicate that which is in the Human Tissue Act, so there would be no question of individual patient data being widely reported outside the medical profession. That is not what is proposed, as indeed it should not be. The amendment would make a tremendous difference to healthcare practitioners

The issue calls for very careful consideration of the value of such information being shared&#151;for instance, with other health professionals involved in patients&#146; care&#151;balanced against the rights of patients to have their information treated confidentially.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0801288000196"></a>This is a complex area and it may be helpful if I outline the aims of the 1990 Act and the Bill in this respect. Essentially, the 1990 Act provides that the HFEA, people who work in licensed centres, and certain others, shall not release identifying information about certain types of patient, donors or those born as a result of certain types of treatment. The Act also provides exceptions to this prohibition so that it does not apply in specified circumstances. This recognises the principle of patient confidentiality while also acknowledging that there are circumstances where it may be appropriate to disclose such information. I also stress that it is not a case of disclosure being able to take place if the prohibitions in the 1990 Act and the Bill were not to apply. The provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 would remain relevant, as would the common law on confidentiality and other relevant laws.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0801288000197"></a>Clause 25 introduces new sections setting out in one place the prohibition on the disclosure of identifying information which the Act imposes and the exceptions to that prohibition. These sections consolidate the exceptions contained in the 1990 Act and add new ones. They also introduce a new regulation-making power subject to the affirmative procedure&#151;new Section 33C&#151;which will enable regulations to be made allowing the disclosure of identifying information without consent for the purposes of medical or other research which is necessary or expedient in the public interest, or in the interests of improving patient care. The regulations are required to be subject to consultation beforehand.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0801288000198"></a>The exceptions in the Bill have been extended in recognition of the fact that a wider range of people may now need access to the information held by licensed centres, the HFEA and others; for example, those working under a contract with the HFEA to discharge its statutory functions. The exceptions have also been extended to cover circumstances where the disclosure of information would be justified, such as disclosure of some types of information with the consent of persons to whom the information relates.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0801288000199"></a>Amendment No. 132 concerns one of the exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure I have already referred to&#151;subsection (2)(i) of new Section 33A. Currently, only recipients of infertility services can consent to their identifying information being disclosed. Those  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_461"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>born as a result of such services and donors may not do so. Further, only clinics can disclose information about recipients on the basis of their consent. The HFEA is currently not able to do so. The new exceptions included in new Section 33A address this. They will enable disclosure of information in certain circumstances, not only about recipients of services but also about those born as a result and about donors. The Government believe that these exceptions will be helpful in enabling researchers to access the data which the HFEA and clinics hold about patients&#146; treatment. It will also enable information to be disclosed for healthcare purposes or for any other purpose where the relevant consents have been obtained.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0801288000200"></a>The purpose of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment appears to be to simplify the circumstances in which the particular exception at subsection (2)(i) of new Section 33A will apply. The exception applies where the people identified in the information consent to its disclosure. It would not, however, enable disclosure of information to a person born as a result of treatment services when they are under age 18 or enable consent to be sought from such a person.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0801288000201"></a>The amendment is helpful. The provisions in the Bill are intended to simplify how the disclosure of identifying information with consent will work. I agree that the amendment would provide further simplification. On that basis I am happy to take it away for further consideration.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0801288000202"></a>Amendment No. 133 adds a further category to the list of exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure of identifying information contained in the Bill. It would introduce a wide-ranging exception, lifting the prohibition on disclosure without the patient&#146;s consent if, essentially, it is necessary or expedient in the public interest or in the interest of improving patient care. This would introduce a wide range of circumstances in which the prohibition on disclosure would not apply but where the patient&#146;s consent to disclosure has not been obtained. I understand that the noble Lord is seeking to ensure that the prohibition on disclosure is not unreasonable, but I can assure him that we have sought to provide in the Bill a comprehensive list of exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure so that the prohibition will not apply in circumstances where disclosure is justifiable.</p>

<a name="80128-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0801288000203"></a>The NHS code of practice on confidentiality makes clear that confidential patient information should generally be disclosed only for healthcare purposes or purposes associated with healthcare with patient consent. We have therefore extended the categories of person in the Bill who can consent to disclosure of their information. We do not consider it appropriate for disclosure to be possible in the wide range of circumstances set out in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, where the relevant consents have not been obtained. For instance, it would lift the prohibition on disclosure of information about a patient&#146;s care&#151;for example, for medical diagnosis&#151;where the patient does not consent to it. Further, the Government consider that the breadth of the exception would not provide sufficient certainty for the purpose of implementing the European Union tissue and cells directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0801288000204"></a>It may be helpful if I mention a couple of additional points. Some believe that disclosure can be made only to a named person and that this is unnecessarily prohibitive. But it is a misconception that disclosure of identifying information to health professionals can be disclosed only to a specific, named individual. That has not been the case since the amendments made to the 1990 Act by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Disclosure of Information) Act 1992. We have not included in new subsection (6C) of the 1990 Act a requirement that disclosure must be to a named person. In any event, the current legislation already exempts the need for a named individual where disclosure is in connection with the provision of treatment services for the person giving consent.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0801288000205"></a>There are also misconceptions about disclosure and written consent. Neither the 1990 Act nor the Bill requires consent to disclosure of identifying information to be in writing. It has to be said, however, that written consent does provide clarity that consent has been obtained.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0801288000206"></a>I listened carefully to points made in the debate, especially by those noble Lords who work in healthcare. The Government&#146;s considered view is that no further concessions are necessary in this area. However, it does seem to be the clear view of noble Lords that enabling further consent would be for the patient&#146;s well-being. Healthcare seems to be the reasoning behind their arguments. Therefore, it is beholden on me to take this amendment back and take another look at it. We will then see whether it might be appropriate to have a similar amendment in the other place and whether this would fit into the broader picture in relation to the Human Tissue Act, human rights legislation and other things. I do not know whether that will be possible, but I am willing to take it back and ask my colleagues in another place to have a look at it.</p>

A woman is attending for in vitro fertilisation and has started her treatment. As noble Lords will appreciate, it is an ongoing treatment. During the course of that treatment, some parallel evidence comes to light which suggests that there is a history of child abuse in that family. The only way of getting that information would be to seek advice, perhaps from another medical practitioner, possibly her general practitioner, but the patient refuses to give consent for any contact with another professional or with social services. What is the doctor&#146;s responsibility under the law? It is certainly not clear to me.</p>

Most of all, I thank those noble Lords who so strongly supported this amendment. I was merely a spokesman for colleagues, who hold a licence to treat infertile women and to provide in vitro treatment, and who come across this problem on a daily basis. The amendment clearly does not apply to situations in which gametes or embryos are donated. It applies to women who are undergoing in vitro fertilisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0801288000210"></a>I shall give another example of something that used to happen on a weekly basis. When my colleagues, who were treating patients with infertility, were successful in achieving pregnancy by in vitro fertilisation and their patient&#146;s care was passed on to me as an obstetrician, they used to have whisper the name of the patient to me in the corridor. I would then go and mark the notes with a red star so that my team would understand what that meant. Not being a licence-holder, presumably I was not committing a criminal act. However, if my colleague had put that down or written me a letter saying, &#147;Please look after this lady&#148;, that might, without consent, have been regarded as a criminal act.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0801288000211"></a>Therefore, there are issues to be handled. The Minister was hesitant in replying, which meant that she was finding difficulty in knowing why such draconian confidentiality rules are put there in the first place. They are draconian and unnecessary. We are talking about what is now a well accepted medical treatment for people who are infertile. It is not 1978, when Louise Brown was born. It is not even 1990, when this Act was passed. It is today and more than a million children are born through this procedure. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will know the exact figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0801288000226"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am sure that Ministers will be pleased to hear that this is the last of my amendments. It is a probing amendment that relates to the defences to the various criminal offences under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and the Bill. The penalties for those criminal offences are rather draconian, or rather stringent, as they probably ought to be but, none the less, there is a problem. A number of criminal offences are set out in the Bill. They include doing any of the following without a licence: storing gametes and creating, storing and using embryos. The terms &#147;embryos&#148; and &#147;gametes&#148; are, rightly, broadly defined in the Bill. For example, &#147;embryos&#148; include eggs that are in the process of fertilisation or are undergoing any other process capable of resulting in an embryo. &#147;Gametes&#148; are defined as including germ-line cells at any stage of maturity. The interpretation of both those terms, and therefore the application of the Bill and the requirement for licences are dependent on the current state of our scientific knowledge. However, our understanding of the processes by which eggs develop into embryos and cells develop into germ-line cells is incomplete. It is therefore possible that a researcher could store or carry out research on cells that are not at the outset of their research understood to be germ-line cells at any stage of maturity but, through developments in science, become recognised as early-stage germ-line cells, the storage or use of which requires a licence. It is also possible that a researcher could carry out procedures involving human cells that, contrary to current scientific understanding, give rise to gametes that are capable of resulting in embryos and are therefore embryos for the purposes of the Bill, the use and storage of which requires a licence.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0801288000227"></a>It is essential that all researchers who knew or should have known that they are storing or using gametes or creating, storing or using embryos and therefore require a licence should be liable to criminal charges if they fail to obtain one. However, there should be a defence in those limited circumstances where a researcher can prove that he or she reasonably believed that what he or she was storing or creating was not a gamete or an embryo as defined in the Bill. This is a very limited defence because in practice it is likely to arise only in circumstances where the HFEA itself did not recognise the activity at the time it was commenced as being regulated; otherwise the researcher&#146;s belief that the Act did not apply would generally have been unreasonable. Furthermore, under the defence, the researcher would have to cease the activity and seek a licence or destroy the material as soon as it became reasonably clear that that was necessary. I note that a similar defence is contained in the Human Tissue Act 2004. Ideally, it might have been better to amend the definitions, but that is probably not a viable option at this stage, or even in the near future. However, this is a real issue: the accidental creation of a parthenote is one such example, but there are many others. I ask the Minister to consider this amendment as a probing amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Generally speaking, in the range of laws limiting what a citizen can do, the argument that one does not know the law is not usually provided as a reason why the person concerned may be exempted from the law. Indeed, if that were the case, a great many laws could not be applied at all. In this instance, one would expect most researchers to be familiar with the law or to have an obligation to make themselves familiar with it.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08012814000002"></a>The other thing that troubles me very much about the amendment&#151;though I recognise that it is eminently sensible in many ways&#151;is how one proves that one did not know. It becomes a very subjective judgment whether the person concerned can show that they did not know what the legislation enabled them not to do. That troubles me because there would be a substantial reward for those who could go ahead with research that was not allowed by the licence but which could, if it happened, be beneficial in commercial terms.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08012814000003"></a>Those two worries are such that they make it impossible for me to accept or support the amendment. I thought that I should raise the issue early so that other noble Lords can see whether they share my concerns.</p>

I was delighted to hear my noble friend Lord Patel say that this was a probing amendment. Unlike the earlier amendments which he moved, when he put forward very good clinical grounds by centring on the care and the needs of the patient, this time we are looking at something altogether different. It is the retrospectivity of this that worries me in addition to the points that the noble Baroness has just made&#151;the ability to put something right after the event which is implied in the amendment. My noble friend said when he moved the amendment that he recognised&#151;these are his words&#151;that there should be stringent penalties and there ought to be proper prohibitions. I agree with him about that. The kind of people who will be carrying out this research, as the noble Baroness has just intimated, will be competent individuals who should have read the regulations and know the law.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08012814000005"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply in due course. In a way, however, I think that the answer to the conundrum that my noble friend offers the House is in the penultimate line of his amendment where he talks about &#147;reasonable grounds&#148;. If there are reasonable grounds and a researcher were to be prosecuted, then I am certain that the courts would find in favour of the litigant rather than on behalf of the person who was bringing the prosecution, possibly on vexatious grounds. I think that the answer is already in the amendment. I therefore hope that my noble friend will not feel the need to press this too far. </p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08012814000006"></a>All of us are worried about those who might try to circumvent the law. I know that the noble Lord would share my indignation should anyone seek to try and do that. He may well be correct that the definitions of gametes, embryos and cell lines defy our ability to be

However, anyone reading this legislation once it has passed, in conjunction with the <I>Hansard</I> reports accompanying it, will be in no doubt at all about what Parliament&#146;s intentions were. I would be nervous about anything that gave anybody literally &#147;a licence&#148; to circumvent procedures. I would be anxious about anything that seemed to dilute our determination to prosecute those who deliberately violated the law. I therefore hope that my noble friend will not feel the need to press this further today.</p>

As was frequently pointed out, what is reasonable to one person is not reasonable to another. I can think of at least one Bill that fell at that hurdle because there was no way of being absolutely certain that everyone would accept that something was &#147;reasonable&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08012814000008"></a>Another thing that worries me about the amendment is that it echoes some of the current problems with certain Members of Parliament saying, &#147;I thought I did adhere to all the rules and laws about money. Oh dear, I didn&#146;t&#151;but I was being perfectly reasonable&#148;. There is real danger in failing to acknowledge that Bills must be clear. We have been taught the lesson time and again even if we have not learnt it. Legislation must mean the same thing to different people. If it does not, it could be translated in a way that is very convenient to some people. I am not saying that I am against the amendment per se. I am just saying that the way in which it is worded will open great difficulties down the line.</p>

If Parliament is creating criminal offences with considerable penalties, it has a fundamental obligation to ensure that the terms used in the formulation of the offences are sufficiently clear so that anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the area will know whether he or she was transgressing the prohibitions.</p>

However, I may have misunderstood the thrust of his argument. If he was seeking to address the imprecision of the law rather than the inexactitude of the understanding of what the scientist was doing, we would obviously have to address the issue of the definitions in the Bill.</p>

Throughout its passage, they have been subject to unfair and somewhat crude criticism, not least the criticism that they have not sufficiently explained to the rest of us what they do. The evidence in all the briefings we have received is that the scientific community, the medical research charities and so on have gone to great lengths to try to explain to the rest of us things that, by definition, we do not know. It is precisely because scientists need to continue to enjoy the confidence of the general public that we believe that the amendment is misguided. I strongly agree with my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby that, in other walks of life, ignorance of the law is not a defence. I do not believe that a case has as yet been made suggesting that that should not apply here.</p>

<a name="80128-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08012814000012"></a>I listened closely to the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and I should like to ask him some questions. Can he say what is the likelihood of a researcher finding himself or herself in this position? Is it not the case that local ethics committees would be involved in licensing any research? Does that not therefore decrease the chances of a lone researcher committing the sort of offence outlined? Does he agree that if scientists at the cutting edge of knowledge are to continue to retain the general public&#146;s confidence, only the highest standards will be permissible? Should we therefore not seek in any way to dilute the penalties they face? If they put themselves in a position where there is a lack of clarity, the potential for things to go wrong&#151;badly wrong&#151;is immense.</p>

If the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, is right to suggest that the phraseology in legal terms used in the Act is insufficiently precise to define the circumstances that might lead to a breach of the Act being performed by a well-meaning individual carrying out research that he or she believed did not fall within the terms of the Act, then I would be greatly concerned. Equally, I would be greatly concerned if any attempt were made to make holes in the Act by passing an amendment that would make it possible for the unlicensed person to experiment on gametes or human embryos without being subject to the full force of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08012814000014"></a>My reading of the very carefully expressed wording of this amendment, so well proposed by my noble friend Lord Patel, would lead me to believe that the amendment deals solely with the very exceptional circumstance where an individual working with cells who was not licensed under the Act&#151;cells which he or she firmly and sincerely believed were not anything to do with the terms set out in the Act&#151;might be subject to criminal sanctions. I wish to be reassured that the Act as it stands is sufficiently precise for that circumstance not to arise. While I have every reason to feel that the Act must be sufficiently clear to prevent the so-called cowboy from experimenting in this highly sensitive field, at the same time the well-meaning and well-intentioned researcher must not be put in hazard, which was the purpose of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

I think that he would have been able to protect himself and that he should have protected himself. Although I understand the case that has been made by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and by others that some sort of defence of this sort is necessary, I go back to my early training in the law and say that ignorance of the law is not a defence.

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08012814000020"></a>This is of course a complex area of the law, and situations may arise where scientists are working within ill defined parameters and experimentation sometimes produces different results from those expected. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Patel, outlined areas where specific problems arise. However, like the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, I do not believe that ignorance of the law in these areas should be a valid defence. This is a

As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, if anyone is in doubt, they simply have to pick up the phone and consult the HFEA.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08012814000021"></a>For proceedings to be brought to prosecute someone under the 1990 Act, the Crown Prosecution Service must first obtain consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is not a common proceeding for criminal offences, and is reserved for offences where weighing the discretionary factors relevant to the decision to prosecute is likely to be a sensitive and difficult task. This therefore makes it desirable for the Crown Prosecution Service to obtain prior approval for a prosecution. If an offence is committed under the 1990 Act, the facts of the case would be looked at carefully and in detail before any proceedings were brought, as this is such a complex area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08012814000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, said that the Human Tissue Act had a similar defence and asked why it was not appropriate for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill also to have a similar defence. Although this is a defence under the Human Tissue Act, the activities that require a licence under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 relate to the handling of human embryos and gametes, and the sensitivity of these activities means that it is imperative that scientists are aware of whether their activities require a licence under the Act. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned ethics committees. I believe that she is correct that ethics committees also consider applications for licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08012814000023"></a>This is a very complex area, but at this time I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I particularly welcome the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. He has, in his customary manner, hit the nail on the head: the issue is that the imprecision of the definitions may lead to this problem. I fully subscribe to the comment made by some noble Lords that ignorance of the law is no defence. I do not challenge that whatsoever, despite the fact that the law might have been framed in the ignorance of science, which probably is a defence.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08012814000025"></a>The current definitions are widely wide, which is probably wise, because that allows the regulator to consider current technology and foreseeable developments when granting and monitoring the licence. I am not talking about people deliberately setting out to break the law when they carry out research; I am talking about scientists doing bona fide research who accidentally stumble upon something because of science that falls under the Act, and who therefore, though they stop any further experiments, fall guilty of the offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08012814000026"></a>Let me give an example. An oocyte that has been activated either by fertilisation or artificially is a reasonable definition of the beginnings of an embryo&#151;so it might be hard to argue against the definition. You could say that it is really at the first mitotic division, as that is when the maternal and paternal DNA first get  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_470"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together. But that does not work for a parthenogenetically activated oocyte, as there is no paternal DNA. Where researchers are working on trying to improve or determine the quality of the egg that will lead to success in in vitro fertilisation, the intention of such research is to understand the molecular signals rather than to initiate cell division. However, very occasionally an egg that has been cultured may spontaneously divide. Under the current definition of the Act, those researchers will require a licence. If they stop further research and report it, will they then be liable? Can there be a vexatious litigation against them?</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08012814000027"></a>A definition that said that only an embryo at the two-cell, eight-cell or blastocyst stage was acceptable might be hard to defend, as each definition would be a little arbitrary. However, the point at which the embryonic genome becomes active at the four-cell stage in humans, when development no longer relies only on maternal&#151;that is, oocyte-derived &#151;products, would make some sense scientifically. I am merely giving examples of how definitions used in the Act do not conform with the developing science.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08012814000028"></a>In terms of science, the Bill includes the definition of an embryo as an egg undergoing any other process capable of resulting in an embryo. The regulators have previously decided that a parthenote&#151;a dividing unfertilised egg&#151;is an embryo. Important research is being undertaken to understand the process by which eggs divide just before fertilisation. Errors at this stage of reproduction result in infertility failure, miscarriages and abnormalities in the foetus. This research has to be approved by the research ethics committee. That does not currently require an HFEA licence. Centres are carrying out such research on eggs and, as I said, the intention of that research is to understand the molecular signals rather than to initiate cell division. It is not appropriate to require an HFEA licence for all research on live human eggs simply to avoid a rare unplanned and unanticipated event. Such increased bureaucracy will seriously discourage research in the field. It is not my intention to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08012814000029"></a>This was a probing amendment to identify that there are areas where the researchers&#151;scientists working on stem cell lines and not on embryos, for example&#151;fall outside the regulation. In an attempt to understand how these lines differentiate&#151;and this is a true example&#151;those scientists found that adding in some factors took those lines one step forward to differentiation into different cell types. In an attempt to take it another step forward, when they added other factors they found that the lines retracted and they were back to stage one. If they had retracted further and gone back to the blastocyst stage, which could well happen, it would mean the creation of an embryo without a licence. The researchers would have had to stop that research, inform the regulators and take advice. They understand that. They do not intend to break the law. I was probing accidental happenings that fall within the law. I hope that I have made my point and that there will be enough on the record so that scientists who do not deliberately set out to break the law but who accidentally fall into this trap will be helped by this discussion and avoid any vexatious litigation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08012814000039"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, we come to an issue that has not previously been raised in our debates&#151;surrogacy. Surrogate parenthood is a practice that has grown in popularity in a number of countries around the world in recent years. Canada, Ukraine and California are examples of jurisdictions in which legislation is in place that could be seen as actively encouraging surrogacy. The usual arrangement is that the male partner in a marriage or heterosexual relationship or one partner in a male single-sex relationship will provide the sperm that will fertilise the egg of a donor and the resulting embryo will be implanted into the carrying mother, who is usually described as a &#147;surrogate mother&#148; or &#147;gestational carrier&#148;. In other cases, the female commissioning parent may be the genetic parent; in yet others, both commissioning parents are the genetic parents.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08012814000040"></a>In the three jurisdictions that I mentioned, surrogacy contracts have legal effect. Contracts will be entered into between the egg donor and the commissioning parents, and between the carrying mother and her husband, if she has one, and the commissioning parents, which provide that the child will be delivered into their custody on birth and that the egg donor and carrying mother, and her husband, relinquish all rights. The court then makes an order declaring the commissioning parents to be the legal parents and the child is registered as the child of the commissioning parents.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08012814000041"></a>In English law, contracts of this kind have no force or effect, nor do any orders or registrations that are made pursuant to them. Section 27 of the 1990 Act provides that, if a child is being carried by a woman who has been artificially inseminated or has had introduced into her eggs and sperm or an embryo, that woman is to be treated as the mother for all purposes; no other person is to be regarded as the mother, whether or not she is genetically related to the child,  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and wherever this takes place. That provision gives the carrying woman parental status and parental responsibility, which can be lost only through a parental order or through adoption.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08012814000042"></a>Under Section 28(2), reproduced in this Bill in Clause 35, if a woman who is a party to a marriage is carrying a child as the result of the placing in her of eggs and sperm or an embryo, or by artificial insemination, and the creation of the embryo carried by her was not brought about with the sperm of the other party to the marriage, the other party to the marriage is to be treated as the father of the child unless it is shown that he did not consent to the treatment by which she became pregnant. This is irrespective of the fact that the husband may have consented to his wife carrying the baby under a surrogacy arrangement. The genetic father is to be,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000099"></a>&#147;treated in law as not being the father for any purpose&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000084"></a>It is clear from the House of Lords debates in 1990 that Section 28(2) was intended to cover the position of conventional donor insemination, when a couple want to create a family for themselves and the sperm donor wishes nothing to do with the child. There was only a passing reference to surrogacy in the debates, when it was said that there would not be many such cases and that the commissioning parents would have to apply to adopt. However, no thought appears to have been given to the international dimension.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08012814000043"></a>In a case such as the one that I described, the effect of Section 28(2) in English law is that the child will always be the child of the carrying mother and of her husband, if she is married. I repeat that this is translated into this Bill in Clause 35. In international law, where there is a court order and registration of the surrogacy arrangement, the child is legally the child of the commissioning parents in the state of origin. Thus, if a child is conceived and born abroad as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, registered as the child of the commissioning parents in that jurisdiction and subsequently brought into this country, significant problems arise. The child will be, in effect, parentless and stateless. In the state of origin he is the child of the commissioning parents, while in our law he is the child of the carrying mother and her husband; the commissioning parents have no status. If the commissioning parents happen to be British, the child would have no right to British citizenship and would technically be an illegal immigrant if brought here. On the other hand, if the child were brought here, it would be impossible for the court to send him back to the state of origin, because the surrogate mother there has no parental rights.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08012814000044"></a>There are only two solutions for the commissioning parents under current law: a private fostering arrangement or a parental order. Private fostering entails local authority supervision, with its attendant inquiries and monitoring. To qualify for a parental order, an applicant has to meet a number of clear conditions, one of which is that the application has to be made within six months of the birth. If this condition is not met, the commissioning parents would have only one other option in order to acquire the legal status of parents, which is to apply for an adoption order. However, that process takes at least three years and the outcome is by  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_473"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no means guaranteed. Let us remember that this is a situation where the man who has commissioned the child is also that child&#146;s genetic father, yet in law they are treated as being unrelated.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08012814000045"></a>The anomaly, however, is that if the surrogate mother is not married, most of these problems do not arise. I am talking here about a surrogate mother who is overseas. In such a case, the genetic father is the natural putative father of the child and the child is treated as his illegitimate child. Thus the father is able to apply for parental responsibility, which the carrying mother can also grant by agreement; he can also apply, as of right, for Section 8 Children Act orders. He does not have to notify the local authority if the child is living with him; he can apply to adopt after the child has been living with him for 10 weeks, or for six months if adopting with a partner; and the child is entitled to British citizenship, succession rights and the rights that follow from being his child for the purpose of prohibited degrees of relationships. None of those things applies if the surrogate mother is married.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08012814000046"></a>A big question arises as to whether our law and this Bill are human rights compliant. In my opinion&#151;I say this having received advice from a QC in this field&#151;there are strong arguments that, in its effect in surrogacy cases, Section 28(2) of the 1990 Act and, therefore, Clause 35 of this Bill are in breach of the rights to private and family life, particularly in respect of immigration and in relation to both child and genetic parent, and probably to the genetic parent&#146;s spouse or partner as well. There may be cases where a parental order is not available&#151;for instance, where consent is withdrawn&#151;in which case the lack of ability to apply for, or be granted, parental responsibility will create a serious problem, particularly in the context of the period that must elapse before an adoption application can be commenced. The fact that the child born to the unmarried surrogate has a wholly different status and the father of such a child has radically different rights and responsibilities seems to me to be anomalous.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08012814000047"></a>I have covered only in outline the various ramifications of this issue and, rather than detaining the House further, I simply ask the Minister to give an undertaking to take these matters away and examine them carefully prior to Third Reading. They need to be properly grappled with. I beg to move.</p>

It is a complex area, even if no international element is involved. We advise couples who are contemplating surrogacy to take expert legal advice at an early stage, certainly before deciding whether to proceed. That would be the case whether the surrogacy were to be in the UK or elsewhere. A range of complex issues affects the law on surrogacy&#151;whose gametes will be used, whether the surrogate is married, the country where the surrogacy takes place, the laws in that country in relation to parenthood following surrogacy and the recognition of those laws in this country. It is  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_474"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not an arrangement that should be undertaken lightly. In the same way, I do not want to attempt to answer the points raised by the noble Earl without reflecting carefully on them and getting proper guidance.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08012814000050"></a>However, I will briefly describe the clauses to which the noble Earl refers. The purpose of Clause 35(2) is to make it clear that, where a married couple is treated with donor gametes, whether the treatment is in the United Kingdom or abroad, the husband of the woman who is treated is the father of the child. That applies unless it is shown that he did not consent to that treatment. This simple provision recognises the parenthood of married men when their wives have babies and donated gametes are used to conceive the child. For the provision to have effect, the conception must involve assisted conception. Clause 35 will not apply if the conception is as a result of sexual intercourse. The provision is there to make it clear that, if a married woman conceives a child through the use of donor gametes in whatever circumstances, her husband is the father as long as he consented to the use of the donor gametes.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08012814000051"></a>Clause 54 is about the conditions that must apply before a parental order, which is a fast-track adoption, can be given by a court. Parental orders are given in very specific circumstances to transfer the parenthood of a child to the commissioning couple following a surrogacy arrangement. They are a form of light-touch adoption, in terms of the processes that will be applied, because one of the commissioning parents must be a genetic parent of the child. The social services are alerted to cases of surrogacy but, for the parental order to be given, the lengthy process of determining the suitability of various couples for the adoption of the child will not be engaged because one or both of the new parents will be a biological parent.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08012814000052"></a>The Bill proposes that the eligibility for parental orders be extended so that civil partners and unmarried couples may apply rather than just married couples. For the order to be given, either or both of the applicants must be domiciled in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. The amendment seeks to remove this provision. The noble Earl raises important potential problems relating to children born of surrogate mothers who are married and living overseas. He cited what could be strong arguments that Clause 35 is in breach of human rights law. I am certainly not in a position to respond today, but I will take the issue away and come back at Third Reading. Therefore, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</p>

Your Lordships will be relieved to know that this has nothing whatever to do with any kind of definition; it is a simpler issue.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08012814000058"></a>One of the situations covered by Clause 46 is that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000100"></a>&#147;the child has been carried by W as the result of placing in her of an embryo&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000085"></a>That is the first point, which relates to what I assume is not the natural way of doing what was intended here, although it might be enough to cover that. Secondly, it must be that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000101"></a>&#147;the embryo was created at a time when W was a party to a civil partnership&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000086"></a>So, at the time of the creation of the embryo there has to have been a civil partnership. Then, it must be that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000102"></a>&#147;the other party to the civil partnership died before the placing of the embryo in the woman&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000087"></a>There was, then, some interval of time between the creation of the embryo and the placing of it in the woman W&#151;&#147;W&#148; seems to be the initial that one uses for a woman in this provision. That interval might be quite long, depending on the circumstances. Then it must be that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000103"></a>&#147;the other party to the civil partnership consented in writing (and did not withdraw the consent) ... to the placing of the embryo in W after the death of the other party&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000059"></a>I assume that the consent was given before her death, but she consented to the placing of the embryo in W after her death. She had also to agree,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000104"></a>&#147;to being treated for the purpose mentioned in subsection (4) as the parent of any resulting child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000088"></a>The purpose mentioned in Clause 46(4) is to be registered as a parent, and nothing more than that.</p>

<a name="80128-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08012814000060"></a>You start off with a situation in which this person who was a party to a civil partnership has agreed to these two particular conditions. Now what happens to the child? Possibly more than one child is born because it is at the embryo stage. It then must be that W&#151;the lady carrying the child or children&#151;has,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000105"></a>&#147;elected in writing not later than the end of the period of 42 days from the day on which the child was born for the other&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000089"></a>party to the civil partnership,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000106"></a>&#147;to be treated for the purpose mentioned in subsection (4) as the parent of the child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000090"></a>This person, who may have been dead for quite a long time, is to be treated as the parent of the child for the purpose of registration if the woman who has carried the child decides that that should be so&#151;and not otherwise. If all this happens, the provision is that the child will be registered with this dead woman as a parent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08012814000061"></a>What is the purpose of this provision? It seems an elaborate provision to secure a registration. The answer is to be found in Clause 48(4). It says there that, where Clause 46(1) or (2) apply&#151;I have taken only the example of Clause 46(1), but the considerations are similar for Clause 46(2)&#151;the deceased woman,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000107"></a>&#147;is to be treated in law as a parent of the child for the purpose mentioned in section 46(4)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012814000091"></a>that is, for registration. Yet, she,</p>
<ul><a name="08012814000108"></a>&#147;is to be treated in law as not being a parent of the child for any other purpose&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08012814000062"></a>The only purpose for which all this elaborate procedure is designed is to secure that the dead woman is named on the child&#146;s birth certificate. I cannot understand the purpose of that; you cannot rely on it for any other purpose, according to the provision that I have just read. I am interested to know what good it does to put on to the register of births, marriages and deaths the name of a deceased person who is not to be treated as the parent of the child for any other purpose than to appear in the registration. That seems to require some explanation.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08012814000063"></a>My other point is that the Government have been reluctant, despite some people wishing it, to require donor conceptions to be marked on the register. Yet this will inevitably mean that the child in question is marked on the register as donor conceived because there is no way in which two women&#151;one the mother and the other a parent&#151;could have produced the child in any other way given the present status of science. That is the present situation, whatever the future may hold. Therefore, this measure would inevitably result in putting on the register the fact that this child is donor conceived when the Government have declined to do that in respect of other donor-conceived children.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08012814000064"></a>Moreover, this type of provision is apt to be blamed on scientists. Sometimes people say that scientists, including doctors, have developed all these procedures. But this is nothing to do with that science; some other motivation is behind this measure. I am not sure exactly what it is; perhaps we shall hear. However, one of the results is that the child in respect of whom this provision applies will be strongly differentiated from the vast majority of other children. Therefore, the equality agenda under which all this appears to have taken place seems to apply only to adults; the children will be subject to severe differentiation in the application of this doctrine. I await with interest the response to the suggestion that this clause be deleted. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08012814000066"></a>I should make it clear what the Bill does in respect of same-sex couples and birth certificates. At present, we have the invidious situation where the female partner of a woman who gives birth following assisted reproduction treatment is not recognised as a parent of the child. I say it is invidious not only because it causes a disparity between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples, but because this means that the child would have a &#147;legal&#148; relationship with only one parent and not two. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 allowed for the acquisition of parental responsibility, but it did not provide for joint legal parenthood following assisted conception treatment.

The amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, would take these provisions out of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08012814000068"></a>A number of consequences flow from the information recorded in the birth register. Birth certificates are used as prime evidence of status as well as rights to benefits, passports, inheritance, and parentage. For example, where parents are not married to each other, the father will acquire parental responsibility by registering the child jointly with the child&#146;s mother under the Children Act 1989, or, for Scotland, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, as amended by the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, or in Northern Ireland, the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. In addition, a child&#146;s birth is required to be reregistered under the Legitimacy Act 1976 when the parents marry after the birth, thus providing evidence of legitimation. A further example is that a father named on a birth certificate is evidence for liability for child support payments.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08012814000069"></a>Birth registration needs to be updated with our changing times. When the 1990 Act came into force it allowed for fathers to be recorded on a child&#146;s birth certificate, following assisted conception treatment, where they were not in fact the genetic father of the child because donated sperm was used. The 1990 Act specifically excludes the sperm donor from being the father of any child born through assisted conception as a result of his donation. Therefore, where donated sperm or eggs are used, the birth certificate does not record the donor as a parent, and therefore is no longer a record of genetic parentage.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08012814000070"></a>Currently, where a single woman receives infertility treatment at a licensed centre, only one name would go on the child&#146;s birth certificate. I am of the view that where there would not be a father, but there would be a same-sex partner, surely it must follow that having two legal parents recorded is better than only having one.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08012814000071"></a>I believe that by allowing same-sex couples legal responsibility for a child born through assisted conception treatment, we are also safeguarding the welfare of the child. We must all recognise that same-sex couples do have children. However, on occasion female couples may need infertility treatment to help them have a child, as do heterosexual couples. By allowing them to go to a licensed centre and both register as the child&#146;s parents we hope we would dissuade same-sex couples from carrying out unlicensed self-insemination at home. It also means that, in the event that something happened to the mother, there is another person who is the legal parent of that child.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08012814000072"></a>Let me again clarify that birth certificates will not record that a child will have two mothers. The Bill sets out that the woman who gives birth to the child will be the mother and her female partner will be recorded as a parent. That is not a wholly new concept. Currently, if a same-sex female couple have a child as a result of assisted conception treatment, only the mother&#146;s name will go on the birth certificate. If the second parent then goes through the process of  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_478"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adopting the child, an adoption certificate will be produced that has the mother&#146;s name and the name of the second parent.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08012814000073"></a>For married couples there is a presumption of legitimacy, when a child is born, that the husband of the mother is the father of the child, and he will automatically be recorded as such on the birth certificate unless proven otherwise. As your Lordships will recognise, there are already births recorded where the husband of the mother is not in fact the genetic father and another man is. If the mother conceals that fact or is not certain which man is the father of her child, the birth register will contain an inaccuracy. I am not insinuating that that is acceptable behaviour; I am merely using this as an example to explain that birth certificates cannot necessarily be relied on to trace one&#146;s genetic heritage.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08012814000074"></a>With this in mind, the clauses in the Bill which confer legal parenthood on female second parents, and make consequential amendments to birth registration law, are there so that second female parents can have the same responsibilities entrusted to them as any mother or father.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08012814000075"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 142. The Bill consolidates the provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003 into the 1990 Act and extends them to same-sex couples. The 2003 Act allows for the registration of a man as a father to a child born as a result of assisted reproduction with donor sperm, when the embryo was created before his death but had not been transferred to his partner before he died. Clause 46 seeks to address any disparity by extending this provision to same-sex couples. In the case of female civil partners or female couples who are not civil partners, the Bill allows for the partner who would have been the parent of the child to be registered as such on the register of births if she dies before the embryo is transferred.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08012814000076"></a>These provisions are intended to address a tragic scenario. They will apply where a couple have started assisted reproduction treatment to have a child together using donor sperm and an embryo has been created, but the partner of the prospective mother dies before the treatment has been completed.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08012814000077"></a>The law applies for heterosexual couples, and I cannot see why it would not apply to single-sex couples, taking into consideration that the mother or the parent will have the choice of making that registration. In such rare situations, there are safeguards in place to ensure that the name is only recorded on the child&#146;s birth certificate with the knowledge and consent of both parties. The provision allows for the child, in these circumstances, which are rare, to have two parents recorded on the birth certificate rather than one.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08012814000078"></a>To sum up, all the provisions that I have outlined are in place to correct the current disparity and in turn to help safeguard the welfare of the child born through assisted conception treatment. Having two parents recorded on the birth certificate will help to achieve that. I invite the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08012824000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 144. Noble Lords will remember that on Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who was then in fine health, proposed that there should be a human bioethics commission in this country, with a lengthy, detailed schedule indicating the ways in which the commission might be composed and the functions that it would have to carry out. That was followed by a speech by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who spoke in some detail a month ago on the proposal. Therefore, I do not intend to cover the ground again, except for very briefly. However, I will deal with a number of issues that have been raised since then in this House in debate and try to show that some of them are, to a great extent, due to a misconception.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08012824000003"></a>First, such a commission would be appointed by the Secretary of State. Secondly, it would cover a wide range of relevant occupations&#151;medical practitioners, research scientists, philosophers, ethicists and others who are concerned with science and the way in which science should be assisted and encouraged to be understood by a much wider public. Its functions would include monitoring scientific advances in bioethics, considering the ethical issues that arise and looking at the consequences of legislation passed by Parliament&#151;I stress this&#151;in the light of subsequent evidence.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08012824000004"></a>We have as a House very much embraced the idea of pre-legislative scrutiny, to excellent effect. By and large, the legislation that comes before us that has been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny is markedly better composed than that which has not. I strongly suggest that we also badly need post-legislative scrutiny. Very often when we pass legislation we do not know subsequently whether it has been to useful effect. If I may say so, with only a very brief reversion to a different subject altogether, if the Home Office had learnt to scrutinise in a post-legislative way, we might all have been spared a very great deal of pain over recent years.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_480"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08012824000005"></a>My specific point on post-legislative scrutiny&#151;we make almost no provision for it in the legislation that we pass&#151;is relevant to the issue of scientific research. We have excellent debates. Over recent days, I have enjoyed what I can describe only as an incredibly intense tutorial in embryology and human fertilisation. I note that, very kindly, the Chief Whip is nodding to that. Those of us who are not scientists feel that we have gained an immense amount by sparing the time to be present during these debates.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08012824000006"></a>The last time we discussed human embryology and fertilisation was in 2001 when the previous regulations were debated, and before that it was in 1990. That is three occasions for a major detailed debate over nearly 20 years. That is hardly adequate for the extraordinarily fast-moving scientific scene, when literally month by month one learns about discoveries, breakthroughs and new pieces of research, many of which raise the most intense ethical considerations. One of the arguments for a bioethics commission would be precisely to enable us to keep in touch with scientific advance, discuss it and look most closely at some of the ethical issues that necessarily flow from it.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08012824000007"></a>In passing, I shall deal with one point made earlier. My noble friend Lady Barker referred&#151;she could not have said anything more important&#151;to the need to maintain public confidence in scientific research and in support for scientific research. I stress that because we are in a delicate situation in which public confidence could be lost quite rapidly. There are already considerable concerns. Anyone who reads the red-topped tabloids will know how extensive those concerns are and the extent to which scientific results are characterised in a way that is possibly partly intended to frighten people. Consequently, if there is no sense that Parliament and other bodies that represent the public are in close touch with what is going on, it will be relatively easy to lose that essential confidence. In this country we have not done so, so far. However, as we proceed with more and more unusual scientific discoveries and research, that danger grows, month by month.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08012824000008"></a>We have to ask why there was such a chilly response in the House to the concept of a human bioethics commission. I shall deal, one by one but very quickly, with the objections that have been raised. I believe that they are based on a fundamental misconception of what is being proposed by my colleague the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and of the arguments for a human bioethics commission. The first objection&#151;I have to be frank&#151;is that it would be a way in which the scientific luddites would get into a position to stop essential scientific research. Understandably there is a great deal of concern about scientific luddites, by which I mean people who simply have an obscurantist and negative view of any scientific research.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08012824000009"></a>I find it hard to recognise that concern, which is about those appointed to a bioethics commission, given that the proposal made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, was precisely that the appointments should be made by the Secretary of State. That is in line with bioethics commissions in many other countries. In Australia the appointments are made by a Minister; in Germany the appointments are made by the Chancellor, the head of the Government; and in other countries  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_481"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one can see a consistent pattern of appointments taking that form. It is simply beyond belief that the Secretary of State could appoint a whole lot of obscurantist&#151;let me be blunt&#151;nutcases to sit on a bioethics commission. He or she would have to answer for that and the House would make life very hard for him or her if a whole set of appointments was essentially driven by dogmatism, and not by an attempt to represent genuinely held and indeed intellectually well argued opinions across the whole spectrum.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08012824000010"></a>The second argument is that the characteristic of religious and, again, obscurantist, societies is to suggest that there should be a human bioethics commission. This simply flows from an extraordinary lack of knowledge, to which I will come back in a moment or two. The third objection, with which I will also deal briefly, is that it adds yet another layer of delay, regulation and general bureaucratic obstacles to be presented to scientific researchers.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08012824000011"></a>I have already pointed out on the first argument that, in almost every case of a human bioethics commission anywhere in the rest of Europe and other parts of the world, particularly North America, the appointments are made by a Minister or a yet more senior figure, the head of Government. That objection therefore falls.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08012824000012"></a>I read the second argument repeated in <I>Hansard</I> extraordinarily often in our earlier debate. Let us pause for a moment: which countries have human bioethics commissions? Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada and the United States. Of this group, a subsection is regarded as consisting of some of the most liberal societies in the world: the Scandinavians. All have a human bioethics commission, some with slightly different names, but all addressing ethical issues in medicine and human biology. All are deeply concerned with trying to educate their publics in what is meant by and involved in scientific research.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08012824000013"></a>In addition to those countries, I may include every one of our co-members of the European Union&#151;with the exception of the recent central European members of the European Commission that have only just got the idea and come on board&#151;which attempt to conduct some form of educative approach to the general public. In the most remarkable case&#151;surprisingly, you might think, the Republic of Ireland&#151;the bioethics commission not only produces detailed reports on issues of public controversy but, uniquely among this whole group of countries, invites the public to comment before the report is approved by the Irish D il. Every single public comment is taken into account, discussed, considered and replied to, subject to parliamentary debate on the issue. There is no more complete effort at involving and empowering the public in discussions on scientific research than in the Republic of Ireland. However, others, notably Germany and the Scandinavian countries, make huge efforts in mounting seminars, discussions and sometimes meetings around the country to discuss these issues. Incidentally, there is a far more complete effort at education of the public in some of these countries&#151;although not all&#151;than in our own country, where much of the discussion is basically still in relatively private circumstances.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08012824000014"></a>One country in this list where the discussion of human biological ethics has been politicised is of course the United States of America. The President dismissed the whole bioethics commission and replaced it with his own appointees, making a condition of that appointment that people had to be opposed to embryonic stem cell research. That was not what our debate suggested in this House, which was something very different: that human bioethics commissions belong to those simply trying to oppose scientific research.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08012824000015"></a>In this country, we undoubtedly have some remarkable debate on bioethics. We know the distinguished record of the Nuffield Foundation and the body associated with the University of St Andrews which has engaged in detailed consideration of bioethics issues in Scotland. There are two great differences between these British bodies and the rest of Europe. First, they have no accountability whatever to Parliament and the public, whereas all the other countries have. Secondly, they are not publicly financed, as are the bioethics commissions in all those other countries. That is bound to raise some questions about whether there are interests to be considered, given the financial support that comes, in this country, entirely from the private sector. Does that matter? Yes, as it raises questions about how objective our consideration of bioethics issues is.</p>
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="80128-0007.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="08012824000063"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08012824000016"></a>I recently went to a seminar at the Nuffield Foundation and was extremely impressed by it. It was very good indeed. However, that is hardly the point. There should be a body that is accountable to Parliament and to the public in a formal sense, not least because, frankly, COMETT&#151;the body that brings together all the European bioethics committees&#151;is the one that decides whether, for example, the European Commission should propose that cloning be forbidden throughout Europe. That is an important part of strengthening the regulations and issues which we have been discussing in this House. We are no longer a country entirely on our own. Few things are internationally more mobile than work on reproductive and other bioethical issues&#151;I can hardly think of any. The brilliant exposition of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has just been on the effects of the transportation of these ethical issues from one country to another, and the fact that laws are not generalised but specific. The one area in which they become generalised is the European Union, where we have no official standing.</p>

<a name="80128-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08012824000017"></a>Before coming to my conclusion, let me say that voices have been raised, perfectly properly, suggesting that we should have a parliamentary Select Committee on bioethics. That is fine by me&#151;it is an excellent idea. In no way is there an exclusive alternative between a bioethics commission charged with responsibility to educate and involve the public in discussion of such issues, and a parliamentary Select Committee charged with responsibility to scrutinise and supervise in those long gaps&#151;I repeat, three debates in 20 years on the issue&#151;which now eventuate crucial scientific questions in an extraordinarily fast-moving scene. A parliamentary Select Committee would be good, but it does not offer an alternative.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08012824000018"></a>I have to say something that I believe is highly relevant to the discussion. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, in an article printed in the <I>Observer </I>two weeks ago argued that, above all, bioethics was a question which properly belonged to the responsibility of Parliament. I am not going to disagree with her about that. That is a perfectly fair point&#151;except, one has to add, speaking as someone who spent nearly 20 years as a Member in the other place, that there are two kinds of vote in Parliament. One is a free vote, where people decide, on the basis of what they have heard and after discussion, what they think the proper judgment ought to be. The other kind is a whipped Vote. We have been speaking today&#151;quite properly and with huge respect&#151;about the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, the Chief Whip, who is just retiring. I can think of few people who I would regard as a more outstanding example of a sympathetic, thoughtful and careful Chief Whip than him. I add that I am long enough in the tooth in government to know that there have to be whipped votes a good deal of the time in order to get the Government&#146;s business through&#151;that is the Whips&#146; job. However, in a democracy, that is only a sustainable argument if one recognises that there are some areas where people&#146;s consciences are involved in such a way that they should not be compelled to vote against them.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08012824000019"></a>I believe, and I will put it very strongly, that the right process was that which took place during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill in 1990&#151;one of the best Bills passed through this House. On this occasion, as we all know perfectly well, the government side has been very strictly whipped. That does not make it immoral, but it means that the outcomes do not reflect the judgments of this set of individuals as being not under pressure to move one way rather than the other.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08012824000020"></a>A Government also have a right to push for Bills that they believe in. The Government have a right to press for this country to be the leading place in which human biology is conducted. There are arguments for that. However, we are entitled to ask, sometimes, what those motives might be. The Government may well see a remarkable opportunity for the country, one that arises from the gridlock in the United States over the issue of embryonic stem cell therapies and research. That has driven many outstanding scientists to this country from the US, where, unquestionably, there was bigotry on this issue on a large scale, and it came from the very top.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08012824000021"></a>It is also the case that being the leading country in the field of human biology carries a huge responsibility to stay within the bounds of what prevents, as described by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury when last in this House, turning human beings into instruments for the purpose of commercial outcomes. We must be frank&#151;the commercial pressures in this field are immense and potentially going to grow month by month.

The social consequences of that are absolutely terrifying. They are consequences of producing a warrior people&#151;a warrior race, if you like. We have to think about the social consequences. That is the argument for a human bioethics commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08012824000023"></a>I will not go on, except to say that this case has been very much understated. We have to ask ourselves why every other European democracy, from Scandinavia to Spain, has a human bioethics commission or an equivalent. Here we go again in the United Kingdom&#151;we do not need these things; we know what to do without having to bother with a bioethics commission. Would that were so. I believe there is potential against what are fragile dikes at present. I will mention just three before I sit down.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08012824000024"></a>The first is the fragile dike of the embryo&#146;s destruction after 14 days&#151;that is absolutely necessary and right, but anyone who lives in this world knows that it is relatively fragile. The second fragile dike is that of forbidding cloning. We badly need international legislation but have not got it. There is no United Nations ban on cloning, nor yet even an EU one. There is huge pressure from people under the illusion that nothing could be better for the world than that they be immortalised for the future. Lastly, and I have mentioned it already and will therefore be brief, there is the refusal to allow the selection of a child&#146;s sex. That, too, is a very fragile dike. If we are to remain in a civilised world&#151;one that fully accepts the huge benefits of science, but recognises that there are limits to what people should do in using other people for certain purposes&#151;then these dikes must hold. We need all the help we can get in doing that. I beg to move.</p>

This House is endowed with a wide range of Peers who are extremely well informed on matters of ethics and bioethics, and our current debates are testament to that fact. However, it is clear that we do not have a monopoly on this type of information, and it is important that we, and the Government as a whole, have access to carefully considered evidence on bioethical matters derived from a wide variety of shades of opinion and expertise outside this House. The question then is how we can best gain that information and advice. We have the excellent Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which the noble Baroness mentioned. It produces authoritative and valuable reports that have important educational value for the public as well as for us. However, its reports are on very important topics it has chosen itself, and it is not clear that it would take very seriously any specific topics chosen for it by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08012824000026"></a>On the other hand, noble Lords have access to the remarkably effective Select Committee system. We have had some extremely valuable reports&#151;one or two of which I have had the privilege of being involved with&#151;for example, on the Assisted Dying Bill, which was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and on stem cells. In both cases, we took evidence from very large numbers of people

We took it from a very wide area and anyone who wished to express views was heard. We visited centres in the UK and abroad and produced very impressive reports at the end of all that. I believe they were very helpful to noble Lords. It is because we have this effective and available mechanism that I cannot support the idea that we should have yet another body, admirable though it may seem in principle, that would duplicate what we already have. Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p>

<a name="08012824000027"></a><b><a name="80128-0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012824000068"></a>Lord Patten:</b> My Lords, I am glad to follow the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and I recognise the clarity with which he said that he does not feel that the scientific community has a monopoly of wisdom in this area and neither does any other section of the community, whether politicians or whoever. That is right. We certainly agree on that point although, having listened to the rest of his excellent speech, I suspect on nothing else. I have only three points to make, and I shall not elaborate on the points I made in Committee.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08012824000028"></a>First, the House has the opportunity to be ahead of the curve in reflecting the views of the population outside this House and another place. Despite the turmoil of the past few months since August&#151;worries about the economy since the sub-prime crisis and the problems and gyrations in the stock market&#151;it is a reasonable generality to say that, in the past few years, much public concern and discourse has concentrated as much on cultural issues as on political issues, all the more so because a lot of the economic debate of the past half century seems to have been rather laid to rest with the coming together of both the main political parties on public expenditure and their economic plans. That is why we have seen that concentration of the general public on matters such as the environment, climatic change and the overarching issue of care for creation, whether that creation came about by chance, as some might suggest, or by divine intervention, as those on the Bishops&#146; Bench would suggest.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08012824000029"></a>Right behind that is growing concern about the dignity of the human person, what happens as a result of manipulating humankind and how fast it is occurring, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, pointed out. That can be summed up in the tabloid shorthand of &#147;cloning&#148;. The general public are becoming ever more doubtful that the ethical issues surrounding these matters are any longer empty of meaning or that they should be left as the preserve of the specialist&#151;the religious, the scientists or whoever else. I am firmly convinced, and much persuaded by the argument made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that the public need a source of trusted guidance on these issues that rises above the fray of debate. They need a place of resort to which they can refer and to which they can reply that is above the fray of full-on scientific advance at all costs or the satisfaction, for example, of adult needs and wants above all else. I do not think science has anything to be frightened of, and I am rather concerned that scientific opinion seems rather frightened of a national bioethics commission.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08012824000030"></a>My second point is that we need a national human bioethics commission that has representatives of different points of view&#151;the strongly scientific and the strongly concerned with human dignity. I metaphorically tear up the rest of my speech on that because the points have been made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08012824000031"></a>Thirdly, such a commission would need to be chaired by a woman or a man who was known to be dispassionately above the fray of debate, neither passionately for nor against this, that or the other. He or she would need to be a figure of real substance, deserving of the greatest public respect&#151;the sort of person who we might seek out to oversee, for example, a committee on standards in public life. He or she would need to be generally recognised as having an Olympian and dispassionate view and as being able to deal with the whole range of views, from members who believed in sex selection or full reproductive cloning to the upholders, as they saw it, of the dignity of life. I cannot see what the Government are frightened of in this, particularly not our formidable new Chief Whip, who I am sure is frightened of nothing at all. Why should she be afeared of a national bioethics commission for proper debate that rises above&#151;for the fourth and last time&#151;the fray of scientific or religious dispute?</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08012824000032"></a>I hope that she will not take it amiss if, like a little lord echo, I say again what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams: it is a tragedy that so much of the proceedings of the Bill and the characteristically excellent ebb and flow of debate has been marred by the application of a heavy, three-line Whip on what in this place and in another place has traditionally been a matter for individual, conscientious discussion.</p>

I give way to the noble Baroness.</p>

I hesitated to intervene earlier; I intervened when the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, made a somewhat similar point&#151;I do not wish to misrepresent her in any sense&#151;during a previous stage of the Bill. The noble Lord made the point that whipping was somehow inappropriate and improper and that the outcome would be different if the Bill had not had,</p>
<ul><a name="08012824000062"></a>&#147;the juggernaut of a three-line Whip&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012824000057"></a>I shall make two points again, because we may be conducting a dialogue of the deaf.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08012824000036"></a>First, this is a government Bill, based on proper parliamentary procedures of pre-legislative scrutiny and taking independent evidence, and the Government have the right, and can expect, to get their legislation  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_487"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through. That has been qualified throughout by the right of any individual to take the issue into his own hands and not take part in a vote. I know, from talking to the Chief Whip, that at least eight or 10 individuals on the Labour Benches have done so, and there was never hesitation about that. An issue such as abortion, which has always been regarded as a private conscience matter, remains ring-fenced for that purpose.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08012824000037"></a>Secondly, I want to pick up the implied point that the results would somehow be different if there were no government Whip&#151;in other words, that those who are being whipped are in some sense voting against their natural inclination, conscience and compassion. Would the noble Lord say to Members of his own side who have been in the government Lobbies that they were exercising conscience while those of us on the government Benches who went in those same Lobbies were not? I am sure that the noble Lord would not wish to suggest for a moment that only one side has the monopoly on compassion or conscience in this argument. I therefore wish that he would not continue to insist that those of us who believe in this Bill and have voted to support the Government are, as a result, under the sway of a juggernaut that informs our decision-making.</p>

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="08012824000038"></a><b><a name="80128-0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012824000072"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I was rising to mention the point about order, but I will now sit down.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="08012824000039"></a><b><a name="80128-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08012824000073"></a>Lord Patten:</b> My Lords, I have been speaking succinctly, as I am sure the Chief Whip recognises, and I shall respond succinctly to the noble Baroness&#146;s lengthy two-question expos&#233; by saying that she might have fallen foul of putting words into my mouth. At no stage did I suggest that the result would be different; I have no idea whether it would have been, had a three-line Whip been applied or not. However, I know that I think it wrong for a three-line Whip to be applied on such matters of conscientious issue. It is not a satisfactory get-out to say that someone can go to the last Chief Whip&#151;or the present, new and smiling Chief Whip&#151;and say, &#147;Look, I am having conscientious trouble and prefer not to go though the Lobbies tonight&#148;. What happened back in 1990 was much better; we did not have three-line Whips on such issues, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern pointed out.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08012824000040"></a>I conclude on this point, as I attempted to do a moment or two ago. The scientific community has nothing at all to fear from this, as it would benefit greatly from having outside advice made under a dispassionate and formidable chairman. The Government have nothing to fear, either.</p>

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="08012824000041"></a><b><a name="80128-0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08012824000074"></a>Lord Harries of Pentregarth:</b> My Lords, there is initially something attractive about the idea of a national bioethics committee, and nobody could put its case more powerfully than the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. She has advanced the argument way beyond where it went in Committee and I would like to address some of her points fairly directly.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08012824000042"></a>First, the noble Baroness emphasised that almost every other country in the world has a national bioethics committee. However, she mentioned the United States  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_488"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of America, whose national bioethics committee has become highly politicised; she would also find evidence of such committees in other countries becoming so. She would be the first to agree that that is an undesirable state of affairs.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08012824000043"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness mentioned the advantage of a national bioethics committee being financed by the state, in contrast to other bodies that might be financed by industry and, therefore, have a vested interest. As I think she knows, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics is financed by two great charitable foundations, the Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield Foundation, and there is no question of the recommendation of the council being in any way skewed by vested commercial interests.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08012824000044"></a>Another aspect of the work of national bioethics committees shows that there is often tension between long-term research or thinking about major issues and the short-term advice that the Government need. Those do not sit easily together. The fact is that long-term work is certainly needed; some reports from the Nuffield council take, perhaps, three years and cannot be provided quickly. If short-term advice is needed by the Government, Parliament is surely the place to look for it&#151;either in one of our Select Committees especially set up for that purpose, or in a standing committee to which recourse can quickly be made. The noble Baroness should agree about that inherent tension. We would have to ask whether such a national bioethics committee would be expected to provide advice in the short term for the Government, on particular issues that came up, or whether we would want long-term work to be done.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08012824000045"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the reality of what she called fragile boundaries. It is good to have the 14-day rule and the possibility of reproductive cloning, for example, brought to our attention. Yet would a national bioethics committee really be any greater safeguard to crossing those boundaries than what is already in place? After all, one could imagine a situation in which a national bioethics committee had been highly politicised by a Government who actually wanted to break one of those boundaries&#151;sex selection is an obvious instance. I argue that a national bioethics committee would be no guarantee that some boundaries would not be stepped across.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08012824000046"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness mentioned the advantage of a national bioethics committee being accountable to Parliament. However, we really need to ask to whom it is appropriate that a think tank on bioethics should be accountable. Surely it should be accountable to those whose opinion it respects. The Nuffield council, for example, regards itself as accountable to experts in the field&#151;to scientists, ethicists and any other experts appropriate to thinking about bioethics. In other words, we hope to be judged on the quality of the work. A national bioethics committee, if it was really doing its work, would surely be looking to its work quality and would hope to gain the respect of those best qualified to judge that work. Accountability to Parliament would be neither here nor there as far as that was concerned. Therefore, while I hugely respect what the noble Baroness says, if those four or five issues that I have mentioned are looked at seriously, the advantages of a national bioethics committee are by no means clear.</p>

For eight years, I chaired the Human Genetics Commission; I stepped down only last November. It is now chaired by Sir John Sulston, who was my vice-chair. He was the head of the British end of the genome project and you could not meet a more ethical scientist. I remind your Lordships that the commission has on it the very kinds of people whom the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, spoke of; we had medical practitioners, research scientists, genetic counsellors, ethicists, moral philosophers, members from the Consumers&#146; Association and people suffering from a disability. We had a consultative panel of 100 persons, all of whom had genetic disease or genetic propensities within their families. The whole business of bioethics therefore stretches beyond the issues that we have been debating on this Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08012824000048"></a>Your Lordships should understand the ecology of the advice given to the Government on ethics. What is interesting is that, while the ground is rather divided in this country, it is covered. The HFEA, for example, deals with the issue of gender selection, whereas the Human Genetics Commission advises on issues such as the ethical oversight of the police DNA database. Our commission has been advising the Government on the improper use of genetic information; because of that, a criminal offence was created to prevent people from stealing DNA and misusing it. We produced many of the kinds of papers that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, spoke of. For example we produced a paper on over-the-counter testing, where there are real issues of ethical implication. We also produced work on genetics and reproductive choice, and the possible overuse of testing without parents having an opportunity to refuse some of the tests on offer. I mentioned that there are ethical issues beyond those being debated here. Bodies exist to advise the Government, after considerable debate and consultation with the public. Indeed, we travel around the country so that our meetings are not confined to London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08012824000049"></a>I had the experience of going to the United States to visit, at its invitation, the White House committee on bioethics. I went with the then chair of the HFEA, Suzi Leather. It was interesting because together we had basically covered the same ground as that committee. However, the experience was most depressing because, to some extent, that committee could not get beyond the primary debate. In the end, the right-to-life debate was the only debate, which hampered the opportunity to have the kind of debate that we have seen taking place in this House over these past weeks.</p>

<a name="80128-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08012824000050"></a>Given my background, that whole debate reaches deeply into my heart. I feel that issues about life and those fragile boundaries that the noble Baroness mentioned need to be decided in the public domain, ultimately by elected representatives in Parliament. In visiting and meeting bioethics committees, I was concerned at the way in which almost inevitably those issues became politicised. So let us have our politics out in the open. I am unhappy about subcontracting ethics to a group of ethicists. That forgets the fact that franchising out ethics to a set of eminent personages

All groupings want to be represented; you end up with all the major churches and many other groups insisting on representation. I am sure that everyone involved is profoundly moral, but in that situation, ultimately, the debates become privatised. It is important that we try to find better ways of having these debates publicly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08012824000052"></a>That may mean putting more money into the Human Genetics Commission. When I stepped down, I had my sort of debriefing meeting as a former chair, who had been asked to stay on time after time until it became a bit too long. I said that it might be better to bring in some of the ethical issues that had been with the HFEA. I felt that there was a discomfort in some of those issues being with the HFEA, which is seen by the public as a regulatory body. It is confusing to have the regulatory function and an advisory function on ethics combined. Perhaps one body could do that, in the form of the Human Genetics Commission. However, to start setting up a bioethics commission and to have a contention as to who should be on it and who might be represented on it will inevitably lead to a politicisation that I think we should avoid. I return to my submission to this House, which is that we are all ethicists.</p>

Let me try to explain why. I have some interests to declare. I was a founder member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and later its chair. I stood down when I started to chair the Nuffield Foundation. So, for more than 15 years, I have been looking at what it really takes to enable a body to achieve independence. I do not say that that has been perfectly achieved, but it is very difficult to achieve, and that is one of the aims spoken about by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams.</p>

Six to eight people is a very small number. Is the whole of human bioethics to be separated from other parts of bioethics? Constantly one finds overlap between human issues and concerns of animal welfare: let us think of xenotransplantation. One continually finds overlaps between human issues and environmental issues and one now finds issues of bioethics that stray into public health. In the broader&#151;perhaps I should say the narrower&#151;academic world where I come from, people now talk about broad bioethics; that is, uniting human, environmental and public health issues.</p>

One of the main things that they cannot do is to have influence, whereas perhaps the US and German bioethics

Whether having influence is the primary function of bioethics committees, I am unsure. I felt that they should have sought influence when, in the mid-1990s, we published a report on the medical and scientific uses of human tissues and could not get certain departments of state to listen to our worries, which later had unfortunate consequences at Alder Hey and elsewhere and, later still, led to what I still regard as one of the more unfortunate pieces of legislation that Parliament has passed in recent years&#151;perhaps there is some competition.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08012824000056"></a>We need to think much harder before we launch into a national committee. We need to think about what areas of bioethics such a committee should consider. Where are the boundaries? How should it be staffed? Who are the people who should be there? How many would be needed to do a serious job? Could they really then be expected to carry the many additional functions that this amendment would assign to them? If they took on these public engagement and education functions, could they be expected to preserve that form of neutrality that is initially described? As the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, has said, would it not in the end come back to Parliament&#151;I hope with a free vote&#151;to make decisions on these matters? I believe that it would. Although I am not wholly hostile to this proposal, I am open to being convinced. We need to think far more seriously about what you have to do to secure independence, which I do not think is easy, how one achieves that across time and how one achieves proper connection with the public.</p>

I shall not divulge the personal views that were offered to me. However, I received a paper on the proposal, I considered it and I discussed it with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. It might be worth sharing some of the reasons why I decided that it was not a good idea to proceed with the proposal. I have to acknowledge that if you are a busy Minister and wrestling with some of the difficult issues around ethics in NHS research and development, in the Human Tissue Bill, in genetics et cetera, then there is something extremely attractive in the idea of being able to outsource some of those issues. I do not dismiss that attraction. However, when it comes to grappling with the specific points in taking that forward, you have to confront some rather uncomfortable issues.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08012833000002"></a>If this commission were to be set up, what range and diversity of membership would make it an authoritative body that carries credence with the public, has a wide diversity of opinion and would be authoritative enough to be useful to Governments of all and varied persuasions? The truth is that you need a very large body indeed to produce that kind of authoritative body. The idea that you could do that with between six and eight members, I say to the noble Baroness, just does not stand up to detailed scrutiny. You also have to look, as I did, at the experience of other countries that have gone down this route. I say to the noble Baroness, for whom I have the highest regard, that I thought she was a bit selective about the virtues of some of those other

One of the most damning reasons for not proceeding was the experience in the United States. I do not wish to take a tour of the world, but other areas, a little closer to home, also do not bear quite as close scrutiny as the noble Baroness might think.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08012833000003"></a>We therefore have the problem of whether such a body, particularly if it were a small body, could be captured. As the noble Baroness may know, we in the Labour Party we are rather expert in entryism; we have quite a lot of experience in that area. There is therefore an issue&#151;dare I say it to some of my colleagues in other parts of the House&#151;about whether faith-based organisations would seek to capture some of these bodies. Uncomfortable stuff though it is, I have to say, based on the experience of other organisations overseas, there is a risk.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08012833000004"></a>Scientists themselves are extremely diverse. A membership of between six and eight would not allow much capacity for a wide range of scientific views, opinions and expertise to be incorporated in such a body. Moreover, the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, makes a very important point, as does my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws: the ground is already quite well covered by quite a lot of bodies. If you are a Minister, you are not short of people offering you advice in these areas. I agree that the advice sometimes conflicts, but nevertheless there is no shortage of people coming to you with expert advice in many of these areas. The Human Genetics Commission has done remarkably good work in this area. The regulators, even though they are regulators, do themselves bring something to bear in these areas because of their experience in dealing with the regulatory issues. The Nuffield Council produces very measured reports after a lot of consultation and research. That is all available, both in the public arena and to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08012833000005"></a>One of the issues that I thought was overwhelmingly important was that we did not try to escape from the fact that elected politicians and appointed politicians need to wrestle with these issues. Parliament needs to wrestle with them. Sometimes it is uncomfortable for many elected politicians to wrestle with these issues. They would prefer that things should go away. In a sense, however, that is the important part of a democracy&#151;that we have these issues out in the open and bring them to Parliament. If we are to go down the path of a new body, it should be something that is enshrined in Parliament. It should be a parliamentary debating capability rather than something off-shored to help us out with difficult issues. We need to wrestle with them as parliamentarians.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08012833000050"></a>&#147;We have had, generally, in this country a deficit in medical ethics, both in the input to some of our decisions over the years and, also, in medical ethicists&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08012833000007"></a>That is a statement we should take seriously. Why is there such a dearth? Because we do not take the teaching of philosophy in schools with the seriousness we should or treat it with the seriousness we should at university level or in medical schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08012833000008"></a>The normal response in the context of this Bill when anyone suggests there is a need for a national committee is to say, as has been said today: &#147;We already have such groups&#151;the HFEA ethics and law advisory group, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, and so on&#148;. None of them, to the best of my knowledge, has any statutory authority. Quite rightly, noble Lords have raised questions of membership should a national body be set up. Can we be absolutely certain that those ethical groups which already exist include, with full voting rights, those who for significant ethical or religious reasons cannot and do not share the presuppositions of other ethicists in those bodies? My information is that that does not happen.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08012833000009"></a>There is not time in a debate of this kind to look at the current stage of ethical thinking in our country. In general, over the past few decades, it seems that it has become increasingly utilitarian and pragmatic. However, within the history of philosophical and ethical thinking in western Europe there have been two significant strands. The first strand is based on the powers of human reason and the capacity for logical thought. I cherish that strand. The second strand is based on the possibility, only the possibility, that the words revelation, epiphany, theophany and disclosure&#151;the kind of words used in the Judaeo-Christian tradition&#151;have a basis in reality, in personal experience and in social experience.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08012833000010"></a>It seems to me that the danger facing ethical thinking in the United Kingdom is that this second strand is treated these days as a lifestyle choice and dismissed as having no more significance than, say, the choice of a gym or a fitness regime. I think that it is slightly unjust to suggest that churches and faith groups might be involved in entryism. What seems to happen most of the time is that, because those of us who have a faith are treated as though we were lifestyle idiots, or the last of the witch doctors, the doors are not opened. Quite the opposite&#151;they are bolted shut. For some reason it is assumed that we are unable to think logically or reasonably and have nothing to contribute. That is very sad.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08012833000011"></a>Suppose for a moment that ethics are not simply about practical and utilitarian behaviour but are also concerned with what is or should be or may be actually true. If that is the case, it seems only fair and just that the significant strand of Judaeo-Christian ethical thinking to which I alluded should be a foundational part of ethical thinking in our country and not treated as though we are somehow bigoted entryists. To exclude that kind of thinking seems discriminatory.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08012833000012"></a>If what I have said is at all accurate, then to ensure that we have in our country a national committee concerned with human bioethics seems a reasonably wise step. The challenges facing those in research and treatment procedures in medicine are massive, and we are all indebted to the scrupulous care which the best medical practitioners and research scientists bring to their work. Having served on the pre-legislative scrutiny committee, I recognised that I was in the presence of such practitioners and such scientists. It was an enormous privilege simply to listen to what they are doing and to try to understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08012833000013"></a>I do not think a national bioethics committee should be seen as something which would hinder research or treatment. Nor should it be seen as an either/or. Can we not still have Select Committees? Can we not still have HFEA ethics and law committees? Can we still not have Nuffield committees? Of course we can. By adding the word &#147;national&#148;, however, would we not assist the ethical thinking that everyone in our country should do so that the treatments and the research which our remarkable scientists and medics are undertaking now and will undertake in the future will be seen as being for the common good and for the well-being of individuals and society? If ethical thinking is sidelined, or treated only by those who have an interest in these things, or treated as a matter simply of pragmatism, then trust in research and treatment will decrease and scepticism will set in, which will be to the detriment of science and our society.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08012833000014"></a>In no sense is the creation of a national human bioethics committee outsourcing ethics. I have learnt a huge amount about ethics by being a Member of this House, and this must and will continue here. This is a question not of either/or but of both/and, and if we do not set up such a commission, we will have missed a great opportunity.</p>

It was extremely persuasive because I have enormous sympathy with the objectives which she so clearly enunciated in making the case for a national bioethics commission. Like many other noble Lords, however, I have serious reservations about the potential efficacy of such a body. In the course of my professional life, I have been much involved in ethical discussions in a whole series of different fora: as president of the British Medical Association; and subsequently as a member of the standards and ethics committee of the General Medical Council and later as its president.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08012833000016"></a>It is important to recognise not only that we have bodies such as the Human Genetics Commission, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the Genetic Interest Group, but that the professional medical bodies themselves play a major role. The British Medical Association regularly publishes and recently updated a substantial booklet entitled <I>Medical Ethics Today. </I>The General Medical Council continually gives advice to the medical profession about ethical issues that have emerged as a result of recent developments not only in medicine but in medical science. The Royal Society, too, has a role in ethical discussions with scientists in the broader sense. The more recently established Academy of Medical Sciences regularly produces significant reports on ethical issues as they affect various situations in medicine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08012833000017"></a>In 1992-93, I had the privilege of chairing the ad hoc Select Committee on Medical Ethics, which was established in this House. That body was set up simply to examine in detail two important issues. The first was the sanctity of life and whether it was appropriate to change the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide. The issue arose after a number of cases such as that of Tony Bland, the young man who had been crushed in the Hillsborough stadium disaster, and another case in which a doctor had been accused of murder because  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_495"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he had brought to an end the life of a patient who was in intolerable pain and in the terminal stages of disease. There were 16 members of that Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. We met weekly and took a huge amount of oral and written evidence from individuals and organisations over 15 months. We spent several weekends in consultation and deliberation on the outcome before ultimately producing a unanimous report. That ad hoc Select Committee was established to look at just two major problems, only two of many that could have arisen in the ethical field. Mechanisms are available in this House to establish Select Committees to examine ethical problems. There has been the Select Committee that I just mentioned, as well as the Select Committee established to consider the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, and the pre-legislative scrutiny committee, to which noble Lords have referred today, on the Bill that we are now debating.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08012833000018"></a>The field of medical ethics is enormous. A human bioethics commission simply could not function with six to eight members, even if you trebled that number to cover the representation that would be demanded not only by ethicists and philosophers but by people of various faiths and of different persuasions in science, medicine and the law. It would be an enormous body if it were to fulfil its task fully and properly. The problems that would emerge would make it almost impossible to deal with the short-term issues to which my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries of Pentregarth referred, because inevitably in matters of complexity in the medical and scientific-ethical field, it takes many weeks and months to be able to assess the evidence and come up with recommendations.</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08012833000019"></a>Although I have all possible sympathy with the proposal, this House has the opportunity to create ad hoc Select Committees to consider crucial ethical issues, and an ad hoc Select Committee, rather than a human bioethics commission, is likely to be the right forum.</p>

Indeed, I moved the amendment in his absence in Committee and as a result looked in some detail at some of the situations that applied in other jurisdictions. I could see that its applicability here could have quite a lot of merit, but I also see some of the defects. I was therefore very pleased when I saw that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, had tabled the amendment again for our consideration today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08012833000021"></a>We have had a very good debate this afternoon, but some of the arguments that have been introduced should be examined more closely. My noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant referred to the importance of our Select Committee system. I agree. The Select Committee that considered the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill and was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and the committee that considered medical ethics in the 1990s and was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, are very good examples of how this House can continue to inform public debate outside Parliament. Noble Lords will be aware, however, that it is not always easy to establish Select Committees and ad hoc committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08012833000022"></a>I had the recent experience of putting a proposal before the Liaison Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, who is in his place, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, supported that proposal, which I thought was an eminently reasonable proposal to look at a seriously controversial question. However, that committee could not be established because of all the competition from other issues. We sometimes have to accept the practicalities and accept that the sheer pressure of business, not only on bioethical issues but on the many issues that come across people&#146;s desks, means that it will not always be possible to set up ad hoc committees to consider incredibly important questions. Moreover, Bills do not often come before your Lordships&#146; House on these issues. We last looked at human fertilisation and embryology in 1990. I might say in parenthesis that I am glad that a joint scrutiny committee examined the Bill before it came here and came out against such issues as sex selection, which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, identified as one of the fragile questions that we may well return to in due course and which is not included in the Bill. Will another 18 years pass before there is another Bill?</p>

<a name="80128-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08012833000023"></a>As we have heard again and again throughout the debate, the science is extraordinarily fast moving. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, will be aware of an issue that I raised last week when I quoted Professor Yamanaka from a recent <I>New Scientist</I> article in which he looked not at cloning but at the way in which reproductive cells&#151;gametes&#151;could be produced from one person and a new human literally created. The scientific questions to which that possibility gives rise are not the only ones that we want to consider. Professor Yamanaka himself identified the possibility as dangerous and said that there was no regulatory framework to consider it or deal with it. Surely we would want to ponder the social implications for the family, for the individuals concerned, and for the new entities that will be brought into the world&#151;what position they would have and what condition they would be in. We know that this is not science fiction. As the noble and learned Lord will recall, in 1990, during debates in another place in which I took part, the possibility was raised that the way may be open to developments such as human reproductive cloning. The then Secretary of State said that it was not an admissible issue because that was unlikely ever to happen. Yet within 10 years science had changed the rules and terms of the debate, and in 2001 we introduced a full ban on reproductive cloning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08012833000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said that we have always to command wider confidence. I agree entirely. However good the debates may be in your Lordships&#146; House, however good our Select Committees may be, there is a need to command wider public confidence. Our existing structures are themselves not enough. It was suggested earlier that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has a difficult role because it is both a regulator and is also at times called upon to take ethical decisions. Alan Doran, the acting chief executive, said as recently as last November at a BioCentre symposium:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="08012833000051"></a>&#147;We do not claim to be a national bioethics commission. We are not a body whose primary function is to resolve ethical issues. I do not think the HFEA was set up as an ethics commission&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08012833000025"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, said that we all need to be our own ethicists. I agree. However, we need to inform ourselves about these very complex questions and we need a sense of where the issues are proceeding. The public on the whole look to us and to the bodies that we establish to give them some kind of lead and to set out the terms of the debate. That was one of the very good things achieved by the committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord on the issue of assisted dying. It did not seek to come to a conclusion. It clearly was divided on the substantive issues but it set out the arguments on both sides and it allowed not only your Lordships&#146; House but also the public outside to reach a conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08012833000026"></a>We have been told that the Nuffield Council could perhaps fill this gap, but it only meets four times a year and, as we heard, is accountable only to its founders. Sometimes we have to uncouple commercial interests from ethical issues. Many of the papers produced by Nuffield are some of the most interesting I have ever read. Nevertheless, its word is not the only one to be had on this issue; it is not definitive. That is why the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill of Bengarve, was right to say that this should not be the end of the argument. It has been an incredibly valuable discussion today. When the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, comes to reply, I know that she will sum up the debate and suggest a way to proceed. Many colleagues in another place are looking at this question very seriously. I hope they will be able to build on some of the very sensible and eminently productive suggestions that have been made in this debate.</p>

It is only when we find it difficult to come to a conclusion that we want some superior authority. Many of your Lordships will remember as clearly as I do that one used to be able to look for that guidance from either the churches or the Royal Society. It is only as the churches and to some extent the Royal Society have lost their authority that we have started to look elsewhere. When you are in doubt as to what to do about an important thing, it is always comfortable to be told by somebody who knows more about it than you do what you should do. All of us in this House are accustomed to receiving that service from our Chief Whips and Front Benches, which leads me to mention very briefly the conversation almost between my noble friend Lord Patten and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, about the use of the three-line Whip. It is worth pointing out that the function of a three-line Whip is not to get people to vote against their conscience. It is to get people who have no particular persuasion in an argument to vote with their party and thus increase the numbers in favour of an argument in which they have taken no part.</p>

However, like many others who have spoken, I reach a different conclusion. I do not wish to repeat the very compelling arguments that have been made for the fact that existing bodies to a great degree cover the waterfront. I simply want to expand very briefly on one additional point which has been touched on both by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and my noble friend Lord Alton. I refer to the question of public trust and confidence. I speak as someone who had the privilege last year of chairing a working party of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics to produce one of its reports. What struck me when the report was launched last November&#151;a report on the ethics of public health&#151;was the high degree of public confidence as expressed, for example, by the reaction of the media to the work of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. It is worth reflecting on where public trust and confidence, so essential to any pronouncements in the complex field of human bioethics, come from. They are a number of different strands to public trust and confidence.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08012833000030"></a>First, the Nuffield Council is seen as an independent body. It is not funded by the Government primarily, although it receives some funding from the Medical Research Council. The fact that it is independent of the Government makes it a more trusted body. I speak again from personal experience, having chaired the Food Standards Agency&#151;a government body where it is much harder to persuade the public that one is genuinely independent. Independence is important and I could add parenthetically that the funders&#151;the Nuffield Foundation and the Wellcome Trust&#151;exert absolutely zero pressure on those publishing or producing the reports in terms of the conclusions.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08012833000031"></a>A further strand of the public trust is gained through the Nuffield Council&#146;s working parties. My working party met roughly 10 times a year over two years and those meetings very often engaged a wide range of views. We chose particularly to meet those who had opposing views; for example, on the issue of fluoridation. There were also very wide consultations. The trust comes in part from transparency, openness and inclusiveness.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08012833000032"></a>Why do I mention this? I do so partly to reiterate the point that the waterfront, as has been said, is very well covered by a number of bodies, including the Nuffield Council, but also to make the point that, were a new national bioethics commission to be created as suggested in the amendment, it would have to work very hard over a very long time to earn public trust and confidence. It is not at all clear to me that it would succeed to the extent that existing bodies have succeeded in earning that public trust. That is one of a number of reasons why I feel that the amendment should not be supported.</p>

The amendments address an issue in which noble Lords have expressed a very keen interest, both this evening and in Committee. The wide range of sincerely held views was apparent then and remains so. It is clear that the proposal for a national bioethics commission should be considered alongside the alternative possibility of a parliamentary standing committee on bioethics. It remains the Government&#146;s view that establishing a national human bioethics commission would involve a number of very significant practical difficulties and risks.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08012833000034"></a>The practical difficulties include determining the membership of, and interests represented on, such a wide-ranging commission. There is a likelihood that there would be ongoing and disruptive disputes about representation that would undermine its role and authority. Some of that was made clear in the discussion that we had in Committee. I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said about membership, but there must also be a danger that pressure for the commission to accommodate a range of various interests and points of view would lead to it being unwieldy; for example, in the consultation arrangements that it would have to have in place.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08012833000035"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, spoke of the problems relating to remit. There must be concern about a commission with such a wide remit having the right balance of expertise and knowledge to be able to deal effectively with ethical issues on specialist subjects.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08012833000036"></a>The Government considered whether to establish a single commission with a remit covering the entirety of bioethics issues as part of the Department of Health&#146;s review of arm&#146;s-length bodies. As my noble friend Lord Warner informed us, this was rejected, after careful consideration, on the basis that the present distributed model of advisory bodies with more specific briefs remained the best option, as it enables specific bioethical issues to be addressed by dedicated groups. Noble Lords have mentioned the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the Human Genetics Commission, the BMA Medical Ethics Committee and the National Screening Committee. They have the appropriate expertise and sufficient time to devote to complex issues within their field. Parliamentary Select Committees also play an important role in the current system. My noble friend Lord Turnberg referred to the House of Lords Select Committee chaired by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, which looked at stem cell research, and the Select Committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, that looked at the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, spoke of the ad hoc committee that he chaired on medical ethics.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08012833000037"></a>The current system means that there is a collective responsibility for bioethical debate, which ensures that ethical discussion is embedded in decisions across all committees. This distributed system of bioethical advice works well. It remains our view that a national human bioethics commission would not bring sufficient benefits in comparison. Indeed, it could lead to ethical issues being marginalised and ignored by committees that are responsible for guidance or policy on any number  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_500"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of aspects of medicine or the life sciences. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made a very important point about the need for wider education and discussion about bioethics and ethical issues in general, but as parliamentarians we should do much more to connect with the public on these very important issues&#151;and we should give further thought to that.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08012833000038"></a>The noble Baroness is also absolutely right about the huge value of debate on bioethical issues in this Chamber, to us as individuals, to Parliament as a whole and to inform the laws that we make. The Government have made clear their view that there is value in the consideration of bioethical issues in Parliament. We said as much in our response to the committee of both Houses that scrutinised the draft version of this Bill, which recommended the establishment of a parliamentary standing committee on bioethics. That would be the most appropriate forum for an accountable and democratic discussion about bioethics, a discussion that would have the necessary influence, as has been mentioned by several noble Lords. We remain of that view, but the decision as to whether to establish a joint bioethics committee of both Houses is for Parliament itself to consider, taking into account in particular the likely composition of such a committee, its remit, and the way in which its relationship with other parliamentary Select and Joint Committees and current ethical bodies would work.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08012833000039"></a>The noble Baroness and the right reverend Prelate made a very persuasive case&#151;but I am rather persuaded by my noble friend Lord Turnberg, the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and others. The Government see merit in a parliamentary standing committee on bioethics but do not see a national human bioethics commission as the way ahead. Like my noble friend Lady Kennedy, I believe that we should all be ethicists. We have our duty as parliamentarians. I therefore invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08012833000041"></a>Many noble Lords pointed out the difficulties that arise from, for example, the membership of a human bioethics commission. In that respect, the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill of Engrave was extremely eloquent. On the problems of trying to involve the public more widely, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, used effectively the argument from the Human Genetics Commission, which she headed and which did so much work in getting across to a wider public the concerns that exist. I also know that if there is no mechanism in place, including a mechanism for establishing a parliamentary Joint Committee or committee of this House, what happens under the pressure of work and time is that those things that are not already in the picture and  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_501"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part of a commitment tend to be disregarded. That is why I made a point, which I shall make again, about the excellence but also the rarity of debates in this House on the issue of scientific advance.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08012833000042"></a>There has to be a mechanism&#151;perhaps a parliamentary committee of the kind mentioned by the Minister&#151;that would provide us with the reasons for having regular debates brought to the attention to the House, and beyond it to the attention of the country, on the extraordinary speed of scientific advance. There is no such mechanism at present. There are excellent bodies, which produce very good reports, but they do not oblige the Government to have to consider the steps that they will take in the light of advances being made. That is the whole point about the fact that the Nuffield Council, and so on, are not in any sense statutory bodies.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08012833000043"></a>I also need to stress a point that I have obviously not stressed enough. We are moving on to a time when it is not national legislation but European and to some extent international legislation that will determine the limits and constraints that are placed on bioethics and not least on the area of human fertilisation and embryology. This is exactly the area in which, as many of our leading scientists know, the pressures are on to weaken the principles laid down by the HFEA and others&#151;pressures that will grow, not decrease. A body such as a bioethics commission or, I agree, a parliamentary Joint Committee, would be able to bring to the Government&#146;s attention the position that it takes on the Council of Ministers of the European Union or, more widely, on international treaty and other organisations. We are on the cusp of moving away from a purely national basis and do not have the proper machinery to deal with that.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08012833000044"></a>With regard to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, I do not disagree with his remarks about the importance of involving Parliament, but if there is not the machinery to oversee what is happening, nothing adequate comes out at the other end. There is a danger of not establishing such a mechanism.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08012833000045"></a>I do not want to detain the House any longer and propose to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the attention of another place, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, can be drawn to this debate and that it will be taken into account in another place. While at the moment to press this to a Division would be inappropriate, I feel passionately that to abandon this at this moment because there is not going to be a Division could lead us to pass up a huge and essential opportunity to create a machinery and mechanism of oversight that does not exist at present and without which we shall rue the day that we failed to take this opportunity. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08012836000002"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we return to donor-conceived children and the kind of issue that might be advocated by the committee that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, would like to see. We have already discussed the desirability of donor-conceived children being told at the earliest possible opportunity of their biological origins. This amendment is concerned with whether the fact of donor conception should appear on the child&#146;s birth certificate.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08012836000003"></a>Telling the child is, of course, widely supported, but there is far less agreement about recording the fact on birth certificates. Indeed, the organisations primarily representing donor-conceived people differ: the International Donor Offspring Alliance takes a quite different view from the Donor Conception Network, a self-help group that primarily represents families. The former group, the IDOA, describes itself as,</p>
<ul><a name="08012836000068"></a>&#147;an international alliance of people conceived by &#145;donor&#146; gametes, together with people with a personal or professional interest in the issues associated with the use of third party gametes&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80128-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08012836000004"></a>It is an international body with members not only in this country but in France, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. It goes on to describe itself as,</p>
<ul><a name="08012836000072"></a>&#147;an organisation which acts as the voice of the donor-conceived as opposed to promoting the interests of would-be donee parents and donors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012836000005"></a>The Donor Conception Network describes itself as a self-help support group and registered charity of more than 1,100 member families throughout the UK. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08012836000069"></a>&#147;We are a parent-led, child-centred organisation, focusing on how best the fact of donor conception can be integrated into the lives of our children&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012836000006"></a>It goes on, at length, to describe the range of people whom it represents, including single mothers, lesbian couples, divorced people, separated people, and so on.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08012836000007"></a>These two bodies, as I have indicated, take very different views. The IDOA, the international body, feels strongly that the fact of donor conception should be recorded on the birth certificate. The network takes the opposite view. It warmly welcomes the objective and believes that donor-conceived children should be told, but believes that recording the fact of donor conception on the birth certificate is not the right way to achieve that and, indeed, would not be an effective way of doing so. One has to bear in mind&#151;I suggested this when the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, replied to the previous debate&#151;the fact that while the treatment is recorded by the HFEA at the time, if it is successful  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_503"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and a pregnancy is achieved, that may well be the last that either the authority or the clinic hears about the case. There is no obligation on either the parents or the clinic where the treatment took place to report the birth to the authority. I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could, as she promised, confirm this. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, confirmed, even the clinic may not be told that a successful birth followed IVF treatment.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08012836000008"></a>Why do the two representative bodies take such opposing views? The argument of the IDOA, which represents donor-conceived people, that the genetic and biological parents, as well as social parents, should be recorded, is based on six propositions. First, genetic heritage has existence. It is a fact, and has meaning and value in itself. Secondly, everyone has a moral right to know. While it cannot be universally enforced, the state should not connive in abrogating that right. Thirdly, because the state intervenes in assisted reproduction, it has a duty to give legal protection to that moral right and should not deceive the child or withhold information about its genetic parents. The genetic regulations give the donor-conceived child the right to find a donor&#146;s identity, but this is meaningless if many parents continue to conceal the fact of donor conception. Fourthly, the truth must be put in the hands of the offspring for reasons of avoiding consanguinity or even incest. Fifthly, and this is an important fact, falsifying a birth certificate is illegal, so it is discriminatory if the state connives at concealing the fact of donor conception. Finally, only honest and accurate birth certificates would be consistent with the rest of UK law, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and case law under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08012836000009"></a>The Joint Committee found these to be strong and persuasive moral and legal arguments. There are also practical arguments. As I mentioned a moment ago, how are children to find out if they were donor conceived if no one tells them? How can they find out about the medical history of a biological parent? We had the discussion earlier about how that might include grandparents. How can these children be sure of avoiding the risk of consanguinity, or even incest, if they do not have the knowledge that would prompt them to seek assurances from the HFEA? Therefore, the international association argues that that fact must appear on the birth certificate, and the law should be amended to require this.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08012836000010"></a>Let us look at the arguments of the DC network, which conducted a snap survey of network members, all of whom said that they had already told, or would be telling, their children. It showed that the overwhelming majority of respondents were against the birth certification proposal. Many said that they would be prepared to lie to the registrar to protect the privacy of their children or would consider going abroad for a further child in order to avoid appearing on the HFEA register. The network argues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08012836000070"></a>&#147;The proposal might even be counter-productive. Parents who had originally decided not to tell (and didn&#146;t tell the registrar) might feel it more difficult to change their minds about telling if they had originally committed an offence in failing to inform the registrar&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08012836000011"></a>They also point out that the law on assisted reproduction, which we have had discussions about in this House, requires absolute confidentiality, on the part of both the clinic and the HFEA. Putting a note or, as was suggested at one point, some sort of code on a baby&#146;s birth certificate would be a complete break with this protection of a family&#146;s privacy and would broadcast to the world how the parents had set about securing the birth of their child.</p>

<a name="80128-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08012836000012"></a>There are two deeply opposed and strongly held views. I spent most of one Sunday a couple of weeks ago on the telephone to both organisations. Indeed, it was an interesting and revealing day. How are we to find a way through this impasse? What emerged from those discussions is that the opposition to putting the fact on birth certificates stems from a fear that public prejudice may damage the child&#146;s chances in life. To many among the general public, donor conception is seen as a novel, perhaps even bizarre, procedure, interfering with nature. However irrational that may appear, it could rub off on to the child and its chances in life. However, even the network says&#151;I pressed it a bit on this&#151;that attitudes may well change with the passage of time and that, as the public become more familiar with the concept and the practice of donor conception, that prejudice could well subside. There needs to be more public discussion. I read with great interest the article by Libby Purves in the <I>Times</I> a couple of weeks ago, in which she spelt out&#151;in the way that only that competent journalist can do&#151;the argument for putting the fact on the birth certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08012836000013"></a>The view from both bodies suggested to me that perhaps a way forward would be to require the HFEA to keep the position under review. That is precisely what subsection (1) in my amendment suggests. I have gone on to argue that if the HFEA decides to recommend a change in the law and the practice so as to require that the fact of donor conception is recorded on the birth certificate, it should not have to wait for primary legislation; therefore, subsection (2) would give the Secretary of State a power to implement the recommendation by order subject to the affirmative procedure. This would require wide consultation and allow Ministers to amend the recommendation if they thought fit.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08012836000014"></a>I cannot claim that this proposal would completely satisfy both camps&#151;indeed, it would be fair to say that they would both regard it as second best&#151;but I think that they would both see it as a reasonable way forward. From the point of view of the Donor Conception Network it does not require the immediate change in the law that it and most of its members would oppose, while from the point of view of the IDOA it offers a possible way forward to achieving its eventual objective.</p>

I have a strong feeling that the proper thing to do is to put &#147;by donor&#148; on the birth certificate, because that would be honest and it would virtually compel parents to tell their children the truth.

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08012836000017"></a>I put my faith in the changing attitudes of society. Change will come. People&#146;s attitudes have already changed towards donor conception, which, after all, has been going on in the form of artificial insemination by donor for years and years. However, it was always regarded as something to be kept desperately secret. That was partly because the attitude of doctors was that they were protecting their patients by insisting on secrecy. They are now much more inclined to think of the interests of the child who may be the result of the birth by donation. There is no doubt whatever that it is in the child&#146;s interests to know, or to be able to know eventually, something about their wider family. We may not put quite so much importance on our genealogy as the Icelandic people do, but at least we now recognise that it is an important part of everybody&#146;s individuality and sense of their own personality to know and be able to find out not only who their father was but who was their grandmother, their cousin and so on.</p>

I very much support the amendment.</p>

I do not think that we have altogether fully realised that we are in very dangerous waters in this Bill. Time and again we have tried to turn a lie into the truth. A far higher authority than even this House has already decreed that you cannot have two women who are parents. You can have two women who are adopted parents or one who is an adopted parent, but we try to pretend that the truth can and should be distorted for people&#146;s feelings. It is a difficult argument to sustain because the truth has to be faced. Of course the truth is sometimes painful and difficult to face, but it is the truth. If we depart from those principles, we are playing a dangerous part and will pass legislation that is not honourable. As my noble friend Lord Jenkin rightly said, it is an offence to put down a lie on an official document such as a birth certificate.</p>

Everybody knows that you cannot have a baby if you are dead, yet this Bill tries to pretend that you can. That worries me very much. The amendment says that we need to think more carefully about what we are doing; it would enable that to happen, which is why I support it.</p>

It does not, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, indicated, go all the way in either direction. Like my noble friend Lady Warnock, I would like to see the birth certificate clearly marked that a child is donor conceived so that they will truthfully know what their genetic identity is. I am sorry that we have not been able to agree on that, but those in another place may well press further on it. For the time being, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has found a thoughtful way of keeping the door ajar, by ensuring, as he says in the amendment, that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority will,</p>
<ul><a name="08012836000073"></a>&#147;from time to time carry out a review of the law&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012836000061"></a>The amendment would also allow orders to be laid before Parliament. If it was decided that change was wanted, primary legislation would not be required. I think that that is a sensible way to proceed.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08012836000022"></a>We have had extensive debate about whether we mark certificates with codes, whether we put &#147;donor conceived&#148; or whether we do not put anything at all. Different views have been expressed about that. I simply remind the House that in 1989 the United Nations declared that every child has the right,</p>
<ul><a name="08012836000074"></a>&#147;as far as possible to know his or her parents&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012836000062"></a>as well as the right not to be,</p>
<ul><a name="08012836000075"></a>&#147;deprived of some or all the elements of his or her identity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012836000063"></a>I strongly agree with that. We all need to know about our genealogy. We need to know who we are, not just for the reasons adumbrated by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, of consanguinity or incest, but also for those mentioned in our earlier debates about genetics, such as the danger of not knowing about hereditary diseases and of not being able to take early decisions about healthcare if we are unaware of our origins. As my noble friend said, as times move on and people become more used to the kinds of technology that are now so widely used&#151;whether we are in favour of those is neither here nor there&#151;there will be a greater acceptance of the need to know and the duty to tell. This amendment leaves the door ajar to enable us to do that.</p>

I find this whole problem enormously puzzling because in the old days, which were after all only about 10 years ago, the great thing for those who had children by in vitro fertilisation or by donor was that you should not know who the donor was. There was supposed to be a wall of secrecy, and for good reasons. Now we have gone completely full circle. They say they want to know who the donor was because they want to know where their parentage is. That is perfectly true.</p>

Supposing a person&#151;it may have been some wealthy person, not an Earl&#151;wanted some offspring but could not, and had to find a donor to provide his wife with the necessary vehicle to have the child. The child appeared and it was a son. Is that son the son of his father or does it go down that that was a donor, and someone else must come in and inhabit this little place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08012836000027"></a>As I said on Amendment No. 142, what the Government are proposing for certain types of parent inevitably means that it will be obvious on the birth certificate that the particular children affected by these provisions were donor-conceived. I do not think the Minister in disposing of my argument contradicted that in any way. That is discrimination between different children in the same basic area of donor conception. I see the difficulty that is faced in this matter. My noble friend&#146;s amendment, supported as it is by the great experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is probably the best way forward at this stage because we try to get a degree of consensus between the people directly involved. As my noble friend has shown, the two organisations that represent these people differently take very different views. Consensus between them at this stage seems rather difficult. This is the best way forward. I certainly support this amendment and take account of the fact that donor conception is already being recognised as inevitably the case in a certain rather small minority of entries in the register that are authorised by the Bill.</p>

I particularly share the concepts in the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock. Over the next few years there is the possibility of a change of view of those who are particularly opposed to such a course of honesty on the birth certificate at this present moment. This is a sensible amendment, making it possible for a change which would be to the benefit of children if not, in the present view, to the benefit of parents. It would be of advantage if this amendment was accepted by the Government.</p>

About 30 years ago a goddaughter of mine, a German child, told me when she was three that a lot of people are brought by the stalks but she came in a train. A year or two later she was explaining to me about what it was to be adopted and how it worked. She knew who her genetic parents were. That has happened quickly; at that time it was quite new for children to talk like that; now it is completely taken for granted. Before long this will happen in the case of donor-conceived children. I too support the amendment. It is a slightly ginger amendment. It is not taking us terribly far but it is keeping the door open. That is perhaps the best we can do.</p>

I did so having listened to many of the people with whom the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has been engaged in deep conversation. I commend the noble Lord for putting the views of those organisations and representing them thoroughly and well.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08012836000031"></a>It is important again to state that those two organisations do not represent all shades of opinion on the matter. There are people who have been adopted and people who have been born as the result of donor conception who are utterly and completely opposed to any move such as this. They feel strongly that singling out one group of children in a public manner&#151;having it registered on a birth certificate is a public manner&#151;is utterly wrong.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08012836000032"></a>That is not to say that they are opposed to a course of honesty, in the words of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. Some of those same people are anxious that children know of their donors. They are the most keen that those children know they are donor-conceived but they believe passionately that that is a matter for them to handle within their families and that they have a duty to handle it within their families. It should not be imposed on them by means of a public document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08012836000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, talked about the article by Libby Purves in the <I>Times</I> which I also read. It was a very good article. But there have been other reactions in the press and that is one of the things that worries me about the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I have a number of concerns about it. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08012836000071"></a>&#147;The Authority shall from time to time carry out a review&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08012836000064"></a>What would trigger that review? Is it inconceivable that public opinion could be swayed dramatically, as it was by the case of the twins that was quoted extensively by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in Committee, and reported extensively in the press? That might sway public opinion in one direction. Having raised this matter in Committee, I can tell the noble Lord that the <I>Daily Mail</I>&#151;without interviewing me, I have to say&#151;saw fit to run a huge one-page article by heterosexual donor parents, who vociferously made the case in the opposite direction. I am rather concerned that we could have a very unspecific measure. I loved the

I ask again what would trigger the review. There is a danger that this matter could be swayed by changes in public opinion based on one or two cases.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08012836000034"></a>I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, a few weeks ago that we had been through a process whereby all of us had arrived at exactly the same position that she and her committee arrived at back in the 1980s. We have realised that this is an intractably difficult problem to which there is no answer that satisfies both the desire of donor-conceived people to have a right to know and those who say that the matter should be handled within the privacy of the family. But at least we have all been through the arguments this time and we all know why we have arrived at the same position, so perhaps our time has not been misspent.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08012836000035"></a>However, a difficult matter now arises that did not apply in 1990. In 1990 people had long birth certificates and short birth certificates. One of the problems we have now&#151;here I take issue with some of the recent articles of the noble Lord, Lord Alton&#151;is that because of the changes going on in the world, terrorism and people&#146;s need to prove their identity to a greater degree than ever before, long birth certificates are increasingly being demanded by all sorts of authorities so short birth certificates may no longer be appropriate. Therefore, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, which I accept was drawn up with much thought, may cause problems. We are told that there will be an identity card scheme. Will this information go on ID cards? I do not know but I rather suspect that if it did it would be controversial.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08012836000036"></a>While I sympathise enormously with what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is trying to do, I consider that the amendment does not, as he said, take us a stage further. It simply acknowledges that there is a problem and makes the situation even less clear than it is at present. Finally, given the deep concerns on this matter, and given its potential impact, particularly on the lives of children, I am not happy about it being left to regulation. It should appear in primary legislation. So while I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, I cannot support the amendment for the reasons I have given.</p>

In the past there was a great deal of secrecy in this area and society generally accepted this culture, as the noble Earl rightly said. Although the same culture of secrecy is no longer the case, this is a sensitive area that involves delving into intimate family relationships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08012836000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, eloquently told us of the conflicting views on this issue and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, expanded further on those differences. I believe that we all agree on the value of donor-conceived children knowing about their origins, but we must weigh this against inappropriate interference from the state and work out the best method for achieving openness. The approach of the Donor Conception Network&#151;an organisation of families of donor-conceived  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_510"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children and donor-conceived adults&#151;is to encourage parents of donor-conceived children to tell them from a young age about their background. The Government recognise the merit in this approach and we are committed to encouraging openness by way of education rather than enforcement. We are funding the Donor Conception Network to produce materials on how to tell, and to run workshops on telling.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08012836000039"></a>The Government have proposed to strengthen the provisions in the Bill with respect to counselling and information provision. In addition to requiring that all patients be given the offer of counselling and provided with relevant information, it also places a requirement on the HFEA to produce guidance on doing so to clinics. I recognise that there is some feeling that indicating in some way on birth certificates that children are donor-conceived will ensure they are better placed to find out about their genetic background. I believe that there would be very serious drawbacks to that approach. First, it is surely better for a person to find out that they are donor conceived in the course of a discussion with his or her family rather than through a birth certificate. Secondly, birth certificates are discoverable documents for anyone, so this information would not be kept private. The point raised by the noble Baroness about identity cards is an interesting one on which to reflect. There are further practical problems such as how, when registering a birth, a registrar could be expected to ask every person for information about the child&#146;s conception without causing distress or offence. There is a further possibility that some parents might want to hide this information and not be honest when registering the birth.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08012836000040"></a>There are also questions about whether the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, as proposed in the amendment, is best placed to carry out a review in this area. Changes to the birth registration laws would involve amending a number of different Acts and I do not believe that a review of the law in this area would be within the remit of the HFEA. It is also not clear that this provision is necessarily appropriate to be implemented by secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08012836000041"></a>Very important issues have been raised during this debate and I believe we are all committed to the same objective&#151;to ensure that donor-conceived children are aware of their conception and origins. Since the Committee stage we have had many discussions to try to resolve this problem but, frankly, we have not done so yet. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment is an interesting way forward but we do not believe that it is the right one at this time for the reasons that I have given.</p>

<a name="80128-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08012836000042"></a>The Government keep matters concerning gamete and embryo donation under review. We reviewed the position on donors, leading to the removal of donor anonymity in 2005 and we have provisions in this Bill that allow for donor-conceived people, their siblings and their donors, to have access to information. As I mentioned earlier in withdrawing Amendment No. 128, we have accepted the spirit of Amendment No. 129, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, which would extend the HFEA's duty to give guidance about information provided by clinics to state that information provided by clinics should address the importance of disclosing to any child born from treatment services the circumstances of their conception.</p>

The noble Lord disagrees with that. I accept that there is a disparity here, and he is seeking to ensure that the truth is on all birth certificates.

What we feel is important is that children should be informed of their real parenthood, as it were, at an appropriate time. If a child has two parents, both of whom happen to be of the same sex, it is clear that they do not have a mother and a father. Therefore, it is right and proper that their birth certificate should say the donor. It is clear that they do not have a mother and a father in the usual sense, if one may put it like that. I am getting terribly confused here. We firmly believe that while children who have been conceived by in vitro fertilisation have a need to know whenever possible&#151;we hope that those children will be informed at an appropriate age who their parents are for their well-being, their genetic inheritance and all the arguments we have heard this evening&#151;their parents are best placed to inform them. We believe that information is best coming from the parents, not from their birth certificate, because it is a rather private matter.</p>

I am sure that the legislation would not be discriminatory, otherwise we would not be bringing it forward. If I am incorrect and we are being discriminatory in law, I will of course inform noble Lords, but I am content that that is not the case.</p>

Secondly, there is the issue of which of those things any child at any point in their life may wish that public document to reflect. Thirdly, there is the right of the child to know and the right of the family to have the privacy to teach their children what their origins are according to their own values and mores, knowing that parents can withhold that information. We have three dilemmas, none of which we can deal with now. The only question now is a practical one&#151;whether it is best to revisit the issue when more consensus has developed through amendment or primary legislation.</p>

These are very important issues that matter very much to those children about whom everybody is expressing such great concern. In view of the fact that we have had many discussions but not found a solution yet, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment and trust that we can find an adequate solution in future.</p>

Set alongside the birth certificate, which should be an historic record telling the absolute biological truth, perhaps there should be a social document. That document could tell the story of the relationships in much the way the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, mentioned. It is something the Government might want to look at.</p>

That might be worth looking at. However, we have looked at various types of birth certificates and the information that might go on them. As I have said, we have discussed that with many of the people concerned, so I am confident that the discussions we have had to date have been comprehensive.</p>

It has been warmly supported by a number of noble Lords, many of whom have much longer experience in this field than I do. It is disappointing that we cannot see some way forward in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08012836000055"></a>The Minister raised the difficulty of whether the HFEA is the right body to do this. I understand that it is not the body that is responsible for the registration of births, deaths and marriages. There is a tremendous amount in the Bill about the registrar&#146;s duties and what goes on the birth certificate, which will clearly be within the purview of the HFEA. In fact, the HFEA is the body that understands about donor conception. I do not think it is in the least bit unreasonable that we should ask the HFEA to keep the issue under review &#147;from time to time&#148;, as I said in the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked what would trigger it. The answer is that when there has been time for the debate to move on, the HFEA might say, &#147;It is time for us to have another look at this. We are getting a good deal of pressure from one body or another to say that something must be done&#148;. The argument about the state not conniving in deception has always seemed strong. We are leaving that in the air.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08012836000056"></a>I would like to feel that at some later stage in another place, the Government might be able to find something that could go in the Bill that keeps the door open, as many noble Lords who have spoken in the debate have said, and I am grateful to them all for speaking. The noble Baroness said, &#147;Yes, the Government are going to keep this under review&#148;. I am sorry, but I have been around long enough to realise that without some sort of statutory obligation that does not mean a great deal. I would have liked to have seen something here. I am not sure that this is the right issue on which to divide the House; and anyway it is dinner time and I think we are going to have a break. The House has been very kind and has indicated its views. I am a little upset by the Government&#146;s rather negative attitude but, in the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0801294000004"></a>Amendments Nos. 147 and 148 amend paragraph 15 of Schedule 6 to the Bill, which makes consequential amendments to the Legitimacy Act 1976, so as to change the phrase &#147;date of the civil partnership&#148; to &#147;date of the formation of the civil partnership&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0801294000021"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving the amendment, which amends the law on late abortions, I will first explain, in case some of your Lordships are not aware, that a baby who may have a disability can go full term and then be killed and removed from its mother. The legal time for abortion is 24 weeks, but there is no time limit for handicapped babies. This is discrimination of the worst sort.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0801294000022"></a>I personally find discussing abortion very difficult, as it would not happen in an ideal world. However, we are discussing the law of the land, which allows abortion up to 24 weeks&#151;six months&#151;which means that the baby is well developed. How can it be, in this modern world of advanced technology, that babies are allowed to go full term and then be given a lethal injection and killed just because they are still inside the womb and may have a handicap? The amendment would stop this unfair discrimination. It has become known as &#147;the equality amendment&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0801294000023"></a>So much has been talked about the welfare of the child. I must try to persuade some of your Lordships that the welfare of the living baby within the mother&#146;s womb should also be considered and protected. There have been many advances in medical procedures. An example is a remarkable operation in the USA to correct a baby of 21 weeks with spina bifida while still in the mother&#146;s womb, which shows how wonderful a surgeon&#146;s skill can be. I ask the Minister whether this operation is undertaken in the UK. Is how much a baby can feel before it is born known? So many babies are being aborted who are thought to be severely disabled but turn out not to be; I know that some of your Lordships know of some such individual cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0801294000024"></a>In Committee, it was the wish of many of your Lordships that there should be a Select Committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the abortion law, proposed by my noble friends Lady Finlay of Llandaff and Lord Alton of Liverpool, and the noble Lord, Lord Steel. Sadly, the Liaison Committee turned it down.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0801294000025"></a>The provision allowing a baby to go full term and then be killed because of a disability became legal as a result of an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, amending the 1967 Act. This was before disability discrimination legislation. I want the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, to take note of this issue. We should consider how serious and important this legislation is to help and protect people who have a disability. My noble friend Lady Campbell of Surbiton unfortunately cannot be with us today because she has a chest infection. In Committee, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a><a name="0801294000180"></a>&#147;My view and that of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, as press-released last week, is that whatever the time limit set, it should be equal, irrespective of whether the woman gives birth to a disabled child&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/12/07; col. 307.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0801294000026"></a>Many people, including a law don from Cambridge, have written to me to say how deeply insulting and offensive Section 5(1)(1)(d) is to every single member of the human race who has been born with some physical or mental disability that other people would regard as serious&#151;whatever that may mean&#151;since it proclaims that such people are not worth caring for, should not be treasured and should not be protected from those who wish to kill them off, provided only that the killing is done before they are born alive. I know some splendid people who were born with spina bifida and cleft pallets. Had this legislation been in force at the time they were in their mother&#146;s womb, they might not be here today. What about such brilliant artists as Beethoven and Toulouse Lautrec? They would not be here. We would not appreciate their wonderful art and music. I beg to move.</p>

I know how strongly she feels about this. I read in <I>Hansard</I> the speech she made in Committee.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0801294000028"></a>I should say at the beginning that this part of the abortion legislation was by far the most contentious and difficult one to deal with at the time that we were legislating for legal abortion, but I believe that the paragraph of the Abortion Act that the noble Baroness seeks to delete is more important now than it was in 1967, simply because medical advances and the customary screening of pregnant women has enabled severe abnormality to be detected at a much earlier stage than was the case 40 years ago. Although the number of abortions carried out under this paragraph of the Abortion Act is a tiny proportion of the total, it is none the less a serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0801294000029"></a>Indeed, when we were debating these issues in both Houses all that time ago, we were very concerned that we did not slip onto the slippery slope of eugenics in this matter. I am well aware that in some societies abortion is used as a method of selecting the sex of children, which I find completely abhorrent. Nevertheless, I believe that the noble Baroness is profoundly wrong when she suggests, as she did in Committee, that in some way the existence of this legislation is an offence to the dignity of disabled people. In the past five years, one of my relatives and a friend of mine have given birth to severely disabled children. I know that after the initial pain of that discovery was over, the entire family and everybody who came in contact with them felt delighted at every stage of progress that those children made.</p>

<a name="80128-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0801294000030"></a>Sadly, one of them, my relative, did not survive. However, she lives on, not just in the memory of those who knew her, but because we set up a fund to raise money to help medical research into the heart defect from which she suffered. Therefore, her contribution to society, in her very short life, was substantial. As for my friend&#146;s child, he is making as much progress as he can at his school, and we delight in that. There is no question of treating these people as, in any way, second-class citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0801294000031"></a>The Beethoven argument, which I have heard so often, is fundamentally false because you cannot have abortion retrospectively. Nobody has ever said, either to Beethoven or to any of these children I have referred to, &#147;Oh, I wish you had never been born&#148;. That is an absurd argument and not one that should be sustained.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0801294000032"></a>There have been challenges since this law came into being. There was one famous legal case taken in the courts, allegedly, because a foetus had been aborted with only a hare lip. The case was thrown out by the courts&#151;rightly so, because as the medical Members of the House may tell us, a hare lip is often an indication of something far more serious. It is something that they have to judge in each case.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0801294000033"></a>We have to remind ourselves that all the abortion law does is to lay down the boundary of the criminal law. It is not a law that says what doctors or parents should do. It simply says that, in certain circumstances outlined in the law, if two doctors, &#147;in good faith&#148;&#151;the words are in the Act&#151;together with the mother, decide that it is in the best interest for the foetus to be aborted, they can do that without criminal prosecution. It does not say how and when they should do that. That is an important matter.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0801294000034"></a>It is also the case&#151;but again, the medical Members of the House will confirm this&#151;that, very often, natural abortion, or as we more euphemistically call it, miscarriage, occurs when a foetus is abnormal and therefore the body rejects it. All that medical science is doing now, with screening, is assisting that process when nature has failed. Therefore, it is the case that the general clause dealt with in subsection (1) of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness should be sustained.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0801294000035"></a>As to subsection (2) of her amendment, to which she spoke earlier, that was a change made in both Houses in 1990, as she rightly said. At that time, it was agreed, and I agreed with it, to reduce the age of  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assumption of viability, in the light of medical knowledge, from 28 weeks&#151;which had existed, not from the Abortion Act 1967, but from the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929&#151;to 24 weeks. That was agreed and it went through both Houses without demur. However, as a consequence, the section, to which the noble Baroness has drawn attention, was added, to say that, in the case of severely disabled foetuses, the 24 week limit would not apply.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0801294000036"></a>I must admit that I had some hesitation about that section. It meant that, as the noble Baroness said, an abortion could be carried out right up to the point of birth, which was contrary to the Infant Life Preservation Act, never mind the Abortion Act itself. However, my mind was settled on that issue by a conversation, which I will retell to the House, that I had with a distinguished professor of obstetrics at one of our leading universities.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0801294000037"></a>He told me about two cases referred to him, after the 24 week limit had passed, of mothers who were carrying foetuses which had no prospect of life. In the one case, after immense consultation and proper counselling, it was agreed that the pregnancy should be terminated and the mother helped to start a new and healthy pregnancy and that is what happened. In the other case, identical to the previous one, the mother, for reasons known to herself, which may have been religious or because of other conditions in the family&#151;I do not know the circumstances&#151;decided that they would rather have the baby born. The baby having been born dead, they took it in the family car from the hospital to their house to see the room that had been prepared for it, and then brought the dead baby back to the hospital.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0801294000038"></a>The professor made three points. First, tragically, the outcome was the same in both cases. He could do nothing about it. Secondly, both parents had been the subject of proper counselling&#151;a subject which we come back to time and again when discussing abortion. Proper counselling is very important and in this case they had expert counselling. The third thing they had in common was that the parents were ultimately able to decide on their preference. That is terribly important. If the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment were carried, that choice would be taken away and we in Parliament would be denying people a free choice on what to do in these difficult and tragic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0801294000040"></a>Many years ago, when I was a local councillor, I remember calling to see a lady who had a badly disabled child&#151;she called him that, although he was 38 years old. What worried her above everything else was who would look after Tommy when she was gone. I thought that quite dreadful and that there ought to have been some way of helping her when he was young, because she said that she was never able to leave him alone. I do not think she had had a holiday after her husband died. There was no one else to look after the boy. She had had a really dreadful life, but that is no reason not to have the child at all.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0801294000041"></a>Society ought to help a great deal more. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel, acknowledged, a handicapped person is often a great blessing. A handicapped baby can be that, and we can learn such a lot from its courage and smiles. It worries me greatly that we are at the stage of seeming to go further and further down the dateline. In the past few days, I was horrified to hear this matter being discussed on the radio by two professors who were trying to decide whether an unborn child felt pain. I can remember seeing pictures of unborn children being jabbed with a needle while in the womb, and their reaction seemed perfectly visible. It was a definite reaction to receiving a painful jab. The professors could not agree&#151;but which two professors can agree, except the noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Winston? In the main, however, experts disagree. The professors said, &#147;If there is any doubt about the unborn child feeling pain, we can always inject it with something that will stop it feeling pain while it is aborted&#148;. That is an extraordinary way of looking at the issue.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0801294000042"></a>We should value our disabled friends greatly and in no way seem to act against them by permitting a later abortion for them than for others. It worries me that we increasingly accept that abortion is necessary and that it will happen. A friend of mine was told by her doctors that she should think seriously about having an abortion because her child was handicapped. She refused to do so and the child was slightly handicapped in one foot, which the doctors were able to rectify over about four years. This matter worries me and I have pleasure in supporting my noble friend. </p>

I do so as someone who has been firmly committed all her life to equality. Although one respects the noble Baroness&#146;s deeply held beliefs on this matter, I think that she is wrong. It is essential that we listen to the long-held views of the medical community and to the very opposing views of those within the disabled community, such as the National Disabled Students Union, which is deeply opposed to this amendment. In 2006, less than 1 per cent of abortions carried out in England and Wales took place on these grounds. If this amendment is passed, should women still be offered antenatal screening and diagnostic testing at all? Under the law, they would not be able to end the pregnancy. So it would appear to be a futile exercise and a retrograde step.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_521"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0801294000044"></a>The issues around detection of abnormalities and the timing of antenatal screenings are complex. It is unfortunate that it remains impossible to diagnose many foetal abnormalities before the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is usually at 21 or 22 weeks&#146; gestation. Even then some foetal malformations are not apparent but visualise beyond 24 weeks if there is a need for a further scan. Identification of a problem at this scan would almost certainly mean that further tests are required. Those tests take time. The law currently allows time for counselling and time for the women to be able to choose&#151;to make a choice. These are desperate cases. There needs to be time for the woman to have the counselling and to make the choice where an abnormality is discovered very late. Putting those few women under pressure to make a painful decision without having the time they may need to do so is unthinkable and inhumane.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0801294000045"></a>Medical professionals also support the current situation whereby the Act does not list how serious handicap should be defined. I believe that flexibility is essential. The Government supported this flexible approach in their response to the recent report on abortion by the Science and Technology Committee in the other place. In their response, the Government stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="0801294000200"></a>&#147;an exhaustive list of abnormalities is neither feasible nor desirable on the face of the Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801294000144"></a>I welcome that defence of the current law.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0801294000046"></a>In Committee, and again today, the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, has mentioned abortions for minor disabilities, saying that these could be rectifiable. But we cannot ignore the fact that these conditions can sometimes be indicators of an underlying genetic syndrome or serious defect, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel, mentioned.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0801294000047"></a>This amendment is also opposed by the Genetic Interest Group, a national alliance of patients&#146; organisations which supports children, families and individuals affected by genetic disorders. Passing this amendment would particularly affect the reproductive choices of those parents who know they are carriers of a genetic disorder and risk having a baby with the condition. It has also been suggested that women are coerced into an abortion by doctors who are prejudiced against people with disabilities. The evidence suggests the reverse. Clinicians are reluctant to be directive and these difficult and complex decisions are taken in partnership between the parents and the professionals providing the care.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0801294000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, who unfortunately cannot be in the House today due to a longstanding commitment, has asked me to say that he is in full agreement with the points I have made. In particular, he asked me to say that there is a range of views on this question to be found among disabled people and that in comparing foetuses which have the potential to be a disabled person with non-disabled persons, the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, is not comparing like with like. Arguments based on equality are just not appropriate.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0801294000049"></a>Finally, no woman ever makes the decision to have an abortion lightly. It is a particularly heartbreaking dilemma in cases where the pregnancy has been very

Those who make that painful choice to end a pregnancy do so after much careful consideration, advice and counselling of what the diagnosis may mean for their baby, the child&#146;s quality of life and what it might mean for themselves and their family&#146;s future. They should be supported to make the reproductive choice which is best for them rather than facing condemnation. I ask the House not to support this amendment.</p>

<a name="0801294000050"></a><b><a name="80128-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0801294000332"></a>Lord Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I follow the noble Baroness, Lady Gould; she knows, as I said in Committee, that I have a great deal of respect for her on a whole range of issues on which we often co-operate. On this issue, however, we are in disagreement. I fully support the amendment that my noble friend Lady Masham has laid before the House tonight. I set out my arguments for supporting the amendment at some length on 12 December, the last day of Committee, at col. 308. The procedures of the House are such that you should not repeat all the arguments that you made in Committee. I shall therefore not trespass too long on your Lordships&#146; indulgence this evening.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0801294000051"></a>I should like to speak about one or two of the questions that have been raised tonight and raise one other issue with the Minister. At the heart of our debate&#151;the noble Baroness has just mentioned it again&#151;is this issue of whether choice should be a trump. I have always been troubled by that argument&#151;the argument about personal autonomy being more important than other considerations. I guess that this is where the issues divide us. In 1906, in his book <I>Orthodoxy</I>, GK Chesterton said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0801294000201"></a>&#147;to admire mere choice is to refuse to choose&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801294000052"></a>Sometimes we have to look beyond the issue of choice at the deeper questions. For me the question is, is this life itself? If it is life, do we have obligations towards it, and does the state not have a duty to protect?</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0801294000053"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said earlier, a very small number of abortions take place on the grounds of disability. Of the 7 million abortions that have occurred since the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, and the noble Lord, Lord Steel, first debated this issue in 1967, 98 per cent have been done under the social clause and do not have anything to do with the hard cases. As my noble friend made clear tonight, that is not a reason why we should ignore these other questions or say that they are less important, especially as this is a discrete question that has arisen, as the noble Lord said, because of the change that was made in the 1990 Act and which did not occur before. That is when we decided to allow abortion up to birth specifically on the grounds of disability.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0801294000054"></a>I should like to ask the Minister how this corresponds with human rights legislation and what advice we have taken on compatibility as far as issues of discrimination and equality are concerned. That, after all, is at the heart of the argument that my noble friend has laid before the House. I should also like to ask him about the definition of the word &#147;serious&#148;. It is a question that I raised in Committee when I referred to Section 1(1)(d) of the Abortion Act, which allows abortion up to birth if,</p>
<ul><a name="0801294000202"></a>&#147;there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0801294000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Steel, gave examples I think of anencephaly and hydrocephaly, and of life-threatening disorders where often the child cannot be born alive anyway. There would probably be no disagreement between us on that. That was never meant to fall within the scope even of this amendment, which I think was first moved in 1990.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0801294000055"></a>We need to concentrate on the definition of &#147;serious&#148;. The Reverend Joanna Jepson, as many of your Lordships will know, tested this issue when she went to court over the issue of cleft palates. Since then, there have been other cases not only about cleft palates but about club feet, hare-lips and webbed fingers. Although I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, also made this point&#151;that it may indicate other more serious conditions, I would like the Minister to tell us when he replies why we do not require the precise reasons to be stipulated on the forms that authorise these very late abortions and how they conform to this word &#147;serious&#148;. Cleft palates, club feet, hare-lips or webbed fingers are rectifiable disabilities, and I do not think that anyone in your Lordships&#146; House would argue that they should be a ground for abortion up to and even during birth.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0801294000056"></a>My noble friend also referred to spina bifida. I drew to her attention last week, as I have to one or two other noble Lords who are in the House this evening, an extraordinary photograph that I was recently sent of a baby called Samuel Alexander Armas, who was at 21 weeks&#146; gestation when an extraordinary surgeon called Joseph Bruner, who works at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, removed the baby from the womb, operated on the spina bifida and returned the baby to the womb, successfully dealing with the spina bifida. There is an extraordinary subsequent photograph of this baby, who is now three or four years old, holding a sibling who had the same condition and who was also operated on in utero.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0801294000057"></a>It might be valuable for us to discuss in some detail at some other stage what we are doing in this country to develop operations in utero to correct rectifiable disabilities. The scar tissue on the spine of that boy healed completely, and although he has some ongoing conditions, his life and that of his sibling were saved. This combines good ethics with good medicine, which should commend itself to your Lordships. I know it will commend itself to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, who is one of the foremost surgeons in this country. I hope that, when he comes to reply, he will not only tell us about the definition of this word &#147;serious&#148; but say something about what can be done and is being done in utero in this country now, and about how widely the sorts of operations to which I have just referred are being practised.</p>

Only this evening, Professor Sunny Anand, one of the world&#146;s foremost experts on foetal pain, addressed a meeting elsewhere in the Palace&#151;a meeting that was reported in the newspaper this morning. He was accompanied by someone who is not from my side of the argument but who the noble Lord, Lord Steel,   


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_524"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will know&#151;Professor Stuart Campbell, a leading gynaecologist from Glasgow, who took the extraordinary 4-D footage of the baby walking in the womb. They talked at the meeting about pain. Professor Sunny Anand said that he believes a baby can feel pain before 24 weeks&#146; gestation and that this should affect our attitudes towards particularly late abortions. That in turn puts the other side of the argument put by the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, earlier in our proceedings this evening when he said quite rightly that technology, medicine and our knowledge of what is happening to the child in the womb has advanced through foetal scanning and the rest. All of us who have seen our own babies on a foetal scan know the magic of that moment. I remember seeing my son, then at nine weeks&#146; gestation, on a foetal scan when his twin had miscarried&#151;naturally, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said earlier. My wife bled profusely during the pregnancy that followed, and there was great uncertainty about the outcome. I am happy to say that the outcome was fine and that that son has done well and is about to do his A-levels next year. The point that the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, was making earlier is that we can never be sure when we are told by these tests and scans, or from the things that happen to us in life, what the outcomes will be. We should therefore be very cautious about trying to predetermine everything.</p>

<a name="80128-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0801294000059"></a>While I was a Member of Parliament in Liverpool a constituent came to see me because she had been told that her baby would be seriously disabled. She was a single-parent mother and had been told that she should have an abortion in order to be rid of a problem that she would otherwise encounter. She was told that she would have huge difficulty in bringing up the child. But when the child was born, there was nothing wrong with it. She had been told that he would be a dwarf and there would be other ailments&#151;a whole range of disabilities. Subsequently, she became pregnant again. When she went to the hospital for tests on the second occasion she was told, &#147;Because you had a disabled baby the first time&#148;&#151;she had not, but that was on her medical records&#151;&#147;you must have the amniocentesis test. If you don&#146;t, it will be irresponsible&#148;. Amniocentesis carries a 2 to 3 per cent risk of spontaneous abortion. The tests can carry consequences as well and they do not necessarily tell us the outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0801294000060"></a>I am glad that my noble friend has had the courage to bring this amendment before us and this debate to your Lordships&#146; House. The noble Lord, Lord Steel, my noble friend Lady Finlay and I suggested to the Liaison Committee that there should be a full Select Committee not just to look at this question but to conduct a comprehensive review, as the noble Lord said, after 40 years of this legislation being on the statute book. He and I totally agree on that. Rather than discussing this within the context of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, that would have been, and still could be, the best way of proceeding. I hope that, when the Bill goes to another place, the Members there will accept that suggestion, in the spirit in which it was offered, and perhaps allow us to look again at all these questions far more comprehensively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0801294000062"></a>On 21 November, on the second day of Second Reading, I outlined my concerns that Members in the other place might make attempts to lengthen the period up to which abortions could take place. I mentioned many other concerns and it is too late in the evening to go through them all again, but I still have this great concern that somebody will try hard to undo some of the good work that has been done. On the question of pain, I will just repeat what I said at Second Reading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a><a name="0801294000181"></a>&#147;We know that from 16 weeks babies will recoil from a noxious stimulus in the womb and that premature babies born earlier than 24 weeks will, if stabbed in the heel with a needle, pull their foot away and cry. It seems reasonable to assume that they are feeling pain&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; col. 853.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80128-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0801294000063"></a>During the passage of the Bill, much time has quite properly been devoted to the creation of life. For a lay person such as me, it has been an education to learn of the efforts of highly skilled and professional people who help women to bear children. As has been said, we are fortunate in this House to have such people as Members. My support for this amendment is strengthened by the moving speech given by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, at Second Reading. Sometimes when you leave this place, you get half way home and you think, &#147;I have forgotten all that&#148;. But the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, have stayed with me. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="0801294000182"></a>&#147;A paediatric plastic surgeon told me that he needed about 29 babies with hare lip defects each year to keep his hand in practice so that he was expert at his job. He is not getting them as he used to because so many are being aborted. When I related this to my secretary, who had been born with such a defect which had been corrected, she was horrified&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; col. 726.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801294000146"></a>She went on to say that people were arguing that people with disabilities should not be brought into the world. As I say, it is late and I should like to quote even more. But that was a case of a lady whose problems were corrected in later life but who could have been terminated if somebody had not allowed her to go to term. We should be championing those people who perform such operations and give people a life. My support for the amendment is strengthened by the words of the noble Baroness.</p>

As the six hours that I have been sitting here tediously went by, when those areas in which I was not involved were debated, I listened very carefully&#151;as I say, it was an education. But what a stark contrast between that and what we have heard from the noble Baroness and what we have heard about the efforts to assist in the creation of human life, as this Bill has made its way through its various stages.

I am not convinced that a foetus as such carries rights; we have responsibilities to it, but I think that humans grow into rights. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, may wish to take me on about that.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0801294000066"></a>What we have not heard about is the position of the woman. I ask your Lordships just for a moment to put yourselves into the position of a woman who has had tests and has learnt at 25 weeks that the foetus that she is carrying&#151;and it may have been a much wanted child&#151;has a severe disability or abnormality. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that we are talking about severe abnormalities. On reflection, after discussing the situation with a partner and possibly after counselling, the woman decides that the right thing for her and possibly for other members of her family is to seek an abortion. If this amendment were passed, she would not be able to get that abortion. What would we be saying to that woman? We would be saying that, although she does not wish to continue with the pregnancy, we will require her to carry that foetus, even though she knows that it is severely disabled, for another three months with growing discomfort, going through the pain and to some degree the risk of childbirth, and to have at the end of it a child that she had sought not to have, with all the stress and the potential for postnatal depression and the like that might follow.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0801294000067"></a>That woman has rights, too. The only person who can make an informed choice, within the framework of the law&#151;although some women will make one choice and others a different choice&#151;is the mother of that foetus and potential child. We would be unwise to seek to impose on that potential mother that she bring that foetus to full term against her wishes and against her own health&#151;and certainly against her own judgment&#151;because we think that it would be good for her and for that foetus to continue despite its severe abnormality. I do not think that that is a decent and proper way in which to go. Other people may have a different view. Everyone is entitled absolutely to have a different view on this, and everyone in that situation would make a different call and a different judgment. But the person to make that call and that judgment is the potential mother and no one else.</p>

This is not a debate about the general concept of abortion. I support the noble Baronesses, Lady Hollis and Lady Gould, and I shall be going into the Lobby in opposition to this amendment. I shall describe a circumstance with which many of your Lordships may identify. I have seen a situation where a child was born, before the technology that we have today, severely mentally and physically handicapped. The parents have, for about 10 or 12 years, tried to identify with that child and bring him up, making a total sacrifice in the knowledge that the child does not really recognise them after all those years. In the end, the parents are so worn out that the child goes into care, still not identifying his or her own parents and not even knowing who they are. I do not want to see any parent&#151;particularly a woman&#151;being subjected to

Anyone who ventures into the field of abortion&#151;I have never particularly done so before&#151;is treading on very tender ground. Since the days when the noble Lord, Lord Steel, introduced his Bill on abortion, which was deeply controversial, there have been lots of abortions, to such an extent that some people almost regard abortion as a choice. That was the word of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton: we have a choice. These abortions have gone on and, as far as I understand it, the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, says that you cannot have an abortion after 25 weeks. At the moment you can have an abortion up to the point when the child is born.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0801294000070"></a>When does that child become a human being? Is it the point at which it comes into the world, because that is the moment when it becomes, as it were, a free human being? It is the same child that was in the womb the day before. Is it really justifiable to say that that child is wrong and, therefore, we ought to abort it? We all want to have perfect children, perfect lives and perfect health, but it does not work out that way.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0801294000071"></a>I am apprehensive, and always have been, about the wisdom of abortions at an early stage, because you are destroying some form of life. I am deeply apprehensive about it at a later stage, because it is very difficult to tell when that child is a foetus and when it becomes a human being with a soul. Aborting children&#151;and I have no experience of this other than seeing pictures&#151;can be pretty grisly. Destroying human beings, even if they are in the womb, is a terrible task to take on. I hope that the amendment will go through, because I do not think it right that human beings should decide at one moment that this child, who is a human being, should not be born.</p>

We joked about it, so I must offer my apologies. I agree absolutely with everything that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said, but I want to speak about the rights of the child. The Mental Capacity Act refers to the child having capacity; if they do not have capacity, it is important for the professionals to consider their best interests. If we could hold to that, we would be doing pretty well. I happen to know two tiny children who were born at 25 weeks with very severe cerebral palsy. They were natural births. Those two children cannot breathe naturally; they have to be helped to breathe. They will never talk. They lie on their backs and can do nothing. My belief is that there are children, born at those very early ages, who are not viable people. It would be in their best interests to have been aborted. There rests my case. We need to consider the best interests of these babies.</p>

I believe quite simply that it is right and proper that the same laws should apply to people who are disabled as to those who are not. Therefore, if a foetus is viable, which it will be after the age of 25 or 26 weeks, it should be permitted to live. It will be a matter of nature whether or not it lives.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0801294000074"></a>We have heard about a great many grim cases. I can equally come up with a case of a very close friend of mine who had a baby with very serious Down&#146;s syndrome, but who has given her more pleasure than anything else in her life. The child has been an immense treasure, and she has no other children. We can all argue these cases for good or for evil. My point is a very simple one. We have a society where once people are born we increasingly go to extraordinary lengths to look after them if they are disabled. All around our country, and quite rightly so, we have ramps and lifts and all kinds of additional things that make it possible for a heavily disabled young person or child to live and enjoy a decent quality of life.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0801294000075"></a>Many of us will be disabled, not because we were born with a genetic disability but because we have suffered an accident that has heavily disabled us. We have to be accepted in society. Society has to make changes to ensure our lives are worth living. One of the things that really frightens me is that, if we pick out the potentially disabled at the age of 25 or 26 weeks, we will sooner or later develop an attitude towards the severely disabled who have been disabled since birth. We ought to be clear on the logic of this. If we are to treat disabled people in all possible ways as potentially having exactly the same quality of life as we do and doing everything we can to make that conceivable, then we have to carry that through always, from when one becomes viable to when one reaches the natural end of one&#146;s life.</p>

In many ways we have had a very moving debate again this evening. We had one in Committee.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0801294000077"></a>I would like to add one or two things to the debate. I will try not to be very long. The noble Lord, Lord Steel, pointed out that we are talking about less than 1 per cent, and in the case of very disabled babies much less than 1 per cent, of the total abortions done in this country.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0801294000078"></a>My noble friend Lady Williams said that we should have equality in the timing of when abortion is permitted. The very reason we say after 24 weeks for severely disabled foetuses is because the tests cannot be done to make sure that the baby has a certain condition until 24 weeks, and 26 weeks in some cases. Therefore, that means a woman carrying a handicapped baby has missed the time limit that is put on normal abortions of 24 weeks.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0801294000079"></a>I said in Committee that we were not talking here about disabled human beings, but about some grossly abnormal human beings; many of those whom I have seen bear little resemblance to human beings. In Committee I mentioned the child with anencephaly  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_529"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I delivered. It had no brain and a grotesque appearance. I spent some time as a medical student in a hospital that was meant for very severely mentally and physically disabled children. It was the most terrible two weeks I have ever spent in the whole of my career, seeing those poor creatures, some of them a little less affected than the others, and maybe trying to feed someone who could just lie in a cot at the age of 35 or 40 and do absolutely nothing else. We are talking about serious handicap.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0801294000080"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, questioned &#147;seriousness&#148;, and asked how serious should a disablement be. We have heard from two noble Lords how surgery in the womb and outside the womb during pregnancy is being developed. That is wonderful news for those foetuses that can be helped in this way. Some mothers of course choose to go down that road to help their babies in that way, but we should not impose that solution or promise it when it does not exist in all seriousness.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0801294000081"></a>I have just one other point to add on the famous cleft palate case that nearly everyone has mentioned. I would like to tell the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, that about 1,000 babies are born each year with a cleft palate. Looking at the incidence of cleft palate among children generally, that means that not many of them are being aborted. The surgeon he spoke of should have the normal number to practise on. People are not having late abortions for that reason.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0801294000082"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, mentioned the disabled students. We heard a moving speech from one of them at a meeting in the other place last week. The important thing about the NUS disabled students is that they are elected representatives. They are not interest or lobby groups; they are elected representatives of disabled people who do not want a woman&#146;s choice to be affected by these considerations. They feel it is the woman&#146;s right to make the decision.</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0801294000083"></a>Finally, supporting this amendment would mean that every woman in this country who has a severely disabled child would have to carry it to term or perhaps go through the same trauma as a 17 year-old Irish girl recently, who was known to have an anencephalic foetus and was shipped across to here, then back to there, and went through the law courts in Ireland before a decision was finally somehow made that she could have a termination of her pregnancy. Are we going to put all women in this country in that situation if they have a handicapped foetus?</p>

<a name="80128-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0801294000084"></a>I ask the people who support this amendment to have a bit of compassion. They speak as if they are being extremely compassionate and want to save the life of the child. Let us have some compassion for the mother who is carrying these pregnancies too. I do not believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, or her supporters are cruel or inhumane. Of course they are not, yet it would be cruel and inhumane in the extreme to make women carrying seriously handicapped babies go to full term and deliver a child that they know would never have any quality of life at all, even if it survived the birth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0801294000087"></a>As far as possible, prenatal screening is to ensure that women and their partners have accurate information about the foetus. At whatever stage foetal abnormality is diagnosed, women and their partners need good-quality information about the implications of that result and the options open to them. The context in which parents choose whether to have a child should be one in which disability and non-disability are valued equally and parents should receive comprehensive, balanced information and guidance on disability, the rights of disabled people and the support available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0801294000088"></a>On the examination of terminations that are currently performed under this paragraph after 24 weeks, one finds that these cases are usually complex. There may be multiple anomalies rather than one. When the forms are classified, the code which is used is that of the primary condition. This does not always tell the whole picture of each individual case, which is exactly why, in 1990, Parliament chose not to define &#147;serious handicap&#148; in the Act. Parliament chose to leave this to the expert judgment of the two doctors, based on the merits of each individual case. The doctors must form their own opinion of the seriousness of the handicap the child would suffer if born, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case. The existing guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists furthermore urges obstetricians to err on the side of caution when considering whether an abortion could be performed on the grounds of foetal abnormality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0801294000090"></a>As regards the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on foetal pain, the 1997 report of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists concluded that before 26 weeks&#146; gestation the nervous system has not developed sufficiently to allow the foetus to experience pain. I am not aware of any new evidence that has changed that conclusion. 4-D imaging is an exciting

Although the noble Lord made the point that the images illustrate the development stages of the foetus, from a scientific perspective they do not change the current knowledge about foetal viability or foetal pain. On the last question he asked, on the legal status of the foetus, both domestic and European law on discrimination&#151;that includes the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;apply only to living persons. The foetus is not regarded as a living person in domestic law and has no rights independent of its mother until it is born alive. The courts have consistently held that a foetus is not recognised as being a separate person from its mother.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0801294000111"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in the absence of the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay and Lady Jay, I have been asked, if the House permits, to move this amendment in their names and I promise no vote. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, said in Committee, this issue concerned the pre-legislative scrutiny committee: that is, the postcode lottery of IVF treatment and that the NICE guidelines&#151;they are not targets or requirements&#151;did not appear to be followed as we believe they should.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0801294000112"></a>That there is such a lottery can be in no doubt. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, furnished me with statistics to that effect. I understand the figures are for 2006-07 and they are the latest figures that she has. For example, East Sussex has a population only slightly less than that of Dorset&#146;s PCT&#151;326,000 to 395,000&#151;yet East Sussex gave IVF treatment to only 32 women and Dorset treated 110 women. Mid-Essex, with a population of 359,000 in its PCT, treated 43 women; and south-west Essex, with 420,000 people in its PCT, treated 76 women, nearly double. Similarly within London, Camden, with 210,000 people in its PCT, treated 51 women; and  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_534"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Croydon, with a population of 343,000, treated 52 women. There is a variation of 50 per cent or more between adjacent authorities, which suggests that it is not just a matter of demographic profile, local needs or local wishes as expressed through PCTs.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0801294000113"></a>Why does this matter? Your Lordships know the arguments, which were much more fully rehearsed in Committee. There are basically two. First, human misery, so eloquently described by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, led to the desperation of many women and their partners. If they could not get treatment from the NHS, that misery sent them into the private sector at high cost. Given that the private sector worked at profit, it sometimes offered treatment that was profitable but not efficacious&#151;bordering, in some cases, on the exploitative. If it was improper, as I believe it is, to buy babies, there must be a question mark over the ability to buy embryos as opposed to having them as part of the gift solution within the NHS, which I suspect most of us would much prefer. The first reason is therefore that finance becomes a barrier and, once it is in the private sector, there is the risk of unnecessary and exploitative treatment in a competitive financial environment.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0801294000114"></a>The second reason why the pre-scrutiny committee was concerned about the failure of so many PCTs to follow NICE guidelines was that it also means that, in desperation&#151;and as a result of tight finance&#151;many would-be mothers will seek the implantation of multiple embryos. Again, as many of your Lordships said in Committee, this presents both a high risk to the mother and foetus and, if there is a multiple birth, often a high cost to the authority in terms of the support&#151;cots and beds&#151;needed for small, premature, low-weight babies struggling with respiratory and feeding problems.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0801294000115"></a>The amendment is modest. It simply requires the strategic health authorities to report annually on local commissioning arrangements. That is a gentle way of highlighting the problem in exactly the same way as reports from the Audit Commission highlight problems for local authorities by use of comparators of appropriate adjacent authorities with which it is proper to compare the cost, quality and delivery of services. Such reports work. They still respect the need for local choice, and the fact that different areas may have different demographic profiles and needs. They do make sure that, if there is a judgment not to spend as much on IVF treatment in one area than another, that is based on information, and not ignorance, as now too often applies.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0801294000116"></a>I have read again the Committee speech of my noble friend Lady Royall, in which she said that this was the subject of an expert working group&#151;that is splendid. I hope that that will be pursued, as I am sure it will be. Such an annual report would help the expert working group come to more firmly based and routed solutions.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="0801294000117"></a>Therefore, I see this amendment as complementary to what the Minister is already proposing to suggest to the House&#151;if her Committee speech is a guideline. It is in this context that we want to see as much IVF treatment in the NHS as is affordable, that there should not be a postcode lottery and that money should not be a hurdle to parents seeking to have a

We should not expose parents to the profit motive of the private sector and also to the risk of multiple implantations. In that context, I hope my noble friend will agree that anything that encourages PCTs to provide equity of access to IVF treatment&#151;and, as NICE has suggested, to a required and appropriate number of cycles&#151;should be supported. I hope that my noble friend will welcome this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

We do not have anything to fear from extensive reporting. It enables us to look at the empirical evidence and, especially, as the noble Baroness has said, at issues such as multiple pregnancies and the subsequent risks of disability, which, topically, follow on the back of the previous debate in the House.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="0801294000119"></a>The issue of prematurity, which often comes up in these circumstances, needs to be assessed. I agree with what the noble Baroness has said. If IVF is to continue to take place under existing arrangements in this country, it is better that it is properly regulated rather be than outside in private clinics where there have been a number of abuses and where profit, rather than good medicine and good science, has been the motive. For all of the reasons that the noble Baroness has properly put to the House, I hope that this will be given a fair wind by the Government.</p>

Would it not be better if we had statistics showing the number of requests for IVF? The noble Baroness mentioned various areas and I know something about the poverty levels in some of them. There must be areas in which people would not be looking for IVF because they could not afford to have any more children. It comes to the same thing, but it does not mean that women are being deprived of IVF treatment, but that, realistically, they are saying that they could not possibly have any more children or a child. I just wonder about that. There must be a list of those who have applied for IVF treatment. A judgment could be made about whether the local health authority was fulfilling its duty, in effect, in offering IVF treatment to everyone that did apply.</p>

One of the most important aspects of this is that NICE guidelines would apply if the infertility services in an area were brought within the National Health Service. There is a much greater tendency to apply them when the work is done in the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0801294000122"></a>I suppose that I agree with my noble friend that, in a sense, the best statistics are those which show the availability of these services in an area rather than whether the gross numbers are different. The latter

Therefore, the statistics might need to be refined. The amendment, which echoes the spirit of the one that was moved in Committee, does the compulsion, if I may call it that, in a more gentle way than was originally proposed. Just requiring strategic health authorities to report is a gentle, but probably very effective, way of finding out what they are doing in this area.</p>

It does not answer the specific questions posed by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, but I shall come back to her in writing with those figures, if they exist.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0801294000124"></a>The survey had an almost 100 per cent response rate and the responses are currently being reviewed to verify the findings. The initial indications are that 30 per cent of primary care trusts that replied are providing one fresh cycle of IVF with no frozen cycles; 35.5 per cent are providing one full cycle involving a fresh cycle and any frozen cycles that may be possible using embryos stored after the fresh cycle; 27 per cent report that they are providing two cycles; and 5 per cent report that they are providing three cycles. A very small number have temporarily suspended IVF services and will be reviewing them. This is not good enough, but I believe that it signals a move in the right direction in the implementation of the NICE infertility guideline. The survey will be a help to the project that Infertility Network UK is carrying out to raise primary care trusts&#146; awareness of good practice in commissioning infertility services and should help to inform the thinking of the expert group.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0801294000125"></a>For the next steps, I propose that we ask the expert group to consider the spirit of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment and that we allow it time to consider how best primary care trusts can identify local fertility needs and explain their local decision-making, including the value of primary care trusts reporting to strategic health authorities annually and the SHAs making those reports public. Let us through this debate ask the expert group to consider that when it is fully established and let us look forward to its findings. I hope that on that basis the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

We are having a brief recap of the debate that we had more extensively in Committee with far more information from the mover of the amendment than I was able to offer tonight. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, is right about the stats&#151;not their flakiness, but their incompleteness. In the three hours&#146; notice or thereabouts  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_537"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column 537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I had of this amendment, I tried to get more complete coverage. That was why I cited the difference between the Essex authorities. I have the stats for west Essex, mid Essex, north-east Essex, south-east Essex and south-west Essex. There are huge variations within a single county with half a dozen PCTs, where one would expect a similar profile. Similarly, within inner London boroughs one might expect a somewhat similar profile, yet there appears to be little correlation between the size of the authority, its expenditure on IVF and the number of women presenting and receiving treatment. I agree that we need more complete statistics than we have.</p>

<a name="0801294000127"></a><b><a name="80128-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0801294000356"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> My Lords, I know that I should not do this, but let me say that the real issue is local affluence or the lack of it. One of the counties that was mentioned&#151;I shall not say which&#151;is completely different from its neighbouring county in the annual income per head. In fact, it contains one of the most deprived towns in the country. If we had an idea of the levels of affluence in each area, it might be easier.</p>

<a name="0801294000128"></a><b><a name="80128-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0801294000357"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely right. For example, I know Peterborough and Waveney PCTs a bit. They are not dissimilar in size, yet one of them has twice as many women receiving treatment. The noble Baroness is right to say that the statistics are incomplete; I wish that I had had the time or the notice to do proper research on this. None the less, it is clear to me from the evidence that we have that there is a postcode lottery, that finances are a bar to many women seeking treatment and that those who do seek treatment in the private sector are exposed to the risk of exploitation as well as to the risk of multiple pregnancies.</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0801294000129"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, hit it on the head when he said that this is a gentler version of the amendment moved in Committee. It is a gentler strengthening of the wish to see this information made available and a gentler way of bringing more and more PCTs into best practice as recommended by NICE. On behalf of the two noble Baronesses who are absent this evening though inescapable family commitments, I ask my noble friend whether she would be willing to accept at Third Reading an amendment giving the Government permissive power by regulation to do this if, as and when the expert group would like such a power?</p>

<a name="80128-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0801294000130"></a>In other words, if the expert group is to report in, say, one or two years&#146; time&#151;I do not know the timetable&#151;and wished to have this power available to it, would it be able to call for reports to the strategic authority without needing either primary or secondary legislation? If it needed secondary legislation, I urge my noble friend to consider whether she would bring forward an amendment&#151;or encourage the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, to do so&#151;giving a permissive power, by regulation, to do what could be necessary if, in due course, the expert group recommends it. Can my noble friend help me here or would she prefer to write at some point in future?</p>

<p><a name="0801289000010"></a>When we adjourned the Committee last Wednesday, the Minister said that he thought we might have a good half-hour&#146;s debate on this group of amendments and I found that slightly disconcerting. I do not have my 15 minutes&#146; worth.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000013"></a>The amendment seeks to strike out Clause 24(1)(b) which would allow the local authority to be overridden. Under Clause 24(1) the LBRO may nominate a local authority as the primary authority if the authority and the regulated person have agreed it, or if the regulated person has requested it. In the position anticipated by Clause 24(1)(b), the local authority would be consulted under a provision further on in the clause, and it must be &#147;suitable&#148;. The issue there is one of resources. There is an imbalance and the amendment seeks an explanation of that from the Government.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000014"></a>We have spoken, both at Second Reading and at previous sittings in Committee, about the tensions between achieving good regulation&#151;or, at any rate, better regulation&#151;and democratic interests, the autonomy of local authorities, and so on. We think the Bill is weighted too much towards centralisation and that this provision is not necessary. I am not seeking to block the primary authority but to ensure that the authority in question consents. I wonder whether the primary authority relationship will work unless both parties wish to participate. I shall not go as far as the analogy of a forced marriage as distinct from an arranged marriage, but in an enforced marriage parties often tend not to be too happy.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000015"></a>The second amendment relates to consultation and I hope that the suggested additional paragraphs speak for themselves. I have not taken anything like half of half an hour. I beg to move.</p>

It may normally be that Clause 24(1)(a) is complied with and a business is able to find a local authority which will agree to be the primary authority, but it would be a pity if the benefits to the public and business of the primary authority scheme were lost if it so happened that the business could not find a local authority that was willing to make a partnership agreement under Clause 24(1)(a)&#151;hence the value of paragraph (b). Only if businesses have access to a primary authority partnership can we ensure that the consistency and co-ordination for which the various provisions in this part of the Bill are designed are achieved. Safeguards exist. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will notice that Clause 24(3) states that consultation with the authority and the regulating person must take place. Bearing that in mind, I think that it would be undesirable to lose Clause 24(1)(b).</p>

However, many other local authorities, in whose areas also the regulated person carries out their business, will be affected. They are not defined in this part of the Bill, but if I call them &#147;secondary authorities&#148;, I think that Members of the Committee will know what I mean. There may be a large number of them. Their authority will to some extent be overruled. Not only will they not be consulted, but also it is not clear how they will hear about it until after the deal has been done. Many of their powers will be superseded and made more complicated. In some cases, we are talking about very large businesses. Some manufacturing companies in my part of the county have very large facilities there which employ thousands of people, but which are nevertheless not their principal manufacturing facilities&#151;they have other facilities elsewhere. The local authority will suddenly find itself superseded, or being bossed about at any rate, in how it supervises many of the largest businesses in its area. It would be very difficult to require all of them to be consulted&#151;that is why I have not put down an amendment to that effect&#151;because supermarkets or clothes shops often have a very large number of branches all over the country. However, they are most affected by these clauses. That is why it is a very moderate amendment.</p>

It takes us to one of the critical issues at the heart of the Bill. I shall do my best to present our reasons for a provision that has caused concern.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000020"></a>When the Government took the decision to put the home/lead authority schemes on to a statutory footing, we had two considerations in mind, much the same as those my noble friend Lord Borrie mentioned. First, it is unfair that only some multi-site businesses have access to the existing schemes; and secondly, just as importantly, it is unfair that certain local authorities choose not to host them, meaning that there are clear benefits for the citizens of the authorities that do&#151;at no cost to themselves. We think all local authorities benefit where a particular local authority chooses to work with a business in this way. Hampton himself noted the inequity of the situation where certain local authorities shoulder a disproportionate element of what is essentially a national role. He noted, for example, that Hertfordshire hosts a large number of major schemes while others host none.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000021"></a>Businesses have every right to look to a local authority&#146;s regulatory services for a professional service that reflects the importance of better regulation to their competitiveness and to our national prosperity. It is critical that all relevant businesses have access to the scheme. An LBRO&#146;s power of nomination is a vital guarantee that that will be the case.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000022"></a>There may be cases where a partnership would just not be appropriate. Perhaps particular businesses have misused the scheme in the past, or doubt has been thrown on their good faith in starting a new one. An LBRO may therefore decline to nominate an authority for a particular business. However, in the interests of our competitiveness as a country and of fairness among local authorities, businesses should have a right to a partnership unless there are good reasons to the contrary. As a backstop, that can be delivered only through a process of compulsory nomination.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000023"></a>We have listened carefully to representations made about the potential resource implications of acting as a primary authority. Accordingly, the Bill makes it clear that the relevant local authority will have the right to recover any costs incurred by it when carrying out the primary authority role. As well as the costs involved there are important benefits, given the possibility for a strategic relationship with a major firm.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000024"></a>As my noble friend Lord Borrie made clear&#151;and this is an assurance we think we can give&#151;it is intended that in the vast majority of cases the primary authority scheme will be consensual. The LBRO will make nominations only after careful consideration. It will take into account the fact that if a local authority is firmly against taking on such a role, it is unlikely in practice to provide an effective service to the business. In doing so, however, the local

<p><a name="0801289000025"></a>Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 offer helpful perspectives on the procedural issues that will need to be taken into account. We believe, however, that the issues they raise can be dealt with administratively without the need for explicit statutory provision.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, talked about the need to consult local authorities where the business operates. We would expect the LBRO to take sensible soundings before a nomination, but routine consultation with 400-plus local authorities would be too onerous a requirement.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000027"></a>The Bill formally requires the LBRO to consult any local authority that it is contemplating nominating for a primary authority partnership&#151;one of the safeguards my noble friend mentioned. This is designed to protect the authority&#146;s interests, in particular ensuring that the LBRO does not impose a role on an authority where it lacks the resources to carry it out effectively. It would be sensible in practice for the LBRO to consult other local authorities, which is the issue raised by the noble Baroness in Amendment No. 69, including those with an understanding of the business. However, we believe that there is no need for comparable statutory protection of their interests.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000028"></a>Amendment No. 70 raises the sensible point that the revocation of a partnership may also have resource implications for a local authority, so the Bill requires the LBRO to take particular account of the resources issues that the primary authority role might present for a local authority before nominating it, as set out in Clause 24(4). Where the LBRO revokes a particular partnership, this too may have resource implications for a local authority. As it may charge for the service, the revocation could involve the loss of a significant source of revenue. We do not believe that there is any need for comparable statutory protections here, however, as there is no question of the LBRO requiring the authority to adopt a role which may not fit the priorities of the local authority itself. But clearly, the LBRO will be under a duty not to revoke a partnership without good reason, and would lay itself open to legal challenge if it did so unreasonably.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000029"></a>In response to the question asked by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, I am advised that in principle there would be a requirement to consult, but that a range of exemptions might well capture the particular case he referred to. We shall examine those exemptions later today. It depends on a number of factors, and as I say, we shall come to the exemptions to the need to have a primary authority in due  course.</p>

On Amendment No. 70, to which I have not spoken, the noble Lord says that it is not necessary to have statutory protection. I have decided that, given the way the clause is drafted, there already is statutory protection. Clause 24(5) provides that subsection (4) applies on a revocation as well as on a nomination. I thought that that was my error.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000034"></a>Two expressions used by noble Lords were interesting, the first of which was the &#147;right to a partnership&#148;. I have always regarded partnership as something consensual, organic and not something to which one has a right. The other expression was the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, at the start of his contribution, about forcing &#147;fairly and reasonably&#148;. I wrote the phrase down as it was said, but perhaps <I>Hansard</I> will show that I misheard the noble Lord since he appears to be denying it. But that is what this clause tries to say. In any event, I think that there will be an imbalance in which the burdens lie on local authorities that are called on to become primary authorities simply because of the geographical distribution of businesses. The noble Lord said that this could be dealt with administratively, but I am not sure whether that is so. To that end, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, for his very good point that it would be difficult to deal with either administratively or legislatively. The Minister asserts that there is no need for this to be in the Bill, but the need to address the matter has been demonstrated. However, I am not sure whether we have come up with the right way of dealing with it.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000035"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. Since we have taken almost 20 minutes of the anticipated 30 minutes, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000039"></a>Clause 25 [<I>Advice and guidance</I>]:</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0801289000126"></a> Clause 25, page 11, line 6, after &#147;authorities&#148; insert &#147;when requested&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000041"></a>The noble Lord said: We pop on to Clause 25, which relates to advice and guidance and the methodology that primary authorities will use in carrying out their role. I seek to ascertain from the Minister how these provisions will operate when they come into force. I understand why under Clause 25(1)(a) advice has to be given to the regulated persons, but in paragraph (b) &#147;other local authorities&#148; is a very wide phrase. I seek the Minister&#146;s thoughts on how this will work in reality. For example, does he see the primary authority sending its advice and guidance to every local authority everywhere, willy-nilly, without regard, in order to cover the waterfront? Or does he see the primary authority selecting carefully the local authorities concerned for the advice and guidance to be more targeted?</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000042"></a>I have referred several times in the Committee to my non-executive directorship of Masters Brewery. We might select Wolverhampton as our primary authority, but our 2,500 pubs all over the country  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be in a lot of local authority areas although not in every one. How will guidance given by Wolverhampton be distributed to the relevant local authorities? How will the primary authority know which local authorities are involved? I can imagine a tremendous waste of paper whereby the primary authority, to be certain, sends the guidance to every local authority; each then has to check whether the guidance is relevant to it. An awful lot of unwanted paperwork will fly back and forth.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000043"></a>Therefore, the amendment seeks to insert &#147;when requested&#148;&#151;in other words, the local authority affected will ask the primary authority for guidance. This would mean that the paperwork would be sent only when required, avoiding the risk of another flood of paper that had to be checked by the issuing authority and the authority that received it. Can the Minister explain how he thinks this system will work and why we should not try to target the transmission of information to the relevant local authorities? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000044"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0801289000151"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It goes without saying that of course we would expect the primary authority to give advice to other local authorities when requested to do so. Our fear is that the amendment would limit too much the primary authority&#146;s role or ability to be proactive in its role as adviser to other local authorities on the treatment of particular businesses.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000045"></a>For instance, where a business has acknowledged a problem in a particular area and is doing its best to put it right, the Bill allows the primary authority on its own initiative to bring this to the attention of other local authorities, or other relevant local authorities, and recommend, for example, a lighter-touch approach to enforcement in particular areas. The primary authority&#146;s right to direct an authority not to proceed with an action could be founded on advice of this sort. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment is too limiting. Limiting the primary authority&#146;s advisory role with other local authorities to an &#147;on request&#148; basis may substantially reduce the potential benefits of the scheme for business.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000046"></a>Local authorities will have expertise in a wide range of enforcement issues associated with the business. The authority may bring any relevant matters, including advice to the business, to the attention of other local authorities. The register to be held by the LBRO, its database of primary authorities, will be sufficient as a means of bringing that to the attention of other local authorities.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000047"></a>The noble Lord asked a good question: will a primary authority as a matter of course give advice across the board to all other local authorities about all matters, even where it is not relevant to those authorities? The answer to that is, clearly not. It will have to make its choice as to which local authorities are relevant for those purposes. I am pretty convinced that that is what will happen. The danger of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment&#151;I recognise it as a probing amendment at heart&#151;is that if it is just done on request, some advice that would be very useful to enforcing authorities will never get there.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000048"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0801289000152"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the consideration that he has given to the amendment. I hope that he is right that primary

I have an awful fear that, over time, in order to avoid risk, they will mail everything because that will be an easier way of covering all the points. Therefore, receiving local authorities will be faced with a deluge of information coming from primary authorities around the country seeking to be risk-averse. I wish that I could be as confident as he is that they will do it on a lean and mean basis.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000049"></a>As for the Minister's second point about the &#147;on request&#148; nature of my amendment, I accept that, but you can bet your bottom dollar that the business in the subordinate local authority, faced with the fact that it is not getting the guidance from the primary authority through to it, will go to the relevant local authority and say, &#147;Listen to me. There is this stuff from the primary authority. I want to hear about it&#148;. I would prefer to see a more causative, interactive process, rather than what I fear will become a blanket flood of irrelevant and duplicative information flowing between primary authorities and local authorities across the country. I hope that before we reach the next stage, the Minister can give some further thought to the practical operation of that. In the mean time, I am grateful to the Minister for the thought that he has given to the amendment and I beg leave to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000052"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 74 and, as under the previous amendment, to Clause 25. Both amendments are probing; the first would establish the exact scope of the proposed primary authority principle. The Bill is quite wide. Both the Trading Standards Institute and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health have asked me to raise the amendments to establish whether the primary authority principle will cover all matters covered by the current voluntary principle.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000053"></a>I do not need to go through the background of how the home authority principle has worked, but it has been regarded as successful, allowing business to seek advice and guidance from one source. The home authority has also been able to act as a conduit for complaints from other local authorities about the business. That has the efficiency that results from cutting down the number of communications, as the Committee will well understand. The home authority can advise other authorities of action agreed with the business and confine the amount of toing and froing. The business is then able to concentrate on putting steps in place to deal with the position.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000056"></a>As I have complained before, there is so little written in the Bill that it is difficult to see exactly how the new Local Better Regulation Office will sit within the existing system. To my eyes, there is potential for some of the LBRO&#146;s work to replicate the existing work of the home and lead authorities, but nowhere is it written that the LBRO will replace them. The amendments suggest that the statutory primary authority principle supersedes the current voluntary arrangements in order to rationalise business relationships into one consistent principle across the United Kingdom. Such an outcome would synchronise well with the ostensible aims of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000057"></a>Through this amendment, therefore, I ask the Minister to clarify further how the Local Better Regulation Office will exist within the current regulatory system, as duplication of work can lead to confusion and inefficiency, not better regulation, which is what I understand the Government are looking for. As it stands, the Bill is confusing and bureaucratic. As the Minister must know, we on these Benches are committed to ironing out some of the confusion and removing some of the bureaucracy to create a result that will be workable in practice.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000058"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0801289000155"></a>Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> Is it envisaged that some of the voluntary arrangements will continue indefinitely alongside the new arrangements and not just temporarily while the new arrangements are worked out? Obviously, it will take a little while for everything to be up and running in every possible business. Some businesses and local authorities may find it convenient to continue with the existing arrangements, which they know, rather than swapping to the new arrangements set out in the Bill. I presume that they would be able to do that and, indeed, they may wish to.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC223"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and unnecessary confusion. Further, it has been suggested that the likelihood of that happening will be greater if the primary authority scheme does not offer all the services currently available as part of the voluntary schemes, including those relating to guidance.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000060"></a>The provisions of Part 2, which we are debating at the moment, have deliberately been drafted to ensure that all the functions currently carried out by a home or lead authority can also be carried out by a primary authority. Therefore, although we understand the intention behind Amendment No. 73, we do not believe that it is necessary.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000061"></a>Under Clause 25, the primary authority already has the function of giving advice and guidance to other local authorities with the relevant function on how they should exercise those functions in relation to a regulated person. That captures all the advice that Amendment No. 74 would include within the scope of Clause 25.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000062"></a>It is not appropriate to make provision in the Bill for the abolition of current voluntary schemes. It has never been our intention that the primary authority scheme should simply replace the home and lead authority schemes, but that it should build on their successes while addressing their limitations.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, asked a very good question in regard to the eventual intention of the two schemes. If the business and the local authority want the voluntary partnership to continue, it will do so. If it is too bureaucratic, we believe that they will not want to maintain it in its present state.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000064"></a>We are fairly confident&#151;I choose my words fairly carefully&#151;that the operation of the primary authority scheme alongside the home and lead authority schemes will not result in confusion. I assure the Committee that the LBRO will work closely with LACORS and the HSE to ensure clarity in the relationship between these schemes.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000065"></a>The home and lead authority schemes have been pretty successful, but they have not achieved everything that we wanted. We therefore think that putting the primary authority scheme on a statutory basis will help, but that is not to say that we want to discard all the good things that have happened under the home and lead authority schemes. I hope that, in light of what I have said, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000072"></a>The noble Lord said: As I understand it, the capacity of the primary authority to intervene to deter overenthusiastic enforcement action is limited to cases where that proposed enforcement action is inconsistent with advice or guidance previously given by the primary authority. The amendment probes whether it is possible to open up the options available to the primary authority and to introduce an element of flexibility, while still ensuring that the objective of securing compliance is met.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000073"></a>The Government gave a commitment in their manifesto for business that multi-site businesses would in future have to deal only with a single enforcement authority. That was one of the basic justifications for the proposed CTSA and the LBRO proposal that succeeded it. The Hampton review found that one of the biggest problems facing businesses was inconsistent advice and enforcement by difficult local authorities. National businesses operate on national plans, while local authorities operate on a local basis. The voluntary home and lead authority system was developed to mitigate that problem, but I understand that the Government felt that there were instances where local authorities ignored the advice of the home or lead authority for no valid reason, hence the decision to place the arrangement on a statutory basis, with the primary authority taking the lead role.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000074"></a>At its best, the home and lead authority system works well because it is flexible and based on a wide range of advice, both formal and informal. By strictly limiting the capacity of the primary authority under the proposed statutory system to cases where the proposed enforcement action is inconsistent with advice or guidance previously given by the primary authority, we feel that the Government are restricting its ability to act in order to lighten the touch of enforcement. This essentially requires the primary authority to provide formal advice, to ignore informal advice and contacts, to ignore other factors such as its knowledge of the company and its procedures, and the likelihood that in the future it would act on informal enforcement. I suggest that this will confuse the relationship and increase the administrative burden because businesses will be more likely to require all advice and guidance to be written down so that it can be relied upon, and in turn primary authorities will be less willing to provide informal advice without going through a formal process. The amendment would open up the options available to the primary authority and introduce flexibility, while still ensuring that the objective of securing compliance is met. This would return the character of the relationship to that which was originally promised and intended. I beg to move.</p>

We are referring here to an internal discussion.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000076"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0801289000160"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I shall come to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, a little later. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has it just right about the home and lead scheme, which as I said when we debated the previous amendment, had been a success. However, the failing with it was that sometimes what had been decided was ignored. That is why a statutory scheme is supported by the Government and, I hope, by all Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000077"></a>We are sympathetic to the intentions behind the amendment. Indeed, as the noble Lord hinted towards the end of his remarks, the basis this provides for the primary authority&#146;s decision-making role when reviewing enforcement actions by other authorities is very close to the formula we consulted on in the draft Bill. I think the word &#147;promise&#148; may be a little over the top, but it was certainly consulted on and considered. Perhaps I may talk through some of the issues raised by the amendment, which of course were raised during the consultation process, and the reasons for adopting the more focused formula in the present Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000078"></a>Some Members of the Committee will have seen that in the original draft Bill, we proposed giving the primary authority a right to withhold consent from an enforcement action if it was not satisfied that the action was appropriate in all the circumstances&#151;in line with the amendment. Very significant concerns were raised by representatives of the enforcement sector that giving primary authorities and the LBRO such a general right to block an enforcement action would present serious practical problems. More importantly, it would put a substantial burden of liability on the primary authority, which would frankly be required to make a thorough investigation of every aspect of a particular enforcement action before it would be prepared to block an action proposed by an enforcing authority. This would turn the primary authority into a statutory reviewer of every aspect of every enforcement action taken against a business with which it had a partnership.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000079"></a>Representatives of a number of major local authorities, including some of those which are most likely to act as primary authorities to major businesses, told us that in practice they would not feel able to block proposed action on this basis. We therefore considered that there was a risk, perhaps a significant one, that the scheme upon which we had consulted, and which this amendment seeks to resurrect, would not be workable and would have the unintended consequence that local authorities that were primary authorities would simply be unwilling to withhold consent to proposed enforcement actions. It is worth pointing out that representatives of the professions involved, including those from the Trading Standards Institute and the Charted Institute of Environmental Health&#151;who have every interest in

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000080"></a>The Bill more closely reflects what we think is the real expertise of the primary authority: the expertise and advice that it has given the business and the familiarity with the business&#146;s management systems and the best way to secure compliance in working with its staff. The Bill also gives an objective role to the primary authority that is founded squarely on its advice-giving function. It does not give businesses a general right to appeal against enforcement actions on the ground that it is somehow inappropriate.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000081"></a>In practice, the scheme will give enforcing authorities a strong incentive to contact the primary authority about issues arising in its work at a very early stage of the enforcement process. Inevitably, in a small number of cases where disputes between, for example, the enforcing authority and the primary authority are taken to the LBRO, there will need to be a formal check on the advice that has been given. We will need to ensure that this does not mean that the provision of routine informal advice is undermined.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000082"></a>There is scope in Clause 25(1)(b) for the primary authority to be more proactive in particular areas of regulatory enforcement, given its role as adviser to other local authorities about the treatment of particular businesses. For example, where a business has acknowledged a problem in a particular area and is doing its best to put it right, the primary authority could bring that to the attention of other local authorities and recommend a lighter-touch approach to enforcement in particular areas. The primary authority&#146;s right to direct an authority not to proceed with an action could be founded on advice of that sort.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, suggested that &#147;primary authority&#148; and &#147;enforcing authority&#148; in the Bill might be the same. In the Bill&#151;I hope this is not too obvious&#151;the &#147;enforcing authority&#148; means any local authority other than the primary authority that regulates the business in practice.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000084"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for raising this issue. I have spoken at some length about it because it is important, and I hope my answer has gone some way towards satisfying him.</p>

The informal advice and guidance, often not written, given by officers in the field is to be welcomed, and heads off rather tougher action. We would all agree that compliance secured without a heavy hand is much the best.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000089"></a>I am sure that the Government do not intend to constrain inspectors from giving advice without first notifying the primary authority. Perhaps inevitably, formal&#151;I shall use that less pejorative term,  rather than &#147;bureaucratic&#148;&#151;procedures attached to enforcement action are provided for, which would not be appropriate to the sort of advice and assistance given on a day-to-day basis by many authorities to many businesses up and down the country. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000090"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0801289000163"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> We agree that it is insufficiently clear whether enforcement action includes informal advice and guidance that officers regularly provide to businesses. If it did, that could disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses; they particularly value this informal, sometimes oral, advice and guidance, and that usually leads them to compliance. Not allowing the enforcement authority to give an informal warning might create a system that was all stick and no carrot, and might well incur hostility between the regulators and the regulated. It would also increase bureaucracy&#151;the very opposite of the Hampton principles and the declared deregulatory intentions of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000091"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0801289000164"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Again, we are grateful for the opportunity that this probing amendment presents to give some assurances on the detailed operation of the scheme. During consultation on the Bill, the Committee will not be surprised to hear that we received an overwhelming message from businesses and local authorities that the primary authority scheme must not&#151;I emphasise that&#151;inhibit local authority regulatory services from providing routine advice to a business.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000092"></a>The example used throughout our consultation was that of one broken egg on the floor of a supermarket. Ordinarily a local authority enforcer would simply advise the supermarket that the egg should be cleaned up to avoid it being a slips and trips hazard. This would surely be the most appropriate response. To require the enforcer to contact the primary authority before giving this advice would not just be counterproductive, but absurd. It would create unnecessary delay and be in nobody&#146;s best interests.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000093"></a>I assure the Committee that it has never been our intention that this type of informal advice should be captured by the definition of enforcement action in Clause 26(5). However, it is not easy to get the definitions right and defining these cases with sufficient precision was quite an intractable problem encountered in the consultation and, frankly, in drafting the Bill, because &#147;informal&#148; is a subjective concept, especially given the wide range of actions a local authority may take when enforcing regulations. This ranges from face-to-face advice at one end of the spectrum to prosecution at the other.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000094"></a>While everyone agrees that oral advice should be allowed to go ahead without the need to contact the primary authority and that prosecution should be captured by the scheme at the other end, a huge number of potential enforcement actions fall inconveniently between these two extremes. I need hardly tell the Committee that the difficulty is to draw a line where informal enforcement action ends and formal enforcement action begins. Much depends on perception here; a letter that &#147;advises&#148; a business how to comply with a particular regulation, but states that any failure to comply will result in court action, may be perceived by the business to be formal enforcement action and will result in behaviour change and potentially cost, while the local authority may well regard the letter to be merely informal advice. If following the enforcing authority&#146;s informal advice requires, for example, removing a product line, potentially at significant expense, while not following it will result in prosecution, it seems fair to us that this type of informal advice should be referred to the primary authority and that the informal advice should be captured by the definition of &#147;enforcement action&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000095"></a>Absolute clarity is needed regarding the exemptions from the definition of &#147;enforcement action&#148;. Having thought about this a considerable amount, we strongly believe that the best way to achieve this is through secondary legislation. Clause 27 makes provision for the Secretary of State, by order, to prescribe the circumstances in which an enforcing authority will not need to contact a primary authority before taking enforcement action.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000096"></a>The guide to the Bill, which was referred to a lot on Wednesday, gives examples of the type of exemptions that we intend to propose and makes it absolutely clear that routine advice will be excluded from the definition of &#147;enforcement action&#148;. To quote the guide, the main factor taken into account in drafting the order will be:</p>
<ul><a name="0801289000134"></a>&#147;whether the enforcement action is purely informal (like advice and routine discussion between the authority and the business), which might make a check for consistency unnecessary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801289000121"></a>That is on pages 21 and 22. Making the exemptions in that way will allow for the detailed technical explanations that will be needed to address those areas where a different perception could create confusion regarding what should and what should not be considered informal advice.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000097"></a>I am sure that the Committee will join me in looking forward very much to debating the order when it arrives in this House; that should be a very pleasant couple of hours, at least. I want to make a point that I hope will seriously reassure the Committee. The first primary authority partnership will not be registered until all the relevant exemptions have been agreed by Parliament, and we will consult closely with local authorities, professional bodies, regulators and businesses when drawing those up.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000098"></a>I am again conscious that I have gone on at some length, but, again, an important point has been raised. I hope that that helps the noble Baroness to decide to withdraw her amendment.</p>

My amendment provides for consultation with Welsh Ministers. Given devolution, I could have expanded it into a two-part provision&#151;one for England, one for Wales&#151;but I first wanted to explore the point of principle, which seems quite interesting. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000110"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0801289000173"></a>Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> I think the amendment is wrong. Given devolution, Welsh Ministers ought to be able to contribute to the decision and ought to have to agree to it. After all, it is a decision which is going to apply in Wales as well as in England on a matter which is devolved to Wales. If devolution is to mean anything, the consent of the Welsh Ministers, as opposed to merely consulting them, is essential. I apologise for being rather direct but the amendment is not a good idea; it is inconsistent with devolution.</p>

<p><a name="0801289000111"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0801289000174"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> I preface my comments with a recognition of the Government&#146;s gratitude to the Welsh Assembly for its pragmatism in working with us on the Bill. I hope this will promote consistency in the treatment of businesses in England and in Wales, in both reserved and devolved matters alike. I am sure the Committee will recognise that the constitutional implications are far from simple in practice.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000112"></a>The primary authority provisions in Part 2 apply in exactly the same way to Welsh local authorities as they do to those in England. All relevant regulatory functions, be they devolved or reserved matters, fall within the scope of this scheme and within the LBRO&#146;s oversight. This means in practice that businesses in England and Wales can depend on the consistency and certainty that the scheme will bring in important areas such as food standard regulations, where responsibility is fully devolved to Cardiff. That means that Welsh businesses will get as much from this scheme as their English counterparts; it is a two-way street.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000113"></a>The scheme will depend on a single set of rules applying to local authorities in both countries. The relevant clauses are designed to ensure that the workings of the scheme rest upon a simple set of unified statutory instruments passed in Westminster, but does so in a way that still guarantees Welsh legitimate interests in matters which are the full responsibility of Welsh Ministers.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000114"></a>The Bill therefore allows Welsh Ministers to withhold consent if they are not content with the shape that the scheme is taking in practice regarding matters for which&#151;this is the point that the noble Lord was making&#151;they are personally accountable to the Welsh Assembly and the electorate. It is not only a two-way street in terms of implementation on both sides, but a question of ensuring that Welsh Ministers can be personally accountable in some degree of comfort. A requirement merely to consult them would not give them that guarantee and would effectively mean an erosion of that aspect of the devolution settlement.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000118"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is concerned with the definition of &#147;relevant period&#148; in Clause 26(4) as regards restrictions on the power of the enforcing authority to take enforcement action. The &#147;relevant period&#148; is described in subsection (9)(a) as, primarily, five days or, in subsection (9)(b),</p>
<ul><a name="0801289000135"></a>&#147;such longer period beginning with that day as LBRO may direct&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801289000123"></a>I wanted to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on this. I quite understand the arguments for flexibility and that five working days is a short period, but, equally, a longstop with no end date at all seems to present dangers of an opposing sort. Some degree of speed is important in any better regulatory environment. That is particularly true when dealing with smaller or small firms.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801289000119"></a>Such firms may know of an impending case hanging over them. The enforcing authority may not be ready to proceed and asks for a time delay, which it is given. This could go on for a long time. Local authorities are not always crisp and brisk in how they proceed and a smaller firm could be at a severe disadvantage in commercial terms, because it may become known that enforcement action is pending.

<p><a name="0801289000120"></a>We could have a situation in which the local authority does not move forward and holds its horses, saying, &#147;We are not ready yet, we need a few more days or weeks&#148; and he LBRO says, &#147;That&#146;s reasonable; carry on&#148;. The threat hangs like the sword of Damocles over the firm. The purpose of my amendment is to strike out paragraph (b). I would fully accept and would feel happier with a longstop of a greater period, but allowing the LBRO to suspend the sword of Damocles for ever is unattractive, unhelpful and does not lead to a better regulatory climate.

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000002"></a>The LBRO&#146;s ability to extend the deadline has been included for a number of reasons, but I assure the noble Lord that it is not in the LBRO&#146;s interests to hold such a sword of Damocles over the head of both business and the authority or to allow it to happen. I think that the public outcry&#151;indeed, the outcry from many places&#151;would ensure that that did not happen. There may be cases where the primary authority&#146;s decision requires complex analysis or there may be a temporary local crisis calling on the attention of all qualified staff. Indeed, there may be a problem that is so local that the LBRO needs longer.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000003"></a>For all those reasons, we think that a time limit of 28 days, as LACORS has recommended, rather than five working days, would be too long. We need to ensure that the enforcing authority is not kept waiting for a decision for such a long time. However, some flexibility is needed, and, although they are only a small minority, the unusual and difficult cases will have to be accommodated. Subsection (9)(b) allows for that.</p>

However, we all know that those rare occasions will be damaging&#151;possibly fatal&#151;to an individual business. I should be much happier if the Government were able to put a date beyond which the LBRO could not extend the deadline so that at least everyone would know that there was a point beyond which it could not go. I hope that the Minister may be able to give some thought to that before we come to the next stage of the Bill. In the mean time, having at least put it on the agenda with the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I seek to replace Clauses 26 and 27 with the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 95. </p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000008"></a>I have received a number of letters about this part of the Bill from the Local Government Association, the Welsh Local Government Association, LACORS, the local government co-ordinating body, and also from the Food Standards Agency. They seem to have legitimate concerns and, for that reason, I undertook to table Amendment No. 95. They have serious worries about creating statutory primary authorities. They do not like the LBRO&#146;s power to nominate a council as a primary authority without that council&#146;s agreement and they do not see how a forced relationship could work or deliver positive outcomes. It is felt that that would interfere with a council&#146;s right to decide on the service that it wished to provide for its electorate.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC233"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000009"></a>They believe that the regime set out in Clause 26 and Schedule 4 for taking enforcement action would amount to a fettering of a council&#146;s right to take any action that it felt appropriate against someone believed to have committed an offence in its area. In their view, for one council or an LBRO to direct another council not to take enforcement action would be undemocratic. In the case of an LBRO directing a council not to take action, it would amount to a centralisation of power. That is rather surprising, as many of the Government&#146;s recent pronouncements on a variety of issues indicate that their policies are against a centralisation of power. More power to local people&#151;that has been the political stance adopted by the Government and it is one with which many of us totally agree.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000010"></a>LACORS is also concerned about the time limit of five working days for a primary authority to determine whether it wishes to direct an enforcing authority not to take action. It thinks that it is unrealistic. The LBRO has 28 days to make a decision in cases referred to it, and it is suggested that primary authorities should also be allowed 28 days.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000011"></a>The Food Standards Agency also has concerns about this section of the Bill. It says that the Government have not been clear about the circumstances in which a local authority should consult a primary authority before taking enforcement action. The guidance on the Bill suggests that an exemption might be made where consultation would seriously jeopardise public health, the environment or consumer protection. The Minister made some reference to that.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000012"></a>Those bodies believe that it is essential that public health should not be put at risk at all by the new procedures that the Government want to put in place. They think that it would be desirable for the Government to make a statement that if there should be an imminent risk to public health, the environment or consumer protection, a local authority will not have to consult the primary authority. Incidentally, the FSA also has some concern about the clause. I have received a briefing from the FSA. It makes it quite clear that although it is, in general, strongly in support of the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda, it has some concerns. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012843000259"></a>&#147;Whilst we are reasonably clear on the process by which the FSA and other regulators will be given access to the new sanctions, the Government has been less clear about how local authorities will gain access to them. Local authorities are key partners in enforcing food regulations and protecting the public. Further clarity would be useful to ensure that councils do not miss out on the new powers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000013"></a>It is therefore very much a probing amendment. It will be seen from what I have said that there are reservations about the Bill from organisations which otherwise have a strong commitment to the Government's agenda. Therefore, it would be useful to have a statement to put some of those worries at rest. The LACORS draft in Amendment No. 95 was deliberately drafted as a way to give voice to those concerns. I will therefore welcome hearing the Government's response.</p>

Looking at Clauses 26 and 27, I find it very difficult to understand&#151;this may be my fault&#151;how they would work. There seem to me to be too many players. You could call the system the price that you pay for consistency; the price could be too high.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000015"></a>If someone is in breach of a statute that is the responsibility of a regulator and the local authority has to take some action, the local authority is taking action against one person. That is quite simple. Another local authority may have to take action against another person, and those two persons may be related; but under this statutory system, you have LACORS, the primary authority and 32 pubs, let us assume, set up in 32 different authorities. It may be deemed that 16 of the pubs are in breach of something and the other 16 are not. The managers may be looking for their Christmas bonus and arguing whether they are in breach of the regulations. The whole system can be intervened on by the LBRO at some point.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000016"></a>You have to take Schedule 4, to which we are coming, to understand the two clauses. I start to think about alcohol disorder zones, on which some secondary legislation is going through at present. The whole thing is so complicated that the chances of people getting their mind around it and achieving consistency without paying far too high a price are very low.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000017"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08012843000308"></a>Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> I, too, have some sympathy with the general remarks made by the noble Baroness. I was worried about the phrase in the guide about Clause 27 that immediate enforcement action can in effect be taken when the delay of consultation would seriously jeopardise public health, the environment or consumer protection. I am surprised at the inclusion of the word &#147;seriously&#148;. There are occasions when an inspector goes into premises, especially if food is involved, and wants to shut the place down immediately because there is a risk to public health. Sometimes it may not be a big risk&#151;it may be quite a small one&#151;but the inspector wants to have the threat of being able to close the premises down even for a small risk. That is extremely important. To have to argue that something is a serious risk to public health and could spread all over the place is not a good thing. To a degree, the question of serious risk may be more appropriate in cases such as the environment or consumer protection, but so far as public health is concerned, it is not.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000018"></a>Further, all this is to be dealt with by order because it is not part of the Bill and the guide only suggests the way in which the order might be drafted. Given that, it would be very helpful if we could see the order before we reach Report so as to be reassured about it. When we discuss the order itself, we shall not be able simply to delete the word &#147;seriously&#148; because there will be no provision for amendments. That is why we need to discuss the detail at this point.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC235"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government&#146;s intentions in proposing our approach to the Bill, which I agree would be useful. I have to say, however, that were this clause to be replaced with the proposed new provision, it would significantly undermine the primary authority scheme we have set out by putting it on a different and, more importantly, less rigorous basis. Let me try to explain why.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000020"></a>The approach as demonstrated in Amendment No. 95 sets out an alternative to the primary authority partnership. I accept absolutely what my noble friend says about this being a helpful attempt to make the primary authority scheme better, and not a gesture from those who object to it principle. It is therefore hardly surprising that it is an approach very similar to one proposed by LACORS during the public consultation process. LACORS was a significant stakeholder in that process, and has helped to mould and set out the provisions in the Bill. The Government thank the organisation for that. Having said that, we do not think that the amendment provides the assurances that businesses need to be prepared to enter into a primary authority partnership.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000021"></a>The intention behind the amendment, of course, is to minimise bureaucracy and to protect the absolute discretion of local authorities to perform any enforcement action they choose. We are not convinced, however, that it would deliver the benefits that are expected. As we have debated already, local authorities have worked informally to promote better co-ordination among themselves through the home and lead authority schemes. They have encouraged open and systematic communication between local authorities when handling regulatory issues affecting a firm that operates across local authority boundaries. Yet, as we have heard, in practice conflicts and inconsistencies continue to arise. These result in significant and unnecessary costs to business as well as significant and unnecessary work for local authorities.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000022"></a>Businesses have asked us to provide access to a scheme which will provide more dependable advice and much quicker resolution of disputes between authorities, thus giving greater certainty and clarity and providing an effective basis for planning their operations across the country. We start from the principle that where a business and a local authority have gone to the trouble of establishing a regulatory partnership, there should be a presumption that the advice given by one professional is respected by other professionals across the country unless there are good reasons for local variation. One of our criticisms of Amendment No. 95 is that it would not provide such a presumption. Its approach would effectively put existing practices, as recognised in the voluntary home-lead schemes, on to a statutory footing. Our view is that that is not enough to deliver the certainty that businesses have a right to expect.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000023"></a>If local authorities adhere strictly to the current scheme, consultation in this way, without any suggestion of a right to block an action, would deal with the inconsistencies that businesses face. Yet cases occur where authorities proceed to prosecution without any attempt to contact the primary authority to determine its advice; and where they do contact the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC236"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary authority, cases of persistent disagreement still arise, creating costs for businesses and local authorities alike.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000024"></a>The benefit of the Government&#146;s scheme is that the primary authority&#146;s right to direct that a particular action should not take place is operative only where the primary authority concludes that the enforcement action conflicts with advice it has previously given to the business. We do not want it broader than that. We debated earlier about &#147;appropriateness&#148;. It has been argued that where a primary authority has publicly expressed the advice it has given to the business, this will make it harder for other authorities to initiate enforcement actions that run counter to that advice. However, the argument only works on the basis that the cases will end up in court, either as criminal prosecutions or as litigation that challenges the enforcement action.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000025"></a>The mere existence of a primary authority&#146;s advice will not deter enforcement actions or the threat of enforcement actions which do not end in court proceedings. This approach would also deny the enforcing authority the right to take the matter to arbitration if it disagreed with the primary authority&#146;s advice. So the enforcing authority is effectively stuck with the primary authority&#146;s advice and any disagreement will be harder and more expensive to test through the courts rather than the LBRO if the enforcing authority is convinced that the primary authority has it wrong.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000026"></a>The approach in Amendment No. 95 is less systematic than the one in the Bill and will give local authorities and businesses alike less effective protection. We understand the concerns that remain among those in the enforcement section about the primary authority or LBRO effectively having jurisdiction over the enforcement actions that a local authority may wish to pursue. We recognise that this is a significant change from the existing practice but it is essential. As I have said, it is narrowly circumscribed.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000027"></a>Our arguments against Amendment No. 95&#151;again, we are grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue&#151;is that, first, the disincentive to taking action in Amendment No. 95 is not strong enough; secondly, it denies the enforcing authority the right to arbitration if it disagrees with the primary authority&#146;s advice; and, thirdly, it is less systematic.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000028"></a>My noble friend asked about exemptions for harm to health, harm to the environment and harm to consumer protection. Exemptions will be made along these lines by order and we will have an opportunity to consider them later today. I assure the Committee that the primary authority scheme will not be made operational, as I have already said, until these exemptions are accepted by Parliament.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000029"></a>In his robust way, the noble Viscount referred to how the price of consistency may be too high. I will put it the other way: the price of inconsistency may be fairly high for both major and small businesses which have outlets in two different local authorities. We are seeking to find the right balance in the Bill&#151;we may or may not succeed in the noble Viscount&#146;s eyes&#151; between the flexibility that local authorities need in

<a name="80128-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000030"></a>There will of course be cases where local issues are paramount&#151;a business with excellent health and safety standards may have a negligent manager in a particular store, for instance&#151;but enforcement action, if the scheme works, can go ahead in any such case after a pretty quick check with the primary authority. However, there are areas where consistency should be protected. For example, a label for a line of clothing should be valid from a trading standards point of view wherever in the country it is sold, or a particular type of sink should be just as safe in whichever store or warehouse it is sold anywhere in the country. We are attempting to achieve the right balance and, we hope, to take the Committee along with us.</p>

One can cut out the stage of the enforcing authority having to go to the LBRO to ask, &#147;Do you consent to our doing something?&#148;, because either the enforcing authority can check informally or the LBRO will simply say, when the enforcing authority goes to it, &#147;We don&#146;t want to deal with it&#148;, and it will not. The provision seems to add a bit of extra bureaucracy. It is not a great point, but it intrigued me.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000038"></a>Amendments Nos. 80, 84 and 86 relate to paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 4, which states that, when a reference to the LBRO is made, it can confirm or revoke the direction. I wondered whether something had been left out here. The use of the word &#147;revoke&#148; is rather curious when it is not its own direction, but if the LBRO says, &#147;Sort it out between you&#148;, for example, and declines to deal with the matter, is that catered for?</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000039"></a>My last point, which relates to Amendment No. 81, is one that I have been over several times, and I am grateful to the Bill team, to whom I went for advice. I see some smiles from behind the Minister. Under paragraph 1(2)(a) of Schedule 4, the LBRO must be satisfied with the matters set out in sub-paragraph (3) in order to confirm the direction. This is a direction by the primary authority directing an enforcing authority. I believe that the direction is not necessary if the enforcing authority agrees with the primary authority. That is the basis on which I have worked.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000040"></a>Under sub-paragraph (3), the conditions are that the advice or guidance given by the primary authority must be correct and properly given but&#151;or perhaps &#147;and&#148;&#151;the enforcement action must be inconsistent with the advice or guidance. The Bill team&#146;s answer is that the essential question before the LBRO is: should the enforcement action be stopped? However, I read paragraph 1(2)(a) as being about the enforcement action proceeding and not being blocked.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000041"></a>The same terminology is used in paragraphs 2 and 3 but in different situations. I am genuinely puzzled by this provision and am not carried along by the arguments that I have heard on this. Drafting can often be very difficult but that is what we are here for. I beg to move.</p>

These can be made by all three parties to an enforcement action under the primary authority scheme&#151;by businesses, by the primary authority or by the enforcing authority. There is a serious risk that the LBRO could be overloaded with arbitration cases&#151;some of which could well be vexatious&#151;if the right to arbitration was unconditional. The Bill has therefore specified that all three parties may refer the matter to LBRO only &#147;with its consent&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000043"></a>I can confirm that the amendments would merely restate what is in the Bill and, with respect, they are therefore deemed to be unnecessary. All three parties

The LBRO would then screen those applications and, where appropriate, give consent. Those applications would then proceed to a formal referral process. That would amount to the same process set out in the amendments. I think that we are probably talking about two routes to exactly the same result.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000044"></a>Amendment No. 81 makes a point of logic. I understand that the noble Baroness&#146;s concern is to ensure that the approach taken in the Bill here is correct. The primary authority provisions revolve around checking whether enforcement actions proposed by local authorities are consistent with the advice that a business has been given. Where the primary authority thinks that it is inconsistent under Clause 26, then it may effectively block the action going ahead.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000045"></a>Schedule 4 sets out the LBRO&#146;s ability to arbitrate where the primary authority, the enforcing authority or the relevant business refers the matter to the LBRO. The essential question before the LBRO in that case is whether the enforcement action should then be stopped. It has three issues to consider, which are set out in paragraph 1(3)(b). First, LBRO needs to verify whether the enforcement action is inconsistent with any advice given by the primary authority. Secondly, the LBRO needs to verify whether the advice was correct to start with&#151;that is, to make sure that the primary authority has not got the law wrong, making inconsistency irrelevant. Thirdly, the LBRO needs to verify whether the primary authority has given advice properly. It has to make sure that it has not been unreasonable in the advice it has given&#151;for example, that it has not disregarded cases where there might be a need for a different local approach.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000046"></a>If the answer to all three questions is yes&#151;the action is inconsistent with advice and the advice was given both correctly and properly&#151;the enforcement action should be stopped. I can confirm that inconsistency is the appropriate concept here. Consistency would reverse the outcome of LBRO arbitration with the effect that it would block actions where they are consistent and let them go ahead when they are inconsistent. Clearly that is not what we are after.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000053"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 87. I am prepared for teasing because there is inconsistency in some of the amendments that I have tabled.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000054"></a>The National Consumer Council asked me to bring forward Amendment No. 82. It wants paragraph 2 omitted because it gives business a pre-emptive right of appeal against proposed enforcement actions by enforcing authorities. I understand that the provision was not in the draft Bill and has not been consulted on. The council describe it as giving a vulnerability to abuse by wealthy companies using lawyers to delay legitimate enforcement action. I have never understood why lawyers should not be used, but they seem to be denigrated in some circumstances. It is not reassured by the safeguard that the LBRO must consent to the reference. The provision does not set out the circumstances in which the LBRO may refuse its consent, and the LBRO may be reluctant to refuse consent if judicial review is threatened.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000055"></a>If a company consistently challenges proposed enforcement actions or the authorities have to deal with a series of challenges from many companies, the prospect of protracted legal wrangling is a real deterrent. This is not a point from the NCC, but I add that we must all be familiar with local authorities quite properly having to have regard to the use of their resources when they take any action, or respond to any action by a third party. Sometimes, the costs to be met, rather than the subject, become the main issue. The LBRO may require a regulated person to pay reasonable costs, but that is only permissive. I presume that, if it did not happen, the enforcing authority would be liable for the costs.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000056"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 87. The amendment which I thought I had tabled made reference to the period provided for in Clause 26(9), but the amendment which appears in the Marshalled List would insert,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000278"></a>&#147;the relevant period provided for in Section 26(9)(a)&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000246"></a>That was not my point, but it is interesting. I do not know who thought of it and whether it is a heavy hint from the Public Bill Office. Clause 26(9) provides&#151;we have already touched on the alternatives&#151;for a,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000279"></a>&#147;period of five working days&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="08012843000248"></a>as the relevant period for the purposes of the clause. My amendment was tabled to understand whether I am on the right clause. If the period is not known in advance&#151;I have in mind Clause 26(9)(b), about which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, spoke earlier and which provides for the longer period that the LBRO directs&#151;it has a knock-on effect in the schedule. Even though it is not the amendment which I thought I had tabled, it has become quite interesting. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000058"></a>I support the amendment, which would leave out paragraph 2 of Schedule 4. As noble Lords will be aware, paragraph 1 allows the enforcing authority to appeal to the LBRO if it is directed by the primary authority not to take enforcement action. That allows the LBRO effectively to arbitrate if there is a disagreement. Paragraph 3 allows the primary authority to ask the LBRO to decide on a proposed enforcement action if it feels unable to do so. This is appropriate if there is uncertainty.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000059"></a>Paragraph 2 is not appropriate. It allows the regulated person to ask the LBRO to intervene when the enforcing authority and the primary authority agree on a course of action but the regulated  person does not. This would seem to frustrate the normal mechanism of enforcement by allowing an opportunity to appeal to the LBRO prior to other opportunities that are dependent on the sanction; for example, a court hearing that determines the right or wrong. The danger is that the LBRO can decide not to decide, but in coming to that decision, it will have had to consider the facts of a given situation, which would use up resources best employed on other aspects.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000060"></a>Removing this paragraph from the Bill would remove the ability of a regulated person to make a pre-emptive appeal to the LBRO against a decision on which the enforcing authority and primary authority agreed and therefore to frustrate the enforcement process. Such an amendment would be crucial to the effective and efficient implementation of the overall design of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000061"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08012843000317"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I first assure the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that the business&#146;s right to appeal to the LBRO was in the draft Bill. For future reference, the provision was set out in Clause 11(5).</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000062"></a>These grouped amendments all relate to Schedule 4(2) on the right of businesses to refer an enforcement action to the LBRO if a business believes that its primary authority has failed properly to check for the consistency of a particular enforcement action with advice previously given to the business. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that my noble friend and I have no problem with businesses going through lawyers, given what we both did in our former lives.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000063"></a>The LBRO&#146;s arbitration role is central to the Bill and is designed to protect the interests of businesses and local authorities as the primary authority scheme takes effect. I know that there are concerns among enforcement officers that this might be abused by particular businesses appealing every decision vexatiously. That is exactly the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. I am pleased that the Bill has a number of safeguards against this. Schedule 4 makes it clear that referrals to the LBRO may be made only with its consent. In practice, we expect that to mean that the LBRO will have a right to screen potential referrals to ensure that any frivolous or vexatious appeals are turned down at an early stage&#151;that they are weeded out. The LBRO may also charge the business for any referral.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC242"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000064"></a>In addition, the Secretary of State may under Clause 26(2) specify a period within which any referral to be made to LBRO by the business must be made. If a business is prepared to pay and passes the hurdle that establishes that it is not vexatious, would they then just play for time, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said? In those circumstances there is a period in which the referral must be continued or come to an end. This will prevent the business using the appeal to play for time indefinitely and will obviate the need for Amendment No. 87, which would permit the enforcing authority to proceed with an enforcement action while the business decides whether or not to appeal.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000065"></a>So there are three parties to any decision under the primary authority scheme&#151;the primary authority, the enforcing local authority and the business. It would be odd, would it not, to give protection to both local authorities concerned, but not to afford it to the business as well? I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, especially, would agree with that. Perhaps both noble Baronesses will not press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000070"></a>The noble Lord said: Under the Bill, a multi-site business is free to select as its primary authority one which is relatively sympathetic to its cause. Smaller, single-site businesses which operate within a single local authority area will not by definition have that flexibility. So there is a risk that they are disadvantaged as against larger businesses. The purpose of Amendment No. 101A and this amendment is to provide some balance for those smaller businesses by giving them some rights of appeal against the enforcement decisions of their respective enforcing authorities. These would be on the same grounds as an appeal to the LBRO against a decision of a primary authority by a business that operates on a multi-site basis.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, has kindly written to me to explain that small businesses can appeal to a tribunal. I prefer my solution for two reasons: first, it would give the regulated party the opportunity of appeal before conviction, which the Bill as drafted would not; and, secondly, the conditions as drafted in the amendment mirror those in the Bill for multi-site businesses, thereby placing small businesses on a more equal footing with larger businesses. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000072"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08012843000320"></a>Lord Bach:</b> These amendments would give businesses operating in, and regulated by, only one local authority access to some of the benefits of the primary authority scheme&#151;in particular, access to arbitration by the LBRO.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000073"></a>I understand that the intention behind the amendments is to defend the interests of small businesses, but this is not a large versus small business issue. The benefits of the primary authority scheme can be enjoyed by a small business that operates across two local authorities in the same way as they can be enjoyed by large retailers that operate in every local authority in the country. However, the primary authority scheme has been designed to address a specific problem that affects only businesses regulated by more than one local authority&#151;that is, that advice, guidance and enforcement can vary from one local authority to another.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000074"></a>The primary authority scheme does not give a business a general right of appeal. The scheme has been created purely to promote consistency of advice and enforcement among local authorities. It is not clear that single-site businesses experience similar inconsistency where they are regulated by only one local authority; nor was this a concern raised in the responses received to the consultation on the Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000075"></a>We believe that the inclusion of the amendments would create a significant disincentive for local authorities to give advice to the single-site businesses that operate within their boundaries. With the threat that such advice could be challenged hanging over its head, a local authority might well cut its losses, cease to provide advice and, rather, use formal enforcement as a means of securing compliance. That would be to the great detriment of small businesses that rely on the advice they receive from local authorities.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000076"></a>We listened very carefully to small businesses throughout the consultation period. Their main concern with the primary authority scheme is to ensure that, where a local authority is nominated for the statutory scheme with a particular business, that will not drain resources away from the support and advice that local authority enforcement officers routinely give them. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, mentioned that point at Second Reading. Our inclusion of a charging provision provides much-needed clarity and will allow local authorities to recover their primary authority costs, should they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000077"></a>A number of noble Lords were eager to explore the benefits that the LBRO would bring for small businesses more generally, and perhaps I may discuss these briefly. First, the LBRO&#146;s general functions will seek to minimise burdens on all businesses. Its guidance to local authorities is likely to address issues such as the best way to support businesses to compliance where they have limited time and resources for finding out the law. Secondly, the LBRO&#146;s role in setting a short and strategic list of national enforcement priorities will create greater certainty and security for everyone. Lastly, but not least, there is nothing to stop a small business bringing a particular issue to the LBRO&#146;s attention for action through guidance and, if appropriate, direction.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000078"></a>Noble Lords will naturally expect assurances that, in carrying out its general duties, the LBRO will not neglect the particular interests of small businesses. I am happy to give that assurance, but the relevant functions are those set out under Part 1, which we debated earlier.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000079"></a>I hope that, on the basis of what I have said, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment and, further, that he will feel satisfied that the concerns of small businesses are being looked after.</p>

The power to give directions is recognised by everyone as significant, and we must pay attention to the fact that this body has that power.

The scheme is set out in the Bill in a way that is wrong. It would be one thing for the LBRO to be advisory and to give guidance, but to have the power to direct would be another. That would completely change the LBRO&#146;s position in relation to all the regulators and the businesses we have been talking about.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000087"></a>Incidentally, we should not forget middle-sized businesses. Generally speaking, they are under the most pressure. The large businesses can look after themselves&#151;as can the small ones, usually. It is the ones in the middle that have the trouble. There needs to be a serious rethink about the reserve powers of the LBRO.</p>

He will know, either from his briefing or from reading <I>Hansard</I>, that we have discussed guidance and directions by the LBRO. Some of us took the view that there have to be directions&#151;in exceptional circumstances, at any rate&#151;otherwise the whole system, which is designed for the public interest and for business to achieve greater consistency and co-ordination through the creation of the LBRO, would fall down. It is essential to have that backup or reserve power. I do not know why we have to argue it again today. I thought my noble friend Lord Bach, dealt adequately with the matter the other day. Of course, reserving the point, it will be a delight to hear what my noble friend Lord Jones says.</p>

As an aside, I wish to take on the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, about medium-sized businesses. During my time as director-general of the CBI I tried so often to reach out to them, thinking they had specific issues that were not covered by other big businesses&#151;which I also thought looked after themselves, and I was wrong about that&#151;or by small businesses, which everyone, every agency and parliamentarian, is usually all over like a rash. After a

They do not feel that they are medium-sized; they see themselves as either a small big company or a big small company. We ought not to concentrate too much on looking at medium-sized businesses. I agree with the noble Viscount that we ought to think about taking them into account separately, but when I did that at the CBI it met with a stony silence.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000090"></a>The amendments relate to a relatively restricted direction-issuing power for the LBRO. I recognise the anxieties of the noble Baroness and the noble Viscount about conferring any powers of direction on to the new body. I am going to repeat quite a bit of what my noble friend said last time and I shall clarify the reason for the inclusion of these specific powers in the context of LBRO arbitration.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000091"></a>The primary authority scheme gives particular multi-site businesses the right to an advisory partnership with a local authority, the core of what we are trying to achieve, and the right to a process whereby that local authority should screen actions by other local authorities for consistency with the advice it has given. Businesses across the land badly want consistency. That is their main complaint. The lack of it is a waste of the implementation of regulation&#151;as opposed to regulation itself&#151;because of the effect of multi-site businesses, the harm that does to productivity and the frustration it causes in so many parts of the country.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000092"></a>Schedule 4 allows for arbitration on request by all three parties. The results of that arbitration will be binding. In many cases the outcome of a referral to the LBRO will be of interest to other businesses and local authorities; indeed, it will be another route to ensuring that we have lack of failure in the implementation of regulation on multi-site businesses.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000093"></a>At Second Reading, a number of noble Lords questioned what benefits the scheme would bring to smaller businesses or to those that operate on one site only and would have no need for access to the primary authority scheme. The latter could be a very big business operating on one site; although there are very few of those around, it is not about the size of the business. The powers of direction in paragraph 7 deal with precisely that issue. They permit the LBRO, if appropriate, to give other businesses the benefit of the same certainty that the business which is relevant to the case can rely on, by extending the implications of a decision to local authorities across the country. This is being done not to add obfuscation, nor to give someone enormous power, but to make business more productive and to make the implementation of the regulatory regime more efficient.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000094"></a>The powers will also help deal with one of the risks of the primary authority scheme: that, when the advice given by different primary authorities diverges, multi-site businesses will find themselves subject to increasingly different regulatory standards in practice. The powers of direction are limited by the requirement that they should relate to a specific enforcement action submitted to referral to the LBRO. They cannot be used more widely or arbitrarily. Paragraph 7 provides an essential part of

This goes to the core of what we are trying to achieve: not only consistency, but ensuring that the whole implementation process is more productive and efficient.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000099"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would delete the delegation provision from the schedule. It aims to understand what the Government envisage. Delegation of functions can be made to any person; presumably that will include a corporate person as well as an individual. Decisions will be taken by officials of the LBRO. Does the paragraph anticipate that a board decision will be carried out by the individuals who are working for the LBRO&#151;obviously there will be internal schemes of delegation, and one understands that&#151;or is it, as I think it might be, to allow for a delegation to a completely different organisation; in other words, requiring another organisation to carry out some of its functions? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000249"></a>means that anyone can be given by the LBRO the power to direct that enforcement action should be taken or not. It can direct local authorities about any enforcement action. The LBRO has tremendous powers in this schedule, any of which can be delegated to anyone else. Who is that? Which powers will be delegated? To whom is it thought even slightly appropriate that the powers of direction, for example, should be granted? I have not so far been able to find any guidance on that in what has been published, and I would be grateful to know what is intended.</p>

The LBRO will be a relatively small public body with a wide-ranging scope. I am sure that Members of the Committee will have had a quick glance at Schedule 3 and will have seen the range of regulatory issues that its work will cover: if I take the simple A to Z approach, from accommodation agencies to zoo licensing. Arbitration cases may be referred to it under any of these headings, and it is unlikely that the LBRO will have the right in-house expertise to deal with all such matters.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000103"></a>For example, a chemicals firm may refer a matter to the LBRO that calls for a highly specialised knowledge of environmental science or of the particular issues raised by a pollutant in a very specific ecosystem. In such cases, the LBRO may wish to delegate the arbitration function to persons or bodies with the appropriate expertise&#151;in the case I have given, perhaps to the Environment Agency.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000104"></a>The Committee can be sure that the LBRO will be under a public law duty not to delegate its functions irrationally. We can consider the points the noble Baroness has raised to ensure that she and the public get that assurance, but, if we removed the delegation power at paragraph 9, that would have serious implications for the viability of the scheme and how it works in practice. I will ask for the noble Baroness&#146;s points to be considered in order to give her that comfort, but removing delegation would, frankly, render the scheme unworkable.</p>

Not having the right in-house experience does not mean you have to delegate to those who have the experience; you take advice from them. The LBRO should be responsible for the decisions and actions, and should remain so. Delegation is a step a good deal further than the Minister describes as being necessary. Of course the LBRO will take advice from others&#151;I entirely accept that&#151;but taking advice is not the same as handing over responsibility.</p>

After all, the functions in the schedule include the powers of direction, and so on&#151;quite fierce powers, ordering things to happen. The Bill does not say that they have to be delegated to another quango&#151;or rather, to another agency of government. The Minister mentioned the Environment Agency, for example, which will be relevant in cases such as the one he mentioned. This paragraph, however, would allow the powers to be delegated to absolutely anyone&#151;to me, for instance. I am not for a moment supposing that the LBRO would think that appropriate, although you never know, but it could delegate those powers to all sort of bodies, trade bodies or whatever.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000109"></a>We know that the LBRO is not a quango; the Minister said at Second Reading that it was not, because it was temporary and would be wound up. Does that make it a &#147;tango&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="08012843000110"></a>The power to delegate enforcement functions, including the power to direct, is very wide. Perhaps the Minister should think about the word &#147;functions&#148; and see whether that needs limiting a little.</p>

As I listened to that, I was thinking that there are three words here that need clarity of definition and of extent: &#147;delegation&#148;, &#147;responsibility&#148; and &#147;function&#148;. As the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, reminded me earlier, this is my first time, and I did not know whether I was going to be able to do what I want, which is to say, &#147;I think we should take this back and look at the definitions of those three words&#148;. I think the LBRO has to have the ability to go to specialists, otherwise it will fail, but that does not mean we do not have to deal with the legitimate points that Members have raised. I was wondering whether I would be able to make that promise to the Committee, and I am grateful that my officials have just said exactly the same thing. On that basis, we will take that back. I make it clear that the provision has to work, but the Committee deserves to have those three words clarified.</p>

In this set of amendments we are dealing particularly with matters of urgency. My Amendment No. 93 was my rather amateurish attempt to raise the issue of urgency and to seek to understand how the Government will approach it. The noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, has an amendment on the same point, which he will speak to with his great experience of these matters. Amendment No. 93A came to me from the National Consumer Council and spells out certain &#147;circumstances&#148;, as the term is. I do not think it matters whether that is the right term at this stage when we are dealing with the principle of the issue. The items the NCC has highlighted include human health, the environment and financial interests. Financial interests could be a major or minor item, I must say&#151;although human health issues could also be major or minor. They are a little different in character from the others. It is important to understand the minimum circumstances in this case. Simply saying, &#147;I am introducing this to seek to understand how the Government will be approaching the issue of urgency&#148; is probably all I need to do. I do not need to argue the case for it being addressed. I beg to move.</p>

I hope I shall not repeat a lot of what has been said already today; I shall try not to. I have a different concept about the whole issue.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000120"></a>The Government are placing an undue emphasis on businesses. I was a founder member of the Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments, which is still adorned by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. We took evidence about regulatory reform, and it was all about making life easier for businesses. There was an occasional mention of voluntary organisations, but not very often.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000121"></a>On reflection, the purpose of regulation is not to make life difficult or easy for businesses; it is to protect the public. That is why local authorities have been given regulatory powers. They are not given them for fun, but for the protection of the public&#151;yet the public are almost never consulted. I know it is not easy to consult the public, but we have already had mention today of the consumer council. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, knows all about that. There is also Citizens Advice, along with other organisations.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000122"></a>Have the Government actually grasped that this is all about protecting the public? Are they going to make an effort to ensure that the Bill will be drafted in order to deal with that issue? It is why the exceptions to going to the primary authority are so extraordinarily important. At Second Reading I gave an example&#151;and I hoped this would be familiar territory to the noble Lord, Lord Jones, in view of the suffix to his title&#151;of some West Midlands pizza parlours. Incidentally, I tell him that Culross is nowhere near there; it is in Fife, but never mind. The point was to show that there needed to be powers to

That is in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000123"></a>There are another four examples of exceptions in the Explanatory Notes. In the recent guide that has grown to seven, so things are improving. We have been told today, however, that the Government will not be able to produce a draft of any of these statutory instruments before further stages of the Bill. When I sat on the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, one realised that a confetti cloud of statutory instruments always follows legislation these days. It is all very well the noble Lord, Lord Bach, saying he thinks we will all have a lovely time discussing this when the statutory instruments come before the House, but he failed to remark upon the fact that you cannot amend statutory instruments. The only thing you can do to correct any mistakes or failures in them is to consult beforehand, which must include in these instances consultation with people who represent members of the public, who are meant to be protected. That does not always happen, but I hope it will this time.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000124"></a>I shall take another couple of examples, the sort of cases that trading standards departments have to deal with. The first is doorstep salesmen of dodgy insurance policies. The moment they step across a local authority boundary, they are a regulated person under Clause 20(1). They therefore come within the Bill. Are we going to make certain that the trading standards department that discovers that this is going on, and that old -age pensioners are being defrauded by such people, does not have to go to the primary authority to take enforcement action? It probably is so, if you look at the exemptions that are listed in the guide. I expect that the delay involved in consultation might inhibit effective evidence-gathering or investigation of a breach. That is new; it was not in the original Explanatory Notes. It is, of course, absolutely correct.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000125"></a>What about the people who come around&#151;I am sure they are a business&#151;who always have a leftover part of a tarmac job that has been done for a public authority, and who will put it upon your drive, usually for cash? They go away and then the tarmac does not set very hard. Enormous sums are involved, which is usually not explained beforehand. This is the sort of thing that the public need to be protected from, and trading standards departments are there for that purpose. Are we sure that the exemptions that will be produced by statutory instrument will cover the full range of such circumstances? I am reasonably content with what is set out in the guide, but I am not sure that it has been consulted on fully and that it is agreed by everyone that it is adequate.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000126"></a>In particular, I cannot see why there is no provision in the Bill to deal at least with what we all know is going to be required. A health and safety provision, which I discussed at Second Reading, is bound to be included. If the matter is urgent, something will have to be done and there will be no time to consult the primary authority. There will be others circumstances of that sort as well. The less we have to set out in statutory instruments, which cannot then be amended, the better. Why not put it all on the face of

We are beginning to crystallise the sort of circumstances where consultation with the primary authority will not be necessary, so let us proceed as fast as we can with setting out as many of these circumstances as possible in the Bill. We can then discuss them in Parliament, where it will be possible to amend them. Let us not leave them to statutory instruments which cannot be amended.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000127"></a>I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, that this needs to be considered. The provision as it is at the moment leaves everything to completely vague and undefined statutory instruments. That will lead only to the usual arguments about whether they are adequate and whether they ought to have included something else. I hope that he and his advisors will think again about making these provisions a little more firm and concise, thus making sure that we really have covered the ground.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000128"></a>The amendment in my name is of course only inclusive; it does not say that there cannot be a power to produce a statutory instrument to add more things. However, I am asking that we do not produce statutory instruments to deal with all the things we know we are going to have to deal with in this context; they can go in the Bill. If necessary, powers can then be taken to add to them. We ought increasingly to take this approach because of the flurry of statutory instruments with which Parliament is constantly beset, and about which the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and I know all too well. I hope that there may be a little more progress on this than simply to say, &#147;We will know what is in the orders before the end of the Bill&#148;.</p>

I will not waste the time of the Committee by trying to articulate the arguments again, but we hear again and again that there is so little on the face of the Bill; it would be a great comfort to have something. This is a perfect example of the issue. Let us have the provisions in the Bill so that we can debate them both in this House and the other place.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000130"></a>Statutory instruments are becoming the enemy of the people. It is quite worrying that the Government have got themselves into a position whereby they are afraid to put things into a Bill. That is not the way this Minister works because it is not in his nature to do so, and that is why the Prime Minister brought him to this House. He can bring fresh air to these issues and say to the Government, &#147;Don&#146;t let&#146;s be so afraid&#148;. We do not need statutory instruments for everything and we do not need the very long meetings that go with them. Moreover, we cannot do anything about them once they have been passed. If I hear the words &#147;appropriate&#148; or &#147;statutory instrument&#148; one more time, I shall begin to think that the Bill is being conducted by the people sitting behind the Ministers rather than by the two noble Lords sitting on the Front Bench.</p>

We are sympathetic to the intentions behind all the amendments that have been spoken to. The noble Viscount has put his case robustly and extremely well. This is the first time I have ever been allowed to praise a judge or an ex-judge. Normally they did not praise me, but they were quite open to say things about me. The noble Viscount put his case extremely strongly. He and others will have read the guide which accompanies the Bill and I hope they find it useful.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000132"></a>We have made clear our intention to propose exemptions by statutory instrument to the requirement to contact the primary authority covering all the issues that have been raised. My officials worked very closely with representatives of the sector on the basis of the draft Bill over the summer to settle those cases where the primary authority scheme could get in the way of effective enforcement. Consultation revealed a number of distinct issues which the noble Viscount and the noble Baroness raised that needed to be dealt with. The guide lists these exhaustively but I shall refer only to a couple.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000133"></a>We have no intention of inhibiting officers from seizing evidence where there is a need to do so quickly if it would be crucial to a prosecution at a later stage. We have no intention of preventing emergency action to deal with imminent and serious risk to human health. We have no intention of stopping officers from taking sensible steps where there is a practical issue to be dealt with&#151;a faulty alarm, for example, in the early hours&#151;and where a cumbersome process of consultation would be against reason and in no one&#146;s interests.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000134"></a>We have not sought to put these issues on the face of the Bill as we believe that that would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of the scheme. Clause 26 allows for an order which would exclude certain categories of action all together from the definition of enforcement action. It will address the issue of routine exchanges and informal advice. Clause 27 enables an order to specify enforcement actions which should be allowed to proceed without the requirement to notify the primary authority beforehand.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000135"></a>Three main considerations have led us to take this approach to these exemptions. First, many of the terms involved in catching such actions can be subjective&#151;&#147;regulations that are local in character&#148;; &#147;insignificant burdens for the business&#148;; &#147;financial interests of consumers&#148;. These may require substantial, detailed, technical explanation of a kind that is not suitable for primary legislation if they are not to create significant loopholes that enforcing authorities and businesses may be able to exploit.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000136"></a>Secondly, the legislation underlying the regulations is very diverse in character and scope. Exemptions will be detailed and are likely to need detailed and tailored treatment of the kind that an order allows for better than legislation. Finally, while we believe the list of exemptions in the guide is comprehensive, issues may arise in particular regulatory areas and the orders will, by their very nature, have more flexibility at a later date. It will be critical to the success of the

I can assure the Committee that those orders will be laid in good time. We will consult on them as they are drawn up.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000137"></a>The principle behind the noble Viscount&#146;s amendment, which would still allow for some exemptions to be made by order&#151;an important factor&#151;and specify some of the grounds on which it should be made, is sensible. He may or may not be surprised by my saying this but, in spite of his great drafting experience over many years, the precise wording will need to be considered and therefore I hope he will understand if we need to take the matter away. Without making any promises at all&#151;the noble Viscount has heard that phrase before&#151;I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment and the noble Viscount not to press his so that we can return to the matter on Report. We want to give more thought to this matter. The speeches that we have heard today have strengthened us in the view that we will need to consider the issue more carefully before rushing into something that may have weaknesses.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000138"></a>The noble Viscount asked about the need to consult on all the exemptions, which were all suggested through the consultation process. Of course, we will consult fully on the draft order with enforcers and consumers, who are an important part of this issue. I hope that noble Lords who have spoken in the debate will be pleased that we are to take the matter away for consideration.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000139"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012843000341"></a>Viscount Colville of Culross:</b> Perhaps the noble Baroness will forgive me if I say one word by way of thanks. I have no particular pride in my drafting; I simply put down some issues to raise the point and see what happened. The noble Lord has been very generous in saying that he will take away and consider the matter, but I urge him to put in as many provisions as he can, properly drafted, and, if necessary, to leave the rest to be added by further statutory instrument. That is not an uncommon system for dealing with things and at least everyone will know to some extent what will not have to be consulted on.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000140"></a>I say that at this stage only because I think that when the Bill comes back on Report I shall be engaged in other parliamentary business, which will make it impossible for me to attend the debates on this Bill. Therefore, I am reliant on what the noble Lord, Lord Bach, has said and I very much look forward to the result of his further consideration.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000150"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to the whole group of amendments, the first and last of which are mine. Amendment No. 96 refers to Clause 28(5), which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000281"></a>&#147;the primary authority must take into account any relevant recommendations relating to inspections which are published by any person (other than a local authority) pursuant to a regulatory function&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000250"></a>My amendment seeks to insert the word &#147;LBRO&#148; to probe whether it has a regulatory function. I do not think that that is defined and it is thus excluded from subsection (5).</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000151"></a>Amendment No. 98 is another amendment suggested by LACORS. It would insert a new clause providing for a compliance plan to broaden the scope of the suggested inspection plans. The promoters of the amendment feel that the clause as drafted has limited value in helping local authorities effectively to co-ordinate and target their enforcement activities because planned inspections, which are focused on here, form only a small part of the regulatory work that they carry out. The amendment would allow for the publication of information which was of more use to councils and would enable the regulated person to get information to all councils about their safeguard systems and, indeed, planned improvements to their operations.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000152"></a>According to LACORS, the clause as drafted fetters the ability of authorities to be able to respond at the local level to local issues and it adds a level of bureaucracy with no ultimate impact. I beg to move.</p>

The purpose of these probing amendments is to cater for a situation in which what I might call a rogue authority disregards an inspection plan which is properly set up by a primary authority and registered with the LBRO. Clause 28 deals with one of the key functions of the primary authority, which is to agree a plan of inspections with the business. The plan will reflect the nature of the business, a careful assessment of the risks, an understanding by the primary authority of the due diligence and other company procedures, and its overall assessment of the business. The inspection plan is then to be registered with the LBRO.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC256"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000154"></a>The objective is to overcome problems that have been identified with local enforcing authorities ignoring agreements made with home and lead authorities and insisting on local arrangements that are unique to their area, without any specific justification. If businesses and primary authorities are to go to the expense of drawing up agreed inspection plans, it is not reasonable for local enforcing authorities to be able to disregard those plans without having to justify that to the primary authority and the LBRO and those bodies being able to overrule the enforcing authority. As the Bill stands, the enforcing authority merely has to advise the primary authority under Clause 28(8) and (9), and that seems to be the end of the matter. One would hope that that would never happen but, if it did, I cannot see how the primary authority concept would survive without amendment along these lines.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000155"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08012843000346"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> If the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, are accepted, in effect an enforcing authority will have to get the consent of the primary authority before carrying out any inspection which falls outside the scope of the inspection plan, although there is what might loosely be called some sort of appeal to the LBRO. The outcome of the amendments would be an additional burden on primary authorities, which would have to deal with requests from enforcing authorities to inspect outside the scope of the inspection plans, and they would impose an additional restriction on the autonomy of enforcing authorities to respond to local concerns.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000156"></a>Noble Lords&#151;certainly those on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;have recognised that on many of the matters we have discussed it is a question of balance: local autonomy versus central agency and so on. The noble Lord said that under the Bill as it stands the enforcement authority does not have to justify itself. However, it does have to justify itself because it has to inform the primary authority if it wants to go against the inspection plan and it has to give reasons. That is set out in Clause 28(9), which states that a notification has to be made and that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000282"></a>&#147;must include reasons for exercising the function otherwise than in accordance with the plan&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000157"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord de Mauley, quite rightly said, any scope to enforce the view of the primary authority is missing. What is in the Bill is sufficient and, because justification has to be given, there is no need for the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000158"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08012843000347"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I am sympathetic to the intentions behind Amendments Nos. 97 and 98. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, was kind enough to say that one of the reasons I came into government was to try to sort out some of this regulatory nightmare, and I have taken a personal interest in Amendments Nos. 96, 97, 98 and 98A.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000159"></a>I have always compared regulatory environments and, indeed, the implementation of regulations. In countries such as France, there seems to be more regulation on the books than in Britain and yet, somehow, businesses seem to operate in a far more  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC257"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>laissez-faire way. In the past, those implementing regulation in Britain have put themselves up in opposition to those who operate business. I disagree with the noble Lord in that I do not think regulation is there just to protect the public; it is also there to protect law-abiding businesses. I often see officials here implementing regulation in opposition to business, whereas on the Continent they often seem to work in the same groove, going the same way, and they see themselves as partners. In one way, Clause 28 will play an essential role in encouraging a much more co-ordinated and strategic approach, especially in relation to multi-site businesses, and implementing their problems at a local level.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000160"></a>Businesses rightly resent the time and cost involved in unjustifiable and meaningless inspections. One of the Hampton principles is that there should be no inspection without a reason. That has been put on a statutory footing with the recent publication of the statutory regulator&#146;s compliance code. It will save time and money for local authorities and businesses alike. Once a primary authority and a business have developed and published an inspection plan and a notice that that inspection plan will be developed together&#151;working in the same groove for once&#151;then other local authorities will be required, first, to have regard to the plan when carrying out an inspection of the business concerned; secondly, to notify the primary authority when they depart from the plan&#151;this is important because a multi-site business headquarters and a primary authority may have settled something and then another local authority somewhere else may wish to depart from it because it has always done it its own way and no one else understands its issues&#151;and, thirdly, to give reasons for doing so in their notification. That will ensure that inspections are not undertaken lightly and without due consideration having been given to the inspection plan which has been agreed.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000161"></a>Inspections can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including a complaint that needs to be followed up quickly or a recurring problem with management in a particular outlet of a multi-site business. An inspection plan agreed with a primary authority cannot take account of all these factors&#151;who knows which ones will apply?&#151;and, if the inspection authority had to seek the consent of the primary authority before undertaking an inspection, especially if one was needed urgently, the result would be a deluge of notifications to the primary authority, bogging down the system on a large scale and preventing quick inspections when these needed to take place. You would get very swift disengagement and the whole system would not work.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000162"></a>To avoid that outcome, primary authorities would be likely never, or very rarely, to contest proposed inspections and would draw up meaningless low-level, low-hurdle inspection plans. It is likely that any agreed plan would be extremely general and so hedged with caveats as to be practically meaningless. That would help no one&#151;certainly not local authorities and least of all business and, by implication, members of the public, whom, in part,

Clause 28 seeks to allow for the preparation of robust and meaningful inspection plans.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000163"></a>Businesses will rightly expect that, having gone to the trouble of drawing up an inspection plan with their primary authority partner, they should not be subject to arbitrary inspections on spurious grounds. I was considering this very recently and came to the conclusion that the biggest problem would be where a primary authority was faced with a notification from the inspecting authority after the event. That notification, while factually accurate, would be of no benefit to this system and would cause problems to the business. It strikes me that a more effective approach would be to require notification, not consent, because with consent the primary authority would have to invest a great deal of money, time, effort, people and, therefore, delay in doing it all beforehand. As is so often the case, for there to be credibility in the system, things have to be done quickly. Notification before the inspection took place would mean that many inspecting authorities would have to consider whether it was necessary and whether it was going along the lines of what we all intend. At the end of the day, I would hope to get rid of that old bte noir of, &#147;Well, we do it this way because we have always done it this way&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000164"></a>I encourage the noble Lord and the noble Baroness not to press this amendment because I should like to consider the matter further and return to it on Report.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000165"></a>I move on to Amendments Nos. 96 and 98A. Clause 28 has also been deliberately drafted to minimise the likelihood of an inspection plan contradicting any recommendations made by a national regulator or the LBRO regarding inspections. Subsection (5) requires a primary authority to,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000283"></a>&#147;take into account any relevant recommendations relating to inspections which are published by any person (other than a local authority)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000251"></a>I can confirm that &#147;any person&#148; captures both national regulators and the LBRO. Therefore, although I understand the intention behind Amendment No. 96, I do not believe that it is necessary. The protection that is needed is already there.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000166"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling Amendment No. 98A and for allowing me an opportunity to clarify what the Government expect regarding the content of inspection plans. Clause 28(3) lists examples of what can be included in an inspection plan as,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000284"></a>&#147;the frequency at which, or circumstances in which, inspections should be carried out&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000252"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000285"></a>&#147;what an inspection should consist of&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000167"></a>This list is not exhaustive and the Government expect inspection plans to include recommendations and information on a wide range of issues relating to a business with which a primary authority has a partnership. The most important thing here is that that inspection plan will have been developed in partnership between the primary authority and the business. At last, we will have a situation where the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>business cannot complain afterwards if it has had &#147;skin in the game&#148; on the inception of the plan.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000168"></a>The guide to the Bill lists some examples of the content of these inspection plans, including details of improvements that a business undertakes to improve its health and safety procedures. There, the inspection will presumably be about how those improvements are coming along&#151;whether people are doing what they said they would do. The inspection would be specifically relevant and not just general. The guide also includes details of ongoing problems relating to compliance to which other local authorities should pay particular regard. From my experience, an example would be where one store was having a problem, perhaps through bad management, when other stores in the same group were &#147;doing fine, thank you&#148;.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000199"></a>I believe that all the issues included in Amendment No. 98A can be addressed in an inspection plan under Clause 28. It is certainly the Government&#146;s intention that that should be the case. However, the amendment would also remove the key requirement that local authorities should have regard to a registered inspection plan and notify the primary authority when departing from it. As I said, giving notification beforehand does not mean that consent is being sought but at least it means that one is forced to write down the reasons.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000200"></a>The Government expect inspection plans to help to reduce unnecessary inspections of businesses and to facilitate knowledge-sharing between the primary authorities and the enforcers. Achieving those aims rests on an enforcing authority having regard to an inspection plan and informing the primary authority of its reasons for departing from it. Amendment No. 98A would remove that requirement and significantly undermine the effectiveness of having an approved inspection plan. It would undermine the fact that business can at last work in a groove to ensure that primary authorities, enforcers and business form a partnership to make regulatory compliance productive and not destroy value. Therefore, I hope that Amendment No. 98A, alongside Amendments Nos. 97 and 98, will not be pressed and that Amendment No. 96 will be withdrawn.</p>

Anticipating the point that the Minister made on Amendment No. 98A in relation to what I think he described as the essential&#151;certainly significant&#151;provision regarding notification, LACORS says that it does not see that that adds value as the primary authority cannot stop another local authority acting outside the plan. In addition, a regulated person has a right to complain via a local authority&#146;s complaints

However, we will all consider what the Minister said in that connection and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000205"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 28 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="08012843000206"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012843000357"></a>Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> I was much reassured by what the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said about this clause and the issues behind it. He placed great emphasis on what I might call the protection of businesses against arbitrary inspection by a town hall on spurious grounds. He ended, quite properly, on the subject of spurious grounds. That attitude may help to explain why he is not a member of the Labour Party, although he is a member of the Government&#151;a point referred to earlier. However, I shall not press him on what he obviously regards as a very personal matter, judging by his response this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000207"></a>I gave notice of my intention to oppose Clause 28 because I think that it could lead to a different set of difficulties. As has been made clear, its purpose is to ensure that inspection of different branches of the same business is conducted on the same basis. That will be very good for the business. That is the purpose of this whole part of the Bill, which concerns inspection.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000208"></a>However, in future, when this is all up and running, inspection will vary not between the different branches of the same business but between adjacent shops along the high street. More so nowadays than perhaps used to be the case, on the average high street quite a proportion will be the branches of multiple shops. Interspersed with them will be independent stores and local businesses with perhaps only one or two outlets, and other concerns such as education providers like McDonald&#146;s, a company which now seems to have moved into that field. However, I am referring to franchisees. We had a little difficulty over franchisees the other day because it appears that they will be half involved in this and half not, depending on the detail of their business arrangements. I do not want to get involved in all that again.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000209"></a>Outlets belonging to the multiple chains will each be part of an inspection plan agreed with a local authority, and most probably a different one for each. Some local authorities may become primary authorities for large numbers of retail outlets, but others will only be the primary authority for an outlet where the headquarters of a concern happens to be located in its area. Many inspection plans will be agreed with different local authorities for the multiple shops; there will be partial inspection plans for the franchisees and the local authority&#151;the secondary authority&#151;will only be in complete charge of individual shops which do not have the advantage of an inspection plan. So the patchwork will be spread along the high street instead of across the branches of a large company.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000210"></a>I am concerned about how to protect smaller businesses within a single authority that are not grand enough to have an inspection plan. Such businesses  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC261"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might cut across several local authorities but would still not be of sufficient size to warrant a plan. How are they to be protected from the arbitrary power against which the noble Lord, Lord Jones, is going to protect those involved in inspection plans? It may be that an awkward local authority inspector will have to concentrate his efforts on small businesses, which worries me.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000211"></a>Certain other aspects of drawing up the inspection plans worry me because of my original qualification as a chartered accountant. I still am a chartered accountant, but now a rusty one because it is a long time since I was last actively involved in the profession. However, I started my professional life as an auditor. The idea that one&#146;s audit plan is drawn up in consultation with the person being audited is not one that springs to mind. Of course you must talk to the person you are auditing, but the plan is the auditor&#146;s plan or the inspector&#146;s plan, and it must be followed. You need a measure of co-operation, but authority over how the plan is drawn up must not be given away. Given that, the extent of the consultation provided for in subsection (4) also worries me slightly.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000212"></a>Subsection (6) provides that the other local authorities which will make the inspections will only be told about it after it has all been agreed. Only after it has been signed up to by the primary authority, the LBRO and the company being inspected will the people actually doing the inspections be told. Here we go back to the difficulty that if all the secondary authorities have to be consulted, and in some cases that could amount to hundreds of organisations, it will be very difficult to reach any sort of agreement. As I say, it is not necessarily satisfactory that the bodies actually making the inspections are to be told only after everything has been settled.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000213"></a>These are my hesitations about Clause 28 and the way it is constructed generally. In some respects I am reassured by what the Minister said in answering the previous group of amendments. I am not arguing that there should be no replacement of Clause 28, but there are still difficulties and I would like to know the Government&#146;s reflections on them.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000214"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012843000358"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I also have concerns about the way in which Clause 28 has been drafted. The Minister tried to reassure us in part in his response to the previous group of amendments. He gave us a halcyon picture of local authorities and businesses working closely together to create a wonderful set of inspection plans. The lion may lie down with the lamb, but I do not think it will be because of Clause 28. The problem here is cultural and historical and the solution will be by attitudinal change rather than legislative change. Trying to bring that about with the prescriptive provisions in Clause 28 carries with it many dangers, some of which my noble friend has mentioned.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000215"></a>This kind of government approach is usually breached rather than observed. The boxes are ticked, the procedure is gone through and no one changes their mind. It becomes a matter of, &#147;We have fulfilled what we have got to do. We have been told to do it and it has been done&#148;. There is no spirit attached to it

Whether life in France is quite as good as the Minister makes out, I do not know, but we need to find a way of altering behaviour patterns. I doubt whether this legislation will do it.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000216"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is not in his place. He is keen on reducing words&#151;he keeps telling us that we have to cut back the Bill&#151;and when he spoke in an earlier debate he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012843000276"></a>&#147;The more I listen to this debate, the more astonished I am at how local authorities carry on. Noble Lords opposite are business-like, and it is business-like to use as few words as possible, to get on with the job and to do it well&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/08; col.

</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000256"></a>That is why I am unhappy about Clause 28.</p>

I am aware that this is on the record and I want it to be. In my previous existence, after the CBI, one of my jobs was as the United Kingdom&#146;s skills envoy. Train to Gain, which involves the essence of getting young people an entry into the labour market, getting them to read, write and count, getting them to learn the ethic of turning up to work on time&#151;or turning up to work at all, frankly&#151;is hugely important. Getting the private sector to be the delivery agent for that is a big task and McDonald&#146;s is a leader in it. It was one of the first organisations to sign up to Train to Gain and has worked with its young people to get them up the skills ladder. I like the sense of humour but I would not want this opportunity to pass without saying that McDonald&#146;s is a company which takes its social responsibilities very seriously.</p>

On the contrary, I, too, congratulate the company on its training schemes over the years&#151;although I have not had much to do with them&#151;and on its project, which my grandchildren like very much indeed.</p>

The first was about the &#147;patchwork&#148; concept on the high street, which I thought he put extremely clearly. I developed a picture in my mind of exactly what he was trying to get at. Yes, the patchwork has changed; instead of it being across multi-site businesses, we are now going to have a different approach, perhaps in one locale. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the single-site small shop will get a bad deal. It might be that the inspecting authority is inspecting only the one shop and is not part of any inspection plan. If good or bad deals are to be had&#151;and I doubt that we will get that much movement from consistency, but if we did&#151;it does not necessarily follow that small businesses would get a poor rub of the green.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000220"></a>The other point I want to address, which one or two Members have raised, is that it is important that we take the hostility out of the implementation of  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulation. The media, local authorities, politicians, and indeed so many vested interests in this country start from the view that business is &#147;at it&#148;; that it is wrong, it is in the bad box, it is on the naughty step, and for some reason we have to be here as saviours of the nation. It is important that we get business into the whole regulatory formulation framework. That is what this is about. I am reminded of when I was at the CBI and I went to see a business in Yorkshire. They said that the day before they had had an inspection officer from a certain government agency, a young lady sitting in reception who said, &#147;I&#146;m behind on my targets this month&#151;I&#146;m going to do you today&#148;. And her department duly did. I said that I would take up the matter, and the businessman said, &#147;Don&#146;t do that, please, because she&#146;d be back next week and she&#146;d do it again&#148;. We are trying to achieve an end to that. It destroys value and productivity. The implementation of regulation as opposed to regulation itself is something that France and Germany do better  than us.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000221"></a>Clause 28 makes provision for a primary authority to draw up an inspection plan containing recommendations for how other local authorities should inspect a business for which it is the primary authority. That is intended to bring greater consistency; co-ordination for the first time of regulatory enforcement for businesses that adopt a primary authority scheme and, I hope, greater compliance with the recommendations given by the primary authority in its role. Where a primary authority has made a plan and the LBRO consents to it, the primary authority will be required to bring it to the notice of other local authorities. We hope that we will develop consistency in that way.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000222"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, about whether legislation is the way to go because what we need is attitudinal change, I completely agree with him. We need cultural and attitudinal change. However, as long as I have been in business, which is nearly 30 years, I have seen many people talk about needing such a change but I have rarely seen people come up with ideas that work. This is constructive and trying to achieve something. At least this is trying to take us down the right path. Perhaps for once we will see legislation leading our social mores rather than the other way around.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000223"></a>I hope that this system will support the sharing of strategic information between authorities, and that it effectively means a lighter touch by local authorities across the country in areas where businesses are known to be compliant. I said earlier that regulation is there to protect business as much as the public, because it is there to protect the businesses that behave themselves and are good businesses against those that are not. I hope it will bring better information sharing about the real regulatory issues that need to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000224"></a>Inspection plans will play an essential role in all this. It will encourage a more co-ordinated and strategic approach to regulating multi-site businesses at a local level. I move that Clause 28 stands part of the Bill, and I commend it to the Committee on the basis that at last something positive is going on to

The amendments relate to fees. The first would require the primary authority to consult the LBRO before charging. I can see that having to consult on a case by case basis would not be reasonable. The second would allow the LBRO to give advice to a primary authority about fees. Under Clause 31(2), it can give guidance. I do not know whether we should regard &#147;guidance&#148; as being advice or a direction. The amendment is probably covered by that subsection, but I do not know whether Amendment No. 99 is. If the LBRO has not given guidance about fees, will the Minister confirm that the primary authority can proceed without consulting it? I beg to move.</p>

Some stakeholders have asked for further clarification of the clause. It is quite simple: all the costs incurred by a local authority, given its responsibilities under Part 2, may be recovered from the business partner. We recognise, however, that local authorities are likely to want more clarity about the operation of the scheme in practice, and that they will need support in interpreting their responsibilities and how to charge for them in practice. A specific requirement for them to seek advice from the LBRO on the approach that they should follow, as is proposed, is unnecessary. The Bill creates a provision for the LBRO to give guidance on the matter at Clause 31(2)(c). Guidance will tackle many of the issues associated with charging in practice, and local authorities must have regard to it when charging. Local authorities may also consult the LBRO, but the guidance clause takes away the need for any specific requirement for them to do so. I hope that that clarifies the position and will allow the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Co-ordination systems such as this save local authorities across the country considerable sums by relieving them of the need to agree local inspection plans and to provide advice and guidance to multi-site businesses locally. One might reasonably ask how and why home and lead authorities have been able to perform this function until now for no charge. The answer, I suspect, is that the benefits are two-way for business and local government. That is why local authorities have been prepared to engage in the current voluntary schemes. It would be unfortunate if business concluded that the cost of paying a supplementary amount for these services outweighed the benefits of continuing with these arrangements.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jones, described the emergence of new attitudes and new approaches, but I can think of few things that are more likely to cause the hardening of attitudes than the stark nature of the statements in Clause 29; for example, the power to,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000291"></a>&#147;charge the regulated person such fees as [the primary authority] considers to represent the costs reasonably incurred&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000237"></a>I accept entirely what the noble Lord said. His speech in response to the earlier stand part debate was encouraging to a major degree and a very welcome, different approach from what we have heard in the past. I think that he should look at finding a way to reassure the regulated person&#151;whoever that may be&#151;that the fees charged are reasonable and are not dreamt up in a way that may be seen to be unreasonable and unnecessary. Of course, the large companies will be able to make a fuss but, once again, it will be the smaller companies that find it is not worth proceeding because of the effort, administrative cost and regulatory burden involved. I am with the Minister all the way with regard to attitudinal change but this is where we could ensure that the underlying attitudinal change was reinforced.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000238"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08012843000367"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> The merits of the primary authority scheme are that it will be in the public interest and in the interests of business, as we discussed on a number of occasions today and last week.

<p><a name="08012843000239"></a>There is no doubt that, if we came back to this discussion in two or three years&#146; time, we would find that some authorities, still called &#147;local authorities&#148;, would have the tremendous burden of having to find resources to carry out their primary authority functions whereas others would not. The county of Hertfordshire happens to have a large number of company headquarters, and there are a number of other reasons why it should be the chosen business

No doubt there are other such examples and other local authorities which would hardly ever be primary authorities for one reason or another. In two or three years&#146; time, we will see nothing other than a patchwork quilt involving a great variety of burdensome responsibilities and less burdensome responsibilities on local authorities. To enable the primary authority adequately to resource its new responsibilities as a primary authority and to enable it to continue to do its normal job in this field and others, there is a need for it to be able to charge as the Bill proposes.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000240"></a>There is nothing terribly new or novel about local authorities being able to charge for the services they provide. In an earlier discussion, we talked about authorities being nominated to be primary authorities, either by way of agreement or, contrary to the views of some in this Committee, possibly through nomination by the LBRO because the business has not been able to find a local authority partner. If there is no ability to charge, as provided for under Clause 29, then many local authorities will be much less willing to take on the responsibilities which we&#151;if we agree with the main principle of this part of the Bill&#151;want for all sorts of perfectly good reasons. Worse still, it may be that a local authority would take on the role and then not fulfil the requirements of the job as well as it should. Primary authorities must be adequately resourced.</p>

Some of them&#151;I mentioned one example earlier&#151;grumble that there is a particular burden on them which neighbouring authorities do not bear. That could not go on indefinitely, but it was a voluntary scheme and there was no other way of doing it.</p>

<p><a name="08012843000243"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0007.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="08012843000370"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am extremely grateful to my noble friend because he is right. Indeed, I am tempted to ask the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, whether he is really suggesting that it is wrong to ask local businesses to charge, or whether he is not going quite that far&#151;it would be a long way&#151;and is asking only how local businesses will pay. If he is really against this charging structure, what does he have in mind to put in its place? It is a legitimate question and I put it to the noble Lord. As I understand it, some businesses currently pay for home and lead partnerships.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000244"></a>In agreeing to be a primary authority, a local authority is agreeing to take on a host of new functions and responsibilities for the benefit of a specific company. Carrying out these functions effectively may be costly, and in their responses to the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC267"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consultation on the Bill, many local authorities expressed concern that they would not have sufficient resources to enable them to carry out the role of a primary authority effectively. The provisions in Clause 29 address these concerns by allowing a local authority to recover the costs it incurs when carrying out its functions as a primary authority. Moreover, regardless of that provision, it is likely that local authorities that volunteer to become primary authorities would have the right to charge under general local government legislation, a point made by my noble friend.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012843000245"></a>Clause 29 makes it absolutely clear that all local authorities may charge for their services as a primary authority if they wish to do so, regardless of whether they have volunteered or have been nominated by the LBRO. It is a carefully drafted clause to ensure that a local authority cannot derive any profit from its work as a primary authority. It may charge fees that represent only,</p>
<ul><a name="08012843000292"></a>&#147;the costs reasonably incurred by it in the exercise of its functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012843000258"></a>Further, if it were completely unreasonable in its charges, for a start I do not think that the business would pay, but if it did, it would have a potential remedy&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, is looking at me carefully because I think he knows what is coming&#151;in terms of judicial review. As a further safeguard, local authorities must have regard to any guidance issued by the LBRO under Clause 31 in relation to costs recovery. That particular safeguard is important.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000002"></a>In putting his case, the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, argued that the provisions in Clause 29 amount to a kind of double taxation as businesses already pay for regulatory services through business rates. However, partnerships in the primary authority scheme will give multi-site businesses access to a range of services over and above those available to businesses in general. If a business has a primary authority, it will benefit, first, from the advice and guidance the authority can offer as the first point of contact on regulatory issues; secondly, it will have the right to a review of all significant enforcement action by the primary authority before such action is taken against it; and, thirdly, a right to refer proposed enforcement actions to the LBRO where it thinks that the actions are inconsistent with the advice it has been given. Not surprisingly, these benefits come at a cost. However, I do not believe it would be appropriate for these costs to be met through general rates on business, including those that do not enjoy access to the primary authority scheme, or charges on local council taxpayers.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000003"></a>At Second Reading the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked what might be done to ensure that the primary authority scheme does not divert valuable local authority resources away from small businesses. We argue that the inclusion of the power to charge will provide clarity and be an important safeguard for the interests of small businesses; for example, those that carry out their business in only one local authority area. Clause 29 will ensure that small businesses can confidently expect that where a local   


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authority becomes a primary authority, it will not divert resources away from the advice and support that they are entitled to look to their local authority to provide.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000004"></a>I am delighted to say that Clause 29 has been welcomed by small business representatives for just that reason. Representatives of some of the bigger, multi-site businesses have put it to us that charging would not be unwelcome so long as the scheme delivers the real consistency that they need. There is, of course, a cost to the inconsistency that has taken place until now.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000005"></a>That is the argument on the other side. Unless there is a serious alternative to this system&#151;I look forward to hearing about it if there is&#151;I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. I hope he will feel satisfied with my explanation of why we have taken the course we have.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000006"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012845000061"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I would make the point that while some local authorities will incur additional cost as a result of this system, others will presumably save because they will not have to repeat the work all across the country. The fact that there is not what I might call an equalisation procedure as between local authorities ought not really to be the problem of business. Having said that, I am attracted to the idea of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, of a right of appeal. I will read the Minister&#146;s words carefully and, on the understanding that we can come back to this, I shall withdraw my opposition to the clause.</p>

I apologise, too, that I have not been able to be here throughout but, for the first time in my life, I am meant to be divided between human embryology and something more practical like this.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000019"></a>The Committee may like to know some of the background to this. I have provided a brief which goes back to one year before the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, went into business&#151;1975. The concern at that time was related to &#147;powers of entry&#148;, as we called it then. I intend to speak to Amendments Nos. 103A to 103K, 109A, 109B, 192A and 192B.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000020"></a>I draw the Committee&#146;s attention in particular to Amendment No. 103K, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012845000058"></a>&#147;Nothing in this Part shall apply to the powers exercised by police officers, members of the security or intelligence services or officers of HM Revenue and Customs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012845000021"></a>I do not need to rehearse all of this but if I had a chance of saying, &#147;I wanted to go to Birmingham and I ended up at Crewe&#148;, I really wanted to go to Crewe. In the research that we undertook we found that of all the powers of entry related to government, no government department knew what its powers of entry, search or seizure were. I therefore introduced a Private Member&#146;s Bill in 2006 which was tabled simply in order to list those powers of entry that existed. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, was the only Minister at that time who gave a proper answer; he said, &#147;Refer to the Library and to the research on the powers of entry written by Professor Stone, which I had put in the Library myself.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000022"></a>I have tried over time with numerous Parliamentary Questions, at considerable cost, to get government departments to advise what powers they have under which legislation. The problem, as usual, particularly in a leap year, is that you have a moveable feast. As Governments change departments, departments within departments and departmental names, no one has a clue what their powers are. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, will probably remember in some of the earlier days&#151;although I think it was before he was there&#151;we consulted the Committee on Invisible Exports, the CBI ad nauseam, every chamber of commerce in the country and all the local authorities to see what their concern was. It was simply this: that there were an enormous number of people who had the power to go into other people&#146;s houses without permission or a court order. Recently, the Committee may be aware, the Prime Minister made a statement on an appropriate day to the <I>Independent</I> that he was going to get someone to look at 250 powers of entry and see what could be done about it.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000023"></a>There is no point having a Private Member&#146;s Bill that does not become law. Officials in this great Palace of Westminster and others suggested that my Bill should be grafted or tacked on to suitable government legislation. The various bodies pointed out that the Bill before us today was extraordinarily suitable government legislation because it dealt with local authority powers, as well as with a whole range of other things. One of the advisers to the noble Lord, Lord Jones, who is not here, might like to know that the McDonald&#146;s &#147;Hamburger University&#148; has provided guidance in the past about food safety and matters of that sort.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000024"></a>The objective of my amendments is to introduce, to some extent, what was called the Powers of Entry  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC270"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>etc. Bill in an appropriate place at an appropriate time. Having had a Second Reading and rather hoping that some people might get up and object, I found that no one objected; everyone I have consulted thinks it is a good idea that we should know what the powers of entry are.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000025"></a>I wanted to leave in the reference to Customs and Excise, but they have quickly merged with the Inland Revenue and you should not interfere with the powers of the Revenue. Some of the powers of the VAT men and others are outrageous. It all goes back, as Members will know, to the differential price of brandy during the Napoleonic wars. That has been superseded by the fact that every spirit produced in the United Kingdom is cheaper on the Continent than ever before, but it was the power of the VAT man that still worried people. Then we came to the question of the security and intelligence services. They, of course, must be left out.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000026"></a>In the Schedule we have 155 Acts that give people the power to go into other people&#146;s houses without authority and without a court order. When these were all government departments and we had nationalised industries such as gas, no one minded, because in a way you trusted government officials. But as we privatise and sell things off, so the same powers are transferred to private sector enterprises; in many cases, foreign-owned. That does not mean that the people who seek to search and enter are foreigners, but our legislation in the United Kingdom gives greater freedom to search and enter than in any other country in the European Union. I am not fully advised on all this, but it is one of the worries.</p>
<h5><a name="08012845000060"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000027"></a>The purpose of these amendments was, effectively, to take a concept and introduce it into government legislation, knowing that government officials and others would probably find a way to object, but knowing that the argument is absolutely flawless, because the first question is: surely it is right and proper that Ministers should know that the powers of entry are of officials in departments or institutions for which they are responsible. That is the principle behind all of this.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000028"></a>The amendments are simply to say, &#147;Look, let&#146;s have a code of conduct&#148;. I would prefer a code of conduct to a code of practice, but in general you need a code that everyone is aware of. You need all the principles whereby people should identify themselves when they enter and if they take documents away, they should not lose them and should provide receipts. All of these are little details. So the purpose of my amendments was simply to introduce this activity into a Bill and to hope that the Government, who are sometimes logical and reasonable, will realise that there is nothing wrong about this&#151;it is a cross-party matter. Should the Government wish to know how many more Acts or pieces of legislation were introduced by Conservative Governments that permitted powers of entry, often without clear thought, I can tell them&#151;even those introduced by the Liberals in ancient times. Of course, this is very much a liberal Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC271"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000029"></a>Therefore, the question is, if my Powers of Entry etc. Bill went ahead to Committee stage, it would then stand there&#151;and what would I do with it next? I would probably introduce it next year or the year after, or maybe introduce it to my friendly officials in Brussels and make it law in another way. So the background to this is that I know that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, knows more about this than any other Minister. He is the noble Lord who gave the most satisfactory answers. I shall sit down and ask the Government please to consider whether they might accept these amendments, either in their present form or in amended form. I have plenty more amendments that I could table at an appropriate time, but the hour is late and I do not wish to disturb or distress anyone here. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000030"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012845000063"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> Briefly, I support my noble friend who has done us a great service by raising this issue. Before he introduced his Bill in December last year, I had come across Mr Snook&#146;s book, <I>Crossing the Threshold</I>, which is a chilling read, in the sense that not only are the actions described there very wide-ranging, but they are difficult to regulate and define. I do not want to repeat what my noble friend said, other than to express general support for his approach and to draw the Government&#146;s attention to his Amendments Nos. 103H and 103J on the issue of information gateways. This will have some relevance to the operation of the LBRO, because Acts are being passed with increasing numbers of powers that permit the passing on of information, often of a highly confidential and personal nature, from one government department to another. That is not right.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000031"></a>The Government&#146;s response to date has primarily been along the lines of, &#147;If you&#146;ve got nothing to hide, you&#146;ve got nothing to fear&#148;. That has been the oldest argument for every bit of illiberal and restrictive legislation since time immemorial. In a lot of cases, though, having been gathered by one government department on certain grounds, information is passed to another government department without the person it concerns knowing what is going on. We came across this issue in the Companies Bill, now the Companies Act. That now permits the Takeover Panel to pass information to overseas bodies carrying out similar tasks. There is no restriction on what they do with that information after they have got it.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000032"></a>I hope that when the Minister replies to my noble friend, he will address this issue of information that the LBRO may pick up, which may be important to a business, and ensure that it cannot be passed on and, most importantly, that it is treated in proper confidence. I am not sure that that is tackled anywhere in the Bill, but it is an important subset of the points made by my noble friend. I thoroughly support his strategic point.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000033"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08012845000064"></a>Lord Lyell of Markyate:</b> I rise briefly to support my noble friend, who has done us a great service by working in such detail on a long-forgotten subject. It happens that the Select Committee on the Constitution is now making a study of the surveillance society.  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC272"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>While this is not exactly the surveillance society, it is not very far from it. My noble friend said that this is not a party political issue because all parties have passed Bills which allow people to enter premises. However, it is highly desirable that some order is brought to the matter. Any help that the Minister can give in steering this provision to that desirable conclusion would be genuinely welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000034"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08012845000065"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> We on these Benches support the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Selsdon to include in this Bill the provisions of his Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Powers of Entry etc. Bill 2007. When she spoke at that Bill&#146;s Second Reading, my noble friend Lady Hanham said that it was alarming that such a Bill had not been produced before, and that it had to come from a Member of the House rather than from the Government. The amendments before us bring together all the legislation under which various government departments can require or force entry to private or commercial premises. As my noble friend has said, these amendments testify to more than 100 Acts of Parliament which allow officials from various departments and agencies to demand entry to premises.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000035"></a>I particularly want to support Amendments Nos. 103H and 103J. My noble friend Lord Hodgson referred to the information gateway, and I agree with him that this is one of those wonderful new things that is creeping insidiously into our daily lives. Too much information is being exchanged too easily. For that matter, too many regulatory bodies and, indeed, far too many Acts of Parliament provide powers of entry. The dangerous consequence of all this is that in the muddle and complexity of it, holding the Government to account becomes far more difficult, so transgressions that affect business, the consumer and the regulator alike can occur.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000036"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012845000066"></a>Lord Bach:</b> We are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, for his initiative in tabling these amendments at a time when his Private Member&#146;s Bill has successfully completed its Second Reading in this House and is awaiting its consideration in Committee. He was kind enough to say that my reply to him some time ago was the only satisfactory response he has had. I think that it owed more to my department then than it did to me personally, and I have to refute what he says about my knowing more about this subject than any other Minister. It is a nice thought, but I do not think that I am in that position.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000037"></a>I believe that on the 23rd of this month the noble Lord met with my noble friend Lord West of Spithead, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, to discuss the Government&#146;s programme of work on the issues dealt with in his Bill on powers of entry, and that that relates to the substance of the amendments before the Committee today. I am able to confirm and put on the record that the Home Office is engaged in conducting a full review of all powers of entry for the police and for non-police agencies. As the noble Lord mentioned, this was announced by the Prime Minister in a speech made on 29 October last year.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC273"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column GC273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000038"></a>The review is looking at three distinct elements: first, an examination of all the existing powers, how they are operated and by whom, and what are the associated safeguards and protections; and secondly, an assessment of the continuing need for the powers, and whether the powers provided in individual statutes remain not just necessary, but proportionate too.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000039"></a>The final stage will consider what individual powers should remain on the statute book and, importantly, provide an options paper for public consultation on the future legislative requirements for consolidating all powers of entry; and how we can raise public understanding; and awareness and avenues of redress. I think that the noble Lord and the Committee will agree that that is a fairly comprehensive review.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000040"></a>I know that the noble Lord has indicated his willingness to share his knowledge of these matters in this area; we are very grateful to him for that. I confirm that this is absolutely a non-party issue and one where it is important to get it right. His positive approach is much appreciated. I hope that he will acknowledge that the programme of work that I have outlined pretty briefly tonight is planned to result in a public consultation paper in the autumn. The programme of work itself is significantly beyond the proposals in his amendment, well drafted though it obviously is. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment today. He has made his point extremely clearly to the Committee today and on the record in <I>Hansard</I>; I know that he made it very effectively to my noble friend Lord West when he met him the other day. There is obviously still much work to be done here by the Home Office. If he is going to tell me that that work must not be allowed to continue endlessly without action, I agree.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000041"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, talked about the information gateway. It is my fault, but that took me slightly by surprise. Let me say what I can on that issue. The exchange of information, as he and the noble Baroness will know, is governed by the Data Protection Act. Arrangements for the exchange and use of information are set out in statute and working protocols agreed by the Information Commissioner. In the context of the Bill, those arrangements apply to the LBRO as to other areas of government.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000042"></a>Returning to the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, I realise that my answer to him is not as full as it might be, but I hope that he will take away with him the knowledge that his amendments have some support in the Committee and that the Government are conscious of the need to put all this, eventually, after public consultation, on the future legislative bandwagon. In other words, I repeat: we will provide an option paper for public consultation on the future legislative requirements for consolidating all powers of entry. I cannot say when that will be, but his amendments today are another step on bringing that to the attention of both the public and Parliament, and I am grateful to him for that.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000044"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08012845000068"></a>Lord Bach:</b> If the noble Lord will forgive me, I think that he made a slip of the tongue. I hope that it was not long ago as 1905.</p>

<p><a name="08012845000045"></a><b><a name="80128-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08012845000069"></a>Lord Selsdon:</b> It says &#147;05&#148; on my brief; I am so sorry about that. I think that the oldest Act on my list is from 1874. I just wanted to get this on the record, because it shows how difficult it is for government. The Answer stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012845000059"></a>&#147;A record of all powers of entry is not maintained centrally. In July 1983 the Prime Minister agreed that the Home Office, together with the then Scottish Home and Health Department and Northern Ireland Office should take responsibility for scrutinising proposals to create or re-enact powers of entry their home jurisdiction. Any new proposed power of entry is required to be submitted to the respective home department for consideration. Appendix A to the <I>Guide to Legislative Procedure</I> published by the Cabinet Office in June 2001 sets out the criteria for scrutiny of powers of entry. That guidance applies to both public and private legislation for which departments are responsible, including subordinate legislation. In England and Wales, those exercising a power of entry must have regard to Code of Practice B issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in addition to any requirements set out in the primary legislation granting the power.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>; 23/11/05; col. <I>WA 219</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000046"></a>The Minister said that everything will be done by November. Would it not be a good idea to have legislation in the Queen&#146;s Speech? As nowadays that is normally written in July, we will have two or three months to get things together. I confirm, as I have said to the noble Lord, Lord West, that I and everyone with whom I am associated will help in any way. Much of this information originated from the Committee of London Clearing Banks, when every clearing bank had approximately 3,000 branches in the United Kingdom. We all consulted together at a time when only 30 per cent of people had bank accounts.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000047"></a>The point that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, made about people&#146;s fear over the transfer of their information to third parties is very real. While the suggestion that the Government are looking at the matter is right and proper, we should separate out the powers of the police, the security services and the Revenue and Customs and concentrate all the other powers. Every day people are entering other people&#146;s houses without the necessary authorisation, as the noble Lord will know from press articles. It is a serious issue and I would be grateful if speedy action could be taken.</p>

<a name="80128-gc0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08012845000048"></a>I shall withdraw all the amendments I have mentioned. I cannot remember which ones they are; they go all the way through the Marshalled List.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0801286000011"></a>The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on 28 January in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) will represent the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0801286000012"></a>The agenda items are as follows:</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0801286000015"></a>The Government expect discussion of the Western Balkans to focus on Serbia and Kosovo. The council is likely to discuss the forthcoming second round of presidential elections in Serbia, including ways the EU can best take forward Serbia's European perspective. The Government are committed to a tangible EU future for Serbia but, at the same time, committed to full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia as a requirement for progress. On Kosovo, EU leaders agreed in December that the Union should play a leading role in implementing a settlement on Kosovo's final status. The council is likely to discuss ways to take forward that commitment. The Government believe the status quo in Kosovo is unsustainable and are working for a rapid resolution of status in co-ordination with international partners.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0801286000018"></a>The Government will support conclusions at the council welcoming recent bilateral negotiations, maintaining continued support for the political process through the framework of the EU Action Strategy and expressing the EU&#146;s serious concern about the humanitarian situation and continued violence in Gaza. The Government also want conclusions to encourage the parties to adhere to their road map commitments, particularly on Israeli settlement activity and on Palestinian security; and to welcome the achievements of the Paris donors conference.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0801286000019"></a>The Government are committed to supporting the process initiated at Annapolis, which has put the Israelis and Palestinians on a path to real negotiations in 2008, which the Government hope will lead to a final settlement of two states living side by side in peace and security. Israeli security is absolutely fundamental to a just solution; and Palestinian hardship can be tackled only through a political process that creates an economically and socially viable Palestinian state.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0801286000020"></a>The Government expect the council to adopt conclusions on Lebanon in light of the ongoing political crisis and the recent spate of violence. Lebanon has been without a head of state since President Lahoud's term of office expired on 23 November 2007 amid ongoing divisions between the Government and the opposition over who should succeed him. The Government will support EU endorsement of the latest Arab League diplomatic initiative to help resolve the crisis and call on all parties to engage.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0801286000022"></a>The UN Envoy for Darfur, Jan Eliasson, will brief the council on the latest developments in the political process in Darfur. The Government will support conclusions welcoming the return of the SPLM to the Government of National Unity in Sudan, while noting the importance of timely and thorough planning for the elections in 2009. The Government will also want the council conclusions to call on all parties to facilitate the prompt establishment of an effective African Union-UN peacekeeping force, UNAMID, noting in particular the continued lack of full co-operation by the Government of Sudan.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0801286000023"></a>The Government hope that the council conclusions will in addition express concern about the tensions between Chad and Sudan, call on both sides to refrain from any further escalatory action and support calls for an internal political process in Chad to end the armed conflict. The Government expect the council to launch the EU military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, which will contribute to the protection of refugees, facilitation of humanitarian assistance and the work of the UN. The Government welcome and fully support EU engagement and messages on these issues.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0801286000026"></a>The Government will support a clear condemnation of the violence in the conclusions, which should also urge Kenya's political leaders to work together to agree a political solution to the crisis while expressing strong support for the efforts of the African Union and the mission led by Kofi Annan to assist Kenya's politicians in achieving this goal. The Government also expect the council to discuss what further action the EU could take to support efforts to find a political solution. The Government welcome this opportunity for discussion given the seriousness of the crisis in Kenya.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0801286000030"></a>The Government expect the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to brief the council on next steps following Iran&#146;s failure to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 and 1747. The Government fully support the strengthening of EU sanctions and will be pressing partners to take a firm stand on this issue, following the adoption of a new UN Security Council resolution.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0801286000032"></a>I am today laying before the House a Command Paper&#151;<I>Ready to Work, Skilled for Work: Unlocking Britain&#146;s Talent.</I> Copies will be made available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0801286000034"></a>The Government want to build on the success of the current apprenticeship programme and have undertaken a review of apprenticeships in England. This review carried out jointly with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, is being published alongside the Command Paper today.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0801286000035"></a>The report,<I> World Class Apprenticeships: Unlocking Talent, Building Skills for All</I>, sets out a wide range of steps that will improve apprenticeships for the future and ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all qualified young people by 2013 and as part of raising the participation age in learning to age 18. There is a particular focus on how we can work  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS22"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column WS22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with employers, through a new dedicated national apprenticeships service, to expand the opportunities to young people and adults. Key measures from the review are:</p>
we want apprenticeships to be a mainstream option for 16 to 18 year-olds, and will ensure that by 2013 every suitably qualified young person who wants to take up an apprenticeship place will be able to do so;as we grow a high quality programme on this scale, taking up an apprenticeship may become attractive to even more young people. We will maintain our commitment to meeting the demand from suitably qualified young people, so that if more come forward we will work with employers to expand the programme further. On this basis, we anticipate that around one in five of all young people will be undertaking an apprenticeship within the next decade, so that an apprenticeship place will be a mainstream post-16 option;a focused delivery system, including a separately branded, national apprenticeships service with end-to-end accountability for the apprenticeships programme, a dedicated field force to support employers and learners, and appointment of a director of the service to lead and champion at the most senior level;strengthening the apprenticeship experience, by improving the apprenticeships &#147;blueprint&#148; to set out the rights and responsibilities of employer and apprentice and include a signed &#147;apprenticeship agreement&#148;;action to boost the supply of apprenticeship opportunities, through a more flexible and responsive model for apprenticeship frameworks, incentives payments to targeted businesses, an apprenticeships &#147;credit&#148; delivered via skills accounts, and improving public sector supply of apprenticeship places; a drive to change the culture around the value of apprenticeships by providing a national &#147;matching service&#148;, and high profile events celebrating the achievement of apprentices; andmore to improve equality of opportunity and access, through positive action to encourage young women and young men to consider apprenticeships traditionally limited to one gender and ensure that contractual wage regulations set by the LSC are fully enforced.
<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0801286000036"></a>The review will be followed by the publication of draft legislation later this year. I am placing a copy of the apprenticeships review report in the Library.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0801286000038"></a>The UK has enjoyed record levels of employment, with 2.9 million more people in work since 1997. We will build on this to ensure that all people can share in this opportunity to work. Today, I have set out the support we can offer employers to recruit job-ready individuals, through local employment partnerships. Employers are offered a range of support from Jobcentre Plus designed to increase the effectiveness of their recruitment processes. In return we ask them to offer people who are often overlooked in the labour market  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS23"></a><b>28 Jan 2008 : Column WS23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a fair chance at a job. This can include wider use of work trials to enable individuals to demonstrate their suitability for a job and tailored pre-recruitment training to give people the skills employers need. Local employment partnerships represent an active partnership approach, enabling employers to find the right person for the job that is available when needed.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0801286000039"></a>&#147;Train to Gain&#148; is the Government&#146;s flagship service to enable employers to access quality assured, impartial advice from skills brokers with expertise in their sector to help identify skills needs at all levels and source training solutions that meet those needs. Government funding will sit alongside the employer&#146;s own financial contribution and include: fully funded literacy, numeracy, and first full level 2 qualification training for employees who need them; fully funded second full level 2 qualification training for new employees recruited from priority unemployed groups by employers signed up to local employment partnerships; and a contribution to help meet the costs of releasing employees to undertake agreed training for employers with fewer than 50 employees.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0801286000040"></a>Accreditation of employer qualifications. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is also announcing today the names of the first three companies that have been recognised to award their own qualifications in the national framework as part of the pilot announced in &#147;World Class Skills&#148; (Cm 7181). They are Flybe; McDonald's and Network Rail. In addition, to date 24 companies have had their training accredited in partnership with awarding bodies and more are on the way. This means that some of the training undertaken by the employees in these companies is now a nationally recognised qualification benefiting the staff, their employers and the country as a whole. It is another clear example of businesses being increasingly committing to improving the skills of their staff.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0801286000041"></a>The Government will continue to support employers, providing the right framework for them and their employees to succeed. Continuing this partnership approach will enable us to unlock our nation&#146;s potential and secure a prosperous future for all.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0801286000045"></a>Since the events that Brigadier Aitken has examined in his report, the Army has already done a great deal to improve its procedures. I am satisfied that the Army is doing everything possible to ensure that its personnel do not repeat the appalling acts that were perpetrated in these cases. I believe that Brigadier Aitken has demonstrated this in his report, but we must not be complacent.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0801286000046"></a>The report makes three broad recommendations:</p>
the Army needs to ensure that it learns and implements lessons from the disciplinary process in the same way that it does for wider operational issues;the Army needs to find better ways to inculcate its core values of selfless commitment, courage, discipline, loyalty, integrity, and respect for others and its standards of behaviour and discipline, into the everyday lives of its personnel; and the Army must educate itself to ensure that it is using administrative action correctly.
<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0801286000047"></a>The report is part of a continuing process of review, investigation and continuous professional development for the Army. It details the work that has already been completed, or is in progress, to ensure such acts as are examined by the report are not repeated. This work includes enhancements to training packages for both routine and specific training, and the implementation of a standard operating procedure for use in Operation TELIC, which includes the treatment of detainees and prisoners.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0801286000048"></a>I am proud to acknowledge that the vast majority of our personnel who have served in Iraq have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour&#151;some displaying extraordinary qualities of courage, self-discipline, integrity and selfless commitment far and above what might reasonably have been expected under the circumstances they faced.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0801286000049"></a>One of the cases of abuse examined by Brigadier Aitken and referred to in his report is that of Mr Baha Mousa, In September 2003, an Iraqi civilian, Mr Baha Mousa, lost his life whilst in British military custody. He and eight other Iraqis had been subjected to varying degrees of abuse. I should like to take this opportunity to also update the House on recent developments in this case.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0801286000050"></a>Last year, the court-martial of seven British Army officers and soldiers concluded. That trial resulted in the conviction of one individual, who had pleaded guilty to the inhuman treatment of prisoners; the other defendants were acquitted.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0801286000051"></a>Following the trial, and in line with normal procedures, the Royal Military Police (Special Investigation Branch) reviewed the case to establish if there was any new evidence (including evidence from the trial) and any further lines of criminal inquiry into the death of Mr Mousa and ill-treatment of other Iraqi nationals. They reported their findings to the Army Prosecuting Authority, which, in turn, having considered the report, consulted the Attorney-General.</p>

<a name="80128-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0801286000052"></a>The criminal review concluded that no further criminal lines of inquiry could be pursued on the basis of the existing evidence. This does not mean that a further investigation will not be instigated should new evidence be made available. Those individuals who were under investigation, and Mr Mousa's family, have been informed

Post-mortem inspection and culture of M.bovis remains the most reliable method of diagnosis.</p>

<a name="80128w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="08012813000044"></a>The currently available blood tests have been validated using blood from both infected and uninfected badgers. They are currently used to measure immune responses in research projects such as the development of vaccines for badgers. A difference between the two populations can be measured, but no test is 100 per cent sensitive or specific, so some false positive and false negative results will occur. It is difficult to find populations of badgers that are truly negative for bovine tuberculosis.</p>

efficiency savings of 67 senior management structure/senior Civil Service equivalent positions were achieved. These officers took the compulsory early retirement or severance packages at a cost to the FCO of &#163;14,853,645; and210 delegated grade officers took flexible early retirement or severance packages at a cost to the FCO of &#163;15,268,766.

The TDA's remit letter does, however, require the agency to work with officials to improve coverage of SEN and disability issues in teacher training, and speech, language and communication needs come within that broad brief.</p>

The QCA is the national authority for qualifications, curriculum and assessment and standards in England. Its remit covers qualifications for both young people and adults. From April 2008, an interim regulator will be established that will be responsible for carrying out the regulatory functions of QCA. The DCSF does not issue funding letters to the School Teachers Review Body or the General Teaching Council for England.</p>

As part of his review, Mr Bercow will examine how the children's workforce can best be organised and supported to meet the needs of children with speech, language and communication needs. He will submit an interim report in March, prior to his final report in July 2008.</p>
