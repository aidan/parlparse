<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Razzall </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80623-01_para0"></a>Whether they are now confident that viewers of digital terrestrial television and viewers of digital satellite television will not be required to purchase separate decoder boxes when digital services are launched later this year.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80623-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as I told the House in April, the design of the receivers of broadcasting services is a matter for the manufacturers and broadcasters operating on those platforms, subject to the relevant regulations and licence conditions which apply. It is still not clear whether the digital receivers which will go on sale later this year will provide access to both digital terrestrial and digital satellite services. The Independent Television Commission which licenses and regulates all commercial digital television issued a consultation paper on interoperability and open access on 13th May. The ITC is discussing the issues set out in that consultation paper with all interested parties, including digital satellite and terrestrial television broadcasters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, in thanking the Minister for that response, which is very much in line with his Answer to a Question that I tabled three months ago, does the noble Lord agree that this is a significant issue in which the Government have an interest? Does he agree that if the result of the consultation exercise that is being carried out by the ITC is that people will have to buy decoder boxes to watch digital terrestrial that are different from those required to watch satellite television it will be a significant set-back for the Government's digital television programme? Does the noble Lord agree that the danger is that the switch-off of analogue television that the Government want to see as soon as possible will be postponed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government have an interest in the sense that it would be deplorable if there were no interoperability between digital satellite and digital terrestrial broadcasting and, therefore, members of the public had to buy two set top boxes. It would not be quite as bad as that because, as in France and Italy, it would be perfectly possible to establish Simulcrypt arrangements whereby both sides provided interoperability. Although the Government's interest on behalf of the public is clear, it does not extend to being able to dictate to the broadcasters what they should do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, is it government policy that all terrestrial channels should be available on digital satellite and, if so, why?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government do not have a policy on these matters. This is a matter for the Independent Television Commission as I indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the ITC has insisted that both terrestrial digital and satellite digital should be compatible but what is needed is a commercial agreement between the two companies? Further, does the noble Lord agree that in order to make the two systems interoperable a simple adapter is required to operate the two systems, bearing in mind that in order to receive digital satellite one must buy a new satellite receiver and dish?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that it is more complicated than that. It is not just a matter of having a commercial agreement. There are two levels of interoperability: one is the application's programming interface and the other is what is provided for conditional access. The noble Viscount is quite right that it is possible to provide interoperability by way of an adaptor or sidecar that goes on the back of the BDB set top-box, but that does not meet all of the requirements of interactivity; still less does it provide for a full electronic programme guide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm or deny the statement of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, that it is government policy to close down analogue broadcasting of television channels? The noble Lord's statement appeared to imply that everyone would be forced to enter the new digital era.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not understand the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, to say that. The Government issued a consultation paper on the future of analogue broadcasting in February of this year. We have always made it clear that, although it is too early to set a date, we do not want to close down analogue television until digital is at least as widespread as analogue television is today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew10"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that one will have take-up of these new services only when the public is offered something simple and cheap on top of the box? At the moment one has a battle between two titans, British Digital Broadcasting and BSkyB, for perfectly good commercial reasons. That process may take some time. How long will the Government tolerate the continuation of that battle and when will they wish to intervene?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I follow the noble Viscount's somewhat emotive language. To an extent he is right. Clearly, it is in the public interest and also in the interests of both digital satellite and digital terrestrial television for the two systems to be interoperable, because that is the way <P>


<a name="column_113"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in which digital television will catch the public imagination and develop successfully. Unfortunately, that recognition does not yet appear to be in the minds and hearts of both broadcasters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord give the House an estimate of the cost of one box, if not two?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is difficult to say what the boxes will cost. The price will start high and go down as demand increases. If demand is held back by the need for two set top boxes, clearly it will take longer to get down to the &#163;200 or so which we expect with mass production.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux: </B>   My Lords, the Minister mentioned the word "sidecar". I thought a sidecar went on a bicycle. What is a sidecar in relation to a television set?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, among the many technical terms that I have had to learn, and which I have tried to spare the House, is the word "sidecar". It means the adaptor put on the back of the set top-box. It is nothing more complicated than that.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80623-01_para1"></a>Whether they consider their policies to conserve the native red squirrel are being successful.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80623-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, the red squirrel is one of the priority species for biodiversity action plans. I can assure noble Lords that the Government are fully committed to conservation of the red squirrel, and will continue to strive for its long-term survival. However, we recognise that the measures currently in place and those being investigated do not identify an immediate quick-fix solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that, on the Forestry Commission's figures, between 1959 and 1991 the distribution of the red squirrel declined in England and Wales by more than 75 per cent., does the Minister agree that it is time for some quick, new and effective policies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am tempted to ask, "which immediate and effective plan?". We share the noble Lord's concern and compliment him on the work that he does in the North West to try to protect and to enhance the numbers of red squirrels. The Forestry Commission is managing successfully a variety of projects to protect the red squirrel. Research is continuing into new methods of protection. One of the problems is that the red squirrel prefers dense coniferous woodlands. As many noble Lords will be aware, there <P>


<a name="column_114"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is strong pressure, on other environmental grounds, for the extension of deciduous forests. The Forestry Commission is doing all that it can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that one of the reasons why red squirrels are deteriorating is that they are being forced out by the grey squirrels? Will the Government take whatever action they can to publicise the damage done by grey squirrels and the fact that they should be wiped out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, the varied response from Members of your Lordships' House indicates the difficulty of adopting a policy of eliminating grey squirrels. There is a conflict of interest. We take the view that it is important to try to protect and enhance the number of red squirrels, but we are advised by all the agencies which are working closely with the Government that a policy of attempting to kill all grey squirrels would not meet with universal approval, patently not even in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that in areas such as the one in which I live where we have red squirrels, and love them dearly, a policy of keeping out grey squirrels is essential for the survival of the red squirrels? Why does she not revert to a policy of paying for the tails of grey squirrels? That would keep the numbers down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I have to stress that the area of conservation and management under biodiversity protection is not one which has an easy or universally acceptable result. With the Forestry Commission's sponsoring of a three-year testing project at Sheffield University, we hope that we will develop a successful sterilisation project which would avoid the measures mentioned by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, although we are investigating ways of increasing the number of red squirrels while doing nothing to control the grey squirrels, we must revert in the meantime to a policy of shooting on sight to control the numbers? I accept that we will not wipe them out, but that is the best form of control that we have found.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree with a policy that involves the indiscriminate shooting of any wild animal. I speak for myself as well as for the Government on this. I am conscious that parents who derive enormous pleasure from taking their children to feed grey squirrels would write to me in their thousands were I to agree with the noble Viscount.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that starvation has been one of the main causes detrimental to red squirrels? Can the noble Baroness give a little more information about the success of planting trees from which red squirrels can eat? Furthermore, does she agree that it is a great pity <P>


<a name="column_115"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that a sterilisation programme for those squirrels is not carried out in the London parks, with the introduction there eventually of red squirrels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I agree that that issue is important. That is why the Forestry Commission is committed to introducing a wider range of trees which form the right habitat for the red squirrel. Grey squirrels eat smaller nuts; and there can be a conflict if the nuts are not large enough for the red squirrels. I appreciate the concern. However, I return to the point: many people in the country would fail to recognise the necessity for totally eliminating grey squirrels and would seek to protect them in a way that they may not wish to protect, for example, rats.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us whether any birds or beasts prey upon red squirrels? If so, which are they?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any birds or beasts which prey on red squirrels. However, it occurs to me that there are those with two legs and guns who appear to wish to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness bear in mind that in parts of south-west Scotland red squirrels are coming back thanks to a determined policy of destroying grey squirrels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, yes, I shall bear that in mind and ensure that my right honourable friend the Minister for the Environment is aware of the success of that policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew10"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that squirrel pie was, I believe, a delicacy during the war? I recall having a discussion with the noble Baroness about shoots for the table. Would she promote the delicacy of squirrel pie in an effort to get rid of some of the grey squirrels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, there are unexpected pitfalls when standing at the Dispatch Box! I understand that squirrel pie, along with hedgehogs baked in earth, are delicacies enjoyed by some people. If any cookery book writer were to find a range of those recipes, I am sure that they would receive invaluable assistance from the noble Countess, Lady Mar.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ironside: </B>   My Lords, have the Government consulted the fur breeders trade association based in Newcastle-on-Tyne? It has members from all the northern hemisphere countries and has great experience and knowledge on how to preserve and conserve endangered species, in particular mink. As the Minister will agree, her party is trying to banish mink farmers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that those who have agricultural and rural community interests are often in conflict with the existence of mink. It is not only those concerned with the fur trade who have an interest in mink.

<A NAME="80623-02_spnew14"></A><B> Viscount Long </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80623-02_para1"></a>Whether the underlying trend in the incidence of tuberculosis in the United Kingdom has increased or decreased since 1990.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80623-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, there has been a small increase in the number of cases in the United Kingdom since 1990, when there were 5,897. That increase peaked in 1993 at 6,564. The figures have now levelled out just below that number. Drug resistant TB remains at low levels in this country. This success reflects the excellent record of TB control which we have and are determined should continue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Long: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her Answer. Recently fizzy drinks were withdrawn from sale because a cancer ingredient was suspected. Does the Minister agree that chewing gum could equally be suspected of being a carrier of tuberculosis and other diseases, especially those from the eastern European countries, India and Persia? Who is monitoring the situation? Is it the EC matrons of Europe or some of our noble medical associations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal with the different strands in that question. The high rates of TB in Asia and Africa impinge on other countries. The noble Lord asked about the European Union. A collaborative pilot study of surveillance of TB in member states has been successfully completed and extended to include drug resistant TB. A series of annual meetings on TB has addressed best practice. Several east European countries are participating and contributing to that exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-02_para2"></a>As regards chewing gum, there is no medical or scientific linkage with TB. TB is spread by bacteria in droplets coughed out by an infected individual. Anything spat out by an infected person might have an effect, but it would contain saliva rather than droplets from the lung. I hope that your Lordships will forgive my being so explicit. There is no direct link between TB and chewing gum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that it is within the memory of most noble Lords present that tuberculosis was virtually extinguished in the United Kingdom? Have not social conditions--those affecting the very poor, the homeless, those who are on the receiving end of most of the disabilities of modern life--been a significant cause of the recurrence of the disease which at one time we boasted we had almost eliminated?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, there was a decrease in notified cases from around 50,000 in 1950 to 5,745 in 1987. The number then peaked in 1993 at 6,564. However, the figures are still comparatively low. In 1996 there were 6,238 cases. The provisional figure for 1997--the numbers are always high because doctors register suspected cases and the figures have to be sorted out afterwards--was 6,430.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-02_para3"></a>The noble Lord mentioned social conditions and poverty. The groups which are considered at risk of TB in Britain today are certain ethnic minority populations, especially from the Indian sub-continent and black Africa, older white people who were exposed to TB when they were young, homeless people and HIV infected individuals. Many of those groups are hard to reach. Homeless people often do not complete their treatment or are lost to the health service. Any social condition which reduces the level of people's health and their ability to withstand infection will increase a disease like TB which is transmitted by bacteria.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, if it is right that drug resistant TB spreads, does the noble Baroness believe that there are sufficient specialised rooms with negative and positive pressurisation in which to treat infected patients?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, we are alive to the problem of drug resistant TB, although in Britain the number of cases is comfortingly low--43 were registered in 1994, 49 in 1995 and 60 in 1996. A programme is in place throughout the country; there are specialist clinics in every area; and TB patients are kept separate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-02_para4"></a>TB is the only disease whose exact timing of treatment was worked out a considerable time ago by British scientists. The treatment lasts six months. I am sure that the noble Baroness is well aware from her background and her membership of the Science and Technology Committee of this House that multi-resistant TB often occurs because people do not complete their prescribed programme of drugs. In Britain, we have several safeguards against that happening. I repeat that we have in place a concentrated programme and that we are alive to the problem of drug resistant TB. We are confident that we are still on top of the problem.

However, there are technical issues which need to be resolved. We shall review our research programme in this area in line with the conclusions of the forthcoming White Paper on integrated transport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-03_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response and wonder whether she will agree to some of the benefits that the use of electronic number plates could bring. Does she agree that they would significantly reduce the number of unlicensed vehicles travelling on our roads; that they would be a support and reduce the cost of road-pricing and motorway tolling; that they would support a single database across all interested parties, including insurers, motor insurance bureaux and government agencies; and that there would be recoveries for the Government in terms of unpaid car tax and for insurers as regards claims made by uninsured drivers? There would be a general administrative reduction too. Does she accept that decisions made today affect how we live tomorrow; that it will take at least 15 years to fit all vehicles with an integrated inset manufactured identity; and that therefore we should begin the process now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the time-frame for such technically challenging developments is long and therefore it is important that the fundamental research is done now. It is also important that we undertake research on an international basis so that countries do not go in different directions and we do not ask people to fit systems which are not interoperable with those in other countries to which they may travel.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para1"></a>The noble Viscount suggested certain advantages which could result from electronic developments; we agree that they could make a significant contribution to vehicle security as well as to dealing with traffic offences and the evasion of vehicle excise duty. He pointed out that they are used in the implementation of electronic road-pricing systems. There are many potential advantages and it is important that we have correct many of the great technical challenges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-03_spnew4"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, although electronics have been used successfully in the fight against vehicle crime, many of us are concerned about individual liberty? We wonder how the technology may expand, because it can already do what the noble Viscount suggests, and whether the vision of Big Brother is looming even larger, with the prospect of being tracked wherever one goes and whatever one does.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount is right to raise the issue. As regards tracking systems, there are data protection and civil liberty implications which we must take into account. It is important that <P>

<A NAME="80623-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I understand the noble Lord's concern that the practice of the past--certainly during the 18 years of the previous government when any income from transport went into the general revenue--should not continue under this Government.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, as regards the technical problems which the Minister mentioned in her first Answer, if she cannot give a summary in reply to the Question, can she place a document in the Library which sets them out in great detail?

The microwave tag, which is often suggested as the most useful form, cannot be used inside a metal structure. Therefore, fitting it during manufacture is difficult. It is also a difficulty in the developments in windscreen technology, which are becoming metallised. Therefore, simply reading though a windscreen, which through plain glass with a microwave is acceptable, is not feasible. That is a difficulty.

<A NAME="80623-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1. In speaking to this amendment I shall speak also to Commons Amendments Nos. 27 and 141.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para8"></a>The GTC will be the professional body for teachers. It will represent the highest of professional standards and promote a positive image of teaching both within the profession and outside. It will play a very important role in improving standards of teaching and the quality of learning and will maintain and improve standards of professional conduct among teachers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para9"></a>The council's work must command the respect of teachers, of parents and of the public. Getting the composition of the council right is a vital part of achieving that aim. We must achieve a council which is authoritative, balanced, effective and independent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para10"></a>The Bill allows for the Secretary of State to make regulations on the composition of the council. During previous debates I indicated that we would be issuing a consultation document on this issue. That consultation document was issued on 22nd April, with a closing date of 31st July. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The consultation document asks a number of questions about how we can secure the right balance of interests on the council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para11"></a>We introduced an amendment in this House at an earlier stage which requires the Secretary of State, when making regulations on the composition of the GTC, to <P>


<a name="column_121"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensure that a majority of the members are registered teachers who are either currently serving as teachers or have such recent experience as may be prescribed. The consultation document invites views on how these teachers may be elected or appointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para12"></a>We envisage that employers will welcome their employees serving on the council. They will be making an important contribution to the education system. It should also be of benefit to the individual's personal development and make a contribution to the work of their organisation. There may, however, be some exceptional cases where this may cause genuine difficulties for employers. For example, in a small primary school meeting the cost of supply cover might be a disproportionate burden on the school and could act to deter some candidates from putting themselves forward. Amendment No. 141 allows the GTC to reimburse employers where an employee is away from work serving on the council or its committees. This will help to ensure that teachers at the chalk face are not prevented from serving on the council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para13"></a>During our earlier debates I also undertook to consider further how we make clear our intention that the Churches should be represented on the council. Denominational schools and teacher training institutions employ and train large numbers of our teachers. I know that they are committed to ensuring high standards among the teaching profession and that they will provide a valuable contribution and perspective to the work of the council. We therefore brought forward Amendment No. 1 which adds to the list of interests which the Secretary of State should have regard to when making regulations on the composition of the GTC. We have referred to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"religious bodies involved in the provision of education", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
to ensure that no relevant religious interest is artificially excluded. In our consultation document we propose that the Church of England and the Catholic Church should each be able to nominate one member of the council, as they have by far the largest number of schools and teacher training institutions. The document asks for views on this proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para14"></a>I also think it is right that the GTC should be an outward-looking body. Its concerns should extend beyond protecting the interests of its own members. It must be prepared to speak out where standards are not as they should be. As with other professional bodies, the membership of the council should be wider than just teachers to ensure that the council can command the respect and authority of the wider public. Amendment No. 1 also ensure, that, when making regulations on the composition of the GTC, the Secretary of State must have regard to the interests of parents. The consultation document invites views on how parents should be represented.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para15"></a>We also introduced during our earlier debates a provision requiring the Secretary of State, when making regulations on the composition of the GTC, to have regard to the interests of persons concerned with the teaching of pupils with special educational needs. Amendment No. 27 places a similar duty on the <P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State for Scotland when making nominations to the Scottish GTC. The Government are committed to including all learners in their crusade for higher standards. I believe it is right that the interests of those with special educational needs should be represented on both councils. Our consultation paper on the GTC for England invites views on how these interests should be represented.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-03_para16"></a>I believe these amendments will help to ensure that we get the composition of the council right. We will carefully consider the outcome of our consultation exercise. Before we proceed with the drafting of the regulations, we want to be sure that there is widespread agreement. The regulations will, of course, be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure when we will have an opportunity to have a further debate on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para0"></a>The GTC will ensure that for the first time teachers have a say in how their profession develops. As with other professions, teachers should have a major role in regulating their own profession. I am afraid to say that the amendment introduced in this House which gave the GTC power to remove teachers from its register on grounds of misconduct, including in child protection cases, was, in the Government's view, irresponsible. The public has a right to expect a coherent and rigorous barring system which covers all people--not just teachers--who have access to children across maintained schools, independent schools and FE colleges. It would have been misguided and potentially dangerous to fragment the child protection system by passing responsibility for cases involving teachers to the GTC.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para1"></a>This Government attach the utmost importance to child protection. My honourable friend Alun Michael, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced on 4th June that we are establishing an inter-department review of measures aimed at preventing unsuitable people from working with children. Among other things, the review will be looking at whether it should be made a criminal offence for persons who have been convicted of crimes involving children to work with children in any setting. I believe this is the right way forward and that we should not therefore pass responsibilities for child protection to the GTC at the present time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para2"></a>We have, however, carefully considered how we might give the GTC a significant and responsible role in regulating the profession. We have reflected on the extremely constructive proposals put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Baldwin, and have sought to implement his suggestions in full. In another place, we introduced <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a new clause and a new schedule--which are covered by Amendments Nos. 14 and 142--which provide for the GTC to determine disciplinary cases which involve unacceptable professional conduct and serious professional incompetence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para3"></a>More than half of the cases dealt with by the department's teachers' misconduct team are clearly about child protection and they account for some three-quarters of the barring of restriction orders on teachers. These cases will remain with the Secretary of State, although he will take advice from the GTC on cases involving registered teachers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para4"></a>Many of the other cases have little or no child protection dimension to them. They involve such matters as teachers making false claims about their qualifications; misappropriating school funds; or, I am afraid, helping pupils to cheat in exams. Those cases will be dealt with by the GTC.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para5"></a>A small proportion of cases may not be so easily classified. For example, there may be cases of serious offences which may not involve children directly but in which the offending behaviour may indicate a possible risk to the safety or welfare of children. Examples are cases of serious violence against adults or dealing in drugs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para6"></a>We intend that those cases will be referred initially to the Secretary of State to consider whether a case raises issues of child protection and to decide whether he should deal with that case or whether it should be more properly considered by the GTC. Paragraphs 1(4) and 1(5) of the new schedule allow for regulations to define the respective responsibilities of the GTC and the Secretary of State in more detail. Our primary concern in doing so will be to make absolutely sure that no case can ever slip between the cracks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para7"></a>Amendment No. 26 ensures that employers are to be required to report cases when someone has been dismissed on grounds of misconduct, incompetence or ill-health or where a person has resigned in circumstances where dismissal might have been considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para8"></a>We have accepted, as the noble Earl, Lord Baldwin, proposed, that the GTC should be able to strike teachers off the register for serious professional incompetence as well as unacceptable professional misconduct. That corresponds with the powers of most other professional bodies such as the General Medical Council. Those new powers for the GTC will not cut across the procedure agreed last year with the employers and the teaching unions for handling incompetence in teachers. That procedure which is now being implemented in schools provides for incompetent teachers to be removed from a classroom within two terms or, in extreme cases, within four weeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para9"></a>We intend that the GTC's role will only come into play only after the teacher has been dismissed or has resigned to avoid dismissal. The GTC will then consider the case and decide whether the incompetence demonstrated is so serious that it should be taken forward with a view to striking the teacher off the register or placing conditions on his or her practice as a teacher.
<P>


<a name="column_124"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para10"></a>Paragraphs 2 to 5 of the new schedule set out the range of sanctions which will be open to the council. They are similar to those available to other professional bodies. The council will have a graded range of sanctions for responding to misconduct or incompetence of differing severity. The schedule will allow the GTC to issue a reprimand; to attach conditions to a teacher's registration; to suspend that registration for a period of up to two years; or to strike a teacher off its register.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para11"></a>People aggrieved by a disciplinary decision of the GTC will have a right of appeal to the High Court, under paragraph 6 of the schedule. That is similar to the appeal mechanism for other professional bodies, including the GTC for Scotland where appeals are made to the Court of Session. I am advised that since the GTC for Scotland was established in 1966, there have been only two appeals, so we envisage therefore that the number of appeals will be small.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para12"></a>It is important that the GTC has open and transparent procedures for dealing with any disciplinary cases and paragraph 1 of the schedule allows such matters to be set out in regulations. Paragraph 7 of the schedule allows, among other incidental and supplementary provision, for employers to be bound by the council's disciplinary orders and for any order to have common currency across England and Wales, whether made by the GTC for England or the GTC for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para13"></a>Those powers will provide the GTC with a full and substantial role in regulating the teaching profession. Our approach was welcomed in the other place and, I believe, will be welcomed by teachers and the wider public. For the first time, teachers will take a major role in regulating their own profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para14"></a>Amendment No. 13 is also closely linked with the new schedule. We debated at earlier stages whether the council ought to have a statutory power or duty to issue a code of conduct or practice for registered teachers. We were not, at the time, convinced that we should legislate for this, but I believe it is now appropriate to do so given the GTC's enhanced disciplinary role. None the less, this will be an area where the Government and the council will wish to tread carefully as there is not necessarily a consensus within the profession that such a code would be a positive step. We shall watch progress with some interest north of the Border, where the GTC for Scotland has issued a draft code for consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 18 to 24 apply the same proposals to Wales. Child protection cases will continue to be determined by the Secretary of State or the national assembly, with professional misconduct and serious incompetence dealt with by the GTC for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 to 6 and 15 are consequential amendments which remove the wider powers accorded to the GTC by this House at Third Reading and reinstate the advisory role we envisage in these areas. Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 133 are all minor technical amendments linked to the GTC's new disciplinary powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para17"></a>Amendments Nos 7 to 10 clarify and tighten up the eligibility requirements for registration with the general teaching council. We have sought to ensure that, whenever a person is legally prevented from practising as a teacher, that should also render him or her ineligible for <P>


<a name="column_125"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>registration. In particular, we have now made ineligible any person barred from teaching under legislation governing independent schools; and made sure that any person de-registered by the GTCs for Scotland and Northern Ireland should not be eligible for registration in England or Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para18"></a>Amendment No. 17 removes the need for stamp duty to be paid if any assets are transferred from a GTC for England and Wales to a new GTC for Wales. This provision should not be needed, as my ministerial colleagues at the Welsh Office have announced that they intend to establish a GTC for Wales from the outset.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-04_para19"></a>The remaining amendments in this group are technical amendments. Amendments Nos. 25 and 134 introduce a single definition of employer/employment at the end of the Bill rather than having a number of repetitive references throughout the GTC clauses. Amendment No. 16 removes unnecessary wording, as it is clear that the GTC will be holding a register of teachers. I commend this group of amendments to the House.

<A NAME="80623-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 29. In doing so, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 31 to 42. The amendments in this group cover the length of the induction period, those schools which will be able to participate in the induction programme, the funding and appeal arrangements and the role of the local education authority in the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para1"></a>Amendment No. 29 makes clear that the induction period will last for three school terms. At earlier stages of the Bill we discussed the concept of the academic year. We envisage that for most teachers the period will run from the beginning of September until the end of July in the following year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para2"></a>Amendment No. 31 will enable us to specify the periods of employment which will count towards the induction period. This is designed to take account of individual circumstances, for example, where a new teacher is able only to gain temporary employment in the first instance, and as a consequence has to move between schools during the period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para3"></a>Amendment No. 31 will also give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to preclude a teacher from serving more than one induction period. There will be exceptions to this rule where either the appropriate body or the appeal body decides that a teacher should serve a further induction period. They would only make such a decision in circumstances where the evidence did not appear to support the head teacher's recommendation, or where procedures were not properly followed at the school.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para4"></a>Amendment No. 31 will also give the Secretary of State power to make regulations to preclude teachers from serving an induction period in certain categories of school. We intend this to preclude teachers from serving an induction period in failing schools and those in special measures. This follows up the undertaking which my honourable friend Mr. Stephen Byers made to members of the committee in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 34 and 36 confer on all inductees aggrieved by a decision on induction a right to appeal to the general teaching council, once it is established, and prior to that, a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. The detailed operation of the appeal arrangements will be prescribed in regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para6"></a>A number of the amendments in this group clarify the role and functions of the local education authority in the induction process and the range of decisions which the LEA may take at the end of the induction period. Amendment No. 35 will enable LEAs to make reasonable charges for services which they provide in respect of induction, in such circumstances as may be prescribed. We have in mind here that LEAs may charge independent schools for providing these services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para7"></a>Amendment No. 35 also spells out the arrangements which will apply when a teacher fails satisfactorily to complete an induction period and then submits an appeal. In such circumstances the regulations will require the employer of a teacher at a maintained school or a non-maintained special school to secure either the termination of his or her employment, or that he or she undertakes only such teaching duties as may be determined in accordance with the regulations. We intend to prescribe in regulations that teachers in such schools will only undertake a limited range of teaching duties pending appeal. In practice, this is likely to mean that they would undertake the sort of teaching duties that teaching assistants would undertake under the close supervision of a more experienced colleague. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the regulations will require the employer to secure the termination of the teacher's employment after a short period of notice. All of this is consistent with good employment practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are technical amendments designed to ensure that where a teacher continues to be employed at the same school, but is not undertaking his normal teaching duties there, his salary costs will not be met from the school's delegated budget, unless the LEA has good reason for deducting the costs from that budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para9"></a>Amendment No. 40 enables regulations to provide that any expenditure incurred by local education authorities for the purpose of implementing the induction programme will count as eligible expenditure for standards fund purposes. This will allow us to ring fence and target the money on those schools with new teachers, and will ensure the money is properly directed to where it is needed.

<A NAME="80623-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I did not notice Amendment No. 40 in that group but that may be due to a fault in the list that I have. I wish to discuss Amendment No. 31. The National Association of Head Teachers has expressed alarm--which I share--at this amendment. The association writes in a letter to me that there has been no consultation and hardly any debate on this amendment. The amendment was tabled at the last minute. I believe it includes a provision that regulations may preclude certain schools--which would be identified by the Minister--from being schools at which newly qualified teachers may serve their induction period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para11"></a>The NAHT was extremely disappointed that it was not consulted on this issue. It is also concerned at the practical implications that this measure will have for the staffing of schools, along with the reduction in the autonomy of head teachers and governing bodies. As the noble Lord is aware, and as the NAHT's letter states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is currently a recruitment crisis and shortage of teachers, particularly in certain subjects. School budgets remain tight ... and the reality is that in many cases newly qualified teachers are the keenest, if not the only ones willing, to take on the challenge of teaching in those schools that require a new way forward. Neither does the Government's amendment differentiate between those schools which remain subject to special measures but which have a new head teacher and other staff in place, and those in which the leadership and the rest of the teaching in the school remains in question. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If responsibility is to be delegated to heads, as indeed it should be, why cannot the decision be left to the head? He/she can decide whether the school can deal with the needs of a teacher in the induction period". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The letter also states that head teachers cannot,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"understand why a head teacher of a primary school, if he/she is fortunate enough to find a talented newly qualified teacher, who is keen to take on the challenge of teaching in a school subject to special measures, should be prohibited from doing so. Why should a head teacher of a secondary school be prevented from recruiting a talented newly qualified maths, physics, or any other subject teacher? Although the Government's argument may be that the amendment is designed to safeguard pupils from poor teaching, it needs to be recognised that it does not necessarily do so. It might actually have the opposite effect by prohibiting the appointment of more talented, although newly qualified staff, and by inhibiting the replacement of those teachers considered to be underperforming. Indeed, it would be dangerous to conclude that all, or even the vast majority of teaching in a special measures school, is poor". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para12"></a>As I have said, there has been no consultation with the very people this measure will affect. We believe that it will work against the best interests of a school that may be failing but wants to improve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   My Lords, I received exactly the same letter from the NAHT as the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. Like the noble Baroness, I share that association's concerns. It is not necessary for me also to read out the letter, but I endorse all that it says. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us and the association on this matter. If what is stated in the letter is correct, the association was not given the opportunity to comment during the consultative stages of the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para13"></a>I have one or two further comments. Amendment No. 31 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"precluding a person from serving more than one induction period except in any prescribed circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
What does the Minister have in mind with regard to the prescribed circumstances? I think all of us would accept that it would be far from the norm for someone to serve more than one induction period, but I can envisage occasions where that is appropriate, for example after someone has taken a long career break.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-06_para14"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 29. As the Minister quite rightly said, we have discussed previously the issue of what a school year comprises and how many terms it should include. I am slightly puzzled at this measure. I understood him to say that one school year is recognised as lasting from September to July. I believe that is what most of us in this country understand to be one school year. However, I understand the words "one school year" will be replaced by the words "three school terms". That provision has been introduced at a time when there is much public debate on whether a school year should consist of four or even five school terms. If the Government intend the period to last from September to July--which is what I understood the Minister to say--why are they now changing that to what might be interpreted as a rather shorter period?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, first I shall discuss the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. The head teachers' organisation may feel that it was not consulted between the time when the Commons amendment was tabled and returned to your Lordships' House. However, during a previous consultation period it was quite clear that the vast majority of people did not think that the induction period--or the probation period, as it used to be called--should be undertaken in failing schools. We have a duty to ensure that we do not place potentially vulnerable teachers in a school which is already failing. I take the noble Baroness's point that "under special measures" can include schools where measures have been taken to ensure that the leadership and the whole ethos of the school are changing. I understand her argument that in those circumstances perhaps we should take on new teachers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para0"></a>These provisions are not intended entirely to exclude that possibility. They would certainly exclude induction in schools that are determined to be failing. As to schools under special measures, the regulations may well prescribe certain exceptions. In general, schools under special measures have yet to prove themselves able to take on new teachers and provide sufficient support for them in addition to the other problems that they face in terms of turning the school round in total, however good the new school leadership may be and however effective are the other measures being introduced. In general, we wish to protect the position of new teachers and not place them in schools that are under special measures or in failing schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, raised questions in relation to prescribed circumstances. Regarding a second induction term, I indicated that there would be circumstances where either the local education authority, <P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as in most cases, or an appeals body following an appeal would consider that a head teacher's decision did not entirely justify the failure of the induction period. In that case a further period of induction could be provided. There would be other circumstances--possibly where there was a break and the three terms had not been consecutive either as a result of illness or because there was no permanent position--where the induction period would possibly be extended or an additional induction period would be most appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para2"></a>I confess that the noble Lord has something of a point in relation to four school terms. Nevertheless, a school year is defined in any case as 12 months. Therefore, were a particular school to adopt a new pattern, appropriate changes would be acceptable under this legislation. In general, as the noble Lord recognises, three school terms is the definition of what is effectively accepted as an academic year in every school as at present. The change has not been made to allow for four or more terms to be a normal undertaking in our schools. Three school terms is the easiest way of describing more exactly what we mean by an academic year since it is capable of several different interpretations. The education year is a 12-month period and would relate to a three-term academic year. That seemed to us the best definition of the period of induction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I am grateful to him for his concession to my noble friend Lord Tope. However, is he aware that in trying to define an academic year both by calendar month and length of term he risks running into the same difficulty as occurs at the beginning of St. Luke's Gospel? It dates a matter by four different events, which are now widely believed to have all happened in different years?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I bow to the noble Earl's non-religious scriptural knowledge. I greatly admire it. However, in this case matters are consistent. The three terms have to take place within a 12-month period, which would normally be taken to describe an academic year. I am not sure that I actually went as far as making a concession to the noble Lord, Lord Tope. I accepted that he had a good point. The aim is quite clear. We all agreed during earlier stages of the Bill that the academic year is what we meant and that in general circumstances three terms describe that period. That is the sensible period for an induction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, from my experience in this House being told that I have a good point constitutes a major victory. I do not want to make a big issue out of this. I merely continue to be confused. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that I am right. I believe it will be possible, for instance, under the education action zones that are to be set up for the governing bodies of schools, if they so choose, to move to, say, a five-term academic year. As I understand it, they would be free to do so. That may well become the norm. I do not wish to discuss today whether that is desirable. But if and when it happens, shall we not have to amend this Bill? I simply do not understand why we are passing <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an amendment that would seem to make the position less clear than the reference to one school year, or an academic year if preferred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the amendment will alter the terms of the Bill from, "not less than one year", to, "not less than three terms". Although that may not be entirely clear from the amendment, that is its effect. Were there to be a change in particular schools to four or five terms, no doubt they could adapt and remain within this legislation. We are talking about a normal academic year, presently defined in normal practice as three terms. I think that "not less than three terms" would meet the noble Lord's concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful for that clarification that a four- or five-term year would be acceptable and legal within the terms of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para3"></a>Perhaps I may return to the noble Lord's response to the concerns of the National Association of Head Teachers. The noble Lord's defence was that the majority of people who took part in the previous consultation, which did not include this particular point, had said that they would not wish young teachers to have a probationary year in such a school.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para4"></a>The National Association of Head Teachers represents a very large proportion of head teachers in this country. They are the people who will be in the front line managing induction programmes for new young teachers. They are in the best position to make that judgment. It seems unfortunate that the noble Lord is not prepared to take into account in drawing up the regulations the powerful points that they have made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para5"></a>When a school is failing, it is not necessarily failing in every department. If there is a shortage of teachers in a subject such as maths, science, technology or languages, and a very bright, talented person with good credentials comes along who could enhance the school and help it to reform, should not an opportunity be given? That should happen so long as, first, the head teacher has control as to whether it is appropriate that the school should offer an induction period. Secondly, as there is a right of appeal for the person undertaking the induction programme to appeal against its quality, it seems to me that all the safeguards are already built in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I accept that the National Association of Head Teachers has a broad-based membership and we are right to take account of its concerns. However, the Government's concern must be that we would not wish to place any newly qualified teacher, however bright or dedicated, and however rare his or her speciality, in a situation where in a different context a school had been designated as failing. That would mean a managerial failure in the school. To place the mentoring and induction of a new teacher, or a series of new teachers, into that context would add to the problems of turning that school round.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para6"></a>I accepted that there might be particular circumstances in which a school that had clearly turned the corner might be in a different situation. In general, schools which are <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>still deemed to be failing schools or which are under special measures would not be an appropriate environment for newly qualified teachers. That would divert managerial effort from the fundamental turn-around required in those schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-07_para7"></a>We note the concern. However, we feel that the interests of new teachers, and therefore the long-term interests of the teaching profession and the quality of education, require us to try to find places for newly qualified teachers in schools that are not in that category.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para23"></a>This is a fairly large group of amendments, all of which relate to the new student support arrangements which we shall be introducing in the coming autumn term. The amendments do not deal with the principles and substance of those new arrangements; we look <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forward to the opportunity to debate that aspect when we come to Amendments Nos. 64 and 123 a little later on. The amendments in this group relate purely to the way in which the new arrangements will be administered and to a handful of relatively minor technical issues. I shall deal briefly with the technical amendments first.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para24"></a>First, Amendment No. 48 will enable the Secretary of State to designate courses at private institutions as eligible for support through administrative act rather than regulations, as now. Secondly, Amendment No. 49 will ensure that where payment of a grant or loan is discretionary--for example, in the case of hardship loans--the body responsible for determining entitlement can exercise a broad discretion rather than having to adhere to detailed criteria laid down in regulations. Thirdly, Amendment No. 112 will enable the regulations governing the student loans scheme in Scotland to deal appropriately with borrowers who are declared bankrupt or are sequestrated. Finally, Amendments Nos. 115 and 117 are minor drafting amendments which simply tidy up the wording of the Bill. All of these amendments are purely technical.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para25"></a>I turn now to the more substantive amendments, most of which have equivalent amendments for Scotland. In this context, the group of amendments is larger than it might otherwise be because of having to repeat the arrangements for Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para26"></a>Amendment No. 67 and Amendment No. 93 relating to Scotland clarify the Secretary of State's powers to transfer and delegate the powers given to him in respect of student support. They replace and improve upon the provisions already made in the Bill. Members of your Lordships' House will note that the Bill makes provision for the Secretary of State alone to make grants or loans to students. This is different from the current student support legislation, which gives the Secretary of State powers to make arrangements for the making and collection of loans and, in England and Wales, places duties on LEAs in respect of mandatory and discretionary awards. A variety of bodies will be involved in the administration of the new loans scheme, including local education authorities, higher education institutions, the Student Loans Company and the Inland Revenue. Amendments Nos. 67 and 93 accordingly provide for these bodies to exercise powers instead of, or on behalf of, the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para27"></a>In particular, these new provisions allow functions to be transferred to local education authorities and higher education institutions, which, as independent bodies, already have distinct responsibilities for administering aspects of the existing awards and loan schemes. Functions will not be transferred to other bodies but delegated. This means that the Secretary of State will retain overall responsibility for those functions and will himself be subject to judicial review. We believe that this is more appropriate in the case of a body such as the Student Loans Company, which is wholly owned by two Secretaries of State, or the Inland Revenue, which will be collecting loan repayments on the Secretary of State's behalf.
<P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para28"></a>The new provisions also enable the Secretary of State to establish an appeals procedure in respect of functions which are transferred or delegated. We are considering the details of the appeals mechanism, but I am happy to repeat the undertaking that my honourable friend made in another place that a right of appeal will be put in place in relation to the collection of student loans.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para29"></a>These two amendments also provide for the Secretary of State to make payments to bodies to which functions are transferred or delegated or which are appointed to hear appeals, either to meet the costs of making grants or loans or as payment for administering the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para30"></a>Amendments Nos. 56 and 98 delete the references to government departments in Clauses 19 and 24 of the Bill. References to government departments are superfluous in this context since they would anyway be covered by the references to "other persons or bodies". More importantly, we do not envisage that the regulation-making power in Clause 19(5) and the equivalent Scottish provision will be used to place duties on government departments--in practice, the Inland Revenue. Instead, the relevant functions will be delegated to the Revenue using the powers which I have just described. This will mean that the Secretary of State remains ultimately accountable for the actions of the Revenue in relation to loan collection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para31"></a>Amendments Nos. 92, 94, 113, 116, 144 and 145 also relate to transfer and delegation and are consequential on the previous two groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para32"></a>The next substantive group is Amendments Nos. 69 and 70, which are necessary to ensure that the existing administrative arrangements can be adapted to accommodate changes in the pattern of student support. Our proposals to replace grants with loans and to introduce means tested support for fees have implications for those bodies which are currently involved in managing the system. As I have already mentioned, in England and Wales this means LEAs, the Student Loans Company and also a small central unit within the Department for Education and Employment. In Scotland student support is administered by the Student Loans Company and the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-08_para33"></a>We shall need to consider how functions should be allocated between these bodies in the most efficient way in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. For example, it is possible that as time goes on, the central unit, which was established mainly to administer means testing arrangements for EU students, might take on other responsibilities. The Bill in its previous form provided for existing student support functions to be transferred, but only in association with the repeal of the existing student support legislation. Given that we intend to repeal the existing legislation this year--albeit with savings provisions--these amendments are necessary to allow functions to be transferred at different times in the future as the regime changes. Amendment No. 71 deletes the existing provisions which Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 replace. Amendments Nos. 95 and 114 make similar provision for Scotland, while reflecting the different administrative arrangements that already exist there to which I have already referred.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para5"></a>The amendments we have just discussed related to the payment of loans; the ones we are now discussing relate to the repayment. We will be introducing the arrangements from 1998-99 onwards. The arrangements have been widely welcomed as fair and progressive and a great improvement on the current mortgage-style system. Indeed, repayment through the Inland Revenue <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was subject to widespread support at earlier stages within this House and no less than the noble Lord, Lord Baker, was generous enough to congratulate the Government on succeeding where he had failed in persuading the Inland Revenue and the Chancellor of the day to take on the task of collecting loan repayments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para6"></a>Repayment of loans through the Inland Revenue has been widely welcomed in all parts of this Chamber. However, there are inevitably problems of repaying through the Inland Revenue. This agreement was reached at a fairly late stage of the proceedings in your Lordships' House and the changes, introduced in another place, try to put flesh on the bones of repayment via the Inland Revenue system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para7"></a>While income-contingent repayments through the tax system will be fairer and more straightforward for borrowers, the mechanics will in some respects be quite complex. As the details of the system have been worked up in consultation with the Inland Revenue, the Student Loans Company and others, it has become apparent that the Bill needed to be amended in various ways. I should stress that none of these amendments affects the principles of income-contingency to which we are committed, but they are about the technicalities of putting those principles into practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para8"></a>Amendment No. 50, and Amendment No. 109 in relation to Scotland, will mean that the terms and conditions relating to the repayment of loans will not be fixed immutably when the loans are first made. Instead, the provisions governing repayment will be set out in annual regulations which will apply to all loans that are outstanding. This is necessary to enable the collection arrangements to be modified from time to time to take account, for instance, of any changes in the operation of the tax system on which those arrangements depend. For example, if the scope of self-assessment was broadened to encompass taxpayers who are currently outside it, revised repayment arrangements would need to be made for those borrowers affected, and those would need to be reflected in the regulations. We would also, of course, expect to raise the repayment threshold over time, for example, to reflect changes in average earnings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para9"></a>Noble Lords will wish to be aware that it is our intention that the detailed repayment arrangements for loans made this autumn will not be contained in the 1998 loan regulations. Loans will not fall to be collected on an income contingent basis until April 2000 at the earliest and for a relatively small number of students, and the repayment arrangements will be set out fully in the regulations applying at that time, which we expect will be published early in 1999. That will give us time to ensure that the regulations fully reflect the detailed technical work being carried out by the Inland Revenue and Student Loans Company in designing the new administrative arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para10"></a>This does not mean that students will not know the terms on which they will be taking out loans this autumn. We have already publicised the key elements of the repayment terms widely, and will be publishing <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a more detailed guide later this summer which will give students all the information they need to know before applying for their loans. We have given careful thought to the best way of getting this important information to students and concluded that a layman's guide, written in plain English and widely disseminated, is of much more use to students than regulations which, by their very nature, tend to be difficult to understand and will contain much material which is irrelevant to students. The regulations will of course be in place well before the first students are actually due to make repayments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para11"></a>Amendment No. 51 serves a number of purposes. First, along with Amendments Nos. 62 and 105 in relation to Scotland, it allows for a relationship to be established between the student support provisions of this Bill and other legislation governing deductions from income. The amendments will permit other legislation to be amended accordingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para12"></a>These amendments are necessary to take account of the fact that students and graduates may be subject to other deductions from their income. For example, a court might impose an attachment of earnings order. At the same time, there is a limit on the total amount that employers may deduct from an employee's income. This is the "protected earnings rate", and is designed to ensure that the employee is left with enough to live on. Where the total deductions payable exceed that limit, it is obviously necessary to determine which should take priority. These amendments enable provision to be made in regulations for determining the priority in these limited circumstances as between student loan repayments and other amounts due from borrowers, via their pay packets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para13"></a>Our decision to arrange for student loan repayments to be deducted at source through the tax system, as recommended by the Dearing Committee, will inevitably have an impact on other legislation governing deductions from income. These amendments would accordingly permit other legislation to be amended, through regulations, to take account of the impact of loan repayments. At the same time, these amendments would allow income from student loans or grants to be taken into account when calculating a person's total income for the purpose of making some other deduction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para14"></a>Amendment No. 51, along with Amendment No. 96 for Scotland, would allow payments of hardship loans to students to be made by higher education institutions rather than the Student Loans Company. My honourable friend made clear when this amendment was debated in Committee in another place that no decision had at that point been taken about the appropriate method of payment of these loans. In the event, we have now decided that the payments should be made by the SLC at least in the first year. However, this amendment leaves open the possibility of taking a different approach in the future if experience suggests that that would be desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para15"></a>Amendment No. 51, along with Amendment No. 111 for Scotland, will have the effect of enabling the Secretary of State to put in place appeals mechanisms where functions have not been transferred or delegated under the new provisions which we will be discussing <P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>later but are imposed under regulations; for example, where they are undertaken by employers. I hope Members of your Lordships' House will agree that these provisions offer borrowers full protection against any potential maladministration of the scheme by whoever it might be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 54, 55, 65 and 108 put a cap on the maximum rate of interest that may be charged on loans. Members of your Lordships' House will be aware that we have already made explicit provision in the Bill to ensure that the rate of interest charged will be no more than is necessary to maintain the value of loans in real terms. This will be achieved by linking the interest rate to the RPI. These amendments leave that provision in place. I can therefore give an absolute assurance to the House that no borrower will have to repay, in real terms, any more than he or she borrowed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para17"></a>It is necessary, however, to make this small technical change to the Bill to ensure that, in addition, the interest rate remains below the level specified for exemption from regulations under the Consumer Credit Act. It is an established principle--reflected in the EC directive--that loans which have low interest rates and are not available to the general public should be exempt from the consumer credit provisions which govern other kinds of loans. It is clear that the new income-contingent loans meet those general requirements. The interest rate is well below normal commercial rates and eligibility is circumscribed by regulations. However, because the general criteria for exemption are described in terms of a relationship to bank base rates rather than the RPI, there is a relatively low risk that at some point in the future the interest rate on student loans might for brief periods exceed the specified limit for exemption.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para18"></a>This amendment will remove that risk by providing that the interest rate, while generally tracking the RPI, cannot at any point rise higher than the limit set out in the Consumer Credit (Exempt Agreements) Order. I trust that noble Lords are clear about this. The effect is that borrowers will pay interest either at the level of the RPI or at the level specified in the exempt agreements order if that is lower. There is therefore no question of the interest rate rising above the RPI.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para19"></a>Amendments Nos. 52 and 107 for Scotland deal with a different kind of interest provision. They will allow the Secretary of State to pay interest on refunds of loan repayments in the event that borrowers overpay. The Bill must provide for borrowers to be compensated in this way if overpayments have been significant. The details of the circumstances in which interest would be payable will be set out in regulations in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para20"></a>Amendments Nos. 60 and 102 ensure that provision can be made for the imposition of penalties on borrowers, or those persons required to make deductions from borrowers' pay, in the event of default. These amendments provide for the imposition of interest and penalties on borrowers who fail to make repayments which are due or provide information when required to do so. They also provide the means to impose penalties on those charged with making deductions from the borrower's salary where they wilfully or negligently fail to carry out those obligations. It is necessary to have the power to recover public money which might be lost <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a result of wilful default. These provisions will have no effect on those employers and borrowers who meet their obligations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para21"></a>The precise penalties which apply will be set out in regulations, but we envisage that they will not exceed those which apply in the event of non-payment of income tax or national insurance contributions. For employers, this might mean the imposition of a penalty in the event that they failed to make deductions from the borrower's salary or to transmit payments to the Inland Revenue. For borrowers, interest would be charged on any outstanding repayments, and in the event of persistent default further surcharges might be applied on which interest would also be charged. I should stress that the charging of interest is not intended to be punitive but is necessary to cover the losses to public funds. Similarly, any penalties are intended to be no higher than is necessary to discourage the sorts of wilful or negligent default I have described.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 68 and 118 for Scotland provide for the Inland Revenue to disclose information to the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and for Scotland, to the Department for Education for Northern Ireland and, by extension, to bodies to which functions are transferred or delegated under this Bill. In practice, this will allow the Inland Revenue to disclose information to the Student Loans Company to which the Secretary of State's functions in relation to loan repayments will be delegated. For example, the Inland Revenue will be able to provide details of repayments made via employers to enable the Student Loans Company to update borrowers' accounts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para23"></a>These amendments are necessary to allow the Inland Revenue's legal duty of confidentiality to the taxpayer to be set aside in the specific case of information required for the collection of loan repayments. Without it, it would be impossible to collect repayments through the tax system. I hasten to add that the normal requirements of the Data Protection Act will continue to apply in respect of any information which is disclosed under this provision. There is thus no question of general details of a borrower's tax affairs being disclosed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para24"></a>Finally, this group includes a number of purely technical amendments. Amendments Nos. 53 and 110 for Scotland improve the wording of the Bill to reflect the fact that there will be no deferment, as such, under the new arrangements. Borrowers will not become liable to repay until their income reaches the &#163;10,000 threshold. Amendments Nos. 57, 61, 63, 99, 104 and 106 bring the wording of the Bill into line with the relevant tax legislation and define "employer" for the purposes of this part of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 58 and 100 extend the duty to keep and produce records to persons or bodies other than employers, while Amendments Nos. 59 and 101 make the requirements on borrowers in this respect consistent with those placed on employers. Finally, Amendments Nos. 97 and 103 are purely drafting amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para25"></a>Taken together these amendments will ensure the smooth operation of the new student support repayment arrangements while providing additional protection for borrowers and for the taxpayer.

<A NAME="80623-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister said, many of us agree with the principle that students should have loans to help with their costs when they are at university. As the Minister also said, many of us welcome the fact that repayments will be made through the tax system. However, that is where we on these Benches begin to part company with the Government. The explanation we have heard from the Minister shows exactly why we are concerned. The concerns that we had at earlier stages of the Bill still remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para27"></a>Our prime concern is about the haste with which this is happening and the problems that that will give the Government--and most of all the problems that that will give the students when they have to deal with these arrangements. When they begin to take out loans they will not really know what they are taking on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para28"></a>The Minister gave an explanation of what he thinks students will require to know before they take out the loan. But I think that we will be setting an incredibly bad example to our young people if we expect them to enter into this type of agreement when they do not know exactly how it will work out. No one in his right mind takes out a loan without assuming that he has some kind of legal agreement. We are all free to decide whether we read the small print; but at the end of the day there is a legal agreement which we have signed. What status will any agreement that students enter into have if the regulations have not properly been laid before us and if some of the facts are not written down? I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us on that point. It has been said that the students will be given only what they need to know. I suggest that if one enters into a legal agreement, one needs to have the lot, whether or not one bothers to read it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para29"></a>No one wants to be held up very much today but we on these Benches want to make it clear that we are not at all happy with what is proposed. If the Government had waited another year before introducing this system it would have been a good deal easier for people all round. It is difficult for students to find out what is happening, but it is even more difficult for local authorities dealing with their queries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-09_para30"></a>Perhaps I may conclude by illustrating why I think next year will be a bad year. We may have three sets of regulations in operation at the same time. We have been told that the regulations for the repayment of loans are not expected until early 1999; there are regulations for the transition year, which were published three weeks ago; and there is already a scheme up and running. There are three different systems all running at the same time. That illustrates the haste with which the Government are proceeding. I think that they will repent in haste. But worst of all, I feel sorry for the students on the end of this and what may happen to them in the future.

<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the land are very concerned about what is happening. Contrary to what the Minister has continued to say, that the students know what is going on, they do not. Some of us met students only today in this House. They do not know what is going on. I received a letter recently from the noble Baroness about the delay in introducing regulations. That is inexcusable, but it is no more than was predicted on these Benches and on the Liberal Benches at the beginning of the proceedings on the Bill. We said that this was being done too quickly and that the Government should wait one more year to put everything in place in an orderly way so that all those who were affected by the measures in the Bill not only understood them but had a proper legal underpinning for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, what my noble friend said about issuing guidelines for students is probably necessary for everybody. Needless confusion has been created about the simplest loan system there is. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said that there are three regimes being followed and that there is confusion. But every year there are three cohorts of students going to college and they are different. Therefore, no one has to know all three systems. The students know that. I am a great devotee of the income contingent loan system. The beauty of it, once it is made clear, is that it is not like a mortgage or hire purchase. It is flexible, but one has to write down all the rules. Once that message has been put across, perhaps more to local authorities, teachers and politicians rather than to students, then it will be clear that we are adopting one of the easiest systems to cope with. The existing student loan system is much more stringent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-10_para0"></a>What my noble friend and the Commons amendments are doing is to make the system much more transparent and not only user friendly, but friendly also to the tax authorities. Therefore, we should welcome the scheme. When the system is seen in operation there is no confusion. The income contingent loan is the easiest thing to explain. I hope that my noble friend will take up this idea. Perhaps we should have a one-sheet A4 explanation or maybe 10 or more sheets, if necessary. It is a very simple idea. The beauty of the idea has not been conveyed properly to people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for my noble friend's intervention. His first point is absolutely right. There are always three systems in operation even when moving from one system to another. That is no different from other circumstances. Repayments under the scheme will not start until April 2000 and even then it will apply to a limited number of students. As I said at an earlier stage of this amendment or as regards a previous group of amendments, we intend to spell out in clear English what the students' entitlements are and what the repayment system will be. It is in that form, rather than through regulations, that students will come to understand the system, if they do not know it already.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-10_para1"></a>I do not believe that we can move from one system, which was not providing sufficient resources for universities, to another without moving through the <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three stages of changing the regulations governing them. I believe that there was universal support for both income contingent repayment and repayments through the Inland Revenue system. All who come into the salaried or other income brackets will have a whole range of tax regulations which they may or may not fully understand but which they will have to comply with.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-10_para2"></a>The Inland Revenue provisions are the simplest way of making repayments. I believe that that is generally accepted. However, tax regimes alter from time to time. There are mistakes under that system both by the payers and the administration itself. They have to be rectified. All the amendments do is allow regulations to be changed when there are changes in the tax regime or something impacts on it. There is provision for compensation or penalties when the system does not work properly and mistakes are made, deliberately or otherwise. That applies in all Inland Revenue collection systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-10_para3"></a>We are not inventing a new principle here but simply applying the best method of loan recoupment through the Inland Revenue to the new system. I believe that in practice graduates will find this system a much easier method of repayment than almost any form of loan repayment that existed under the previous regime. I make no apology for the fact that we have to tailor the scheme to the Inland Revenue system. I make no substantive apology for the fact that it has come somewhat late. That was because agreement had not been reached among government departments when the Bill first appeared in this House. At the point we announced that in principle we were going to pay through the Inland Revenue, everyone agreed that that was a good method. These are the consequences, and I believe we should accept them.

<P>

<A NAME="80623-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the system count against the PSBR?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, do the loans apply against the PSBR? The noble Baroness will have to wait until there is a further announcement in that regard. Clearly, administrative costs are part of public expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, not the administration costs, but the loans themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty:  </B>   They do at the moment. As your Lordships will know, the whole question of public sector accounting is now subject to discussion. There may be changes and I cannot pre-empt them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that expenditure on student maintenance is public expenditure? Even the Opposition must remember that from a year ago. It counts on that side of the balance sheet. In due course, when the loans are gradually repaid, they will count on the revenue side of the balance sheet and that will lower the PSBR. Perhaps the noble Baroness will agree with me that we should recast our public sector accounts so that none of this expenditure gets into the PSBR. When one argued that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Government, somewhat artfully, linked two issues in one amendment. This House had completely separate debates. They are completely separate issues. One is to do with maintenance and the other is to do with equal treatment throughout the United Kingdom and is related to tuition fees. By linking the two together we have had to burn quite a lot of midnight oil during the course of the week to be advised on how to deal with them technically. We have been successful. Therefore I shall be speaking to the maintenance section of Amendment No. 64.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para9"></a>I invite the House to ask the Government a second time to reconsider their proposals on student finance. The grounds on which I take this very serious step are justice and fairness. Put simply, the Government have introduced proposals which will result in students from lower income families leaving college and/or university with a greater burden of debt than students from more affluent families. There can be no justification whatever for such unfairness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para10"></a>The Government say in defence of such unfairness that the tuition fees are means tested and that some students will not be required to pay them at all. That argument was put by Ministers both in this House and in another place, and even by the Prime Minister himself. It misses completely the point about student finance. As far as the student is concerned, he or she will have to borrow for tuition fees, where that is appropriate, and for the maintenance grant. For students from low income families the maintenance grant is by far the greater sum. So students from low income families must borrow the whole of their maintenance costs and students from more affluent families are asked to borrow only half.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para11"></a>At no time during debates in this House or in the other place, has a single Minister, including the Prime Minister himself, produced a credible defence for such an injustice to students from low income families.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para12"></a>The response of the Government to the Dearing Committee was issued ahead of the publication of that report; it was leaked in detail the weekend before its publication. Therefore, the Government had made up their mind. It was a Treasury-led decision, and certainly Mr. Brown was in the driving seat at that time. For the purposes of my amendment I should like to refer the Government to paragraphs 103 and 108 of the report:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"103. The widespread view in evidence was that an additional contribution from graduates should be sought by converting the existing support for student living costs from 50:50 grants and loans ... We [the Dearing Committee] looked carefully at this option". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"108. We would be particularly reluctant to see any reduction in public subsidies being concentrated on students from the poorest families and even more reluctant to see the funding released by this, and more, being used to increase the subsidies for others". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para13"></a>The Government have been extremely reluctant to guarantee that moneys raised and/or saved at the expense of higher education students will benefit higher education in particular in real terms; that is, not simply held by the higher education institutions, which we understand will be the case, but that such moneys should not displace funds from the state. That has not been agreed. Any moneys raised at the expense of higher <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>education students and spent on any other part of the education service, even on further education, represents a tax on those students.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it may be helpful if I speak straightaway and set out the Government's position. With the leave of the House, I should be grateful for the opportunity to speak again at the end of the debate to respond to any further points that are made. I have listened very carefully to the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. She starts from the position that there should be equal access to higher education for students from all backgrounds, in particular those from lower income groups. That is a position to which the Government are absolutely committed. Indeed, our proposals are built on the principle that access to higher education should not depend upon ability to pay. Moreover, we have announced a range of measures that specifically target support for those students who need the most help. I shall say more about that later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para15"></a>The noble Baroness seeks to make capital out of the fact that our proposals for student support are different from the preferred option of the Dearing Committee. I am not ashamed to acknowledge that they are different even though they arise from the same objective as securing access and equity. On a number of occasions during earlier debates on the Bill I have spoken about the thinking behind the proposals and why they differ from the preferred option of the Dearing Committee. In particular, I have explained that we believe it is right to provide support in the form of grants for fees to those who need them rather than require all students to pay those fees. I have also explained how this, combined with our system of income-contingent loans, will ensure that the largest public subsidies go to students from the poorest backgrounds. I pointed out that our proposals would generate considerably more resources for reinvestment in further and higher education than the previous government were prepared to put into them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para16"></a>I could go on. However, rather than engage in a narrow debate about comparative funding options I should like to return to the real issue of how best to secure participation in high quality higher education by students from all socio-economic backgrounds, particularly those groups that are currently under-represented. In doing so, I hope that we can at least agree upon the facts rather than engage in speculation. There is a wealth of evidence to show that participation by lower social groups in higher education remains poor but that, crucially, this cannot be put down to finance. The reasons why students enter higher <P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>education are much more diverse and complex than that. I believe that to suggest otherwise does students from low income backgrounds a great disservice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para17"></a>The facts indicate, nevertheless, that there is one fundamental factor which determines whether young people are likely to enter higher education. Quite simply, they are more likely to go to university if they have the school qualifications that universities demand. Yet survey after survey shows that students from lower income backgrounds either do not get the opportunity to study for those qualifications or are unsuccessful in exploiting them. It is in this respect that students from lower income backgrounds are disadvantaged and why they are not entering higher education in the numbers that we wish to see. We are determined to put that right and we shall do so by developing a school system aimed at securing progression for all who have the ability and by raising standards, expectations and achievements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para18"></a>We have already brought forward measures in the School Standards and Framework Bill to promote excellence in schools. These measures will give students from lower income backgrounds the chance to get the grades that they need in order to enter a university. We hope that they will also help to create a learning culture in which higher education is not seen as the privilege of the better-off few. Although there are more important factors influencing access to and participation in higher education, I do not deny that student support has its part to play, but it would be helpful if we considered the facts about the impact of grants and loans on access.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para19"></a>Noble Lords opposite are unhappy that we propose to replace maintenance grants with a fair and progressive system of income-contingent loans. I might share their concerns if I thought that grants promoted access or loans hindered it. But, as I have pointed out already, in the five years before loans were introduced, when students still received support from grant alone, participation among students from lower income backgrounds rose by only two percentage points. Between 1990 and 1995--during which time loans were introduced and the proportion of support available through loans increased--the rise was much greater: it was over seven percentage points. This shows that students from less advantaged backgrounds were not deterred from entering higher education by the flawed loan scheme introduced in 1990. There is all the more reason to believe that they will not be put off by the much fairer loans that we shall make available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para20"></a>Noble Lords opposite may wish to consider the latest figures which show that home applications for places in higher education this autumn from under 21 year-olds are nearly 1 per cent. up on last year. The position in respect of those aged 21 and over is also improving. Overall, home figures are about 2 per cent. down on 1997. This is hardly surprising given the increase in students entering in that year. Nor is there any evidence from the University and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS) that potential applicants from lower income families have been deterred by our proposals. On the contrary, application levels appear to be holding across all social classes. This suggests that students understand that the Government's proposals will give them access to the resources that they need and that they will not be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>expected to contribute more up front to the cost of their education than they would under the current system. Furthermore, it suggests that they recognise that the income-contingent loan repayment arrangements that we are introducing will be both fair and progressive. The level of repayments that graduates will be expected to make will be directly linked to their incomes. Graduates who earn less than &#163;10,000 will repay nothing at all, and over time the total amount that graduates repay will be no more in real terms than they borrowed as students.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-11_para21"></a>Members of your Lordships' House, in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and Members of another place have suggested that the poorer students will end up with the largest debt. As I have sought to make clear on previous occasions, under the new arrangements less well-off students will get the most support towards their fees and living costs. The noble Baroness is laughing; I am not sure why. I cannot believe that any Member of your Lordships' House will take issue with that; it is a fact. No doubt noble Lords will argue that that is fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I was amused because what is there in the system, what is there in the proposals and what is there in the Bill that makes up for the 50 per cent. maintenance grant that the poorer students have to borrow that the more affluent students do not have to borrow?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I was just about to complete what I was saying about the poorer students ending up with the largest debts. I can make an immediate reply to the noble Baroness as to what does make it up. They will have a loan scheme which is income contingent and fairer and which they can pay back according to their income rather than the loan scheme which existed under the previous government that required them, regardless of income, to pay back all that they owed within five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para0"></a>I shall return to one of the basic principles underlying our proposals. It is one that I have heard no noble Lord dispute. It is that graduates, as the clear main beneficiaries of higher education, should make a larger contribution to its costs. That was a Dearing principle that we accepted and to which we are adhering. It is wrong to see the fairness of the student loan arrangements just in terms of the size of the debt. As I have just said, the fairness of the student loan arrangements lies in two things: the availability of support and cash for living costs for those who need it most and whose access to higher education might otherwise be hindered. It is the making of fair terms for the repaying of those loans based on the ability to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para1"></a>As I have just said, students will not repay their support on the basis of their current position but on the basis of their future earnings. Students will repay their loans as earning graduates, not as school-leavers from poor backgrounds. In most cases graduates will repay their loans over a longer period than they would, as I said, under the current arrangements. I am sorry to reiterate this, but it is important that noble Lords understand that. Students from less well off backgrounds who take out the full loan available will be eligible to <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>receive the largest public subsidy over time. That subsidy is of course additional to the support that they will receive towards the cost of their tuition, which is considerable, because that group of students will not be making a contribution towards their tuition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para2"></a>I hope that I have been able to reassure Members of your Lordships' House of the Government's commitment to securing wider participation in higher education. I hope also that noble Lords will reflect upon the evidence that I cited. I have not yet mentioned the specific steps that we announced to target support on those students experiencing the greatest need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para3"></a>I should like to take the opportunity to remind noble Lords again that students from lower income backgrounds--that is, about 30 per cent. of the total--whose parental income is to be taken into account will not be required to contribute towards the costs of their tuition. Many students from middle income backgrounds will also receive help towards their fees. We have pumped more money into the access funds. We have broadened the eligibility to include part-time students. That is an important broadening of eligibility. We are also making available an additional &#163;250 loan for those students in particular hardship. We have ended the means testing of the disabled students' allowance. We are retaining supplementary allowances for students with dependants and those who are lone parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para4"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in another place on 8th June that we will be extending loans for students aged under 55 at the start of their courses from the academic year 1999-2000. That will help the development of our policy on lifelong learning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para5"></a>We are not complacent. We shall continue to monitor closely the pattern of applications and entry to higher education among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. That is obviously important. My department has also commissioned regular surveys of student income and expenditure. We shall look carefully at the impact of our proposals on student finances once they have fully taken effect. On the basis of all the evidence available, and taking into account the specific measures that I have outlined, I am confident that our proposals will secure improved access to higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para6"></a>Finally, I should like to remind the House that the replacement of maintenance grants by a system of income-contingent loans was a manifesto commitment. The amendments we are debating overturn amendments made during our earlier debates on the Bill which would prevent the Government from carrying out that commitment. I hope therefore that the House will abide by the Salisbury Convention and will not seek to reinstate the amendments.

<A NAME="80623-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for intervening early in this debate. I am not sure that all noble Lords agreed with what she said, but it was helpful that she said it. Perhaps I may correct her on one point. She referred on a number of occasions to <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"noble Lords opposite". There are at least two groups of noble Lords opposite. I hope that she and her Front Bench colleagues might distinguish occasionally between the two different groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para7"></a>On a more serious point, we are all concerned about the position of students, or potential students, from low income families going to university. I have no doubt that fear, whether real or perceived, of debt is an inhibiting factor. It may be more of an inhibiting factor for students from low income families who may be more used to and more ridden by debt. The real concern--the Minister referred to this--is that many people from low income families never seriously consider becoming university students. They are given no expectations at school. They almost certainly do not obtain the necessary qualifications through the school system even to consider whether to have a student loan or whether to go to university. That is an issue which may be outside the realm of this debate, but it is an issue of greater concern to us all than the worry about debt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para8"></a>We have debated this issue in your Lordships' House many times during the Bill's progress. I do not need to prolong the matter. I shall merely restate briefly the position of these Opposition Benches on this issue. We are concerned to maintain and increase the numbers in higher education. We are at least as concerned to maintain and improve the quality of higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para9"></a>We are, on principle, opposed to the student payment of tuition fees. I have rehearsed that argument many times in your Lordships' House, and do not need to do so again today. If additional funding has to come into higher education, and it does, then with some degree of reluctance we have had to accept that the maintenance grant must go. It is important therefore that it is replaced by a system of loans with a fair repayment process--an income-contingent repayment system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para10"></a>Here again I agree with the Minister that the system that we support is one that will be based not on the prospective student's family's income or position but on the earning capacity of that student when he or she becomes a graduate and, it is hoped, will have a higher earning capacity. That is an important difference. We are talking about the income of the family at the start of the process. We are talking about the income of the graduate as he or she progresses in his or her career.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para11"></a>That is our position. It has been our position throughout. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is fully aware of it. She often repeats it for me to audiences that we share, as she did at lunchtime today. For those reasons, we cannot support the noble Baroness's amendment today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support my noble friend in resisting these amendments. Not only has this issue been debated many times in the course of the Bill's progress but it has also been debated many times going back to the days before the setting up of the Dearing committee. The whole question of student finance has been a difficult financial and political issue for all the political parties. It was as a result of not having a solution to the problem, or of not <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being prepared to find a solution to the problem, that noble Lords opposite, when they were in power, set up the Dearing committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para12"></a>Even before the establishment of the Dearing committee, there was much discussion about the future of student maintenance and student loans. I remember discussions on that in this House. I remember from this side of the House, when the Conservative Party was in power, references being made to the high cost of higher education in the United Kingdom and to the fact that that resulted largely from the generous maintenance grants which were paid by the British Government and which no other country paid to its students. The debate then was very lively. First, we had the introduction of student loans partly to replace the maintenance grants. That discussion resulted in even the National Union of Students being prepared to accept that maintenance grants would have to go.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para13"></a>Then we had the advent of the Dearing committee. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said that the Government acted too quickly and prior to the publication of the Dearing report. However, the fact is that continual discussions were taking place even while the Dearing committee was meeting. I remember being at meetings and conferences held under the auspices of several organisations which the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, attended and where he discussed the issues with those present. Clearly, both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party should have been considering the issues before the Dearing committee reported, ready to look at that report in the context of all the arguments and ready to come up with their responses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para14"></a>In responding to the report, the Government accepted the main thrust of it. They accepted the recommendation that students should themselves make a contribution to the costs of higher education because they would be the beneficiaries. It was recommended that the loans system should be income-contingent. Again, the Government accepted that recommendation. Therefore, it seems to me that the main thrust of the report was accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para15"></a>Having said that, the whole question of how to increase the finances available to higher education arose and we saw the introduction of the &#163;1,000 contribution towards tuition fees. That was introduced on the basis of it being an income-contingent scheme. Like many noble Lords, I had reservations about that and about its effect on the higher education participation rate, particularly for those from lower income families. I have two points to make about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para16"></a>First, the participation rate from lower income families has never been high. It is growing slowly, but it is much lower than the participation rate of students from other social groups. The reason is exactly that which the noble Lord, Lord Tope, indicated: parents (and children) in low-income families do not think of their children attending a university. They must become part of the learning culture to which my noble friend referred before they will anticipate and expect that their children will have the benefit of higher education. Statistics from universities now seem to suggest that, despite the introduction of the fee, applications from 18 to 20 year-olds are increasing rather than declining. <P>


<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>My reservation about the introduction of the fee was that the situation needs to be monitored. At an earlier stage in our proceedings I tabled an amendment to that effect and my noble friend the Minister assured me that there would be a monitoring system to watch what happens to the participation rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para17"></a>My second reservation was that the finances raised should go to the institutions concerned. We have had assurances to that effect, but I should like them to be reiterated so that we know that more money will go into the higher education system and to the universities. I accept what my noble friend has said all along, that there will be more money for further education, but we need more money for higher education as well. I should like those assurances to be reiterated because the universities have been starved of finance over the past 20 years or so. The unit of resource per student for universities has declined considerably. If we are to have a university system which is internationally competitive, we need it to be better financed. Therefore, I hope that money from the students' contributions will result in an increase in the funding available for higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-12_para18"></a>In her introduction my noble friend approached the problem much more positively by saying that we need to encourage a culture of learning both at an earlier age and throughout the system so that there is an effect on all sections of society. That would be the best way of moving forward and ensuring that our participation rate in higher education is not only equivalent to those of our colleagues in the rest of Europe and the western world but begins to exceed theirs. I believe that the way in which the present Government have approached the problem is the right one and that returning to student maintenance grants and not proceeding with an income-contingent loan would be a regressive step.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I have always warmly supported income-contingent loans, but I am concerned because the Government seem to be concentrating on getting people to university but they are not thinking about the effect of these changes on students when they are at university. Many students now, because they are increasingly concerned about money--and the poorer their background, the more likely they are to worry about that--are working in term and damaging their academic prospects. They are also removing any prospect of having a good extra-curricular life. We must consider the fact that the Confederation of British Industry and all those who will be employing the graduates--all those who are the source of all these well paid jobs--will ask, "Did this man (or woman) take part in an expedition to the Maldives? Did he act? Was he president of the union?", and they will find that all that that student did was to stack shelves in Sainsbury. Full student CVs will no longer exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para0"></a>That sounds cynical but it is a practical fact. Everyone is supposing that all of these unfortunate undergraduates will go out and automatically find well paid jobs. If they have bad academic results, they will not get such jobs. Moreover, I am concerned about the people who do not want such jobs, but who want to serve the community as teachers, social workers or in other such roles. They <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80623-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether the Minister speaks to students any more. If she does, she will find that there is widespread dismay at the financial package with which they are now confronted. I refer to student fees as well as student loans.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para1"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the Salisbury convention. Let us nail that canard at once. I do not recall any statement about student fees in the manifesto. What we on this side of the House and many students firmly object to is the package which will have a disincentive effect on students. When speaking in his report of his preferred option, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, spoke of maintenance grants. He said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"their withdrawal ... [will be] a disincentive to potential students". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is surely right. The Minister implied that if she thought loans hindered access they would not be something she favoured. Of course loans have a negative effect. It may be that we cannot accept the reality of student loans as part of the package, but that is what the amendment is about. It limits the extent of loans. That is all it seeks to do. The amendment provides that the loan that students take out will not be more than one half of the overall maintenance costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para2"></a>Many of us are concerned at the cumulative effect, and the burden on students. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, referred to the heavy burden that students from low income families will have to bear when they enter the wage-earning world. If one talks now to students, there is no doubt that that is a powerful disincentive. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, spoke of a culture of learning. I was interested to hear the concept. I agree with it. I found the speech of the noble Baroness entirely appropriate as she outlined the need to generate a culture of learning among those who might come to university. We might have heard a great deal more about that in earlier debates on the Bill. However, those perfectly valid points do not justify the extraordinary financial burden that the Bill is likely to put on would-be students and on students at the time of their graduation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para3"></a>For those reasons I firmly support the amendment of my noble friend Lady Blatch.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   My Lords, as the villain of the show and one who has not spoken before on the issue, perhaps I may contribute to the debate, although I suspect that we have made up our minds separately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para4"></a>The committee was appointed because there was a crisis in the funding of higher education. I read what the three main national political parties said, in particular in the run-up to the election. The first priority was education. But the first priority was not higher education; it lay elsewhere. It was clear that there was little prospect of higher education receiving more money from whatever government were elected.
<P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para5"></a>Yet our terms of reference made clear--it was the first item--that society aspired to maximisation of participation in higher education. Where was the money to come from to meet that very desirable aspiration? We were driven reluctantly to the conclusion that we must look to the graduate in work to make an income contingent contribution. To help us judge those issues, we set up a number of working groups. One was to judge the justification for asking the student to make a contribution. The evidence was that on average the benefit to the student from participation in higher education was about twice that to society as a whole. That provided the justification for calling upon the graduate, depending on the income, to make a contribution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para6"></a>We set up another group to consider on what basis that contribution should be founded. The majority of the group initially was minded to recommend that the contribution come through the conversion of maintenance grants into loans. However, as our work proceeded and we debated the issues, the opinion of the group progressively moved. The considerations that weighed with us were these. Financial issues are not the major cause of the low participation by young people from poorer homes. That was not the main cause of the inverse correlation between social class and participation; it was the earlier experience in life. As the Minister said, it is in response to that that the main answer must lie.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para7"></a>Nevertheless, we were concerned that the one differential advantage for children of the poor might be removed. We concluded that the better course was a tuition fee with an equal contribution from all students. We were concerned that the 25 per cent. contribution to tuition fees would amount to &#163;1,000 whereas the loss of the maintenance grant, with its conversion to a loan, for the poorer student would be &#163;1,500.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para8"></a>There were other considerations too. As an old civil servant, a former Treasury official, one learns to be careful. We were mindful that by drawing from the maintenance grant, as opposed to asking the student to contribute towards tuition, we were in a less strong position to say to the Treasury, "That money is for education." If the contribution came from a tuition fee, people would never forget in three, four or five years' time from where the money came. We were clear in our mind that the justification for asking for this money from the student, or the graduate in work, was the need to discharge our remit to maximise participation in higher education. We saw that as the greatest security.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para9"></a>We believed that over time we should move the funding more to the student so that it was channelled through the individual student--rather than through a funding council such as that I chaired--so that the individual was more responsible for his or her choice. To treat all students the same in relation to a contribution to tuition fees was moving in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para10"></a>It was not an easy decision. We understood the alternative argument: that the contribution would be out of income after graduation rather than related to parental circumstances. But we felt that there was an overhang of parental backgrounds and attitudes towards debt. <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There was also a realisation that the student who came from a well-heeled family might look to the family if circumstances were adverse, whereas a student from a poor home might feel an obligation to contribute to the family budget. Therefore on balance we came down in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para11"></a>I wish to acknowledge that the Government changed their position from that in the manifesto. Noble Lords asked why the Government were able to move so quickly. The truth is that I went to see the Secretary of State at my own request. I was desperately concerned about the urgency for decisions because of the crisis in the funding of higher education. I outlined the options as I saw them. I told the Government that I believed the option in their manifesto was wrong; it would not work well. I was glad to find that the Government moved a substantial way towards us; they accepted and enlarged our proposals for support for the poorer part-time and full-time student, and moved to help the disabled student. I was delighted when the Government agreed to monitor and publish the implications of participation. But, on balance, being suspicious of my Treasury past and concerned about participation of the poor, I remain with the Committee's original recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, a great attribute of the British middle classes is that they can justify any subsidy for themselves by invoking the working classes in their defence. I have been teaching for 32 years and during much of that time have been grossly subsidised with free tuition and free grants. They have always defended their free education by invoking the working classes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para12"></a>The working classes never had access. Therefore, as my noble friend cogently explained, we should leave the access of working class students out of the debate. It has nothing to do with it whatever. It will not be improved by cutting all the maintenance grants and tuition fees because we have lived through a golden period when working class access was practically negligible. Money is not the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para13"></a>Let us deal with the equity of the present system of loans. I believe that noble Lords obliquely opposite have almost understood the economics of it--not quite, but almost--and I welcome their education. They are still a little confused about tuition fees, but we will respect them for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para14"></a>Noble Lords opposite still have a problem about understanding income contingent loans. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, cogently made the case for the Government. I put it to her that at present many of my students are not given grants by their parents. Many of my students work overtime and at nights because the loan system is not a good system. The loan system is a very bad system. The present system entirely reflects the concerns of the noble Baroness. However, if students had a full loan payable from future income--I will deal with low paid people in a moment--they would not have such anxiety and would not have to work overtime.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para15"></a>What happens if someone wants to become a monk? Why not? The income contingent loan is simple; that person will not have to pay back very much. Therefore, the income contingent loan taken for a whole cohort of <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>students is a very redistributive arrangement where the lower paid people--those who do not want to apply for highly paid jobs--will not pay the full amount. No one will pay more than the full amount, but many people will pay less than the full amount. That progressivity will be decided by the future income of the people who have graduated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para16"></a>Once we understand that, the equity of the system is clear. Access is a fake argument and we have an equitable system. All the talk about people being burdened with debts and so forth is irrelevant. If the system were like the present student loan system or a mortgage debt I would agree, but it is not like the present system. People will not be burdened with a particular size of debt which they must repay or their house will be repossessed. They will pay from a income stream and when they retire from their jobs the loan will be finished. It will be burnt out even if they have not paid the full amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para17"></a>Once one understands that, the beauty of what the Government have done is obvious. One must accept that the way in which the maintenance grant has been constructed presents an equitable system. If people understand that and get parental income or students' present income out of their heads and think in terms of future income--which, in terms of economic theory, is the correct way to think of such things--they will see that we have an equitable system. I urge your Lordships to reject the amendment.

<A NAME="80623-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, in this intricate issue my main concern is how fair will it be to students who must pay back loans when they have finished university. The Minister said that those who earn &#163;10,000 or less will pay nothing. It was nice to hear that because, whatever salary the graduate receives, he should not accumulate too many loans. One knows that in life there will be other loans. Indeed, one is being encouraged too often by too many people to borrow money, saying, "Come on, let me help you to get this or to do that with a loan". Some of us know that we must be firm. As a clergyman, I know how firm one must be because only in recent years has a clergyman's salary become reasonable. When I started it was very low.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-13_para18"></a>I am in a difficult position. I understand and see the principle put forward by my noble friend Lady Blatch because it is terrible when people are enticed to take out too many loans. Yet--perhaps some of my noble friends will be surprised to hear me say it--the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, have almost persuaded me not to vote for the amendment if there is a Division. I do not think that I would vote in the same lobby as noble Lords opposite. I believe that most probably I would abstain because there is a conflict. I am voting with my thinking, my mind and my spirit and not just on the party Whip. That is how Members on this side sometimes ought to vote. I apologise if my noble friend Lady Blatch is sorry but, although I agree with the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I shall be forgiven for speaking to the amendment, No. 64B. The words "tuition fees" do not appear, although the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, managed to mention them, as did the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew. But that is up to them because your Lordships are always incredibly nice and do not mind what anyone talks about, whether or not it is concerned with the amendment. The amendment is about the contingent maintenance grant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way. In a general sense, we are debating a Bill which the amendment amends. The remarks must relate to the Bill as well as to the amendment. That is what I was endeavouring to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is mistaken. The rules of this House--and I have been here longer than him--are that we try (at least some of us try) to debate the amendment before us. That does not mean that we succeed. I do not criticise the noble Lord--I am sure that if he were to look up my record he would find that I had occasionally drifted from the point. I simply believe that on this occasion we might as well stick to the amendment before us, which is concerned with maintenance grants and alternative ways of financing them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para0"></a>I have bored your Lordships previously in pointing out that I wrote my first paper on student loans 35 years ago. A long time has passed since then. I have never embarrassed my right honourable and honourable friends in the other place by referring to the way in which they screamed at me for my reactionary views on the subject and of being in favour of loan schemes. They came to them slightly later than I did.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para1"></a>I was not the first person to advocate loan schemes. Two of my teachers had written papers on the subject. One was devoted to the Conservative Party and was an economist at the LSE and the other was absolutely devoted to the Liberal Party as it then was. What staggers me about the current position of the Conservative Opposition--I shall take the admonition and stick to that--is that the person regarded as the world's greatest figure in conservative economics, Milton Friedman, was the original advocate of loan schemes for students as being the right way to go. He was a figure the party opposite used to revere. I have to tell them that he is not yet dead, although he is old and would be astonished to hear the remarks made from the Opposition Front Bench and the Opposition Back Benches, as if it were to do with Conservatism, which amazes me. The noble Baroness may like to reflect on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para2"></a>The essence of the loan scheme was described by the noble Lord, Lord Milverton, better than any of us have managed on this side; and it is particularly favourable to under-paid clergymen. I think that is part of the point he intended to make, because assuming the Church of <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>England continues with its relatively low remuneration for clergymen, I cannot believe that any vicar would have to repay a loan for his or her higher education. I take it that that is why the noble Lord feels that he has at least to abstain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, the only loan that I have had from the Church was in connection with getting a car.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I should not be concentrating on the Church of England; I gather that Roman Catholic priests get an even worse deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para3"></a>The serious point mentioned by my noble friend Lord Desai is fundamental--that we should not approach student support in terms of the student's present position. The essence of the correct economics in the view of the Government is the prospective view: to say students are always broke today--and those of us who were students were always broke, no matter how much money we had--but that they are part of an affluent section of society and that we should look at people's income prospectively. I do not deny that that represents a major change, but I have been convinced for many years that that is the right way to approach student maintenance. It is to say the Government will invest in you so that you can be a student. But it is different from the Conservative loan scheme because we will essentially buy an equity interest in you rather than operate a fixed interest loan scheme and we will expect to be repaid if, viewed prospectively, your prospects turn out to be as good as we hope they will be. I hope that we can persuade noble Lords opposite of the essential correctness of that approach to student finance. I am absolutely convinced that that is the correct way to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para4"></a>I can foresee technical problems arising. I was much more junior in the Treasury than the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, but I never trust the Treasury. Implicit in a loan scheme is that the size of the loan will rise as GDP rises so that the relative position of students does not deteriorate. I do not trust the Treasury to come through on that, but it will be for us to make points of that kind in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para5"></a>I have no doubt whatsoever that it is the right thing to do. It means that the student will become independent from 18 and beyond and will essentially be the person who takes this decision. Noble Lords opposite may regard this as an extremely Right-wing view, but how well off the parents are is neither here nor there. What matters is that they are 18 years of age and more and grown up; and what matters in determining maintenance is how well off they are.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para6"></a>Again, it is off the point, but the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Park, struck home to me. Times have changed and students in most universities earn income. I have been extremely irritated on a number of occasions when I have been told that I cannot teach at a certain hour because no one will be there because they will be in Sainsbury's stacking shelves. The greatest university system in the world, that in the United States, has no difficulty at all with students who earn. When I was at Princeton the rich students were incredibly rich, beyond <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anything I had ever seen, and the poor students used to serve the rich students in the refectory. I do not think it did the poor students any harm and I am not sure that it did the rich students any harm. I am reactionary about this kind of thing, but I can live with the idea of students earning money.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para7"></a>In regard to what determines whether one goes to university, I believe overwhelmingly that the Minister is right and that the view that it is determined by marginal cost is not right. I also agree that for the kind of person we are trying to attract to higher education the situation is incredibly bewildering, and we have to explain what it is about. It is nothing to do with loan schemes. When I was 16 and thinking of going into the sixth form I remember my father asking why I did not want to go out to earn money, and I said that I wanted to go to university. He asked me: "What is a university?" I had not the faintest idea. I thought with any luck it would be just like school and I could go on without having to do much work and passing exams, which I have managed to stick to for the rest of my life.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para8"></a>The serious point for those who wish to address the issue of participation is that we still have a long way to go and I am appalled at the social class mix in universities. The entree is in the schools and in education. A proper contingent loan scheme cannot be harmful, and I am absolutely convinced that it is the right way forward. I very much hope that my few words have convinced the noble Baroness opposite to say that is the right way forward and that she will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I asked whether I could pick up on one or two points made earlier in the debate and I hope that the noble Baroness accepts that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para9"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, because he was quite right to reprimand me for referring to noble Lords opposite without indicating that I meant noble Lords on the Conservative Benches, not those on the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para10"></a>Our plans are in accordance with the principles of the Dearing Report and we have built on those principles, as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, stated. We endorse the Dearing case for student contribution to tuition fees and share Derek Dearing's concern about targeted support towards living costs. We have acted on Dearing's call for extra provision for students in need. We are implementing contingent loan repayment arrangements as recommended by Dearing, with repayment through the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para11"></a>The Government are abolishing grants because they believe that a system of grants no longer has a place in a modern student support system. It is right that students' living costs should be met out of their future earnings and in part by their parents, if they can afford to do so. We stated clearly in our manifesto that we would abolish grants and replace them with income contingent loans, and that was accepted by the National Union of Students. We have no intention of going back on that manifesto commitment. We believe that it would be more acceptable, on balance, to mitigate the fee and <P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not charge poor students for tuition but abolish living cost grants and replace them with a loan to be paid back later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, stated that we rushed our response to the Dearing Committee's report. But as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said, discussion took place between himself and the Secretary of State before his report was published. We had time to think about it. We responded rapidly and decisively. Having inherited a worsening financial crisis in higher education, we could not stand by idly once Dearing had reported. We had to act quickly, and that quick response resulted in an extra &#163;165 million for the higher education sector in this coming financial year. I believe that the HE sector is grateful for that and that it wishes to see the Bill enacted as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para13"></a>Nor did we leave students and their parents in the dark during the summer as important decisions were made. That is why we mobilised our information campaign so quickly. LEAs and institutions have been notified of the details of the new procedures. We have consistently kept them informed of developments and will continue to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para14"></a>When one considers the scale of our information campaign and the positive response we have had to it, it is deeply unconstructive of noble Lords on the Conservative Benches to persist in suggesting, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, earlier, that students are in the dark. We know from research conducted some time ago that a high proportion of would-be students had read the information and understood what the new arrangements meant to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para15"></a>Student awareness of the new arrangements and how they affect them has continued to increase. We have continued to provide information. Most recently, we published and disseminated through appropriate channels advice to disabled students.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para16"></a>I was rather puzzled by what the noble Baroness, Lady Park, said because she implied that students will have less money up-front while they are at university. That is not true. In fact, students who are in some financial difficulty will have more money. They will have access to a &#163;250 hardship fund and we have doubled access grants which are to support such students.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said also that she thought it was important that we should support students who wish to serve the community. We are doing that. We are having an income-contingent scheme, unlike the present one, so that those graduates who wish to support the community in jobs which are lower paid will not have to pay back so quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, suggested that increased loans will deter less well-off students and those unaccustomed to debt. I can only repeat what I said. Loans have not deterred less well-off students in the past from going to higher education. It seems to me that there is absolutely no reason why they should in the future. By far the most important factor in determining whether a student gets into a university or goes on to higher education is the level of attainment which that student reached at school. Quite simply, if a young <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person achieves good A-level results, whatever his social background, he is likely to go into higher education. Financial considerations are secondary in making that decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para19"></a>Nevertheless, the key point is that providing maintenance support in the form of loans does not act as a disincentive. That is the evidence. We must look at the evidence rather than simply staring it in the face and pretending that it is not there. Perhaps I may express the matter in another way. There is no evidence to suggest that grants help to encourage students from lower socio-economic groups to enter higher education. What matters is that students have access to the funds they need while they are studying.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para20"></a>We must put right the under-representation of lower socio-economic groups in our higher education system which, up until now, the system we have had in place has so lamentably failed to do. We shall do so by creating a level playing field leading up to, and in, sixth forms by developing a school system focused increasingly on progression for all who have the ability; and by raising standards, expectations and achievements. The measures we are introducing to create excellence in schools are all about that. We must try to make sure that talented students from lower social groups have the same opportunities and expectations as their peers from better-off backgrounds to achieve the grades that they need to go on to university.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para21"></a>We are introducing a new and fairer system of loans, accepting the principle that students who benefit greatly from higher education should pay back their living costs as graduates when they can afford to do so. No one will be expected to pay for the cost of their higher education living costs up-front.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her remarks at the beginning of the debate and for the full response she made at the end of it. But, again, almost everything that the Minister said misses the particular point of my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para22"></a>At least the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, threw some light on why we had such a precipitate response from the Government in relation to the Dearing Report. It had not emerged at all throughout the whole of the discussions both here and in another place that before the report was published the Government had discussed openly the conclusions of the report and that that was the reason for such a speedy response.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para23"></a>Nor has the &#163;165 million extra money found for higher education this year anything whatever to do with this Bill. It is to do with the rescheduling of payments, and the noble Baroness knows that. Therefore, that money was found irrespective of this Bill and independently of it. It is one-off money which I suspect, over time, will need to be built into the base revenue for higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para24"></a>The noble Baroness referred to a 1 per cent. student increase from school leavers this year. However, she did not refer to the fall of 11.5 per cent. of those aged 21 plus and the fall of 15 per cent. for those aged <P>


<a name="column_166"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>25 plus. Nor did she refer to a 15 per cent. fall in the numbers of those entering on a four-year course to become primary school teachers. That is something the country can ill afford.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para25"></a>The noble Baroness and others who support the Government's stand make much of the very generous repayment schemes which will be available to students. That is the same whether the student is affluent or from a poor family. The volume of loan will be twice as great for a student from a poor income family that it will be for a student from an affluent one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para26"></a>The noble Baroness made much of the Salisbury convention. The manifesto, in relation to maintenance grants, did not mention the package in the context of the introduction of tuition fees. Nor did it mention that those grants would be abolished completely and in the first year of this Government. That was one promise that was not made quite specifically.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para27"></a>The noble Baroness invoked the National Union of Students as being in support of this measure. I have spoken at length to that body and it says that its acquiescence was secured before the election in the context of some phasing-out of maintenance grants but not in the context of the introduction of tuition fees at the same time. A confidence trick was played on those students and they accepted it without knowing the full facts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-14_para28"></a>I am pleased that it was the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who made the comments that he did about the poor students serving the rich students. The noble Lord said that he saw nothing wrong with that. It was the most patronising comment I have heard as regards students from low-income families.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, this is getting preposterous. The noble Baroness has done this throughout the Bill and some of us do not like the suggestions she makes. I was a poor student both here and in America. I have no problems with that in the society in which we live. If I were a waiter in a restaurant, I should probably be serving people who are richer than I am, but I can live with that kind of society. I really wish that the noble Baroness would stop making such interventions which are not only irritating but actually offensive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I found the remarks of the noble Lord offensive when he was talking about poor students from low-income families. The system that we now have in place will disproportionately disadvantage students from low-income families. They will lose the grant they receive now and must make up the difference by taking out a loan. Therefore, they will leave university with a greater burden of debt than students from more affluent families. That is the truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para0"></a>The Minister said that survey after survey shows that students from lower income families are disadvantaged. The Government's response to that is to put in place a system that doubly disadvantages students from low income families. I commend my amendment to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   rose to move, That the House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 64, but do propose Amendment No. 64D in lieu thereof.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 64D I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 123A standing in my name and Amendments Nos. 123B and 123C which stand in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para8"></a>Here we return to the question of English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students at Scottish universities. Your Lordships will recall that in Scotland the honours degree in both the arts and the sciences lasts for four years, whereas in England the degree lasts for three years. Therefore, when the Government decided, quite surprisingly, to impose tuition fees, the position became that Scottish students would pay &#163;4,000 for their honours course whereas English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students would pay only &#163;3,000 at their universities. That was obviously unfair. It was also an interesting contrast to the remarks made by Tony Blair in the Evening Standard in March 1997 before the election when he said that Labour had no plans to introduce tuition fees. Never mind. I suppose we can leave that aside. We have rewritten history in that regard. The idea was certainly not to introduce tuition fees in a way that was discriminatory against Scottish students and Scottish universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para9"></a>The Scottish Office quickly realised that there was something wrong. Its policy changed to a position whereby the fourth year of a Scottish honours degree would not be charged and, therefore, Scottish students would pay only &#163;3,000 like their fellow students going to universities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the good sense of the Scottish Office did not seem to transmit itself to the Department for Education in the South and to the Northern Ireland Office, which insisted that students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland attending a Scottish university should pay &#163;4,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para10"></a>It is that discrimination that we are examining. It is discrimination against the Scottish universities and their traditional four-year honours degree. It is also discrimination against youngsters from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, many of whom wish to attend Scottish universities. Clearly, that flow from England, Wales and Northern Ireland is important for Scottish universities, and is more important for some than for others. For example, Dundee, St. Andrews and Edinburgh have a higher proportion of students from the three other parts of this still united kingdom than other universities, including my old university in Glasgow. So it is a particular problem for some of the universities, and a problem in part for all of them. It is therefore a Scottish problem, but it is also an English, Welsh and Northern Irish problem.
<P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para11"></a>That is why I am disappointed that, yet again, the Government have fielded the Scottish Office Minister, when the Scottish Office has in fact solved the problem, realised the injustice and done something about Scottish students who would be asked to pay &#163;4,000 as opposed to &#163;3,000 elsewhere. I am sorry that once again it is the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, who has to take the brunt of these arguments. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, has once again ducked out of the argument altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para12"></a>When the Bill came before this House it contained that iniquity. Noble Lords agreed with me and amended the Bill to be sent back to the House of Commons. Our amendment was removed in Committee in the other place. We shall no doubt be told that we should not undo what the House of Commons has done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para13"></a>However, I have in front of me an interesting letter from Mr. David Bleiman of the Association of University Teachers. He tells me:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Although in general it may be said that the House of Commons has greater democratic legitimacy than the Lords"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
but we never tire of hearing that from the Government--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on this occasion there was not a single Scottish MP on the Standing Committee". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Government did not put one single Scottish Member of Parliament on the Standing Committee. That is quite hard to do, considering the number of Labour MPs in the other place from my country. But the Government managed to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para14"></a>At Report stage an attempt was made to insert a new clause into the Bill to do what I am now asking your Lordships to do. When the vote was called in the other place, there was a significant number of Scottish Labour MPs who suddenly had things to do other than vote. I noted that the names of Mr. Dennis Canavan, Mr. Michael Connarty, Mr. McAllion, and even Mr. Jim Murphy, a former president of the NUS, were absent from the Division List. It is interesting that retribution has been visited on poor Mr. Canavan, who had the temerity to speak. He is not even being allowed on to the list of those who have a chance of going to the Scottish parliament, such is the control opposite.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para15"></a>When we discussed these matters previously at one Question Time, when I managed slightly to sidestep a question on another subject and move it into this field, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, argued that students outside Scotland could enter at the second year because there were differences between Scotland and the rest of the kingdom in the way school education was conducted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para16"></a>In fact, not many students do enter at the second year. I have the statistics before me. They were given last year in a Parliamentary Answer. The figures are 6 per cent. from England; 7 per cent. from Wales; and 7 per cent. from Northern Ireland. This year there has been an increase. I almost said a considerable number, but the percentage has just about doubled. The vast majority of students from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland still enter at the first year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para17"></a>There is a total misunderstanding--and I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, subscribes to it--that somehow or other as long as someone has some A-levels, he or she can enter university at the second <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>year. It is simply not true. It may be true in a very limited number of cases if someone's A-levels are extremely good; but it is certainly not true in the generality of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para18"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour, who is unfortunately not able to be present, has done a lot of work for the Scottish universities. I am indebted to her for a letter that we have received from the Association of University Teachers. In answering the question that will no doubt be put to the House later by the Minister regarding entry at the second year, I can do no better than read out some of the contents of the letter about the whole issue of Scottish student fees. It refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Scottish Minister of State for Education's recent intervention stating that more 'A' level students should apply for, and gain access to, the second year in Scottish institutions", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which was echoed by the Minister last time round, and will no doubt be echoed again. The letter continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The number of students who presently enter directly into the second year is only 8% for all nationalities. Even at this manageable level, there is anecdotal evidence from our members and student associations that many students find the transition too difficult and either drop down into the first year or have to retake the second year". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Indeed, just a few hours ago I spoke to a young student from Heriot-Watt university. He said that the view in the student association there was that roughly half of the students entering in the second year fall back within a few weeks of the start of the session and restart the first year. He tells me that that is the position; and it is the position referred to by the Association of University Teachers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para19"></a>There was one time when a word from the Association of University Teachers meant that the Labour Party simply did what it was told. The world has changed significantly. I even find them on my side, so it has changed quite a lot. Frankly, the letter makes compelling reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para20"></a>Even more compelling is the simple fact that the Minister will be unable to give the House any statistics in relation to the outcomes for those students who enter at the second year--how many drop back to the first, how many achieve a poorer degree than they ought to, or how many drop out of university altogether. That information is simply not held.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para21"></a>The Association of University Teachers goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This line of policy threatens the very existence of the Scottish four-year honours degree as Scots with 'A' levels, and in the future advanced highers, will wish to have the same treatment as English students". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said previously that most Scottish students go to university at the age of 17 because they do only five years at school. That is simply not true. Although it was 20 years ago, I speak as someone who taught in a Scottish school. The great majority, indeed almost all, of our students who went to university did a sixth year at school. So the idea that they were fifth-year students and 17 year-olds is not completely true. By the end of their sixth year some students are still just 17. Some Scottish Office statistics pointed out to me by the AUT indicate that only 7.4 per cent. of higher education students were 17 on 31st December 1995, when the survey was taken.
<P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para22"></a>Interestingly, the association goes on to point out that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the number and proportion of direct second year entrants has decreased over the last three years, hence this politically enforced increase", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which is the Government's intention,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would buck the academic trend and require institutions to radically rethink their admissions policy. It also raises a purely academic problem in that degree courses will have students with differing academic backgrounds in the first 3 years of honours programmes where traditionally the first year has been used to harmonise the academic standards of the students. This may well increase the workloads incurred by a minority of students". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para23"></a>There is more to it than that. For many degrees the students will not have comparable A-levels. Let us say that a student is good at languages, has A-levels in the traditional languages taught in an English school and decides to go to university in Scotland to study Russian. He will have to start at year one. If he goes to study engineering at, for example, Strathclyde or Heriot-Watt university, he will have to start at year one. He will not have done the width of courses at A-level that are necessary to skip that first year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para24"></a>The same is true of students who decide that they would like to study, say, geology, not having done it at school. They will have to start at year one. I could go on and mention a range of subjects for which there will be no option but to start at year one. The only people who will have any degree of certainty of being able to start in year two will be those with very good A-levels, not just ordinary, run-of-the-mill A-levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para25"></a>Your Lordships will be interested to hear about the cost of the change I propose. As the National Union of Students said in a letter from Andrew Pakes, the national president elect:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The amount of money involved is negligible and it is hard to understand how the Government has allowed this situation to develop". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para26"></a>In England it would cost &#163;1.5 million to do the sensible thing that the Scottish Office has done; in Wales it would cost &#163;45,000; and in Northern Ireland, because of the large number of Northern Irish students who go to Scottish universities, it would cost &#163;550,000. We are talking about a couple of million pounds in order to right a great wrong which I believe the Government are doing to students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who choose to go to Scottish universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para27"></a>But that is not the end of the oddities that occur. Here I quote from a letter from Richard Baker, the president elect of the National Union of Students in Scotland:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An added irony exists in that students who are nationals of other European Member States will be treated as Scottish domiciled purely for the purposes of the final year fee waiver and will also be excused the final year tuition fee charge. It would seem that the Government recognise that to practise such discrimination against European Union citizens studying in the UK is in breach of the Maastricht Treaty, and would constitute racial discrimination. Although European law does not protect UK citizens under these circumstances this discrimination is wholly unjustifiable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para28"></a>Your Lordships will remember that I told you about the exchange with Mr. Brian Wilson on the "World at One" programme. The "World at One" presenter said to Mr. Brian Wilson: "So the youngster from France going to Scotland will pay &#163;3,000; a youngster from England will pay &#163;4,000. Why is that?" "Ah", said Brian Wilson, <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"France is in the European Union", to which the interviewer said, "Isn't England?" I thought that that said it all. As the NUS letter concludes,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It remains absurd that students from Birmingham and Belfast should be expected to pay &#163;1000 more for that choice than students from Munich or Motherwell". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para29"></a>I hate to bring this to your Lordships' attention, but I have two grandchildren. I would not like to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Sewel! One lives in Kent, and her parents pay their taxes to the UK. The other lives in Italy, and her parents pay their taxes to the Italian government. In the fullness of time, if they decide to follow their parents and grandparents to Glasgow University, the one in Italy will be charged &#163;3,000 for tuition fees; the one in Kent, in the United Kingdom--the same country, supposedly--will be charged &#163;4,000. That is simply not fair.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para30"></a>There is a combination of people who think that that is not fair. The Association of University Teachers and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom think that it is totally unfair; the Liberal Democrats think that it is totally unfair; my noble friends think that it is totally unfair; I trust that many members on the Cross-Benches think that it is totally unfair; and I suspect that not a few members on the Government Back-Benches think that it is pretty unfair as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para31"></a>I invite your Lordships to join me today in asking the Commons to think again on this issue and to give it serious consideration. Two million pounds is not a lot of money to sort out an internal anomaly in the United Kingdom and an anomaly as far as the European Union is concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para32"></a>Moved, That this House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 64, but do propose Amendment No. 64D in lieu thereof.--(Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Sewel): </B>  My Lords, it may be for the convenience of the House if I say a few words about the grouping of the amendments now before us. The noble Lords, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish and Lord Thomson of Monifieth, have rightly grouped their amendments for the convenience of the House so that the issues raised can be discussed in a single debate. The amendments proposed to Clause 25 appear, however, to be alternative ways of making a similar point. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, proposes to disagree with the Commons amendment, while the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, offers an amendment in lieu.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para33"></a>I should indicate to the House that, should the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, press his Motion No. 64C to a vote and win, we on these Benches will accept that decision as binding on Amendment No. 64D and on Motion No. 123A, both of which also stand in the name of the noble Lord. If the noble Lord's Motion No. 64C is carried, I shall therefore accept Amendment No. 64D and Motion No. 123A without a further vote.
<P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para34"></a>The Government believe, however, that the House should have an opportunity to form a separate view on the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, given that this provides an alternative approach to the same question. Accordingly, if the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, chooses to move his Motion No. 123B when it is called at its place in the Marshalled List, the Government will oppose that Motion, although I hope that the House will, having already debated the issues in the grouping now before it, proceed swiftly to a Division if the noble Lord presses his Motion at that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-15_para35"></a>I hope that this clarification will allow the House to proceed to an orderly debate on these questions. I shall, of course, seek the leave of the House to speak again at the end of the debate and will save my substantive remarks until then.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, I am sure I speak for the whole House in thanking the Minister for that clarification--if such it was, because I am not myself a great deal clearer than I was before. What I proposed to say--and I hope that it is consistent with the advice we have heard from the noble Lord--was that I was rising primarily to speak to the amendment proposed by the Liberal Democrat group in this House and that in this case the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, would not be making an error if, in replying to the debate, which we would have welcomed, she were to talk about the Opposition in a more collective way than happened in the previous case. I am content, generally speaking, to support the arguments that were put with such force by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para0"></a>I am aware that the amendment standing in my name is a flawed amendment, though not through any fault of ours. It does not, for example, refer to Northern Ireland, which is a very necessary part of the issues we are discussing in terms of tuition fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para1"></a>I shall not at this stage seek to repeat the powerful arguments put by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, on this issue. I shall confine myself to saying that in principle the Liberal Democrats have always been against student fees in general, and that position has been made clear during the long debates on the Bill. We take the view that, if we have to have student fees, it is doubly unacceptable for them to discriminate against those whose parents reside in one geographical part of the United Kingdom rather than another. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, that the Government's policy in their Amendment No. 64 destroys the principle of equal treatment and will do great damage to Scottish universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para2"></a>I speak with, I hope, appropriate diffidence since I have not previously intervened in the prolonged debates on this piece of legislation, although I hope I have reasonably conscientiously and enthusiastically trudged through the voting lobbies on this issue. However, I thought that perhaps, after 14 years as the chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, I might be entitled to say something on this matter at this final stage. Heriot-Watt University is an intensely Scottish institution, but I think it is fair to say that it is <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a technological university of international standing. Thirty per cent. of our students come from England, so we are typical of the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para3"></a>The other university with which I have a modest connection--many years ago I was an evening student there when it was a different institution--is the University of Abertay in Dundee. Its principal, Professor Bernard King, spoke to the Scottish Council (Development & Industry) the other day and warned about the Government's proposals in relation to student fees. He believed that in the long run it would have a devastating effect on Scottish student numbers, on the Scottish university system, on the funding of Scottish universities and even perhaps on the number of Scottish universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para4"></a>The Government's argument that English students or students from Wales and Northern Ireland should try to join the second year of Scottish courses--an argument dealt with by the noble Lord--would have a disruptive and destabilising effect in the Scottish universities. If that process was persisted in, it would set up a momentum which would end the four-year course altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para5"></a>There is some misunderstanding about that rather glib solution of trying to reconcile the different Scottish tradition to the different English tradition of people joining in the second year. The Scottish four-year course is an integral and coherent programme. The first year is not a disposable bit of bolt-on do-gooding. The Government's cavalier encouragement to English students to join Scottish degree courses in year two is driven by cost cutting and certainly not by academic considerations. The four-year degree course is part of a long and honourable tradition in Scotland of broadly-based education. In fact, 70 per cent. of Scottish university courses are four-year courses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para6"></a>I am conscious that in joining with the Official Opposition in this House on this matter, we come under the criticism of "flying in the face" (as we were told by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone) of the Salisbury convention. I believe I have a proper regard for the legitimacy of the other place--the elected Chamber. But coming to this matter at this stage with suitable diffidence I hope, though late in the day, I am baffled by the way in which the Government persist in their obstinate refusal to change their position. All those who have been in government in the past go through this process. Proposals are made, often initially because of Treasury aspects, and that may be the case here. They are then debated. They are shown to be ludicrous, absurd and anomalous. But the more that they are shown to be ludicrous, absurd and anomalous, the more the Government stick to them. I begin to feel that that is the state of the present Government on these proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para7"></a>I conclude with this remark. I believe that there are wider than educational implications for the consequences of the Government's stubbornness in this matter. There are implications for the unity of the United Kingdom at the very time that the Government are embarking on the brave policy of devolution. Large numbers of English students at Scottish universities and a smaller number of Scottish students at English <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>universities are an important part of the cement of the United Kingdom. If I may say to the noble Lord who will have the thankless task of replying to the debate, he is a splendid example. I believe I am right in saying that he is an English academic with a distinguished academic record in Scotland and is now a Minister in the Scottish administration within the present Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para8"></a>I recall a year or two ago a vigorous correspondence in the letter pages of the Scotsman where the narrower nationalists in Scotland--there are a few of them around--were complaining about the numbers of English students in Edinburgh and some other Scottish universities. They were seeking to make the point that it was turning the Edinburgh University "un-Scottish". There may be a longer-term consequence of the Government's stubbornness over this. The narrower English nationalists who are beginning to raise their heads--we heard something of them in our debate on the Scotland Bill the other day--may begin to mutter as well and there may be an English backlash.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para9"></a>University education should be something that binds the nations of the United Kingdom together instead of dividing them, just as it should bind the nations of the European Union together. Educationally, it is totally absurd that for a saving of around &#163;2 million the Government should treat students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland differently from those from the rest of the European Union, of which we are members. But seriously, constitutionally, to save &#163;2 million will seem a high price in terms of the United Kingdom's sense of unity and that precious aspect of the unity which is provided by our educational system and is so necessary to make a success of devolution.

<A NAME="80623-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, I support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, for a variety of reasons--touched upon, to some extent, by the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para10"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, I have a granddaughter who has just successfully completed four years at the University of St. Andrews on the basis of English A-levels. There is nothing I know about that university, of which I am an honorary professor, which would lead me to think that she or anyone else would have done better by joining that course at the beginning of the second year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para11"></a>The argument advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, is far more important. The Scottish universities are among Scotland's main contributors to the history of the United Kingdom. Indeed, their history precedes the creation of the United Kingdom. The ancient Scottish universities were there before the Scottish Parliament and may indeed survive the parliament that we are apparently about to set up. One reason has been that they have been part of an international flow of study and learning. From the 18th century--one must not always look at things in terms of the past few years--to achieve a Scottish university education was one of the objectives of anyone preparing himself for a number of major professional or <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>public service fields in England. The noble Lord, Lord Thomson, reminded us that there has been a flow in another direction as well and they have all contributed to the common culture of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para12"></a>I know that governments are, by their nature, obstinate. But this is a curious case where obstinacy is combined with self-contradiction. It was only a few days ago that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, emphasised to this House that nothing in the devolution measures should be thought to diminish the unity of the United Kingdom. Anyone who suggested that it was part of a primrose path to Scottish separatism was out of his mind. Yet the same noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is apparently prepared, for the sake of &#163;2 million--one could obtain a couple of nude statues of Mr. Peter Mandelson and erect them in the Dome for that price--to damage one of the most important and obvious facets of the common culture of our United Kingdom. How he can live with himself in the face of that self-contradiction I find extremely difficult to understand.

<A NAME="80623-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McConnell: </B>   My Lords, I am against discrimination and I find it hard to think of any other word to describe a proposal whereby full fees are paid to Scottish students and to students from all the countries of the European Union but are denied to other students in the United Kingdom from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Over many years there has been a strong connection between Northern Ireland and the Scottish universities. As has already been explained, many students go from Northern Ireland to the Scottish universities. That should not be harmed by a proposal of this nature.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-16_para13"></a>When it is said that other European Union countries will get the full grant, does that include the Irish Republic? Will students from the Irish Republic get the full grant whereas students from Northern Ireland or from England or Wales will not? I think it is time that the Government thought this matter through and decided to act in a fair and equitable way.

<A NAME="80623-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dearing: </B>   My Lords, in speaking in support of the Conservative amendment in the previous debate, I described myself as the villain of this show. I think I am the excoriated villain of this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para0"></a>When the committee was considering what principles it should work from, one of those it chose was to seek greater equity between all the citizens of the United Kingdom. In its recommendations it sought to gain greater equity between students going to further education and higher education--that was one of the justifications for introducing tuition fees, as there are in further education--and greater equity between part-time and full-time students. Part-timers are often paid; full-timers are not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para1"></a>In expanding that principle we came to perhaps a very simple view that all students--wherever they were, whatever the course was and whatever the course cost--should make the same contribution. Whether it was a one-year course, a two-year course, a three-year course or a four-year course, it should be a straight, flat &#163;1,000. One could say that was unfair to those taking a one-year <P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course because they would not get government subsidies like other citizens for three or four-year courses. But it seemed a simple principle and one which was equitable. Therefore, we said that that should be the principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para2"></a>However, in the case of Scotland we recognised that a number of students had not had the advantage of an extra two years after compulsory schooling at public expense. So we recommended to the Government that Scottish students who had only one year's education after statutory schooling, many of whom under current arrangements would choose to take a four-year honours degree, should not make a tuition contribution for one of their years in higher education. That was fair do's. Then we said that beyond that it would be a matter for consideration for the Secretary of State for Scotland. He exercises his discretion in relation to the funding of the universities and in relation to participation. We thought that this would be another occasion. Perhaps we had in mind that if he exercised his discretion it should be more widely than he has chosen to do it. But I would say this to the House. If the House were minded to the view that if a course is for four years the student should be let off one year, I would point out that there are many programmes in England, in Wales and in Northern Ireland that last for four years. The cost would not be &#163;2 million. I do not know what the cost would be, but it might be 10 times &#163;2 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para3"></a>Therefore, in debating this issue we have to consider that the extension of that principle might widen programmes throughout the United Kingdom and that we would be breaking the very simple and equitable principle that for every year you make a contribution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I have an interest to declare. I was an English student who went to a Scottish university. I left just over a decade ago. When I reached Scotland I discovered just how different the Scottish system is. People talk about taking out the first year. After I was halfway through the first year I was told that I could have done that. The reason it is there is that it is a four-year course. It is unit constructed and has the option of becoming an ordinary degree after three years and goes into honours at the end of the second year. It is a very different beast to the English degree. One of its strengths is that students do not have to specialise straight away. They can find out the subjects they are good at under university conditions. Students do not have to go straight in and decide the minute they arrive. I transferred, quite ironically, from politics to history.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para4"></a>The system is so different. It is designed to fulfil different educational functions. Furthermore, the system is not dependent on the very narrow A-level examination. I have heard much in this House and beyond as to just how limiting A-levels can be. If you fail those exams or you change around you suddenly find yourself in a strait-jacket. The Scottish system allows broader entrance. It is a system which answers many of the questions which we are asking about our own higher education system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para5"></a>The idea of fairness has been dealt with very well by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. Why should someone who comes from outside the Scottish system but from inside the United Kingdom be treated <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>differently from someone who comes from outside the Scottish system but from inside the European Union? That is ridiculous. The Scottish system has many supportive features and thus creates better educational opportunities. The universities are very much the property of their communities--that was certainly true at Aberdeen University--in a way that has not been achieved in England. In England there is the idea that you bus in your students. In Scotland they are predominantly for locals. When a university is expanded to take in students from outside, I have a nagging suspicion that you end up damaging a local community and a local resource. We can always bandy around statistics, but there is always that danger.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para6"></a>The more one looks at this the more it becomes apparent that, for what is effectively about a quarter of what the National Lottery gives away every weekend, the Government are prepared to damage opportunities for people from England to experience a different type of education system that allows them greater variation in their choice of subjects and the chance to get the right course. I support the Motion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. I declare an interest because I am an unofficial guardian of two orphans who attend Edinburgh University. Those of the friends of the family who can afford to make some contribution are finding it fairly difficult to do so. For that and many other reasons, I support the Motion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, I rise with great diffidence to support my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. I have voted only once before in all the proceedings on the Bill. That was on this very issue first time round. I feel it is a total travesty and a complete nonsense to discriminate in the way that the Government propose. Twenty-two thousand students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland currently study in Scotland. I gather that the latest figures show that in the Scottish institutions entries are down by 4.5 per cent., while the number of English students entering the second year is up by 99 per cent. At a time when we are trying to promote a Scottish parliament, there is something seriously wrong if we are discriminating against Scottish universities and discriminating against students from within the United Kingdom. I sincerely hope that the House strongly supports my noble friend.

<A NAME="80623-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest. I am chair of the Further Education Funding Council (England), although I believe that that position has nothing at all to do with my contribution to this debate. Far from regarding the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, as the villain of the piece, I regard him as the hero of the exercise in identifying proper, fair and equitable support and funding for each student.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para7"></a>Let us get the position clear as regards Scotland and the case which has been deployed from the Opposition Benches. I feel a great deal more secure when the Opposition are debating this issue now rather than something like the previous amendment when it was <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggested that their concern was overwhelmingly for those from poorer backgrounds. That is an issue which scarcely categorised the past 18 years of the previous administration. But now we are clear that the Opposition are talking about the defence of a middle-class perk. After all, those from poorer backgrounds are not affected by this issue because the Government have taken the position adopted by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, with a guarantee that no tuition fees will be charged for those who come from poorer backgrounds. So the issue does not obtain as regards that category of student.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para8"></a>Therefore, we are talking about students who come from homes which are in a position to make some kind of contribution. Let us be clear, for example, about the kind of contribution that can be made by the parents of the grand-daughter of the noble Lord, Lord Beloff. They are already indicating that they are prepared to support the young person for four years instead of three. There will be additional costs involved from forgone earnings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para9"></a>Noble Lords will recognise that a very high percentage of students who attend Scottish universities from England come from the southern counties and the more prosperous parts of southern England. Is that entirely surprising? Inevitably over a four-year period extra costs are involved in regular travel from and to their homes and the Scottish universities. That cannot be a marginal cost when one considers, for example, the journey to St. Andrews.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para10"></a>We are talking about a proposition which states that the Government should be supporting students who come from backgrounds in which the additional costs involved in going to Scottish higher education have been, or will be, absorbed. It is maintained that it would be quite unfair, if not catastrophic, if the Government withdrew their subsidy in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para11"></a>This issue cannot be calamitous for Scottish universities. Either the numbers are so limited at present that the potential loss of support is no great matter, or if there are significant numbers, it is quite clear that extra subsidy has been going from the state to support the students. But there is no subsidy the other way. I understand the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, about the advantages of cross-fertilisation by people from different parts of the United Kingdom, but I have not heard of a proposal in recent years suggesting that a very significant subsidy should be given to Scottish students to encourage them to attend English universities. That has always been regarded as a matter of choice on their part and not for society, the government and the taxpayer to subsidise. Therefore, why should it be suggested that subsidy should be considered the other way round?
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-17_para12"></a>The answer for the Scottish universities is quite clear. All the figures we have at the moment show that there is no reduction in applications to Scottish universities in the light of the new proposals. The argument put forward in the last debate is surely right. Of all the issues which condition whether people go into higher education and where they choose to go, the marginal costs that we are talking about are not at stake when students make a decision. If such decisions, however <P>

<A NAME="80623-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, has overlooked one or two points. I would not describe Northern Ireland as full of rich people. It is filled with rather poor people who at this particular moment more than any other need reassurance that we support them. They are bound to be thinking that it is strange, to say the least, that students from Eire will be getting an advantage and that they will not. That is the first point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para0"></a>Except for the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth,--incidentally, I strongly support his feeling about the importance of the Union--no one has spoken enough about the anxieties felt in Scotland both among students and their teachers about the future of the four-year course. On the advice of the Government, the influx of students into the second year is distorting it and can only continue to do so. That is bad for education. According to the Association of University Teachers and others, they are anxious that this measure may bring universities to consider a three-year course. In turn, that will have an impact on what is taught at the top level in secondary schools in Scotland. There will be a complete educational upheaval, which is nonsense when we are talking about a relatively small sum of money. That is the second point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para1"></a>I come back to the general matter of fairness. It is difficult for any student to understand how it can be fair that someone from Portugal who lives in this country will gain advantage while someone from England, Northern Ireland or Wales will not. It is not an issue of rich and poor but a question of fairness. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, told an excellent story about questions on the radio. It is very curious indeed that, having just put the Treaty of Amsterdam through this House, when we talked about everyone being a citizen of the Union--including us, I suppose--suddenly for the purposes of this Bill we are not citizens of the Union. We do not have the advantages of any other member of the European Union. That is very strange.

<A NAME="80623-18_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, will in future desist from using the Orwellian argument, "Mr. Jones will come back". It is not for me to defend the record of the party physically on my left, and the noble Lord knows that it has not been my habit to do so. But it is not relevant to the debate on this amendment. If the noble Lord wants to challenge me or my Benches to a contest on concern for people from poorer backgrounds, I will take him up on that any time. We do not have to keep the House waiting to listen to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para2"></a>I was grateful to be able to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, describing the good intentions which paved the road to where we have now arrived. I believe <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we heard a classic description of the dangers of excessive addiction to formula funding. It is like taking a wildlife site and carefully planting it. One tends to iron out all the idiosyncrasies and all the vital individualities which are there because they have grown there. Scottish education is good because it has been allowed to grow that way. It has not been pulled up by the roots to see how it is growing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para3"></a>I am glad that my noble friend said what he did about the danger of national separation in universities. When I went across the water to Yale I found one of the world's great universities. I will never say otherwise. But it did disconcert me deeply to find a national flag carried in front at a degree ceremony. We do not want to get that in what we believe should remain the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para4"></a>I have one further point. We have here discrimination by national origin within the European Union. That bears a prima facie appearance of contravening Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome. I raised this point in Committee and the Minister replied that the Government were "confident". I have heard that before. When the Minister replies, I hope that he can give me better reasons than that for believing that what the Government are now doing will not result in our ending up in court.

<A NAME="80623-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish because I am on the councils of both Dundee and St. Andrews universities. I studied at Dundee and graduated from St. Andrews because at the time they were one and the same university. I should like to advise noble Lords opposite who have been going on about paying fees that I paid my own fees, which were &#163;25 a year. I paid them by working at picking soft fruit and potatoes. I lived at home and I hitchhiked in because I could not afford the bus fare.

I think that I share a certain fellow feeling with Mr. Jim Leighton this evening, but I hope that he has more success than I am likely to have. We have had this debate several times previously and it is not surprising that a number of the arguments and, indeed, a number of the personalities and characters involved have reappeared, even down to what is now the standing army of relatives of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para5"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with a point raised by the "diagonal Opposition" and in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth. The Government are not in any sense relying on the Salisbury convention in the context of this debate. That simply does not arise in any way, shape or form.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para6"></a>Although we have been around this track a number of times in this House and in another place, it is clear that there is still much misunderstanding over why the Secretary of State for Scotland decided to introduce a concession on fees for Scottish students in the fourth or additional year of the generally longer honours degree courses offered in Scotland.
<P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para7"></a>It has to be remembered that Scottish universities and colleges are not the only institutions in the United Kingdom which provide four-year honours degree courses. There are institutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which also provide such courses. The concession made for Scottish students is not intended to be a subsidy for Scottish institutions at the expense of those institutions elsewhere in the United Kingdom which provide four-year honours degree courses; rather, it is intended to compensate Scottish students who may enter university after having received only one year's education after the statutory school leaving age, often at the age of only 17.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para8"></a>To some extent, I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that an increasing number of Scottish students are going to university a year later, at 18, not, however, following an integrated two-year course, as is the case in England, but having taken two separate lots of Highers. The degree of intellectual development involved in adding up the number of Highers that one has gained is very different from the intellectual development involved in the two-year integrated A-level course. That is why it has always been recognised that because of the earlier starting point--in the past "earlier" meant in terms of chronological age but is now taken in the sense of the student's intellectual development--a four-year course is more appropriate for Scottish students than is a three-year course. Those studying in Scotland and those studying in the rest of the UK finish at the same point in terms of intellectual development. That is why, in line with the recommendation in both the Dearing and Garrick reports, most Scottish students will not be required to pay tuition fees in the additional year, which is, typically, the fourth year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para9"></a>The other point that can be made about Scottish students' intellectual development at the start of their university degree can be seen from the low proportion of Scottish school students who attend English universities. It is a very restricted and narrow flow. It is difficult to make the transition across the two very different systems in that direction. It is much easier to make the transition from south to north.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para10"></a>Students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland spend longer in school education before entering university. Indeed, not only do they spend longer at school, but they go further in their school education. They spend two years studying an integrated A-level course or its equivalent. There is no reason why, having had that extra year's school education, they too should have one year's tuition fees paid for them regardless of their family's income just because they attend Scottish universities rather than universities in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. If we are concerned about poor students from Northern Ireland--and I am concerned--I must point out that such students will not pay that amount because they will be covered by the income factor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para11"></a>Scottish higher education rightly has a high reputation. I have been proud to be a member of the Scottish higher education system for nearly 30 years. I have a commitment--the Government have a commitment--to maintaining that high standard. We <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognise that many students in the rest of the United Kingdom can, and wish to, benefit from studying at a Scottish university--perhaps in particular those who, like the children of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, have family ties with Scotland. I quite understand that they may wish to make use of the high quality education provided by the University of Glasgow, following in the footsteps of their parents or even grandparents. However, no student will be prevented under our proposals from benefiting from Scottish higher education because they cannot afford the fees for a fourth year. Students from low-income families--wherever they may happen to be living in the UK--will in any case have their fees paid for them while those from middle-income families will receive help, depending on the level of their income.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para12"></a>The Motions tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will benefit only those who can well afford to pay fees for a fourth year. It amounts to a subsidy for the better off and runs counter to the Dearing principle that those who benefit from higher education should share the costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para13"></a>In any case, in choosing to undertake a four-year course at a Scottish institution, UK students not ordinarily resident in Scotland have already made a decision to forgo potential earnings and to take on extra maintenance costs by choosing to study for an extra year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para14"></a>Taken together, the additional costs of doing an extra year in a Scottish university amount to approximately &#163;20,000, taking forgone earnings into account. The additional fee of &#163;1,000 is 5 per cent. of the total cost which is the product of the decision to attend a Scottish, as opposed to an English, university and to take a four-year degree there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-18_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, may say that it is not the 5 per cent. that counts, but the principle. That principle is equality of treatment across the United Kingdom for Scottish, English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students alike. That is superficially an attractive argument but it does not bear that much scrutiny. It was the Dearing inquiry, in the light of representations from its Scottish Standing Committee (the Garrick Committee), that recommended that Scottish students at Scottish institutions should not have to pay for one of the four years that they must normally spend to acquire an honours degree. The reasoning behind this was clearly concerned with equity. It was to compensate Scottish students who had had one fewer year's education at public expense before entering university. On that reasoning there are no grounds for giving English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students the same concession of a free year's tuition.

Therefore, they do not reach the same stage by the time that they leave school as English students. That degree of development rightly and properly takes place in the first year of a four-year honours degree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, I would have had greater respect for the Minister's argument had he said that the Scottish school system in the fifth and sixth forms was different from the English system, which is much more selective. The idea that somehow or other the Scottish secondary school system in the fifth and sixth years is intellectually inferior to the English system is very curious, coming as it does from a Scottish Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the noble Lord has made that point. I do not say that it is intellectually inferior but that it is fundamentally different. In Scotland the main qualification that students take at the end of their school life is the Higher. That course is studied over a period of just over two terms in most cases. I believe that the noble Lord will agree with that. That is a matter of fact. In England one has the two-year A-level. I do not say that the A-level is superior to the Higher or anything of that kind. The Scottish system under which students take more subjects than under the A-level system has a lot to be said for it. However, one does not get as far down the road in a particular area of study or intellectual development in Scotland as in England by the time one gets to university. The four-year Scottish degree has always recognised that by incorporating that work in the context of university study.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, I was impressed by the argument of the Minister that the better-off in England should pay. What about better-off Scots? I know a good number of Scottish students who come from well-off homes. Why should they not pay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, we have ways and means of making sure that the rich Scots pay, but we do not say that there are many of them. As far as concerns Scottish students, one must look at the bundle as a whole. Here and there is a contribution that the graduate will be expected to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para0"></a>I return to my argument. I maintain that there are no grounds for giving English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students the same concession in order to provide a free year's tuition at university level when it is recognised that that year is spent within the school system. I believe that we shall be here for a considerable time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, if there is no case for making this concession to English, Welsh and Northern Irish students, why is there a case for making it to French, German, Italian and Finnish students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Earl will allow me to get on I shall deal with that point later. That may <P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>be an incentive to others. The arguments and reasons for equity provide much stronger grounds for resisting rather than supporting the amendment of the noble Lord. It would lead to inequality between English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students in the fourth year at Scottish institutions where all tuition-fee support would be paid without means-testing, and students at English, Welsh and Northern Ireland institutions where tuition-fee support would depend on means-testing. One comes back to the argument that there are institutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which already have four-year degree courses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para1"></a>I see no reason why a student from Northumberland should have his fees paid in the fourth year regardless of income if he attends St. Andrews but not if he studies at Durham or Newcastle. Similarly, why should a student from Northern Ireland automatically have his fourth-year fees paid at Glasgow but not at Queen's University, Belfast? That is where the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, falls down. It does not deal with the students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland who attend institutions in those countries that provide four-year degree courses. They will still be in the position of having to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para2"></a>We have yet to hear from the noble Lord how he would justify exempting students from fees in the fourth year of courses at Scottish institutions but not those in the fourth year of courses at institutions in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Why is it right that a four-year course at an English institution should cost an English student up to &#163;4,000 when a four-year course at a Scottish institution would cost that same student only up to &#163;3,000? So much for that appeal for equity. That breaks down. Our proposals would ensure that all students across the UK could if they so chose get an honours degree for up to &#163;3,000 in fees. That is the test of equity which these proposals pass.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para3"></a>The stance that is taken by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and his noble friends on the Front Bench directly opposite is curious. I remind them of their much-vaunted endorsement of the Dearing Report lock, stock and barrel at the time of its publication. They have encouraged the Government to stick closely to it and then criticise them when they do so. They claim to be the party of Dearing and in favour of tuition fees, yet they speak against the Dearing Committee's very own Recommendation 81 and in support of exempting all students from tuition fees in the fourth year of Scottish courses, however wealthy their background. Perhaps the noble Lord can explain how he reconciles his party's support of Dearing with such disregard for that committee's Recommendation 81.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para4"></a>We have heard arguments that the Government are treating Scottish institutions unfairly. On the contrary, the Government have already made a significant concession to Scottish institutions which benefits them. To go further than that and provide non-means-tested grants for all English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students in the fourth year of courses at Scottish institutions would give Scottish institutions an unfair advantage over English, Welsh and Northern Ireland institutions. What the noble Lord appears to argue for is <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a subsidy for Scottish institutions. But given the high reputation of Scottish universities I do not believe that that is necessary or right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord referred to Scottish institutions suffering from the loss of applicants from other parts of the UK. Application figures for 1998-99 do not bear out the argument that the geographical diversity of the Scottish student base has been damaged by our arrangements. By mid-May the drop in the number of English applicants was, at some 4.1 per cent., less than the 4.5 per cent. drop in the total number of applicants to Scottish institutions while the number of Welsh applicants had risen by 4.5 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para6"></a>It is also worth remembering that the number of applicants from within the UK but from outside Scotland--at about 33,000--easily outnumbers the 27,000 or so Scottish applicants. There is not the slightest evidence that these proposals are having a deleterious effect or consequence on the number of non-Scottish UK students applying to Scottish universities. There is not a shred of evidence to support that claim.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para7"></a>It is of course open to Scottish universities to admit more students into the second year of their courses from the rest of the UK. That is a point that I have made a number of times before. That is up to them. They must exercise their judgment. I taught at a university where a relatively small proportion of students did that. They did it without any great disruption. The time is now right for various universities in Scotland to look at the way in which they structure their courses. The straightforward, rigid, conventional four-year degree structure, and perhaps the rigid three-year structure--although it is not for me to pronounce upon it--may not be universally appropriate for all students. A greater degree of flexibility, of entry at different stages, at different levels, perhaps exiting at different stages and different levels might be more appropriate to meet the needs of an increasingly large undergraduate population. It is up to the universities themselves to decide that. We will not decide it for them. I am convinced that entry at different levels recognising prior qualification, is a sound academic route for the universities to go down.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para8"></a>There is a further argument against the Motions set down in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. Students are currently required to have been ordinarily resident in a particular area on a certain date prior to the start of their higher education course in order to qualify for an award from the body responsible for awards in that area. We intend to maintain ordinary residence as a criterion for eligibility for financial assistance with fees. It would thus be ordinary residence which would determine whether a student would be eligible for assistance from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, or from the Department of Education for Northern Ireland, or from the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. It is those students who are eligible for assistance from the Scottish Student Awards Agency who would receive the concession announced for Scottish students studying in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para9"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord would in effect circumscribe the use of ordinary residence as a criterion for financial support for student fees. They <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would require the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to extend any arrangements for financial support for fees made under English and Welsh legislation to students ordinarily resident in Scotland in their fourth year at English or Welsh institutions. Is everyone happy with that? This would apply for the fourth year of courses only, not for the preceding three years. So, a student ordinarily resident in Scotland could apply to an English local education authority for means-tested support for the fourth year but not for the preceding three years, when the student would have to apply to the Scottish Student Awards Agency for support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para10"></a>Likewise, any arrangements made available under the Scottish provisions for financial support with fees would have to be extended to students ordinarily resident in England, Wales or Northern Ireland in their fourth year at Scottish universities. Again, this would apply for the fourth year of courses only, not for the preceding three years. So, under the present administrative arrangements, a student ordinarily resident in England could apply to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland for non-means-tested support for the fourth year, but not for the preceding three years, when the student would have to apply to an English local education authority for means-tested support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para11"></a>This would lead to considerable confusion, not least for students. It would be a thoroughly unsatisfactory piece of legislation, which would undermine the current use of ordinary residence as a criterion for eligibility for financial support with higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para12"></a>For practical considerations but more importantly for reasons of principle, I urge the House to resist the noble Lord's Motion. As I explained earlier, the proposals do not accord with the principles of the Dearing Committee. Our proposals protect the diversity of the higher education system in the UK, without giving an unfair advantage to Scottish institutions over other institutions in the UK. They promote equality by ensuring that, across the school and higher education systems as a whole, students in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK can receive the same number of years of education at public expense. And they provide all students in the UK with the opportunity to study for an honours degree for the same maximum contribution towards tuition costs, while ensuring that those from lower income families, from all parts of the UK, will receive free tuition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para13"></a>This Motion is inappropriate and misguided. For practical considerations--but more importantly for the reasons of principle--I urge the House to resist the noble Lord's Motion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para14"></a>My Lords, I turn now to the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth. In his Motion the noble Lord argues that our policy will result in unfairness and inequality. On the contrary, our proposals mean that all students in the UK will have the opportunity to study for an honours degree for a maximum contribution of &#163;3,000 towards tuition costs. Our policy thus recognises and preserves the diversity of the UK higher education system, which we value, while also offering equality of opportunity.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-19_para15"></a>Let us also be clear that no student, from any part of the United Kingdom, will be prevented from attending a Scottish university or college because he or she cannot afford a fourth year of tuition fees. Students from outside Scotland who come from low-income families will in any case be entitled to free tuition. Many more from middle income families will receive financial assistance with fees. To extend free tuition to all UK students in the fourth year of honours courses at Scottish institutions, regardless of financial circumstances, would help only those from better off families.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, it might be for the convenience of the House and might help the Minister were I to say that in the light of the procedural situation described initially I shall not move my Motion in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. That will help me to abbreviate my comments. I regret that I am detaining the House, but I had a number of lengthy and detailed interventions at the beginning of my speech. I am sure that the House would wish me to cover in full the points that have been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para0"></a>I want now to turn to the problem of cost. It would cost approaching &#163;2 million a year to meet the fees of all fourth year students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Scottish courses. But, as I have said, that in itself would create an anomaly and would no doubt lead to mounting pressure on the Government to meet the fees for all UK students on the fourth year of degree courses at institutions throughout the UK, because once one makes the point that the fourth year is covered automatically for all students in Scotland, regardless of where they have come from or what they have done before, it is, in all fairness, impossible to say that we will not do the same for students attending courses at English universities. That seems to follow inevitably. Throughout the course of the Bill, I have heard no argument that those who support the position taken by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, will draw the line there and will not argue for that extension.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para1"></a>If that extension takes place, which I believe is inevitable, it will cost 10 times as much--in the region of &#163;27 million a year, and possibly quite a lot more. Such an exemption would benefit the well off since only they would be required to contribute towards tuition fees. I repeat that it would do nothing to benefit those most in need of assistance. In practice, a subsidy of &#163;20 million or so for better off families would mean &#163;27 million less in public funding for universities and colleges.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para2"></a>I accept that there are Members opposite who started to go down that path for understandable reasons of equity. I believe that when noble Lords properly understand the situation--students come to Scottish universities from different school environments and traditions, having reached different stages--it is clear the Government's proposals answer the test of equity. The Opposition's proposals raise the anomaly as regards people attending four year courses in English, Welsh and Northern Irish universities. If they propose that the <P>


<a name="column_190"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new anomaly they have created should be resolved, an extra &#163;27 million will be taken out of the resources of the universities and colleges. Is that what they want? I think not; I hope not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his first intervention. The noble Lord indicated that if Amendment No. 64D were carried by your Lordships, Amendment No. 123A would be accepted by the Government. I am grateful for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para3"></a>As regards his second intervention, I hope that Scotland do a good deal better in a few minutes than the noble Lord has done in defending the Scottish goals. He seemed to spend most of his time passing the ball back which, as some noble Lords will know, is a dangerous occupation in football.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para4"></a>I do not wish to take too long, but I shall make a few points. I find it far from the reality of Scottish education when I hear that in Scottish schools there is only one year after the statutory leaving date. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, repeated that. I do not know where the Minister and noble Lord get their information. It is 20 years since I taught at Oban High School as principal teacher of mathematics. The vast majority of my pupils stayed on for two years after the statutory leaving date. They gained Highers and the certificate of six years study which was every bit as good as A-levels. They went into the first year of universities. I worry that our education policy has been based on a totally fallacious view of Scottish school education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para5"></a>The Minister did not answer the other point. What about the Republic of Ireland, Italy or France? Do all those pupils leave at 17? Do they only have five years of schooling? Of course not. They leave at 18-plus. The noble Lord failed to mention Europe. I am not surprised. He made no attempt, for example, to reply to the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I am not surprised. The noble Earl asked me many questions in my time and sometimes they were difficult. The question tonight was clearly so difficult that the Minister did not even try to convince the noble Earl that government policy is not contradictory to European law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para6"></a>The essential unfairness is lost, it would appear, on the noble Lord, Lord Davies. It would be bad enough if it involved only England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it involves the Republic of Ireland with students from Northern Ireland. I gave the example of Italy, and the rest of the European Union. That is the other anomaly that the Government have not addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para7"></a>The Minister referred to students in Northern Ireland: no one is having his or her fourth year paid at Queen's University, Belfast. That is the point: no one is. I should complain if Northern Irish students were having their fourth year paid and no one else was. That is the point: the Minister seems to have lost it altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-20_para8"></a>I do not believe that the Government have made their case. I believe that noble Lords would be reasonable and correct, and defending not only the Scottish tradition but also the interests of those students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland who wish to go to Scotland for their education, if they voted with me this evening.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 72. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 73 to 91, 119 to 122 and 146.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 72 to 91 and 146 relate to the English and Welsh provisions and Amendments Nos. 119 to 122 to the Scottish provisions. They clarify how the Secretary of State's reserve power to place conditions on grant in respect of the fees charged by further and higher education institutions would work in practice. They also respond to concerns expressed by Members of your Lordships' House when we considered Clause 21 earlier. But I should make clear from the outset that these amendments do not contain any changes in policy. They are all essentially technical changes aimed at improving the clarity of the provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para7"></a>In our earlier debates, we discussed at length the principles behind Clause 21 and the parallel Scottish provisions in Clause 25. Let me remind the House that Clause 21 gives the Secretary of State power to require, as a condition of giving grant to the Higher Education Funding Councils for England and for Wales, that they should in turn impose a condition on the grant that they give to higher education institutions. A condition on grant given by a Higher Education Funding Council would require an institution to charge certain categories of students on particular courses fees at the level of the maximum grant available to them for the payment of fees. The categories of students are to be prescribed in regulations but must exclude students who are not connected with the UK or the EU or who are on part-time or postgraduate courses other than courses of initial teacher training. In prescribing the courses to which a condition may apply, the Secretary of State may not single out courses of initial teacher training by subject or other courses by area of study or research.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para8"></a>It is clear from this that initial teacher training courses are intended to be covered by the powers this clause gives the Secretary of State. But most of the funding for initial teacher training courses in England is provided by the Teacher Training Agency rather than by the Higher Education Funding Council. So the Secretary of State needs to be able to impose the same conditions upon the TTA as he can upon the higher education funding councils. Amendments Nos. 72, 74-78, 82, 86-88 will give him the necessary powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 73, 79, 80 and 84 are technical amendments that tie down the period for which a condition imposed on an institution should operate. <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendments Nos. 81 and 120 are also technical amendments which ensure that, like HE institutions, FE institutions may not be subject to conditions of grant which control the level of fees charged to overseas students. Amendments Nos. 91, 119, 121, 122 and 146 are minor technical drafting amendments. They have been made in the interests of clarity and consistency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para10"></a>Amendment No. 85 does just that. It makes clear that, where one institution--let us call it the parent university--claims funding council grant in respect of certain students, then that institution retains a responsibility for the fees charged to those students by any other institution, such as a college, which partly or wholly provides the course for those students. But, in the event that the parent university claimed no HEFC or TTA funding for those students and the college relied wholly on private finance, then the parent university would have no such responsibility and no sanctions on its grant could apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para11"></a>Amendment No. 89 ensures that a publicly-funded institution cannot charge extra fees for awarding or accrediting any qualification to students, nor can an institution which provides some or part of the course. Amendment No. 90 thus ensures that universities and colleges can continue to provide field trips to students in future and can continue their current practice of charging for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-21_para12"></a>All these amendments are intended to clarify the extent and exercise of the Secretary of State's power to impose conditions in relation to university and college fees. I commend them to the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-23_para14"></a>The situation in Wales, as provided for in this clause, is that the Chief Inspector of Schools in Wales should include the inspection of government funded vocational training and careers services, and the amendment to the Long Title is simply a consequence of that inclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-23_para15"></a>The Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector in Wales already carries out inspections of further education colleges on behalf of the Further Education Funding Council for Wales. That is unlike the situation with Ofsted in England. Given the links between work-based vocational training and that carried out in colleges, it makes sense for the same body to arrange the inspection of both aspects. In Wales OHMCI also inspects the quality of careers education provided by schools and colleges. The inspectorate therefore has considerable knowledge in this area and there is logic in drawing on this expertise to enable the chief inspector to inspect the work of the careers service. The extension of the chief inspector's remit would therefore streamline the current arrangements and in particular it would end the arbitrary division of inspection responsibilities between careers education carried out in schools and colleges and the work of the careers service. The providers and the services to be inspected would be specified by the Secretary of State for Wales in the first instance and agreed with the chief inspector. Inspection would be carried out by the office of the chief inspector, with the inspectorate free to draw in specialist staff to support this work, as appropriate, and the framework of inspection would be non-statutory, implemented through contracts with the organisations concerned.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-24_para14"></a>These amendments implement recommendations of the Dearing Report. Unfortunately, some institutions are using unofficial titles such as "university college" which have no clear meaning and are confusing to students and others. The Dearing Committee recommended action to put an end to this confusion. The amendments will prevent institutions in the further and higher education sectors in England and Wales from using unauthorised titles including the word "university".
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-24_para15"></a>The Dearing Committee also believed there was a place for a new category of "University College" for higher education institutions which fall short of full university status but have the power to award their own degrees. The Government accepted this recommendation but there are some technical obstacles to implementing it under the present legislation in England and Wales. The amendments remove these obstacles.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-25_para4"></a>These amendments deal with the exempt charitable status of further and higher education corporations. This is not a new matter. The last government made provision in the Education Reform Act 1988 to give higher education corporations exempt charitable status. The same arrangements were made for further education corporations when further education colleges became independent. Exempt charitable status confers certain financial advantages; for example, in respect of VAT treatment and rate relief.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-25_para5"></a>Part of Clause 21 of the School Standards and Framework Bill makes comparable provision to deal with the exempt charitable status of the governing bodies of foundation, voluntary and foundation special schools. It is desirable to have consistent legal treatment of the school, further and higher education governing <P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies that should have this status so that there is no doubt that they all are, or continue to be, exempt charities. Accordingly, the wording of Amendment No. 131 is designed to be consistent with Clause 21 of the schools Bill. But because further and higher education matters do not fall within the scope of the schools Bill, the necessary provision is included here.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-25_para9"></a>These are purely technical amendments. Amendment No. 132 simply defines the terms "functions" and "modifications" for the purposes of the Bill.

<A NAME = "80623-25_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 135 to 138 amend the provisions of the Bill which relate to its geographical extent. For the most part these amendments are simple consequentials; for example, to enable the new clause relating to the Scottish GTC to extend to Scotland.

<P>

<A NAME = "80623-25_para11"></a>Amendment No. 140 simply removes the standard subsection that was inserted to allow the Bill to be properly debated in this House. It needs to be removed to allow the Bill to work once it has received Royal Assent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the early completion of our deliberations on the Teaching and Higher Education Bill means that the time available for the Unstarred Question on Guardsmen Fisher and Wright is no longer limited to a one-hour dinner adjournment debate. The debate can now run for a maximum of one-and-a-half hours. That change does not affect the time available to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, or to my noble friend Lord Dubs, but it increases the maximum time available to other speakers from three minutes to six minutes.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-27_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government when Guardsmen Fisher and Wright can expect release from life imprisonment.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have put down their names to speak. In particular, I thank the Government Chief Whip for his tremendous help, even at this late stage, to enable us to do justice to a serious problem which concerns us all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para13"></a>The expectation of release remains as deferred until well beyond six years spent in custody. The Secretary of State, on reasoned analysis of the findings of the trial judge, has so decided and, for my part, that decision is not called in question because the trial judge found that there was no possible justification for either of the accused to have opened fire as they knew that they were not exposed to any appreciable degree of danger and that the man they shot was unarmed. Both Secretaries of State--fortunately one is present--were entitled to rely on those findings which inevitably slighted release: and are not open to criticism for having done so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para14"></a>But the purpose of this Question is to challenge the rectitude of such findings on material deposed to on affidavits handed to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and placed in the Library; and so to seek immediate release pending judicial resolution as an exercise of ministerial discretion--a delegation of the Royal Prerogative--as acknowledged by Section 23 of the Northern Ireland Prisons Act. That is an exercise of discretion on which immediate release is not to be inhibited by treating these <P>


<a name="column_217"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases as scheduled for accelerated release or by "comparable culpability" which in this context does not arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para15"></a>The merits of that argument (grounded on those affidavits) have not as yet been considered by either Secretary of State (in context with release) or judicially (in context with conviction) because Lance Sergeant Swift, in charge of this four-man foot patrol, and Guardsman Williams, the fourth man (whose evidence would have been in stark contradiction to those findings of the judge to which I have referred) were not called to testify at the trial.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para16"></a>These affidavits were sworn by the lance sergeant in amplification of his recorded interview by the RUC on 10th September; the colonel then in charge of the 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards; the company commander; and the search training officer of the battalion. The recorded interrogation of Williams by the RUC on 9th December 1992 is also included. They are all in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para17"></a>On 4th September, after the shooting these men returned to Girdwood barracks and were questioned by the colonel, who saw them with the company commander before they were arrested by the RUC and taken to the North Queen Street station, where they were questioned on 4th and 5th September. On 5th September there was a protest demonstration of about 500 who had gathered around the station. On the afternoon of that day the RUC charged them with murder. In Northern Ireland when British soldiers on duty have killed a civilian, the charge of manslaughter is not available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para18"></a>When seen by the colonel and the company commander, according to the colonel's affidavit, these guardsmen were shocked and they said that they believed their lives, the lives of the patrol and of others were at risk, and that they acted in good faith in accordance with their terms of engagement. The colonel also deposed that these men indeed did act in accordance with the terms of engagement as armed soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland, and under his command were in danger 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para19"></a>The evidence deposed shows that the findings of fact to support this conviction were fundamentally flawed; that these men did no less, and assuredly no more, than their ordained duty according to training; and that their convictions were a grave and manifest injustice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para20"></a>The Crown contended in opening that the defence was "dishonest and concocted". The judge rejected the evidence of Fisher and Wright in favour of that of three residents in the New Lodge area, an area hostile to these patrols in which there was a high risk of terrorist activity, and where doors were kept open as an escape route: and in recent weeks such patrols had come under persistent attack from coffee-jar bombs--an improvised grenade, as some of your Lordships will know, which contains Semtex, shrapnel and a detonator and has a killing radius of 30 metres.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para21"></a>The defective structure for inevitable conviction (based on the evidence of the residents) was erected upon five flawed pillars of fact; a structure which could <P>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>never have been assembled if the lance sergeant and Williams had been called in evidence (and believed on their oath). For the lance sergeant would have said that he never searched McBride; that when McBride made a dash for it he did not shout, "Don't shoot"; and that he had every reason to believe that McBride was armed with a coffee-jar bomb; that he, Fisher, Wright and Williams thought that they were exposed to the danger of a "come on" ambush in which a coffee jar bomb would be used; and that as McBride had disregarded three yellow card warnings, there was every justification under the rules of engagement to open fire. Various aspects of his evidence would have been confirmed by Williams, and are confirmed by the affidavits in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para22"></a>The lance sergeant would have said that at the morning briefing on 4th September and orders of the day, the threat of attack from coffee-jar bombs was stressed as the patrol would be out for over two hours; that it was well known to the patrol that the coffee-jar bomb was often directed with a plastic bag from behind the engine of a parked car; that it was an extremely dangerous, easily concealed weapon, designed to be used against such foot patrols; that leading the patrol he had cause to stop McBride, who with an arm across his waist was holding something bulky under his jacket. Fisher covered him, Wright covered down the street, Williams covered the rear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para23"></a>The lance sergeant started to question McBride and when he gave his name and address the lance sergeant knew that the RUC was searching at that address. The lance sergeant tried to make radio contact but failed. He said, "I'll search you. Empty your pockets onto the wall", and again tried to make radio contact. Before he was able to search, McBride grabbed the earpiece of the radio from the lance sergeant's ear and lunged at him. The lance sergeant recoiled and McBride made a dash for it, vaulting over the wall and railings. As McBride did so, he pulled from his jacket a thin white plastic bag containing a solid looking cylindrical object, which the lance sergeant thought would be a coffee-jar bomb to be used against the patrol in a "come on" ambush.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para24"></a>The lance sergeant made a dash to catch him but fell to the ground. Then McBride ran towards the wall. The lance sergeant shouted, "Grab him". Fisher tried to grab him but failed. The lance sergeant did not shout, "Don't shoot". They all went in pursuit. McBride was gaining on them, still with the bag in his hand, heading towards a parked car. Three yellow card warnings, "Army--halt or we'll fire", were given and disregarded. McBride was shot, still running with the bag in his hand towards the parked car. Wounded he fell behind the parked car and then struggled to a house. It was then that the lance sergeant shouted, "Don't shoot", as confirmed by Williams. The area was deserted. There was no one about until after the shooting.

<A NAME="80623-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, apart from expressing my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for raising the issue, I want to make only two points. First, among all the encouraging gleams of hope emanating from Northern Ireland, on which--and on her <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determination and perseverance--I warmly congratulate the right honourable Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the time has surely come to spare a thought, in practical and understanding terms, for those men and women of Her Majesty's Forces who have borne the heat and burden of the day in internal security for close on 30 years and have done their duty as they saw it under conditions of considerable tension and stress.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para25"></a>Secondly, I have always fervently believed--I may say I have had considerable encouragement and support for this view from very senior members of the legal profession--that if a soldier goes out on duty, when called in to aid the civil power, with absolutely no malice aforethought, and may possibly and tragically make a split second error of judgment under very great pressure, he should at the end of the day serve a sentence no greater than that commensurate with unlawful killing and manslaughter rather than with the appalling crime of murder.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para26"></a>I suggest that a split second error of judgment is all the more understandable because these men were operating in good faith in that grey area closely surrounding the yellow card rules of engagement. When these points are taken together, there should be no question but that the two guardsmen, Fisher and Wright, who have now served that sort of punishment and paid that sort of price, should be released forthwith. Under the circumstances prevailing in Northern Ireland, in which immense tolerance is being shown to terrorists serving multiple life sentences, that is the very least that the Secretary of State, who has the power, can do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_time2"></A><H5>8 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, I served in Belfast in 1973-74, as thousands of others have done. Before going to Northern Ireland, every regiment receives excellent, well-prepared and highly sophisticated training. I have patrolled in the remarkably unpleasant and dangerous New Lodge area of that city where Fisher and Wright were on the day that McBride was killed. I am aware of the guardsmen's feelings and the pressures and strains that they were under. There is no time to go through the incident that happened that morning. In any event, my noble friend Lord Campbell has dealt with it in some detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para27"></a>I wish to put some questions to the Minister. Why were the following personnel not called to give evidence? First, the company commander, who would have issued the instructions to Sergeant Swift and the patrol that day. Why were Sergeants Swift and Williams, the two other members of the patrol, not called to give evidence? Why was Company Sergeant Major Goodall, a trained search adviser and an expert witness, who would have provided vital evidence, not called? He would have, or could have, said that the search of the house through which McBride had passed did not take place for approximately one hour after the shooting incident; that the cordon surrounding the RUC search was insecure; that people were coming and going all the time, and any one of them could have taken a coffee jar grenade and disposed of it; that the house search took a mere 17 minutes, when in Goodall's expert opinion a proper search would have taken some <P>


<a name="column_220"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>two-and-a-half hours. I agree with that; I, too, was trained in house searches. Why did the RUC not carry out their duties on that particular occasion in their normal diligent and painstaking way? Is the Minister aware that Sergeant Swift was subjected to hostile questioning by the RUC on behalf of the prosecution in a military barracks at Windsor shortly before the trial?
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para28"></a>I now turn to some matters raised by Sir Ludovic Kennedy. Why did the judge accept the evidence of three local Irish residents who said that McBride had been searched in preference to the guardsmen's denial that any search had been carried out? It is worth noting that one of those witnesses had 12 convictions for shoplifting, as well as others for receiving and handling stolen goods, disorderly behaviour and failing to surrender to bail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para29"></a>If a search of McBride did take place, and he was unarmed, certain questions arise which the judge made no attempt to answer. Why, if McBride was unarmed, did he run away? Why did Sergeant Swift order the guardsmen to grab him? If McBride had nothing to hide, why did he not stop when Fisher and Wright told him that they would open fire if he did not?
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para30"></a>Fisher and Wright acted as they did because they were convinced from what they saw that McBride was carrying a coffee jar bomb and might use it, putting their lives in immediate danger. Army rules of engagement are extremely strict and are normally gone through carefully before every patrol goes out. Those two guardsmen opened fire in accordance with Army regulations, because they realised that their lives were in immediate danger, in the belief that McBride was in possession of a lethal weapon which he might have used.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para31"></a>In conclusion, the Secretary of State can, at any time, if she thinks fit, release a person serving a term of imprisonment for life. Why does she not do so? The cases of these two guardsmen are to be remitted to the Secretary of State for further consideration. It can only be hoped that she will release the guardsmen immediately. Are those two men, who were merely carrying out their duty for the nation, to languish in prison when others, many of whom have committed unspeakable crimes, are to be released? There has been a miscarriage of justice, and it must be put right immediately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. Like the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, and others in this House, I have been in the same position as these two young soldiers were in on 2nd September 1992--on patrol in a hostile environment under the immediate threat of urban terrorism. As other noble Lords have said, in those circumstances one has to make constant life and death decisions. They are not just split second decisions; they are more deliberate decisions based on experience and the kind of attacks that the regiment has endured.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para32"></a>In much of the debate about this matter there has been the dreadful fallacy of moral equivalence: the tendency to apply the same standards to terrorists on the one hand <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and to soldiers and policemen on the other. But they are not the same. When the terrorist goes out in the morning with his armalite, his grenade or coffee jar bomb, he sets out to kill or maim, not merely soldiers and policemen but often innocent civilians as well. In my experience, when a soldier puts on his equipment, he does not go out to kill. More often he goes out on dangerous duty with a determination if possible to avoid inflicting death upon other people. That is my experience of the British soldier in such circumstances. That is how they behave. They are required to carry out dangerous and complicated duties. These young men believed that they were doing that duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para33"></a>They might, as the noble and gallant Lord said, have made a mistake. I am not sure that I would go that far. When the man who was eventually killed pulled the earphone away from the patrol leader and ran, was that the action of an innocent man? Were the two soldiers of whom we are speaking supposed to regard that as an innocent and normal procedure? I think not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para34"></a>But even if they made that mistake, they were on duty and under military discipline; and there are military disciplinary channels for dealing with that kind of mistake. What happened to these two young soldiers is that they were sentenced to prison for life. One of them has already spent a quarter of his life behind bars for doing what he believed to be his duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para35"></a>I am not one of those who will rush to blame or criticise the judge on this occasion. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, said, there was not a possibility of a verdict of manslaughter being found in this case because it was not available; and the sentence was mandatory. I suppose it is possible to suggest that even judges can make mistakes, like soldiers sometimes do. But, whatever the reasoning, the facts and the legal arguments behind this case, I believe that there has been a very grave miscarriage of justice. It is important that this miscarriage of justice should be rectified at once.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para36"></a>It has been suggested--and I think there may be something in the suggestion--that the reasons why the Government are finding it difficult to bring about the release of these young men have a political content: that to release them might, to use the jargon of the day, send the wrong message; that it might in some way upset the peace process. If that is so, it is an outrage. To use the workaday jargon of the City of London, there should always be a Chinese wall between political calculation and the administration of justice. There is absolutely no excuse for keeping two young men behind bars because someone has judged that to release them may send the wrong political message. That is a total fallacy and an outrage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para37"></a>I agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that we in this House should now call upon the Government to exercise ministerial discretion, which it is open to the Government to do. In my view, this is not just a question of the early release of these two young men. Someone said that they had already been in prison long enough. They have been in prison far too long. We should be calling not for their early release or a reconsideration of the circumstances but for their immediate release. As I said, it would be outrageous if <P>


<a name="column_222"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this were not done for political reasons. What would be even worse, and what no civilised or intelligent person would understand, would be if terrorists convicted of murder--multiple murder in many cases--were released from prison in pursuit of a political process while these two young men remained in prison. That would be not just inconceivable but utterly outrageous.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-27_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for introducing this Unstarred Question. First, I should like to offer my sympathy to the family of the late Peter Paul McBride, the young man who died in this tragic incident on 4th September 1992. Secondly, I wish to offer my deepest sympathy to the families of Guardsman Fisher and Guardsman Wright, who, I understand, have behaved with classic dignity during their misfortune. Thirdly, I wish to offer my sincere best wishes to the two guardsmen in prison at the moment. Like the noble Lords, Lord Chalfont and Lord Vivian, I too had the privilege to serve in uniform in Northern Ireland and I say sincerely: "There, but for the grace of God, went I".
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para38"></a>I understand that the law in Northern Ireland does not permit a court to impose a discretionary sentence on someone convicted of murder. Instead, it requires the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. It therefore falls to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to decide whether, and, if so, when, it is appropriate to release a life sentence prisoner on licence. I understand that the Secretary of State will listen to the advice given to the Life Sentence Review Board. That advice was given in October last year. I understand that on that board there are senior officials of the Northern Ireland Office, psychiatrists, psychologists and prison staff. I hope that the Minister can assure this House that, when examining the case of these two guardsmen, the senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office on the Life Sentence Review Board were not in any way influenced by the political situation at that time in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para39"></a>I further understand that, when the board considers that a prisoner has served long enough to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence and is considered to be no longer a threat to the public, the board will recommend to the Secretary of State that the prisoner be released. Let us consider those three points.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para40"></a>Retribution, in Old Testament terms, means an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, does it not? Five years in prison for those who have worn with pride the uniform of their nation is surely sufficient retribution for what was a tragic error committed in the course of most dangerous duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para41"></a>Deterrence means, I understand, preventing someone from carrying out a similar course of action in future. Does anyone in this House or elsewhere believe that these two servicemen will ever be in a position, or be put in a position, in which they will carry out the same action again? The answer must be no.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para42"></a>I know and admire the Ministry of Defence. I understand that in similar circumstances, where a soldier has accidentally killed, murdered or committed <P>


<a name="column_223"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>manslaughter against a civilian, that soldier does not carry arms in Northern Ireland again. I also understand that cases will be looked at on other occasions, especially when there is a significant material change in circumstances. Ministers in another place and noble Lords on the ministerial Benches have expressed the view that the situation has indeed changed dramatically for the better in Northern Ireland. I ask them to bear that in mind when they consider the cases of these two guardsmen languishing in gaol.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para43"></a>Having had the privilege to serve as a soldier in the Province in the 1970s, I sincerely believe that it is the wish--the demand--of people on the mainland and all people of good will in Northern Ireland, people I deeply admire, that these soldiers should be released from gaol, not forthwith, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said, but with immediate effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para44"></a>We are shortly to hear the Constable of the Tower of London, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge. He will know, as many of your Lordships know, that there are three important swords in the Tower of London. One is the Sword of State, which we see at the opening of Parliament every year. The second is the Sword of Justice. That has a sharp point, evidently demonstrated in the cases of Guardsman Wright and Guardsman Fisher. The third is Curtana, the Sword of Mercy. I hope that the Secretary of State will show mercy.

<A NAME="80623-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, if any one of the following defects in our law had been removed before the shooting took place in this case, then these guardsmen would now be at liberty. The defects to which I refer are, first, that murder carries with it an automatic life sentence. Time and again in this House we have said that, because the circumstances giving rise to a murder vary infinitely, then the life sentence which should be available for the offence should be discretionary. Thus, the whole range of sentences would be the same for murder as for any other serious crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para45"></a>I had the privilege to be a member of your Lordships' Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment when, in 1991, an amendment was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Nathan--the chairman of the committee--to provide for the abolition of the mandatory life sentence. It was passed in this House with a majority of nearly 100. There were two former Lord Chancellors, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and five Law Lords among those who voted in its favour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para46"></a>The second defect is that the settling of the tariff and the decision on release is taken by a politician, in private, with no right of appeal. The Home Affairs Committee recently recommended that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is wrong in principle for the Executive--that is, a politician--to have a role in decisions which effectively determine how long a person subject to a mandatory life sentence spends in prison; a role it does not have in discretionary life sentences". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para47"></a>It is refreshing to observe that the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, when in Opposition in 1989, said when the Select Committee's report was being debated:
<P>


<a name="column_224"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The point is that the duration of imprisonment should be decided by judges in an open process and not by the Executive behind closed doors, without even the authority of Parliament".--[Official Report, 6/11/89; col. 522.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That was his view as shadow Lord Chancellor. It was also substantially his view when he was asked a Starred Question on 24th June last. I had briefed him in advance of his previous statement, to which I made reference, and asked him in terms whether or not he still agreed with it. His answer was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The only difference between my position as expressed then and now is that today I have a keener awareness of the arguments on the other side".--[Official Report, 24/6/97; col. 1463.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para48"></a>Finally, under this heading, I refer to the observation made by the current Leader of the House, the noble Lord, Lord Richard, again in the debate on the 1991 Act to which I have made reference where he said, "To be blunt"--if one can imagine that ever occurring with the noble Lord--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe that the public have an infinitely greater confidence in judges than in Ministers--of any government--to make decisions on the length of sentences".--[Official Report, 18/4/91; col. 1570.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para49"></a>The third deficiency is that it was not open to the judge to bring in a verdict of manslaughter. In that regard it is interesting to note that the Criminal Law Revision Committee, in its 14th report way back in 1980, made this recommendation:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a person kills in a situation in which it is reasonable for some force to be used in self-defence or in the prevention of crime but the defendant uses excessive force, he should be liable to be convicted of manslaughter not murder if, at the time of the act, he honestly believed that the force he used was reasonable in the circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That recommendation featured in the Law Commission's draft criminal code in 1979. The Select Committee to which I have already made reference recommended that the law be so changed. Significantly, in the Clegg case, both the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland and your Lordships Appellate Committee, when the case came before it, made the same recommendation; in fact, the Appellate Committee wondered at the extent to which it could itself lay down that a verdict of manslaughter was open in that situation but decided that it needed legislation and was beyond its powers acting in a judicial capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-27_para50"></a>I understand that the guardsmen are entering their sixth year of imprisonment. That is equivalent, if one was dealing with a determinate sentence, to eight or nine years.

I am grateful also to the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, for recognising the importance of this matter and being in his place tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para0"></a>Time is short, but I am not known for speaking at length. I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to the effect that this matter has on morale in the armed services. Before doing so, I remind the House that, as a serving officer in the TA, I have an interest to declare.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para1"></a>Soldiers on operations are subject to a wide variety of stresses and strains, to which they will readily admit. The most obvious is the pain of separation from their loved ones. Another is the risk of injury, or worse. In that context I draw the attention of the House to the tragic death yesterday of Corporal Gary Fenton who was assisting the RUC. I am sure that the whole House offers condolences to his family. We do not yet know what the full circumstances were so it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions at this time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para2"></a>Good performance on operations is important for career reasons--it is called "the right tick in the box". But there is also a secret, dread fear, not often talked about; that is, the fear of misconduct during operations. At the lower end of the scale we are talking about offences such as negligently discharging one's weapon, which could result in a fine of &#163;1,000 and an adverse confidential report. At the higher end we are talking about misinterpreting the rules of engagement, with the tragic results of which we are all aware. Moreover, soldiers can also be in severe difficulties if they fail to open fire when they should. They cannot just play safe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para3"></a>It is important to understand that, while soldiers will readily accept discipline even if it has to be severe, they are becoming increasingly demoralised, disillusioned and disheartened by this affair. They cannot understand how rehabilitated known terrorists become politicians and terrorist prisoners are released while at the same time these two soldiers, who did not get out of bed that fateful day intending to commit those offences, are still in prison. Perhaps the Minister can explain.

<A NAME="80623-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inge: </B>   My Lords, I should declare an interest as I was Chief of the General Staff in September 1992 when the incident involving Guardsmen Fisher and Wright took place and I feel very strongly that these two young guardsmen have suffered real injustice. Therefore, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for raising this Unstarred Question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para4"></a>I sense from discussions that have taken place in this House and in the other place that there is not really an understanding of the demands we placed on our soldiers <P>


<a name="column_226"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who had to operate in a hostile urban environment in their own country against a ruthless enemy and under constant threat of attack. Instant decisions had to be made in very confused situations. In addition to coping with that, we asked them to cope with the yellow card--when can and when can they not use lethal force? I have certainly asked myself how well I would do in similar circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para5"></a>Certainly, the Scots Guards were in no doubt about the threat that they faced in September 1992. There had been more than 20 attacks with lethal coffee-jar bombs and 18 incidents of shooting and in one a guardsman had been killed. It is important to reflect again on the incident which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, described so vividly. I think it is totally understandable that Fisher and Wright acted as they did. This was not just a routine patrol. The patrol had two specific tasks in support of the RUC, based on hard intelligence; one concerned an illegal drinking club and the other a search of Flat 5b in Templar House, the block where McBride, the man stopped but not searched, because he ran away, by Sergeant Swift.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para6"></a>I think it is totally understandable that Fisher and Wright reacted as they did. If one thinks about it, the patrol commander had stopped this person who they thought had something under his bomber jacket, They stopped him and then he violently pulled from the patrol commander's ear his earphone, leaped across a wall and ran off. That was very suspicious. Despite what the residents said at the trial, Sergeant Swift and Fisher and Wright are adamant that no proper search took place. They are equally adamant that McBride appeared to be carrying something.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para7"></a>That leads me to the trial itself. I find it incredible that key witnesses were not called: the company commander, Major Page; Company Sergeant Major Goodall--a trained search adviser and expert witness; and Guardsman Williams. But even more incredible is the decision not to call Lance Sergeant Swift, the patrol commander, who had a better opportunity than anyone else to say whether McBride was properly searched and whether he thought McBride was carrying something. I think it is even more incredible given that the judge said that the actual search of the suspect--in other words, saying that the search proved that he was not carrying something--was the crux of the prosecution's case. He seemed to rely more on the evidence of three local residents. The noble Lord, Lord Vivian, described one of those witnesses to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para8"></a>I recognise the difficulty faced by the judge but I sense that he did not really understand either the pressure or how Fisher and Wright thought in the middle of that incident. I am left with the uneasy feeling that, if this had not been a Diplock Court but had been a normal court with a neutral jury, a different verdict would have been returned. My unease is heightened when I know that such an eminent and respected fighter for justice as Sir Ludovic Kennedy supports what has been said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para9"></a>Very surprisingly, as a number of noble Lords have said, Guardsmen Fisher and Wright are still in prison and have been in prison or under close arrest for very <P>


<a name="column_227"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>nearly six years. Private Thain spent only three-and-a-half years and Private Clegg four years. I find it difficult to understand why.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para10"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, referred to morale. I endorse what he said. This causes deep concern within the Army, but the Army is a non-political, disciplined service that rightly does not get involved in open critical debate, and its commanders cannot publicly, for reasons that I understand, express their opinion. But you should not, my Lords, underestimate the strength of their feelings. In such cases, those at the sharp end rely on the chain of command--their superior commanders--to fight their corner and look after their interests. This chain of command includes their political masters, because of course it is not military commanders or even the Ministry of Defence that can make decisions in such a case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para11"></a>The Army's overall record in Northern Ireland has been outstanding. We, the nation, expect the loyalty and dedication of our Army when we, the nation, order it to Northern Ireland. But loyalty should flow two ways--upwards and downwards. In short, any government has a duty to stand by those it orders to discharge its policies. I wonder what Fisher and Wright feel about this. So I, too, hope that the Secretary of State will exercise her discretion without delay and release these two guardsmen; but I think they deserve a retrial as well.

<A NAME="80623-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Napier and Ettrick: </B>   My Lords, I have read the affidavits and statements that have been placed in the Library and I have listened with great care to all the speeches made so far, particularly the introductory speech of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. It seems quite clear to me that there has been a miscarriage of justice here and that these two Scots Guardsmen, Fisher and Wright, who to date, as we have heard, have spent all but six years in prison, ought never to have been convicted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para12"></a>How many of your Lordships sitting here this evening have ever tried to put yourselves in their position? Can you imagine what it would be like to be convicted of murder when you were simply carrying out your duty and, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said, simply as an aid to the civil power? That, let us remember, was the sole reason these two men were in Northern Ireland anyway. It does not really bear thinking about.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para13"></a>In this country we abolished the death penalty since it had become obvious that down the ages men and women had been convicted of murder and were sent to their execution, mainly by hanging, when they were innocent of the crime of which they had been found guilty. In other words, terrible mistakes have been made in the past and terrible mistakes can still be made today. Take, for example, the case of the man who only the week before last was released after completing more than 23 years in gaol for a murder he never committed. His conviction has been found to be unsafe.

<FONT SIZE=3>interferes with its administration save to be the granter of a royal pardon on the advice of the Secretary of State. Justice is to be administered in an even-handed way both to those who acknowledge allegiance and to those who do not, irrespective of political or any other extraneous considerations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para15"></a>Although ignorant of the technicalities of defences to killing, it seems to me, as a former regular officer and as a layman, that justice, as ordinarily understood, has not been done as regards the conviction of these two Guardsmen. How could it be when vital witnesses for the defence were never even called? Now that the Government have access to all the relevant papers in this tragic case, I would like to ask the noble Lord the Minister whether he is satisfied that the Army legal services did everything they possibly could to help Guardsmen Fisher and Wright in their defence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para16"></a>Whatever general arrangements have been made, or may be made, for the release of prisoners is not the point. In the wholly exceptional circumstances that have been outlined to your Lordships this evening what, in the name of common sense, can be the justification for continuing to detain these two men? Is it not reasonable to ask that they be released at once on licence?

<A NAME="80623-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Westbury: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway for instigating this very important debate. I am speaking tonight because I am appalled at the treatment of Guardsman Wright and Guardsman Fisher. As a Scots Guardsman, I feel that the whole situation has been a slur on their reputation and also on the regiment which has served sovereign and country since 1642 with honour and distinction, in exactly the same way as these two guardsmen were doing in every sense of the word.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para17"></a>It is now known that the evidence procured at the time of the trial was shabby to say the least of it, and that the defence of these two men was inadequate. A great deal of the blame falls on the government of the time. Sadly, Dr. Mowlam has inherited what is called "a hot potato". The whole affair has now obviously become a political football, regrettably at the expense of these two soldiers who have been in prison for nigh on six years. This wicked injustice should now be brought to a sharp conclusion by their immediate release.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para18"></a>There has been a great deal of public opinion expressed and many letters to the Prime Minister and Dr. Mowlam. All the answers have been similarly evasive, calling their prison sentence the result of a heinous crime. This was no crime. The soldiers were doing their duty to the letter. Surely, whatever government have power, they must uphold their Armed Forces to the hilt; otherwise the whole system collapses. Who would join the Army, Royal Navy or Royal Air Force if they felt that they would be let down in this way? Why cannot the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland release these men immediately? It is within her power to do so.

<P>
<A NAME="80623-28_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, many of your Lordships tonight have spoken with great military experience and a military background. Perhaps I may also express my concern from a legal background at the result of the proceedings that were brought against Guardsmen Fisher and Wright.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Vivian, asked the question: why did the judge accept the evidence of the witnesses? Indeed, another of your Lordships posed the question: did the judge understand the position that these guardsmen were in? It has to be said that all the judge had before him was a one-sided account of what had occurred on this particular occasion. As a lawyer, I would focus on the decision by the prosecuting authority to prosecute the two guardsmen for murder.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para20"></a>If one looks at the framework, as excellently outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, what does one have? Peter McBride was quite properly stopped by a guards' patrol in the course of its duty. He gave an address which those guardsmen, together with the RUC, were about to search on the basis that they were premises where it was suspected there were IRA sympathisers. He pulled the earpiece away from the sergeant; he ran away and did not stop when challenged. There is no dispute about those facts. That is the framework within which the decision to prosecute was taken. The overwhelming inference was that he had something serious to hide by the conduct which he exhibited on that occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para21"></a>Yet the prosecution took a firm decision to present the case of murder against these two men based on the evidence of three bystanders. It may be that it can justify that decision on the basis that no bomb was found in the premises into which the young man ran, although there was plenty of time for him to dispose of the bomb if he had one. It may say that, in the heat of the moment, the two guardsmen did not immediately warn their colleagues that a bomb was in the vicinity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para22"></a>The evidence which those three bystanders gave in court was, in the event, inconsistent with the earliest accounts that they had given to the police. As has been said by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Napier and Ettrick, the essential point was--did Lance Sergeant Swift search Peter McBride or did he not? That was the factual issue in the case. The very witness who could give evidence to that--the man who either did or did not carry out the search; namely, Lance Sergeant Swift--was not called to give evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para23"></a>It is not enough for the prosecuting authority to say, "Oh well, we handed over his account to the police, given on that same day to the defence for it to use that evidence if it so wished and for it to call the witness if they thought fit". There are many reasons why a defence legal team does not call a witness in defence. As a matter of practice one would hesitate in any case to call witnesses for the defence. In our system the burden is firmly on the prosecution. Although the noble Lord, Lord Westbury, suggested that the guardsmen were inadequately defended, I would not go along with that simply on the basis that statements may have been handed over which did not result in those witnesses being called by the defence.
<P>


<a name="column_230"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para24"></a>When the case reached the appeal stage the findings of fact could not be effectively challenged by the appeal lawyers. Indeed, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Hutton, said that the main objective facts relating to the killing were not in dispute. He said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No bomb or firearm of any type was found in the course of the search and it was not in dispute that at no time had the deceased been carrying a gun or coffee jar bomb or any type of bomb. Therefore, as the deceased was shot when he was unarmed the appellants, on the objective facts, had no lawful justification for firing at the deceased". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The trial judge was bound by the evidence that was put before him to make findings of fact. The appeal court was equally bound to follow those findings of fact in the absence of any application for further evidence at that stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, pointed out the distinction between terrorists who go out intending to kill and soldiers who are intent on keeping the peace when they go out. When a member of the IRA is caught he wishes to be treated as a prisoner of war even though he represents only a tiny unrepresentative terrorist faction. He will not answer an interrogation; he will plead not guilty at his trial and he will not give evidence. He will go to prison where special IRA arrangements are in hand for him to be treated as though he were a prisoner of war and not a common criminal. Then he sits and waits for the armistice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para26"></a>It is totally unacceptable that a person should assume for himself those privileges when people like the guardsmen who are real soldiers representing their country and who have the support of the whole community behind them, are treated as common murderers and kept in prison for an overlong time. It is time they were released.

The newspapers have consistently been inhibited by threats of libel and, indeed, by libel cases which have already cost the Daily Telegraph &#163;130,000 plus costs in this and similar incidents, and there is another case which may well cost even more. Therefore, the chance and the hope that my noble friend's remarks will be widely reported must be extremely helpful, as must all the points made by your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para27"></a>The case has been explained carefully by noble Lords. We must all be particularly grateful for the remarks of my noble friend Lord Vivian and of the two noble and gallant Lords who have spoken. However, unless we have a retrial, this case is in the past and I believe that I should touch tonight on matters relating to the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para28"></a>I am most grateful to the Minister for a letter that he wrote to me a fortnight ago on this case in which he confirmed that Mr. Justice Coghlin was not persuaded <P>


<a name="column_231"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that a sufficient case had been made out to quash the Secretary of State's decision. I now quote from the Minister's letter, which reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, he [Mr. Justice Coghlin] granted a declaration that there has been a failure to provide proper and adequate reasons for the decision to distinguish the applicant's cases from that of Thain and has remitted their cases to the Secretary of State for further consideration in accordance with that Order". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Let us hope that something comes of that because the two guardsmen seem to have been treated in a different manner from Clegg and Thain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-28_para29"></a>Secondly, I ask the Minister yet again--I have asked this of several Ministers both in this Government and in the previous government--for an absolute and unequivocal declaration that there is nothing political in the failure to release the two men. I accept that the Secretary of State and the previous Secretary of State--I am glad to see him in his place--had a very difficult time. I quote from Republican News (or An Phoblacht) of 11th June 1998:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We know they are going to get out, but what really grates is the fact that they are still serving members of the British army. They'll have maybe &#163;60,000 in back money waiting for them when they get out, and we know that their families have been assured that they won't have to go back to Belfast, but that they'll probably be posted to Germany". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I again ask the Minister to repeat that there is nothing political in the decision as it stands at present. I am sure that the Minister has already given this assurance, but I should like to hear it tonight.

<A NAME="80623-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way, but I detected a certain lack of assurance in what he has just been saying that what he was seeking was in fact the case--an assurance from me, as the previous Secretary of State, that there was no political component or influence in the decision that I took in the first instance. I seek to take no refuge in the fact that, as my noble friend said, I had a difficult time. I had not spent nine years as a Law Officer in Northern Ireland seeking to uphold the rule of law to abandon that when I took office as Secretary of State. I give my noble friend now the assurance about which I hope that he was not really in any doubt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, of course I accept what my noble and learned friend has said. He was Secretary of State in another place, but I had an assurance from my noble friend Lady Denton in almost exactly the same terms as he has just given. I accepted that as being the same as having the assurance from the Secretary of State himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para0"></a>My final point is to ask that when Fisher and Wright are let out they will be permitted to continue to serve in the Scots Guards, should they so wish. It would be no surprise if they are fed up with the treatment that they have received when trying to maintain law and order. However, I hope that, like Corporal Clegg, they will feel that they wish to continue to serve. I hope that they will remember Nemo me impune lacessit--touch me not with impunity.

<A NAME="80623-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Lord Dubs): </B>  My Lords, perhaps I may first join with all those noble Lords who have complimented the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for introducing this very important debate. At the outset, I should like also to pay a tribute to the Army and to the many young soldiers who have served in Northern Ireland with enormous courage in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para1"></a>I am aware of the considerable interest in this House in these particular Northern Ireland life sentence cases and I understand the concern that these cases should be dealt with fairly and consistently. I am therefore particularly grateful for this opportunity to advise the House on where these cases currently stand following the most recent judicial review judgment, delivered on 22nd May.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para2"></a>The background to these cases is well known and has been explained by a number of your Lordships. The two guardsmen were jointly convicted of the murder of an unarmed civilian, Peter Paul McBride, who was killed during an incident which occurred while they were on patrol in Belfast.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para3"></a>The courts, both at first instance and upon appeal, found that, on the object facts of the case, the guardsmen had no lawful justification for firing at the deceased and that the guardsmen were guilty of murder. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused on 8th March 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para4"></a>Having been convicted and imprisoned in Northern Ireland, the guardsmen's cases fell to be considered under Northern Ireland life sentence review arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para5"></a>In April 1997, following a judicial review of the cases, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, now the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, decided that the cases should be considered by the Life Sentence Review Board at the five-year point of sentence--that is to say, in October 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para6"></a>The cases were duly considered by the review board and its confidential advice was subsequently passed to and considered by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She decided that the cases of the guardsmen should be referred back to the Life Sentence Review Board in October 1998--that is to say, at the six-year point of sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para7"></a>It was this decision which was the subject of the recent judicial review and the judgment delivered on 22nd May. In it, Mr. Justice Coghlin did not quash the Secretary of State's decision. However, he granted a declaration that there had been a failure to provide proper and adequate reasons for the decision to distinguish the applicants' cases from that of Private Thain and remitted their cases to the Secretary of State for further consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para8"></a>The Secretary of State complied with the requirements of that judgment last week. On 17th June both guardsmen were provided in writing with the Secretary of State's detailed reasoning.
<P>


<a name="column_233"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para9"></a>The reasons included the overall involvement of the respective soldiers in the two individual incidents; their knowledge of the whereabouts of the rest of their respective patrols during the pursuit; the fact that the guardsmen were acting in concert; and the passage of time since Thain's case had been considered and the knowledge of more recent, relevant cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and many other noble Lords raised concerns about the safety of the convictions. As the noble Lord has informed the House, he recently forwarded me a number of sworn affidavits which are purported to contain fresh evidence about the cases. He has also asked whether, given concerns about the convictions, the prisoners could be released by the Secretary of State. I am grateful to the noble Lord for the helpful way in which he has advised me of his general approach to this evening's debate and for sending me copies of the affidavits. I appreciate his helpfulness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para11"></a>I should explain that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State previously had a statutory power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal when it appeared that there had been a miscarriage of justice. However, the Secretary of State's statutory power lapsed when the new independent Criminal Cases Review Commission began its work on 31st March 1997. As a consequence, questions about the safety of any conviction in Northern Ireland are no longer matters properly for the Secretary of State. If the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, wishes, I would be happy to forward his papers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para12"></a>It has been put to me that, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary of State no longer has a role in referring cases back to the Court of Appeal, she retains responsibility for their release from imprisonment. She could therefore use this power to release the prisoners pending consideration of the cases by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. I believe that that is the thrust of many arguments advanced by noble Lords this evening. In the alternative, it has been suggested that some other mechanism for release can be used such as the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, to use its full title. I understand that if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refers cases back to the Court of Appeal it would be open to the prisoner to apply to the court for bail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para13"></a>The Royal Prerogative of Mercy is properly available to be used in truly exceptional circumstances where other mechanisms are not available or would be unduly delayed. As to the Secretary of State's general power to release life sentence prisoners, this is not unfettered. She is required to consult the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge, if available. Moreover, in exercising her powers she is required to act on a rational basis; she must not be influenced by extraneous or immaterial considerations and must have regard to material factors only.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para14"></a>In the consideration of any life sentence case the proper starting point must be that the prisoner has been properly convicted of murder or some other serious offence. It is not the role of the Secretary of State to attempt to second-guess the Northern Ireland courts, and it would be entirely improper for her to replace their judgments about guilt or <P>


<a name="column_234"></a>

<B>23 Jun 1998 : Column 234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>innocence with her own. Furthermore, in the consideration of life sentence cases she must pay full regard to the facts as found by the courts and available in their judgments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para15"></a>Noble Lords have asked when the guardsmen can expect release from life imprisonment. Given the nature of a life sentence within the Northern Ireland jurisdiction, I cannot answer that question. In Northern Ireland, unlike England and Wales, there is no tariff system and therefore no specific penal element formulated at the outset of an indeterminate sentence. There is in consequence no minimum period that a life sentence prisoner is required to serve. Instead, all cases are considered in the round with the various elements of the sentence; that is to say, retribution and deterrence, risk and the public interest being relevant in varying degrees throughout sentence. In Northern Ireland the average period served in custody towards a life sentence is 15 years. This is in the context that life sentence prisoners generally serve a period within the range of 10 to 20 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para16"></a>Fisher and Wright have now served just over five-and-a-half years in custody and are due to be seen a second time by the Life Sentence Review Board in October when they will have served six years in custody. This contrasts with most other cases that are seen for the first time at the 10-year point of sentence. The exceptional treatment of these cases reflects the fact these are not normal life sentence cases. Mitigating factors include the difficult circumstances in which the guardsmen were operating in the course of their duty and the fact that there was no premeditation. The circumstances which resulted in this particular murder cannot in any way be compared with carefully pre-planned and executed murders carried out by terrorist-type offenders. However, the decision not to release these prisoners reflects the fact that a very serious crime was committed which resulted in the death of an unarmed civilian youth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para17"></a>A number of noble Lords have compared these cases with those of terrorist prisoners who stand to be released early under mechanisms being proposed in the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill to be debated in your Lordships' House shortly. Fisher and Wright, like other prisoners convicted of scheduled offences, will be eligible to apply to have their cases considered by the proposed sentence review body. This does not mean that they are being treated as if they were terrorists. If a declaration is made in their favour, they will be required to serve roughly two-thirds of the period that they would otherwise be required to serve under the existing review arrangements. I have already explained that the guardsmen have had their cases considered under existing arrangements much earlier than most other prisoners.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-29_para18"></a>I should like to deal with a number of specific points raised in this debate. I fear that many of them are not matters for the Government. They concern the way in which the defence was conducted and matters falling within the discretion of the judge. Therefore, they are not matters over which the Government have any influence, nor should they. I deal with one matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, and others. For the sake of absolute clarity, there is no political content whatsoever in the Government's handling of this case. The Government have not been influenced by <P>


<a name="column_235"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>political considerations at all. The position of the Government is based solely on the merits of the two particular cases.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. That being the case, what has changed since the release of Private Thain? The noble Lord said that circumstances were different. What is different except the political situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, political considerations did not influence my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in her decision on the previous recommendation of the Life Sentence Review Board. Each case is treated on its merits. The details of the particular cases of Fisher and Wright distinguish them from that of Private Thain. That is the reality. That was what the Secretary of State looked into again following the judicial review proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord referred to the defence and the judge. He said that the Government had no control over how they conducted their respective responsibilities. The Government have overall control over the mounting of a prosecution. Has the Minister looked at the prosecution file? Can he inform the House why it was that only one side of the evidence was put forward by the prosecution as part of its case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I have not looked at the prosecution file. But the fact is that the decision was made by the court and was upheld by the Court of Appeal. It is that decision which noble Lords believe that the Government can reverse. The Government cannot reverse that decision; they have no power to do so, and it would be improper were they to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. As I understand it, he will be in charge of the promotion of the Bill next Monday which gives the Secretary of State absolute authority to release terrorists at any time of her choosing. I do not want to bracket the guardsmen with terrorists, but would they have been in a more fortunate position after Monday if they had been terrorists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, let me make it clear that there are two separate and parallel procedures open to the guardsmen. One is the existing procedure under which the Life Sentence Review Board will look at the position again in October and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State. The alternative procedure--subject to both Houses agreeing the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill--is that the review body established under the new legislation could also look at their cases because they had been convicted of scheduled offences.
<P>


<a name="column_236"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-30_para0"></a>I cannot predict how quickly that body will operate and what priorities it will have for its work. The prisoners now have two alternative ways forward. They will have lost nothing by having the second procedure--if Parliament agrees--indeed, they may well gain some time by it; in other words, the new body might deal with their cases more quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I am in some difficulty. I think that the Minister asked what I would advise them to do with regard to those two procedures. The Minister must understand that I am not instructed professionally in this matter. They will have to seek professional advice. I doubt whether they will seek my advice. Therefore I am not in a position to advise them. We shall read the Minister's most helpful speech. There are two avenues. If either of those avenues is taken on the advice of whoever they consult, why, in effect, cannot ministerial discretion--the delegation of the royal prerogative--be granted for immediate release? That is what I am after. I cannot advise these men unless I am instructed to do so. I am entitled to say, in the name of justice, under the royal prerogative, release these men.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, there is, of course, the third avenue to which I have referred, but it is not for the Government to give this type of advice. There is the Criminal Cases Review Commission. I have offered to send the noble Lord's papers to the commission as being the most appropriate procedure for dealing with miscarriages of justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful. I accept the offer. They will be handed over, but I cannot advise unless instructed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80623-30_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I believe that I have answered all the specific questions. Most of them, I repeat, concern the way in which the court operated, the judge's decision, and the way in which the defence conducted the case. I do not know that I can say any more on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-30_para1"></a>As regards the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, which related to the whole legal basis for this and many other cases, all I can say is that I will draw his remarks to the notice of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I do not think that I can do more than that. Let me give the assurance that political considerations have in no way influenced the Government's approach to these two cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80623-30_para2"></a>I have listened carefully to all the views that have been expressed. I can give noble Lords the assurance that these cases will continue to be considered, as they have been to date, solely on their merits, without reference to any other extraneous considerations.

This reduction takes account of transfers of responsibility to the newly established Department for International Development (Class III, Vote 1). It also reflects the movement of the Wilton Park executive agency from a net running cost regime to a gross running cost regime. This does not change the overall cash limit.

<A NAME="80623w01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes. The survey provides invaluable information about the state of England's archaeological heritage, and the threats it faces. English Heritage has responded very positively by publishing a number of measures which it is committed to implement. The Government's Planning Policy Guidance Note on archaeology and planning (PPG 16) sets out a framework for addressing the threat to archaeology caused by development, which the survey highlighted. PPG 16, and the possible need for additional legislative and financial measures, will be kept under review in the light of continuing discussions with English Heritage and other relevant government departments.

<A NAME="80623w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  Recruitment constraints within the Home Office have led to a temporary shortage of Presenting Officers which is now being actively addressed; the Central London Presenting Officer's Unit last month moved into new premises following the Immigration Appellate Authority's own move to Taylor House. This unfortunately led to some administrative problems in the handling of files, which have now largely been overcome; the decision on whether a case will be heard on the day that it is listed is a matter for the adjudicator.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
