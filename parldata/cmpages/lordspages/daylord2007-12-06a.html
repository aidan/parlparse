I shall not give any target start dates but we will make more payments to more farmers earlier than last year, which was a substantial improvement on the first year of the scheme in 2005. Defra is looking at the review of this year&#146;s animal disease outbreaks, which have cost the industry an enormous amount. I have just spent three days in the north-west and I am well aware of the direct cost to the industry. They have also cost the taxpayer an absolute fortune. These matters are being reviewed so that we can learn lessons. We are still adding up the full cost as restrictions are still in place in respect of bluetongue, foot and mouth and avian influenza.</p>

It was a non-runner to wipe the slate clean; it was not possible. It was looked at by myself and the former Secretary of State some months ago. While I was in the north-west, I met farmers from Wales and Scotland who did not waste any time other than saying, &#147;Pleased to meet you. By the way, we&#146;ve had our single farm payment&#148;. I told them that the system in England was designed to be far more efficient than that in Scotland and Wales but that we had not yet been able to make such early payments. All I can say is that we will seek to pay the farmers a lot more money a lot quicker than we did last year.</p>

It will be very difficult to fight a disease transferred by the midge. At present, along with the industry, the decision has been taken to keep the bluetongue strategy at phase 1; to keep the restricted area and not go for the whole country being covered as a bluetongue zone. If&#151;we expect it to be when&#151;it comes back and hits us really badly, perhaps after a mild winter, or there is another plume from across the channel, clearly in terms of trade restrictions it would be a lot easier if the whole country was a bluetongue zone. By &#147;the whole country&#148; I mean GB, not just England. That is absolutely crucial but we have not yet got to that point. We are watching it carefully. By next spring and summer, we hope to have the vaccine available. All the tenders have been placed through the companies, and we will be working, as we are now, with industry on a bluetongue strategy on the assumption that it will hit us and become an endemic disease.</p>

The headquarters are at Reading. That is considerably fewer than the number of old MAFF offices. It could be that the number of offices will be reviewed but, given what the Rural Payments Agency has gone through with the single farm payment, the last thing that I have asked it to do is to start organising offices.

It is not a government-run laboratory. Pirbright is the Institute for Animal Health, which is a charity. Defra is a customer of that laboratory, which is sponsored by one of the research science councils from where most of the funding comes. It obviously has commercial research contracts. To the best of my knowledge, we do not provide capital expenditure. There is a huge capital programme that Defra helps with, but the capital part of the Defra budget is not the difficult one, to be honest; it is the normal revenue spending budget.</p>

I suspect that, in time&#151;and I do not say this as a claim&#151;Welsh and, indeed, Scottish farmers will see the benefits of the dynamic system. Its introduction has been fraught with difficulties&#151;including the computer systems, the rush, some of the decisions on changing the system, mapping problems and all the other issues.

Instead, their arguments have focused on the wider impact that the level of remuneration has on the game. The majority of players in the England women&#146;s team took unpaid leave to take part in the World Cup, which meant that they lost wages and had to recoup their working hours.

The desire for a Goldilocks outcome does not by itself warrant an extension of the powers of the state, which still does not seem justified by the arguments advanced today by the Government.

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="07120641000113">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this debate today. This House has always taken a serious and knowledgeable approach to agricultural and environmental matters and we have in today&#146;s debate many expert speakers. The contribution of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle, who is making his maiden speech today, will be especially welcome. It is also good that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, will be replying to the debate. He is rightly a popular Minister in this House, and within the industry is known as someone who listens.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="07120641000114">Today&#146;s debate focuses on Defra&#146;s role with regard to the farming industry, but Defra&#146;s overall responsibilities are very broad and could hardly be of more importance to our nation. Its responsibilities include preparing for the greatest global challenge that we have known&#151;climate change&#151;protecting our national environment, ensuring a safe and sustainable food supply and supporting those who care for 75 per cent of the nation&#146;s land surface. These are enormous policy areas.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="07120641000115">When Defra was created in 2001, we were promised that it would provide a strategic and joined-up approach across government&#151;something that I warmly welcomed at the time. I also hoped that the creation of a larger department would give the important issues with which it dealt more salience across government and its Ministers more clout than their MAFF predecessors had. Bringing together different Whitehall cultures is not easy, but Defra officials continue to provide highly specialised expertise at every level, for which I had every reason to be grateful during my brief and now distant time at MAFF in the 1990s.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="07120641000116">That expertise is needed in every policy area, because MAFF had and now Defra has to wrestle on a regular basis with natural disasters such as floods, droughts, other environmental events, outbreaks of animal disease and food scares. This year alone has seen them all in abundance: the severe flooding in the summer, foot and mouth twice, avian flu, bluetongue and bovine TB. The department&#146;s experts will have been in overdrive. At the same time, they will be conscious, as are we all, of the effect of these disasters on a farming community

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="07120641000117">To deal with this, Defra needs to be efficiently run and well resourced and it needs to have the clout to deliver an effective and consistent strategy across Whitehall. How are we to judge the efficiency of Defra? Is it well run? Is it able to cope with the crises that are part of its daily expectations? Does it help or hinder? Sadly, we have examples over the past year or two of problems for farmers arising from Defra itself. The most obvious are the single payment scheme and this summer&#146;s double outbreak of foot and mouth emanating from the government-licensed laboratory at Pirbright. I will address those briefly, as noble Lords will have other examples.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="07120641000118">As is well known, in 2005 Defra chose, against EU advice, to adopt a dynamic hybrid system to make single payments. According to the March 2007 EFRA Select Committee report, it did so,</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000519">&#147;in the knowledge that it was inherently more complex and risky&#148;,</ul>
<a name="71206-0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="07120641000119">than the historic approach, and with no proper appraisal of the volume of work that would be entailed. In the event, the financial loss to English farmers of the whole sorry saga has, according to the National Audit Office, amounted to between &#163;18 million and &#163;22 million. Of course, some farming enterprises have been ruined, but the stress and frustration to almost all farmers is difficult to quantify. The Minister has been very open with the House on the problems caused by this episode. He will certainly accept the EFRA Select Committee&#146;s view that that decision was,</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000520">&#147;a fundamental failure by Defra to carry out one of its prime tasks&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71206-0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="07120641000120">August&#146;s foot and mouth outbreak at the government-licensed laboratory at Pirbright has done little to enhance the department&#146;s reputation for efficiency, nor has the second leak of virus from the same premises announced a couple of weeks ago. The independent inquiry by Professor Spratt of University College London concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"><a name="07120641000521">&#147;An accidental release from a high security containment facility is of obvious concern to the public and raises issues of public trust in both science and Government&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="07120641000121">I know that the Minister will wish to point out that Defra is not the only government department with problems, either now or in the past, when my own Government were in power, and he will be right. But he is also fair enough to accept that the farming industry has enough problems without Defra adding to them, as the NFU continues to point out.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="07120641000122">Given that Defra deals with issues of enormous national and international importance, such as climate change and flood defences&#151;all government priorities&#151;adequate resources are clearly essential. Last year, Defra had to impose in-year cuts on, among other bodies, the Environment Agency. That turned out to be a short-term view, given what happened in the summer. Now Defra faces cuts of a further &#163;270 million in the 2008-11 Comprehensive Spending Review period. In addition, I understand that it will have to find up to &#163;300 million&#151;it may not

In the current year, the administration budget has already overspent by &#163;50 million out of a total budget of  &#163;360 million, and there are still six months to go. Meanwhile, bovine TB, with no resolution in sight, is costing some &#163;90 million a year. I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the Minister, because I remember from my time in MAFF that the Treasury delighted in taking a very hard line on our budget in the correct belief that we were small and had no clout. Defra is not small. It should have clout. Things have changed and I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the Treasury has, too.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="07120641000123">When Defra was created, we were told that the  new department would deliver a co-ordinated approach in all its policy areas. Has it been allowed to take an effective lead in policy development across Whitehall in areas within its remit? Because of time, I choose only one example&#151;the impact of migrant workers on rural areas&#151;on which I would have hoped that Defra would take a lead. Had it done so, the number of migrant workers, whom we certainly need to help us, would not have come as a surprise to the Home Office.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="07120641000124">Biofuels&#151;a policy area that is very close to my heart&#151;have revealed that, although Defra&#146;s intentions were undoubtedly good, its effectiveness in practice proved wanting. I, along with other noble Lords and many Members of another place, have been campaigning for at least 10 years in support of biofuels contributing to the Government&#146;s environmental targets, providing an alternative market for producers and keeping land in cultivation. Two weeks ago, the UK&#146;s first bioethanol plant was formally opened by the Minister in south-west Norfolk, my former constituency. He was immensely welcome. He pointed out that this plant hits all the environmental targets set by the Government. It uses excess energy from the adjacent sugar factory and it will produce 70 million litres of ethanol each year from 700,000 tonnes of sugar beet. Its by-products include stones&#151;this sounds a little funny but it was explained that they are for rockeries&#151;top soil, lime, animal feed, enough electricity to power 200,000 homes in Norfolk, and excess CO2 to cultivate 100 million tomatoes each year, grown under glass on the site. The Minister was impressed by all that and, as I said, he praised the plant for its holistic approach to production. Why then has it seemed to me and to others involved that there has been resistance in every sphere of government towards the development of biofuels in the past 10 years? I think that Defra was on our side during that long journey, so why was it not the lead department?</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="07120641000125">The Minister will almost certainly not wish to comment on that, but I make the point for a reason. I have already spoken of the immense importance of Defra&#146;s responsibilities, but another area of even greater importance is emerging in which Defra&#146;s skills, efficiency, resources, clout and effectiveness will be tested to the full: food security, or, to say what we actually mean, the food supply, or food shortages. In 2003, Margaret Beckett, then Secretary of State, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"><a name="07120641000522">&#147;National food security is neither necessary nor is it desirable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07120641000491">The joint Treasury-Defra paper, <I>Vision for the </I><I>Common Agricultural Policy</I>, repeated this view, which was taken by farmers to mean that what they did could not be of less importance to the Government or to the nation. Defra&#146;s strategy under this Government has concentrated almost entirely on environmental issues, while assuming, dangerously, that the food supply is not an issue. It is now. By 2050, the world population will have reached 10 billion. In developing countries, improving incomes will increase the demand for more and better food. More people will become consumers rather than producers of food. The World Bank has calculated that world food demand will double. Over the next 40 years, farmers in this country and across the world will need to double the production of food, triple yields per hectare, and do so on less land, using less water. Contrary to the assertion that the world is awash with food for us to import, suddenly there is less food than people thought. The fact that the Prime Minister has initiated a review is welcome, but it is a bit late.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="07120641000126">It will be Defra&#146;s task to lead and support our farming industry in playing its part in one of the most formidable challenges that the world has ever faced. Our farmers can and will rise to that challenge, but the Government need to do so as well. They must have the courage to change their attitude to the farming industry. They must reorder some of their priorities, especially in research. Above all, they must afford to Defra the resource, clout and respect across government that it will need to meet this challenge. Will the Government do so? I hope that the noble Lord will be able to tell us today. I commend the Motion to the House and I beg to move for Papers.</p>

I come from Cheshire, a dairy county, where we are very proud of our products and very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wade of Chorlton, who every Christmas provides roundels of cheese for noble Lords&#146; delectation in the Bishops&#146; Bar. There is praise and cheering in Cheshire today following yesterday&#146;s announcement that there is no decision at the moment on splitting up Cheshire. It would be a folly indeed to create two different Cheshires when we want to remain a unitary Cheshire. To give an example of why we want this, farming in Cheshire takes place mainly in the central and southern areas. To split the two artificially would be a very bad thing indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="07120641000128">I have in the past asked the Government Questions about milk production in Cheshire. I am very eager to learn more about farm gate prices, which I understand are now at 20.7p per litre since August 2007, at their highest since 2001. Can the Minister confirm that? Is he able to tell us what the trend is likely to be? I congratulate the Minister on his ambition to improve regulation that governs the farming industry and reduce it by a net amount of 25 per cent by 2010.

I was surprised by how poor the resources were for farmers&#146; record-keeping, which was essential for reporting to the Government. I hope we can help them to learn how to administer their own farms. I am sure that things have improved since my time.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="07120641000130">My theme today is innovation and the future. I am pleased that Hilary Benn addressed a &#147;Farming for the Future&#148; conference on 19 November at the Oval. I wonder whether my noble friend can report on that. What was the attendance from the farming community, to try to absorb some of the new and innovative ideas? One such innovation in recent years has been the expansion of farmers&#146; markets. They provide competition and bring to the marketplace goods that are desirable to consumers. That is also good for farmers. When I was an MEP, in a meeting at Beeston, which is at the centre of the farming industry in Cheshire, I learnt how isolated farmers are. They do not have the opportunity to meet customers face-to-face. I welcome farmers&#146; markets as an example of where this is now beginning to change. Farmstead isolation is being reduced.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="07120641000131">A good example of the obverse of this coin is that the Government are having the Year of Food and Farming to encourage children, who are of course future consumers, to have a direct experience of food farming and the countryside. Again, it is hugely beneficial to bring town and country together in a positive way. On the Fresh Start programme, how many potential farmers are being brought into the countryside with their new ideas about what and how they can farm? In the 1980s, when I was on Cheshire County Council, it was always a great regret to me that we closed or sold off 80 farms that had been provided to bring new and fresh blood into the countryside and new ideas about farming.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="07120641000132">I should like to explore innovation more and encourage the Minister to distinguish between good and bad innovation, and diversification. One bad idea is the plethora of motorway advertising which has besmirched our motorways and major trunk roads. Farmers may be trying to get an extra buck or two, but such advertising despoils the countryside and kills the very golden goose which should be saved. I shall not go on more about that because I have spoken on this subject previously in your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="07120641000133">Good ideas sometimes are frustrated by planning laws. A farmer wrote to me about providing truck stops for lorry drivers who are taking goods throughout the country and require not only safe places to stay overnight but also places to eat. He wanted to convert his farm partly to provide such facilities, but he was being balked by the planning conditions. The addition was that he would provide fresh food from his farm for dinners at night for lorry drivers, which seemed to be an excellent example of innovation. One hears further ideas on &#147;Farming Today&#148;, including the Scottish farmer who transferred to herb production, which responds to a new need, or the farmer from Northern Ireland who is making mash available for the market. We need to encourage that kind of innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="07120641000134">We also need to encourage marketing. Too often the marketing of the wonderful food that is produced is lax in our country. When I represented the Wirral, I noticed that tomato growers did not talk to each other in the same way as our Dutch counterparts. The Dutch were much quicker at marketing their tomatoes than were the English. I regretted that and I thought more could be done. I saw a wonderful example of this type of marketing when I visited Paris with the European Union Committee. The British ambassador hosted an event for marketing and showing off our wonderful British cheeses to the French, who are very proud of their cheese. Our cheese is very different, but it is a wonderful product and I praise the ambassador for making available the wonderful British embassy in Paris for that purpose.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="07120641000135">My closing remarks are on the relative importance of farming, which of course is a central industry. We do not exist as a nation if we do not eat. But there are other important industries, especially in the countryside, associated with leisure, tourism and hospitality, which these days employ many people and sometimes are offshoots of the farming industry. I have in mind the equine industries. As people have more leisure time and money, they are more likely to go horse riding and so on. What are the Government doing about that? I note that the universities which study these matters are saying that when such terrible things as BSE and FMD have happened in the countryside, the Government may have responded there but have been less secure in responding to the tourism industry. In work done at Glasgow Caledonian University, Leslie and Black said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"><a name="07120641000523">&#147;FMD was initially treated as just an agricultural problem, without the realisation that the domino effects, particularly the actions taken to control and contain FMD, would have potentially substantial effects on rural economics and tourism especially&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="07120641000136">The farming industry is vital to us but we must not neglect those other growing and innovative industries responding to the changes in society that are taking place in rural areas of Britain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="07120641000138">There are mixed fortunes within the area over which Defra has its purview and remit.

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="07120641000140">Great changes are also going on given that climate change, for which Defra has responsibility, brings particular challenges and opportunities for the farming industry and for rural life generally. The Commission&#146;s health check is coming up next year. At one time that was going to be just a &#147;look and see&#148; and planning for post-2013 but it is clear from certain pronouncements by the Commission and member states over the past few months that it is to be a much larger and more fundamental exercise than we had previously thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="07120641000141">Food security was another area mentioned by the noble Baroness. That is going to be much higher in people&#146;s perspectives within the farming industry. A couple of months ago, I went to a meeting of the farming community in Somerset. I was expecting to go there to talk about foot and mouth disease, bluetongue and supermarkets but one of the biggest issues that came up, along with climate change, was food security. We sometimes think of that as being food availability, although it will probably be reflected in prices when buying food rather than in an absolute shortage. However, there is a real issue concerning biodiversity and the threat from climate change and disease to the small number of crops on which we rely. We need to look more strategically at that whole area. I am not of the Malthusian tradition of looking forward and saying that the world will starve because of that threat, but there are real issues to be looked at strategically with our European partners, and relatively soon.</p>

<a name="71206-0003.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="07120641000142">I will go through some of those bigger changes. First, there is the health check. I remember that the press releases of Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel earlier this year were about looking at the common agricultural policy, something that, from a financial perspective, was demanded by the UK Government during the British presidency. There was going to be little change for the farming industry. However, if you look at the pronouncements coming out of Brussels now, you see that suddenly they have become energised and more interested in this area. There may be a feeling that France may not be quite so obstructive to a change in the CAP, so there is sudden excitement and all sorts of initiatives are appearing in terms of flattening payments rather than grandfather rights, taking out smaller holdings&#151;I had hoped that my modest five acres in Cornwall could have qualified for single farm payment, but it looks like that will be, quite rightly, impossible&#151;scaling down large payments and changing the complex cross compliance regime. There will be a real agenda of change next year. But I do not yet understand what Defra's view is on that fundamental area, which will greatly affect our farming industry. It is urgent that we understand what positions Defra will take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="07120641000143">On climate change, I live in Cornwall and two issues have been farmers versus nimbys, as they would be described in the tabloids, and attitudes to wind farms. Although there are huge opportunities in terms of climate change and various bio crops, wind farms or whatever, a number of conflicts are likely to arise, which are of great concern. Going back to the meeting that I had with farmers in Somerset a couple of months ago, there was great frustration that a couple of farmers were trying to move ahead with anaerobic

It is important for all of us in the political arena, where it is sometimes easy to align ourselves with local opposition groups, to use the planning system to support farmers to help them resist some of this nimbyism and to diversify into the various areas that are necessary to help climate change.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="07120641000144">One or two years ago, Defra had a biomass programme related to wood. I have two wood burners. It is one of the areas where we have a great possibility to move forward. I should like to understand how that strategy has progressed. We must also remember that farmers have a challenge in terms of some of the outputs. I am sure that in the European context, dealing with the problem of methane and nitrous oxide, let alone nitrates from fields getting into our water systems, will be on the agenda and there will be pressure for farming to become more climate change and environmentally sensitive.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="07120641000145">The area that we on these Benches see as particularly important is Defra's attitude to rural affairs&#151;the much broader question of the future of the countryside and its prosperity, which is not often talked about. I do not often see much in the headlines and I do not, if I am honest, often see Defra as a great advocate for rural areas. I hope that I am wrong about that, because the Commission for Rural Communities in its recent report identified some 900,000 people as living in poverty in rural areas. In an urban context that would attract massive attention.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="07120641000146">There is also the question of mobility in terms of cars and transport and increasing fuel costs, and particularly access to services. There is a government programme to close some 2,000 post offices. They are not all in rural areas, but that will have a major effect of the fabric of the village. Is Defra on the side of the rural community in that matter?</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="07120641000147">Finally, there is the question of affordable housing. Although I understand that the Government are trying to raise this on the agenda, frankly I believe that we need much more of a blunt instrument to increase affordable housing in rural areas so that we can relieve rural poverty and give people proper places to live. At the moment, because of earnings, that is impossible.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="07120641000148">Given my history of speaking about fisheries policy, I am tempted to refer to it as it is very important for Defra. I cannot understand why we still allow discarding within the broader common fisheries policy when there is such a threat to fish stocks. New Zealand and Norway have made discarding utterly illegal but still have quota systems. That can work. I do not see Defra demanding those changes to the common fisheries policy, which I know are difficult to achieve because of unanimity&#151;I do not know whether that will change under the reform treaty&#151;but clearly this outrageous and terrible practice of discarding must be stopped if we are to preserve the biodiversity of our oceans and to preserve future food stocks. The matter must be taken seriously for the sake of the fisheries industry.</p>

She is right, farming is very important to all of us. My particular interest has always been employment, and farming is a very important employer of labour. It is a substantial employer of immigrant labour. Indeed, I wonder whether the industry would be able to cope as well as it does nowadays without the labour of those who have arrived on our shores from the eastern European countries which recently joined the EU.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="07120641000150">There is no doubt about the vulnerability of such workers. They are often almost pathetically glad to be here and to have any sort of job. Sometimes it has been quite a sacrifice for them to get here. They are willing to work hard, often for lower wages than our own workers would find acceptable. They are frequently unaware of basic employment protection, particularly in health and safety, and the accommodation available to them is often substandard and overcrowded.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="07120641000151">Some time ago the plight of migrant workers was brought very sharply to our notice because of the tragic deaths of Chinese workers in Morecambe Bay. This led to the introduction of a Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Gangmasters (Licensing) Bill, which was supported by the Government, and which established the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, covering gangmasters working in agriculture, horticulture and the shellfish industry. It did not cover food processing and packaging undertaken by mainstream food manufacturers or retailers. It was introduced in agriculture because it was felt that the problem was considerable there. Subcontractor labour providers were also covered by the scheme. The legislation forces gangmasters operating in agriculture to obtain licences and to operate within the law, including respecting minimum employment provisions. There are also robust maximum penalties for breach of the law, including a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years. This acknowledges the involvement of organised crime in gangmaster activities. The desire of frequently desperate people to migrate has unfortunately led to a growth of trafficking by organised criminals. The legislation was intended to make these criminal activities much more difficult to pursue.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="07120641000152">We have now had this legislation in place for more than three years. Agriculture was one of the industries in which it was intended to make a considerable impact and to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers. I would be interested to learn today the Minister&#146;s assessment of the success of the legislation. As a former union official, it is my belief that the only way really to ensure that vulnerable people can escape exploitation is by means of union organisation, and my union has certainly given time and energy to recruitment in this area. At the time of the introduction of the legislation to which I referred, the Transport and General Workers&#146; Union was involved and there was consultation.</p>

Meanwhile, the legislation had the support of the National Farmers&#146; Union and no doubt farmers have been assisted in their understanding of the legislative requirements and what they need to do to establish whether a gangmaster is licensed and it is therefore safe to hire labour through his agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="07120641000154">I hope that the existence of this legislation has led to a substantial improvement in the conditions of such workers. When it was introduced, the Minister for Rural Affairs said:</p>

I want to emphasise some of the points that I made then. Some noble Lords will remember that I called for the sacking of the director of the Pirbright Institute. I certainly do not retract that.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="07120641000157">I welcome this important and very timely debate on farming and Defra, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Shephard. The temptation is always to be too negative about farming. I have often accused farmers of crying wolf too frequently. The weather, disease and poor prices all take their toll. The present situation is very mixed, however. For one part of the industry, cereal prices are buoyant, but for the livestock sector, feed prices have doubled, disease has struck in the south-east resulting in animal movement restrictions and, in the west, Wales, the north-west and Scotland, export bans for three months have halted markets. The impact has been devastating&#151;I really mean that&#151;on all the upland areas, including the Pennines, the Lake District and the south-west of England. My remarks apply to all those areas, but the best thing I can do is to highlight some quotations from a speech by Rees Roberts, whom I know well from my time working for the Agricultural Training Board. He is now the chairman of Meat Promotion Wales and spoke at the Royal Welsh Winter Fair last week. This is equally relevant to England, and in particular to the role of Defra. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"><a name="07120641000525">&#147;This had been one of the most damaging years for our industry that I can remember. Make no mistake&#151;the industry in Wales is in crisis and the whole of the traditional Welsh rural way of life is now under threat. ... It is entirely possible that we could come to this event in two years&#146; time to discover that half of the Welsh sheep industry will have been wiped out&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000492">Those are the words of a very well informed person, not just somebody hyping things up. He says that it will not be possible for Welsh farmers to survive in this situation.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="07120641000158">The Welsh sheep industry alone has suffered more than &#163;30 million of losses since early August because of foot and mouth disease breaking out in Surrey. Meat Promotion Wales estimates that more than &#163;2  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1829"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1829</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>million a week has been lost since the first case was reported near Guildford on 6 August and losses are continuing to accumulate as farm gate prices are crushed beyond recognition.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="07120641000159">In spite of that, retail prices are holding up. Just over a week ago, Welsh farmers were being handed 73p per kilo when consumers are joining long queues to pay &#163;6 a kilo at the checkout. Rees Roberts said that we are heading at speed towards the collapse of our industry&#146;s critical mass. The single farm payment is currently bolstering the hopelessly low pricing structure imposed by the retail sector.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="07120641000160">That evidence confirms my long-held belief&#151;I am speaking for myself now&#151;that the Government are inadvertently subsidising the supermarkets, which discount single farm payments and offer ridiculously low prices to producers. There is an honourable exception in all this. Waitrose has paid 2006 prices this year, thereby giving their lamb producers a future in the industry. Why could the other supermarkets not do the same thing in the middle of the biggest crisis to hit the sheep industry for many years? Words fail me to describe their action, which has been despicable.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="07120641000161">Frankly, the Competition Commission, for its report, should be able to see the evidence before its very eyes. As an aside, Rees Roberts and his organisation have calculated that to produce a lamb costs 143 pence a kilo, not the 73 pence that has been given to farmers over the past month. Bluntly, the headline is &#147;Supermarkets seize massive opportunity of foot and mouth outbreak to boost profits and hammer the sheep industry into the ground&#148;. That can properly be said. We Liberal Democrats have advocated for the past 10 years to the nation, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission the importance of installing an independent ombudsman to ensure that the prices paid to primary producers are fair. It should be illegal for purchases to be made at less than the cost of production.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="07120641000162">It is very important that the code is updated to include the following&#151;we hope that Defra will ensure that this is the case. Suppliers should be able to complain anonymously to the ombudsman as in Germany and other EU countries, and all agreements between suppliers and purchasers must be in writing. Compliance must be monitored. The ombudsman must deal with complaints and advise the OFT. He must be able to mediate and solve disputes, and his decisions must be binding on the parties within the code. If the current problems for suppliers and retailers are to be solved, those provisions must be included in the Competition Commission&#146;s imminent report, and Defra must ensure that occurs. Defra has a moral obligation financially to support the sheep industry now in its hour of need.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="07120641000163">Defra must surely also ensure a European ban on the import of Brazilian beef. FMD is rampant in three regions of Brazil, and yet we are still importing 33,000 tonnes of Brazilian beef a year into this country. Surely what has applied to us in the recent crisis should also apply to the import of Brazilian beef. The efforts of the Secretary of State for Defra to get farmers to absorb disease control costs at this time should be dropped immediately. He should stand up

The evidence of the Pirbright outbreak, the Brazilian imports and bluetongue should surely persuade him of that. The point will not be lost on Defra&#146;s staff, who have had a very hard time and who have been working very hard indeed.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="07120641000164">Other action points must surely ensure that Defra&#146;s remit to provide social cohesion through upland farming is vital. Those areas have some of the lowest GDP in the United Kingdom. They do not have other production opportunities. The Minister replied to my question earlier today about historic payments. You cannot move mountains or the sheep that are hefted on them. They have been there for centuries, which is why the historic payment is a sensible rationale. I know that is not the view in the EU, but Defra should fight for those principles.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="07120641000165">Defra is alert to the threat of climate change, flood-prevention measures and the production of vaccines against exotic diseases. Those are all urgent priorities. Continued research on climate-change-busting agriscience must be a top priority. There is no doubt about that, given what has happened with climate change in the past five years. It is accelerating. Even now, on top of that, Defra has the CAP health check to deal with in 2008, which has been mentioned by my noble friend. The reforms of 2003 must remain in place until 2013. I know that is not a popular view. If Defra is only now beginning to put the Rural Payments Agency into proper working order, this is no time for further changes to take place.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="07120641000166">The Government have a duty to fund Defra properly on the issues that I have mentioned. Defra has massive problems to solve, not least that of bovine TB.

Very recently, however, there has been an upturn. BAE Systems has a full order book with the Astute submarine class. West Cumbria has seen the arrival of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, for which we are very grateful.

Farming in Cumbria is mostly beef, dairy and sheep. I want to tell it how the farmers tell me it is. Hill farming is precarious financially at the best of times. As the noble Lord has just stated, this year it has been disastrous because of the ban on animal movement following the recent foot and mouth outbreak in Surrey. The farmers tell me that that could not have come at a worse time. It came at the end of August, at exactly the point in the year when hill farmers sell their lambs and around one-third of the lambs are normally exported for food. When the auction marts reopened, the prices collapsed, both for the farmers on the higher fells and for those lower down. Those who kept their animals instead of selling them have had to buy winter foodstuffs, and the price of lamb has not recovered. Sheep farming is a complex business in which lambs pass from the high fells to farmers lower down for the next stage in the breeding process. Farmers pointed out to me that what has happened this summer will also have serious consequences for next year, because the chain of breeding has been seriously interrupted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="07120641000172">The Government have provided a support package, for which of course the upland farmers are grateful, but they are still in great difficulty. One firm of Cumbrian farm accountants, taking a sample of  30 farms, has calculated that the estimated profit for the year ending next April is an average of just &#163;2,000 per farm family, which compares with &#163;18,000 two years ago. That &#163;2,000 includes the single farm payment. In other words, a huge loss is being made on the livestock. There has been a large increase in applications to farming charities, because the bills cannot be paid. The farmers are borrowing more and getting deeper into debt, and the accountant whom I mentioned says that he is often a shoulder to cry on.

That would affect tourism, which is  vital for Cumbria. This is not only about land management. One leading young farmer emphasised to me the contribution that farming families make to the social glue of rural communities. They provide social capital&#151;I use the current terminology. Tourism in the Cumbrian hills and lakes flourishes because the farming families bind the rural communities together and a whole lot of related businesses flourish as farming flourishes. It really is vital that the hill farmers are supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="07120641000174">For dairy farmers, the milk price has risen in the past year, not I think because of any change of heart by the supermarkets, but because of a shortage of dairy products worldwide. Things were looking up for the dairy farmer until August. However, the price of winter foodstuffs has also dramatically increased because of a world shortage of grain, so the gains of the better milk price are being taken away in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="07120641000175">What has long been needed is for the farmers to take more of a stake in the food production process. The First Milk farmers&#146; co-operative has bought the Dairy Crest cheese-making factory in Aspatria and another producer is to create a new factory for dairy products. All this is good, but the change is slow. It would really help if policies could be developed that encouraged this added value for the farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="07120641000176">Meanwhile, the beef and dairy farmers tell me that, at best, they just about keep afloat, but they have no possibility of investing capital in the future of their businesses. As they see it, their counterparts in Belgium and France receive much more support and competing with them in a European market is very difficult. One of the goals that the NFU seeks from Defra is a level playing field across the single market of the EU. The Cumbrian farmer finds it hard to see why we do not have clearer policies to support food production. As they see it, the carbon footprint would be reduced if more food was produced locally and they are aware of important issues about national food security, to which several speakers have referred.</p>

<a name="71206-0004.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="07120641000177">In conclusion, farming is part of the fabric of communities all over Cumbria and many other businesses relate in some way or other to the prosperity of farming. Cumbrian farmers have always faced hardship and I am full of admiration for their resilience, but it is hard seeing them struggle when there could be policies to help them.</p>

As a former Minister of Agriculture, like my noble friend Lady Shephard, I am dismayed at the way in which my former department, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has descended into the shambolic disarray that is now Defra. At a time of the most serious crisis in the livestock industry, one can only say that the present state of the Rural Payments Agency is a disgrace. Again, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease at Pirbright in recent months is a scandal. The Minister may say, &#147;Oh, but that is not the responsibility of Defra&#148;. But it is, in part, and, in terms of the Government as a whole, it most certainly is a scandal.</p>

As my noble friend said in her opening speech, the European Community is widely expected to impose substantial fines on the Rural Payments Agency for the situation in which it finds itself. We are told that a fine of something approaching &#8364;300 million is likely to be imposed on us as a result of the mismanagement of the single payment scheme. What I find inexplicable is reading in the press of the announcement of major staff redundancy programmes for Defra. We are told that some 300 members of staff are to take voluntary retirement in the near future under the most generous redundancy scheme in history. It seems clear that this huge impending fine on the department and the RPA is why they have had to make all those redundancies at a time when the RPA is quite unable to handle the situation that lies before us.</p>

He made the point that farmers could lose thousands of pounds because of the frequent instances of Defra losing claim forms. It is absolutely wrong if Defra is not issuing receipts; certainly some of us in the Chamber today who are former Ministers would never have done that.

Many of those employed are not particularly well paid and government action on the minimum wage, minimum holiday entitlements and the position of part-time employees will have benefited some within the farming and agriculture industries. Despite the speech by my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden, there is a temptation in talking about the farming industry to spend too little time considering those employees who earn relatively little and asking whether they are getting a fair deal from those who employ them. Certainly, the more extreme examples of the gangmasters, to which reference has been made,  show the extent of the problems that can exist and  the need for legislation and regulation in some areas. Once again, the Government have taken action on that front.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="07120641000187">Farming in the UK uses, as we have heard, around three-quarters of this country&#146;s land area. Public access and public rights of way can be a source of conflict on occasion. It is not unknown to find rights of way either deliberately blocked off or made difficult to traverse, although it is also true that not every user of a public right of way always acts responsibly. Reasonable access to our countryside is important. The Government&#146;s Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the right to roam mean that, in England, people now have nearly three-quarters of a million hectares of land across which they can ramble, climb and watch wildlife. Legislation last year also established Natural England, a new body with responsibility for promoting and encouraging the integrated management of the environment, nature conservation, biodiversity, landscape, access and recreation.</p>

One hopes that further improvements in making full payments will be achieved in 2008. This year, which initially looked promising, has been one of significant difficulty and hardship for the livestock industry, with foot and mouth and bluetongue outbreaks and avian flu. The president of the National Farmers&#146; Union said that the industry had cause to be grateful to Defra officials for their work in bringing the outbreaks of foot and mouth, bluetongue and avian influenza under control.</p>

Following the foot and mouth and bluetongue situations, the Government recently announced an aid package to farmers worth, I believe, &#163;12.5 million. Comment has been made that the average farm gate price for milk delivered in August this year was the highest August figure since 2001, although the right reverend Prelate told us in his thoughtful and thought-provoking maiden speech that increased feed costs are having adverse effects.

The initiative, which runs through the current academic year to July 2008, will also give young people a better insight into what happens on a farm, how food is grown, reared or produced and how it gets to the customer. Defra has also made a commitment to reduce net administration burdens by 25 per cent by 2010. The department&#146;s 2006 simplification plan contained initiatives to deliver an annual reduction of around &#163;160 million in administration burdens, some of which will assist farmers.</p>

There is nothing wrong with that, since nobody achieves change by giving the impression that there is nothing that needs putting right. However, I hope that at least some of the problems that the farming industry feels that it is having to face, or is about to face, can be addressed to the satisfaction of all parties involved. Equally, it is also fair to draw attention to some of the steps that the Government have taken and are taking to help the industry to operate as efficiently as possible and to address the difficulties that have been encountered, in addition to administering support policies agreed in Brussels that provide around  &#163;3 billion to UK agriculture.</p>

To be kind, let me say that Defra&#146;s delivery record as a new department has been at best disappointing and at times a total failure. Described by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, as a &#147;dog&#146;s dinner&#148;, Defra&#146;s broad remit and overarching role into several departments was perhaps too ambitious a concept. The department then had to deal with the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth, which brought misery to many farmers. It imposed closures on some rural areas, with devastating financial implications for many local businesses. Add to that the visual spectacle on television and in the newspapers of thousands of animals being slaughtered and it is perhaps no wonder that the department got off to a poor start.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="07120641000196">Unfortunately, incompetence has continued to dog the department. The single farm payment scheme chosen by Mrs Beckett was controversial because, applying only to England, it was different from the schemes chosen by the remaining home nations. Only Germany chose the same route. The RPA was given the responsibility for mapping the eligible areas, calculating the sums and paying the farmers. Due dates were set and Mrs Beckett kept assuring us that the money would be paid on time. March due dates were then deferred to June and, clearly, even this target was not to be met. My noble friend Lord Jopling has again stressed the failures of that saga.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="07120641000197">Farmers found themselves in financial difficulty and stressed to the limit, while confidence in the department fell to an all-time low. Between &#163;18 million and &#163;22 million was lost due to Defra management failure. Will the Minister tell us how many of the 2005 and 2006 payments are still unresolved and whether he has confidence that the 2007 payments will be paid in time? Can he tell me whether there are still any remaining IACS payments overdue? My information is that there are. Defra was then faced with fines from the European Commission for late payments to farmers. Will the Minister bring us up to date on what those fines might be? I understand that &#163;64 million in administrative savings were planned for Defra and the RPA for 2005-06. How is that going to be realised?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="07120641000201">Bovine TB continues unabated. It causes great distress to farmers to see their cattle killed&#151;still about 30,000 each year&#151;and costs the country millions in compensation. The Government urgently need to take firm decisions on tackling this scourge. The longer the delay, the more the spread of the disease continues. Someone within government must take a lead.</p>

The Government&#146;s reaction is to propose a major shift in the cost and responsibility for future outbreaks of animal diseases, moving that away from government towards industry. This comes at a time when the whole of the livestock sector is in severe economic crisis because prices have not adjusted to the steep increase in feed, energy and regulation costs. To suggest now that the industry should be picking up additional costs from the Government is unfortunate. Indeed, with climate change likely to increase diseases, the Government should think twice about it.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="07120641000203">Lastly, I turn to regulation. Defra has committed itself to reducing its administrative burden by 25 per cent by 2010. So far, only 5 per cent has been achieved. What strategy is in place to achieve its target and what areas of regulation have been identified that will make a difference? For a collection of relatively small businesses, agriculture and horticulture are disproportionately heavily regulated, and there needs to be better understanding across government of the cumulative impact across departments and agencies. Inspection fees set in the UK are not in line with fees required by other countries.

This is a subject which has not always received the attention it deserves, partly because we have tended to look at it as a series of different issues&#151;food, tourism, welfare of farmers, welfare of animals. This debate gives us the opportunity to bring those strands together and to encourage Defra in its pivotal role in the future of the land in this country. I am delighted, too, that my noble friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle has been introduced here in time today to give his wisdom and current experience of the realism and kindness of Cumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="07120641000206">Today, 6 December, is St Nicholas&#146;s Day, a day when that church tradition which we now celebrate chiefly in Santa Claus looks to provision for the future. As a rural bishop, Nicholas looked to the future by providing&#151;so legend has it&#151;dowries to safeguard the future of young women and protection for young men against those who would starve them. I believe that this debate provides the opportunity for Defra to show that it follows in the footsteps of St Nicholas by establishing a firm way forward which will defend and safeguard the future of our farming industry and the way in which that affects and contributes to our whole economy.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="07120641000207">I want to concentrate on two issues for the land as we look to the future. The church has long been committed to a vibrant sustainable agricultural sector for our economy. There is increasing evidence of the danger of agriculture coming to be seen as dispensable. We are less and less self-sustainable in our provision of food with an increasing proportion of imports. I want to come back to that in a few moments. One issue is the continuing price pressure which puts farming livelihoods at risk and which is an inevitable result of the dominance of the four great supermarket chains with their skewed buying power. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for drawing our attention to that. I am also grateful to the Ethical Investment Advisory Group of the Church of England for its recent survey, <I>Fair Trade Begins at Home</I>,<I></I>which raises for all of us the dangers of the pursuit of cheap food. Through case studies, that report demonstrates practices which it describes as &#147;invisible&#148; and &#147;pernicious&#148;, unknown to the consumer and accepted with bitter anger by farmers as simply inevitable if they are going to do business at all. These include labelling which obscures the country of origin of the primary ingredients of products, flexible payment terms which are subject in practice to arbitrary change, and promotions which are made at the expense of the farmer not the retailer.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="07120641000208">If farmers are to flourish as the Government wish them to do, there must be a greater control of prices  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1840"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1840</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and a fairer market. I believe that we need a supermarket ombudsman if we are going to achieve fair trade in this sector and I hope that the Minister will comment on that in his response. There are other ways of doing things&#151;in Wensleydale local cheese and ice-cream manufacturers pay more realistic prices for milk&#151;but these are small-scale in the general scheme of things. Unless more is done to end the silent collusion over the continued rush to cheap food, we shall continue to see decline particularly in the dairy and beef industries.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="07120641000209">My second point is to emphasise the need to return to the principles of food security and self-sufficiency and to do so before we are caught out by ever advancing climate change. The global challenges facing the world in the next 50 years make our countryside policies crucial and mean that Defra has a particular and major contribution to make. The countryside is not there simply for tourism, biodiversity and recreation, important though all of these are. There needs to be an increasing concern for food itself and I do not believe that we have yet properly tackled that issue. Andr&#233;s Arnalds of the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland makes that point dramatically when he argues that more food needs to be produced in the next 50 years than has been consumed in the past 10,000 years since the last ice age.</p>

<a name="71206-0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="07120641000210">The global food challenges are immense and Defra has the opportunity to develop policies which can respond to those challenges. Climate change appears already to be affecting many of the traditional areas of food production, such as the Australian cereal farms affected by drought. If we allow our own agricultural industry to decline, we shall store up problems for the future rather than, like St Nicholas, providing for it. There is nothing sadder than to go to one of those once-flourishing parts of the Yorkshire Dales, such as Grisedale at the head of Wensleydale, which has been abandoned by the farming industry. Indeed, the abandoned area is increasing.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="07120641000211">The most important point, however, is not the sadness but the danger. We have ideal conditions in many parts of our country for a vibrant farming community but its continuance is not inevitable. In 1988, UK self-sufficiency from all food types was  70 per cent; in 2006, it was 60 per cent. Self-sufficiency in indigenous crops was 82 per cent in 1988 and 74 per cent in 2006. This is a worrying decline. We cannot take it for granted that we can easily source food from across the world. Defra may be the most crucial of all our government departments at this juncture, both in securing fair trade prices for our own farmers now and, even more crucially, in a return to food security and self-sufficiency. Only in those ways will we be able to secure the future not just for ourselves but for coming generations in this country.</p>

By any measure, the past few years have been difficult for livestock farming. I shall restrict my comments to that

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="07120641000213">The hardships in farming have already been indicated by several speakers. They come not only from the loss of animals or the interference with their production capacity, such as meat, milk and breeding potential, but also from the disruption of normal trade within the country and in export. An example is bluetongue and the inability of sheep farmers, especially in Cumbria, which I know well since I am a Cumbrian, to take their animals to market, with the consequent reduction in the value of the animals and the extra cost of feeding those animals that farmers cannot sell or move to the auctions. This has been critically described by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle, and for that I thank him.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="07120641000214">The indirect losses experienced nationally from disease are well exemplified by the experiences of a few years ago with the lack of exportation of animals and animal products because of BSE and foot and mouth disease. The suggestion from the Secretary of State, as reported in the press, is that the Government are determined to press ahead with the sharing of costs and responsibilities in a consultation before Christmas. Sharing responsibilities and costs is based on the Minister's comments that the present situation is unsustainable. The press indicated that with the industry bearing the costs, this will be the second year in a row that Defra will be cutting back on spending plans.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="07120641000215">None of this is good news for agriculture but, as I think we know and as has been mentioned by a number of speakers, farmers will collaborate, or perhaps one should say they will comply. An increasing number of farmers are leaving the industry without knowing where to go and what to do. Unfortunately, a few have taken the suicide route to end their considerations. This cannot be good news for the countryside as a whole. If a greater burden is to be placed on farmers by sharing costs and responsibilities I think that the farmers expect Defra to be prepared, as a quid quo pro, to assist by way of an improved provision of services in disease control, as my noble friend Lady Byford indicated, in surveillance, diagnosis and the provision of vaccination to keep our livestock healthy. An example of support for livestock farming is given in the United States in the Homeland Security Program where, Members may be aware, substantial sums are poured into research and research training to provide the background of surveillance and provision of information of exotic diseases.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="07120641000216">I will set out a few examples where farmers expect more than is being done at present. TB in badgers and cattle is a problem that has been brought to a head in recent speeches by Sir David King, particularly that yesterday to the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee where he again dealt with the subject. A vaccine for bluetongue in this country should not be beyond our means or our abilities. We know the strain of the virus. We know the midges that transmit it. And we know that it will come again when the midges

Furthermore, I believe that a vaccine for tuberculosis in badgers is a strong possibility. I know that that is a contentious statement and the Minister may well reject it, but we have the knowledge and the wherewithal to take that on board </p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="07120641000217">A further point that is relative to surveillance of exotic disease is vigilance to detect and monitor the highly contagious entities that I say are poised to enter the UK owing to global trade and travel. Examples are African horse sickness, which is a devastating disease for equines, and rinderpest, which is almost eradicated in the world, but, if we are not careful, could rapidly re-enter parts of Africa. It may be of interest to noble Lords to know that rinderpest a century ago devastated the cattle population of London, in particular, where there were many small dairies; so much so that the then Archbishop of Canterbury offered a national prayer to save us from this plague. Whether or not that was particularly helpful, the plague was cured. Out of that came disease control by the Government.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="07120641000218">Surveillance has been shown to be particularly good in the case of the SAARS outbreak in the Far East. If they can do it with SAARS, so can we. Other areas are public health issues; for example, the importation of bush meat carrying viruses, which, if eaten, are devastating to the human population, and the importation of raw or putrid meat to celebrate the birthdays of people of African origin.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="07120641000219">I mentioned the Homeland Security Program. I have some good new. The programme for the training of veterinary scientists, the veterinary training research programme, of which I have the honour to be chairman, is going very well indeed. We look forward at the end of next year to having a substantial number of well trained young veterinarians who are able to pick up the programme of surveillance and help in the control of not only our indigenous diseases but those from overseas. These are examples of developments which will convince the farming community that Defra is on their side, not the reverse. </p>

The latest single payment scheme book runs to 100 pages; the cross-compliance handbook to 47 pages; the cross-compliance soil management handbook to 40 pages; and, in a little light reading, the set-aside update for 2007 is 9 pages. And, one I seem to have missed, the SPS handbook, is 90 pages. That is not allowing for the waste management paperwork, the ELS&#151;the entry level scheme paperwork&#151;or the countryside stewardship. I do not blame Defra for this paperwork; it is simply doing Brussels&#146; bidding.

Railway companies in this country, horse-breeding establishments in Germany and golf courses in Denmark and in this country all qualify in some mysterious way for common agricultural payments, which seems pretty odd. That may be a bit of a joke in a way, but it is not, it is a very expensive joke. Britain is still the second largest contributor to the European Union budget; France is by far the largest recipient of common agricultural policy funds&#151;very nearly twice as much as the next recipient, which is Spain.</p>

It is not even as though the CAP is a success. It is generally agreed that it is a gross misallocation of resources; it fails consumers as it puts up prices; it fails the taxpayers because they have to pay the bill; as many speakers have said this afternoon, it has not even succeeded in securing or improving farm incomes; and, perhaps most lamentably of all, it fails the third world and the economies of developing countries.</p>

Of the CAP it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"><a name="07120641000530">&#147;Internationally, it continues to attract criticism, creates tensions in the EU&#146;s relations with trading partners, and imposes significant costs on developing countries.

We were particularly lucky being north of the border that the single farm payment scheme was not administered by the English for us. That would have caused a huge amount of unemployment and the demise of agriculture north of the border. However, one of the quirks of the devolution system is that animal health and welfare policy is devolved but the budget is held by Defra on a GB basis for England, Wales and Scotland. That is based on the basis that GB is one epidemiological zone. While this is true, it opens the door to the sort of political wrangling between London and Edinburgh that we have seen over the past couple of months.

However, when reminded that Defra had paid for a welfare disposal scheme in 2001, he changed tack and argued that the amounts this time around were not sufficient to access the Treasury contingency fund and could, or should, be accommodated from existing Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly or Defra budgets. However, when questioned as to the top-up LFA payments to English farmers and whether any of that was in respect of economic loss, he had to admit that there was of course an element of that.</p>

There is agreement that the immediate imposition of movement restrictions, which prevented a repeat of the 2001 disaster and a &#163;3.5 billion bill to the taxpayer, was right. However, the restrictions have cost farmers hundreds of millions of pounds. The Government should recognise that, especially given the cause of the outbreak.</p>

Surely that should come back from the contingency fund, not just from the internal fund of the department. If that is not the case, what is happening is government by financial expediency rather than principled policy-making. England has been given &#163;12.5 million from the Defra budget.

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="07120641000236">As well as dumping its annual animal health and welfare costs on the industry, Defra would like to raise a levy to pay for any future disease outbreaks. Again, why should the industry pick up the cost of managing an outbreak from a body that cannot even manage its own laboratory safely? In Scotland, the industry already has a healthy working partnership with the Scottish Government Ministers and officials. Legislation for responsibility-sharing is not wanted  or needed.</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="07120641000237">Finally, I move on to the question of state aids. There are two points here. First, there is a strong feeling in Scotland that Defra will not use what it calls its negotiating capital to take forward Scottish problems. We saw that when it came to getting state aid approval in Brussels for the ewe payment and&#151;the issue that affected us in the north of Scotland&#151;the Orkney and Shetland shipping charges for livestock. It was a real tragedy that Defra would not use its negotiating capital because it said that it had more important things south of the border to take up with Brussels, rather than take up a remote Scottish issue. There is a mistrust of Defra on that issue. If Defra was to get that right, can the Minister assure me that Defra officials can present the Scottish case adequately and that Scottish officials and Ministers are given a proper and representative degree of interest in negotiations with Brussels?</p>

<a name="71206-0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="07120641000238">I have time to raise one more question. It is a wide question, so the Minister may not be able to answer it now, but perhaps he will write to me when he has covered the other points that I raised. Where are the cost cuts going to be in Defra? Given climate change and the need for spending money on all sorts of areas that have already suffered from Defra cuts, where will the cuts be made so that Defra can balance its budget?</p>

In its November 2006 report, the NAO calculated the loss to farmers at between &#163;18 million and &#163;22.5 million. Against better advice, the then Secretary of State, Margaret Beckett, insisted on adopting the dynamic hybrid model,

To make matters worse, that &#163;131 million provision was increased in spring 2007 to &#163;305 million. Can the Minister confirm that, and confirm whether that figure is in addition to the &#163;131 million and whether it will come off the future Defra budget? It certainly ought not to.

In two official inquiries into the outbreak, serious failings were identified at both the Pirbright laboratories. If robust systems had been in place at the Pirbright site, could the 2007 FMD outbreak not have been avoided? On this subject, I am concerned, as are others, about the statement by the Minister, Hilary Benn, in his speech at the Farming for the Future conference on  19 November, that a major shift of the cost and responsibility for animal health should be made from government to the industry. Does the Minister believe that the &#163;40 million levy on farmers to fund disease prevention after the outbreak is reasonable?

If the general population of badgers is expanding as fast in the rest of the country as it is in my county, Hampshire, I can well understand livestock farmers&#146; problems. As the NFU states, that is destroying livestock farming in more and more parts of the country, at great cost to the industry and the nation. The Secretary of State has asked for more time and space to take a view on the disease. I urge the Government to take robust and strong measures, as recommended in the Chief Scientific Adviser&#146;s advice to Ministers, given in July and published recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="07120641000246">I now turn to the organisation of Defra itself. None of the following comments is meant to be critical of the generally hard-working staff in the organisation. Farmers do not look to Defra to shield them from the realities of the market place or from their legal and moral duties to manage their land. However, they do look to Defra to work towards three clear goals. First, Defra needs to understand the  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1848"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important role that agriculture and horticulture play in national life. Secondly, it needs to realise that there should be a firm commitment to act, in a positive partnership with the industry, to meet the public policy objectives. Thirdly, farmers look to Defra to help to ensure that there is a level playing field in competitive conditions across the EU single market. However, the seemingly endless change in Defra has had damaging effects on staff moral. That makes it more difficult for farmers to develop good working relations with them and, because of the increasingly large remit of Defra&#146;s scope, puts farmers at the bottom of the list of priorities.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="07120641000247">Finally, I want to cover the implementation of regulation. For a collection of relatively small businesses, agriculture and horticulture are disproportionately heavily regulated, as my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke has discussed. Some progress has been made on the deregulation agenda; for example, the reduction of inspections for food hygiene for farmers in assurance schemes. On the other hand, there has been serious gold plating. Does the Minister agree that that has happened, first, in relation to the EU environmental liability directive, which has been extended to national sites and species, not just the European ones required by the directive? Secondly, there is the nitrates directive, which has been unnecessarily extended to include requirements for cover crops. Dairy farms, already under pressure, will be burdened with costs for slurry storage works that will cost the industry hundreds of millions of pounds for, I understand, a minimal reduction in nitrate leaching. Another case of gold plating involves the implementation of the IPCC regulations, which have huge registration fees and ongoing annual fees, which at &#163;3,000 far outstrip those applied in the EU and even in Scotland and Wales. Does the Minister agree about all this gold plating?</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="07120641000248">I have huge confidence that the Minister will, with his industry experience&#151; unfortunately unusual these days&#151;do his best to address farmers&#146; and horticulturalists&#146; concerns and will, in the same way that he has helped to clear up the RPA fiasco, address in his usual forthright manner the concerns mentioned by me and many others.</p>

Defra&#146;s incompetence was highlighted by the new single farm payment scheme in 2005, as others have mentioned. Farmers were assured by the Secretary of State that it would greatly simplify payments and reduce the burden of bureaucracy. Oddly, the Secretary of State then implemented an overly complex scheme against all the advice given by experts across the industry. The fiasco that followed led to extreme financial hardship and was devastating for farmers, a third of whom already live in poverty.</p>

No. She was promoted to Foreign Secretary. &#147;Good for farming&#148;, I thought, &#147;but heaven help our foreign policy&#148;. It is typical of the Government: livelihoods ruined but the perpetrator rewarded. Farmers have already suspected that the Government did not care where the food came from, as long as it was cheap. Until my noble friend Lady Shephard mentioned it, I had not realised that Mrs Beckett was so insensitive and stupid as to say it in public. We have had three Secretaries of State in the past three years. David Miliband was also promoted to Foreign Secretary. There seems to be a theme: do a stint at Defra, then you get to be Foreign Secretary. Is it not time that we had a Secretary of State who knew something about farming or at least business management?</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="07120641000252">One of the problems with Defra is the lack of a command structure, which leads to a lack of co-ordination. Like all farmers in Norfolk, and no doubt up and down the country, I have to deal with at least 12 different Defra offices. The mapping is done in Bristol. I correspond with the headquarters at Reading. Northallerton administers the single farm payment but the Newcastle office pays it. Environment schemes are agreed in Norwich but administered in Cambridge, and another office in Newcastle makes the payments. Livestock matters are administered in Bury St Edmunds. One has to inform Cumbria of movements but Worcester of long-distance movements, although to get the movement licence one has to apply to the Norwich trading standards office. There is another office for farm waste.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="07120641000253">That is absurd. As things stand, there is total confusion, not just for farmers but for Defra staff. It is high time that Defra was reorganised so that every farmer had just one point of contact to answer on all aspects of his farm. My noble friend the Duke of Montrose tells me that all his Defra affairs are dealt with by the Perth office. If it can happen in Scotland, why on earth can it not happen in England? The Minister is already aware of all these offices and I am hoping that he will come back with a cunning plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="07120641000254">Defra staff must be so demoralised with the present system&#151;farmers certainly are&#151;because they do not know what is going on, which leads to them giving conflicting advice. For example, with the recent outbreak of bluetongue in East Anglia, the Bury office would say one thing one day, while the next day the Reading office would write saying another. Farmers do not know where they stand, which makes Defra look idiotic and incompetent. The fragmented structure of Defra leads to confusion within it. No one seems to be able to make decisions, because they do not know the whole picture. I am not criticising those working in Defra. The animal health officials dealing with FMD, bluetongue and avian flu have done an admirable job. All Defra staff whom I have come across have been polite and diligent in doing the work that they have been paid to do. It is the system that is too rigid and inflexible, obsessed with form-filling and box-ticking.</p>

I said, &#147;Okay, but if I put it down to grass, where do I put the fence?&#148;. I was hoping that the office would reply, &#147;Up against the hedge&#148;, but no&#151;because livestock must not graze the 6-metre margin, I must put the fence inside the 6-metre margin, 6 metres away from the hedge. I said that that would look absurd. I then suggested taking the field&#146;s 6-metre margin out of the scheme and reducing my payment accordingly. &#147;No, you mustn&#146;t do that&#148;, I was told. A contract is a contract and cannot be changed and, if I put the fence up against the hedge, I might jeopardise my entire payment. So, the field is down to grass, but unfenced. That is completely absurd and inflexible and it lacks logic, but the command structure does not allow for common sense and flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="07120641000256">Agriculture and horticulture are disproportionately heavily regulated and the cumulative impact is crippling. Since 2001, there have been nearly 1,000 new Defra regulations. No one in Defra knows what they all are, but farmers must know. Heaven help them if they do not. Last year, my farm was inspected five times. All the boxes were ticked, but when I asked the fifth inspector, who came to Norfolk from Dorset, why I could not have one inspection looking at all aspects on the farm, I was told, &#147;No, that would mean us inspectors would have to go on endless courses to learn all the rules and then go on frequent refresher courses because the rules are constantly changing&#148;.

Here, I am talking about the foot and mouth outbreak at Pirbright. The Institute for Animal Health said that the drains were known to be dilapidated and due for replacement as far back as 2002. As my noble friend Lady Byford pointed out, Defra is the laboratory&#146;s regulator. Yet this report, which said that there was an accident waiting to happen, was ignored by Defra. Defra failed to regulate. This shocked and infuriated farmers and destroyed the livelihood of some, which led to a further loss of credibility and trust. The one time Defra should have regulated, it failed. I keep asking myself whose side Defra is on. Defra, or the old MAFF, used to be farmer-friendly. Now Defra controls and overregulates and it is strangling the farming community. Rife with mismanagement, Defra must get its own house in order.</p>

Unfortunately, although the scale of the problem was quite obvious then&#151;the fires were visible from such a distance&#151;the equally hard financial implications of the present crisis are going unseen. I declare an interest as a landowner with two hill farms.

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="07120641000260">The debate has featured a cornucopia of issues, which I am sure the Minister will address in great detail. I shall focus on a small number because, as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, pointed out, we had better use the Minister now before he becomes Foreign Secretary. My first question, which is rhetorical, is: why is Defra being hammered so hard by the Treasury? I was reminded of the event that marked the formation of Natural England. I am sorry; I almost lost my bearings, because it was in the Locarno room of the Foreign Office. In a rather long speech, David Miliband said that the Treasury had just informed him that large cuts were being made and that this was obviously very difficult to deal with. He added that he was not going to fight the cuts but that in his next year of office he would seek to reverse them and bring more money into Defra. Unfortunately, he never had a second year in office to do that and now we have a new Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, and further cuts are being announced. This is obviously an issue, because Defra&#146;s role is to act as a lead on farming.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="07120641000261">I know, as the Minister does all too well, that farmers are wont to paint a bleak picture, but I was particularly taken by a joke that I was told recently in the local pub. One farmer said to the other, &#147;What would you do if you won the lottery?&#148;. The other farmer turned to him quite happily and said, &#147;I&#146;d carry on farming till it was all gone&#148;. This is the issue: further costs and further bureaucracy. It has been pointed out that many of those costs come from Europe and not from Defra, but it does seem that insult was slightly added to injury after the outbreak at Pirbright. I commend Defra&#146;s role in controlling that outbreak, as I do its speedy action over the avian flu outbreak. Thankfully, that outbreak has not turned into the major episode that it could have turned into, which, just before Christmas, would have destroyed the poultry industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="07120641000262">As the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, mentioned, Hilary Benn announced on 19 December that there was talk of a levy being imposed on the farming industry to deal with disease outbreaks. This is not a new issue; the industry and the department have discussed it for many years. The timing seems to be rather unfortunate, given that many farmers are still suffering under the cosh of financial hardship. I have a number of questions about how that levy is to be introduced. First, when will it be introduced? Obviously there will be consultation if the levy is to be introduced at all, but will it be introduced under the new amalgamated  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1852"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1852</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Levy Board? The order went through the other day. The board is a welcome development. It will do a great deal to slim down and reduce waste, and I am hopeful that it will be a great success. The issue, however, is who will pay this levy and at what point it will be paid. At the moment, if it is paid at the point of slaughter, some members of the industry who rear livestock but sell them on will not be affected by the levy, which might fall disproportionately on one side of the industry. The Minister might say that he will not be able to answer those questions before any consultation, but I very much hope that the consultation will consider that major issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="07120641000263">The agricultural buildings allowance, which has come directly from the Treasury, is also causing some worry, as the Minister will no doubt be aware. Phasing out the allowance at a time when the industry has to upgrade its premises for animal welfare, which is an excellent reason, and as a result of the nitrates directive, which protects the environment, will cause a great number of problems in the industry. However, what concerns me the most is the retrospective nature of that cut. Can the Minister say whether farms that have taken on the grant will have to pay back money that was claimed under it? Perhaps I have got that wrong, but I am not aware of another tax that has been imposed retrospectively.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="07120641000264">There have been many cuts in Defra, which has badly affected morale in the department. It is very unfortunate that the problems with the Rural Payments Agency led to a switch of energy in Defra&#146;s work to deal with that crisis, especially as many people who were assessing the entry-level stewardship and higher-level stewardship programmes were moved away to deal with the crisis. I understand the reasons for that, but it is very unfortunate. I declare an interest, as both my tenant farmers are looking at the stewardship scheme. However, it is vital that many farmers in the upland area are considered for the scheme, and putting it off indefinitely is a real issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="07120641000265">My noble friend Lord Livsey made the very real point that, although there has been a crash in the cost of lamb, the supermarkets do not seem to have paid the same amount of money to the farmers as they could have. My noble friend mentioned Waitrose, which is an excellent example. I very much hope that the Minister will consider taking a stronger line with the supermarkets, because this is not the first time that this has happened. It happened during the last foot and mouth crisis; for it to happen again during this one, even though it will probably be a short-term event, shows that the supermarkets are taking a very short-term view. Does the Minister think that the Competition Commission should take a further look at this issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="07120641000266">Defra is concerned not only with farming, but with climate change and rural affairs. I will run out of time if I go into those issues, which are for another debate. However, I hope that the Minister will look, through the role of Defra in fighting climate change, at the skewing of the marketplace as a result of the rush towards biofuels. The case for using corn in ethanol does not stack up on economic and environmental grounds. It has had massive effects in America, where  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1853"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1853</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it has had an upward pressure on feed prices. There have even been riots in Mexico because of the cost of food. The impact in this country is that the cost of other feedstuffs for animals has risen substantially. Can the Minister tell us whether any work is being done with pig farmers, who have found that the rise in feed prices has made their industry very uneconomical? While looking at biofuels is, for reasons of fighting climate change, a good thing, there is a massive resource in the country: the large areas of soft woodland in the north-east, Wales and Scotland. When those are felled, the by-product of that waste will be incredibly useful. Defra could take a lead in that. Using wood waste instead of corn to form ethanol would be a much better solution.</p>

Both inside and outside this House, he is a highly regarded and respected Minister, who clearly understands the problems faced by UK farmers. Our purpose is less to criticise the Minister than to reinforce his role within Defra. Nor is our criticism of the staff, who work diligently for the department. Our concern on these Benches, and expressed elsewhere in this debate, is the failure of the department and the Government to establish a proper working relationship with UK agriculture and horticulture. As my noble friend Lord Jopling said, this has caused considerable damage, both to the Government&#146;s reputation and to all those who live and work in the countryside.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="07120641000268">The perception outside Westminster, particularly in the farming community, is of a Government totally disengaged from the concerns of UK farmers. I declare an interest. I am one of many Members of your Lordships&#146; House who will go home this evening to the real world of 21st century farming in the  UK. I farm in England, where Defra has direct responsibility, and our position contrasts acutely with those working with devolved Administrations elsewhere within the United Kingdom. I regret to say that among my neighbours, friends and colleagues this Government are not seen as an ally, but as a hindrance. &#147;Defra than ever&#148;, they say. There is a lack of trust and a loss of that sense of partnership which should be the basis of a successful farming industry.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="07120641000269">I know the Minister will agree that farming is over-regulated and burdened with bureaucracy. My noble friend Lord Cathcart has shown how Defra&#146;s bureaucracy results in a multiplicity of offices and service points. Many noble Lords will know how much time we spend filling in the boxes. Farming should not be like this. Those engaged in farming do so to grow and produce food and to cultivate and care for the countryside. No Government should impose such a costly and time-consuming regime on an industry where so many of the active participants have to do it all themselves. My noble friend Lord Cathcart posed a very pertinent question: why are so  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1854"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1854</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>many different inspections and inspectors necessary? The notion is that the regulations are so complex that no government official could be expected to understand them all. But what about the farmer, who has to comply with them all, at the risk of financial and legal penalty?</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="07120641000270">Not surprisingly, farmers see regulation and bureaucracy as a largely irrelevant imposition on their businesses, a tax that they have to pay to be in business and make a living. Why are English farmers subjected to a nightmare single payment system? My noble friend Lady Byford has been like a terrier in exposing its shortcomings. My Scottish friends received their payments on 3 December and the intention in Wales was the same, but English farmers will be waiting until spring. This year it will cost them &#163;30 million in interest alone, let alone the loss of working capital and facilities for investment. As we asked at Question Time today, what is the advantage of the dynamic hybrid model to them? What, I might add, is the advantage to Defra? It must cost a fortune to run. We discussed this at Question Time today but I still find it hard to see why the simpler scheme adopted in Scotland and Wales cannot be used in England.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="07120641000271">Many noble Lords have talked this year of disease and disaster. We have already had much debate about this in your Lordships&#146; House. Noble Lords have graphically described the costs and losses visited on farming communities. I will not elaborate, except to say that the unexpected is part of farming, so it should be part of government planning. What has become of the Government&#146;s contingency funds? How much has Defra been able to draw on this? Meanwhile, how is farming supposed to make up its losses? Cost-sharing proposals simply show how inadequate is Defra&#146;s response. As my noble friend Lady Shephard said in her opening speech, the truth is that the dead hand of the Treasury looms large.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="07120641000272">Defra&#146;s responsibilities grow, and yet it faces acute budget costs. My noble friend Lord Soulsby talked of the consequences of this for the industry. A demoralised staff face redundancy. My noble friends Lord Jopling and Lord Caithness pointed to the dangers of this. It is often the case that the best go first. This is a department that prided itself on its expertise. How can it get to grips with its problems and responsibilities in such a situation? One fears that the British farmer will pay the price. It may seem a harsh judgment, but as I said in the debate on the Loyal Address, if Defra were a school it would be in special measures and, I might now add, earmarked for closure.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="07120641000273">I hope I have made it clear that my concern is the failure of the Minister to achieve his ambitions for agriculture. He listens and makes it plain that he aspires to deliver, but his lack of influence over outcomes is evident. I take, as one example, food procurement by Government and public bodies. We all know that the Minister believes in a policy of sourcing from British farmers. Indeed, where possible, British farmers should be supplying all government agencies. All we see, however, is that this campaign, which was supposed to apply across all departments of government, has been a total failure. Can we

What do we expect people to eat in French hospitals, French schools and French government catering departments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="07120641000274">I know that the Minister gets up early and I am sure he will have heard the item on the &#147;Today&#148; programme two or three weeks ago about the meat supply company which, among other public sector customers, supplied Her Majesty's Treasury. It is now out of business and it was revealed that rather than making doorstep deliveries, its drivers were dropping produce in the street or throwing it over the fence. It produced in my mind a vivid image, an apt metaphor. I had a picture of the Defra delivery van driving along Great George Street chucking the carcass of British agriculture over the Treasury fence.</p>

<a name="71206-0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="07120641000275">The biggest tragedy is that we are now at the start of a new era in which the challenges to farmers and growers will be very different from those of the immediate past. My noble friend Lady Shephard mentioned a number of these. She dramatically illustrated ways in which our understanding of these changes will be considerable. Access to food has become a real issue. In a powerful maiden speech, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle also spoke of the ways in which this will impact on farming. Finding ways to preserve our countryside and yet provide British people with the stuff of life will be a major challenge, not just for British farmers but for Defra too.</p>

The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds made a similarly powerful point about its consequence. It will bring a whole new .perspective to government and it is not just Defra that needs to rise to the challenge. This Government must listen to the message of the failure of Defra or they will fail to meet the challenge of the new era. The Government need a positive policy which is designed to support and promote the farming industry of the United Kingdom.</p>

As he probably heard, because I think he was present at Question Time, I have spent most of this week in Cumbria. I have not been here until today. I have had my ears bent enormously in Cumbria. Yesterday, I was on a farm on the outskirts of Carlisle. A coach load of children visited the farm as part of the Year of Food and Farming experiment to encourage children to visit farms to see how they work.

Now she has this debate today, so things are going really well. What probably will not go down very well is my response. This debate is on the role of Defra, to which I intend to stick. I do not want to spend all my time on the RPA, which figured at Question Time. It has permeated through the debate and I should like to answer a couple of specific questions.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="07120641000279">I acknowledge that there are significant difficulties. I know that one noble Lord said that people are fed up to the back teeth with the Minister saying that he is sorry, but that he has still failed. It is true. In Defra, my main role, above all else, is the RPA and single farm payments. I do not qualify that at all and it has been the case since May 2006. The RPA has taken a wide range of actions to improve its performance: 98 per cent of the 2006 single farm payments were made by the end of the payment window, which is our legal obligation, against the target of 96.14 per cent. We of course have set challenging targets for this year&#146;s payments: 75 per cent by the end of March 2008 and 90 per cent by May. As I have already said&#151;it is well known&#151;for the year just finished, we started to test the system in January and started making payments in February.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="07120641000280">The RPA is not all about the single farm payment. It is the biggest payment scheme and is worth  &#163;1.5 billion to farmers. But the RPA&#146;s staff of 4,000 plus administer more than 30 other schemes, which are worth more than &#163;0.5 billion&#151;for example, export refunds and hill farm allowance. I have a list of dozens of them, including what some people think is the defunct school milk scheme. There are an enormous number of schemes. The RPA also issues the 2.8 million cattle passports every year, which are free&#151;unpaid for&#151;to the farmers. It is a public good for cattle tracing and traceability of the system. Originally, it was intended to charge for them. There is still a case for a charging system, but they are free to farmers. They help to demonstrate to consumers that there is traceability in the system. The RPA is responsible for that as part of its function and role.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="07120641000281">There are 11 or 12 single farm payments which remain to be paid from 2005, almost all of which relate to probate. That is no different from the previous IACS scheme arrangements. There were always delays because of probate, breakdown of relationships or changes on farms. In 2006, the RPA achieved its target, which is why for 10 months we heard nothing on &#147;Farming Today&#148; about single farm payments. It was not an issue. The target of paying 96.14 per cent of the fund by 30 June was achieved. The figure now stands at more than 99 per cent. Out of a total of 108,000, there are 115 cases where no payment has been made and a further 110, where, at the beginning of this week, partial payments had been made and the top-up remains to be paid. If necessary, I can give further information on the hill allowance. That is where the RPA stands. By any stretch of the imagination, the overwhelming majority of its work is a success. As I said at Question Time, we are paying more farmers more money earlier than we did last year. I can be confident of that, but I will not give any dates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="07120641000282">In terms of my response, Defra has been mauled over today, sometimes in a very unfair way. It is involved in a complex range of difficult tasks, as was identified at the Second Reading of the Climate Change Bill. It is staffed by a team who are working hard to assist the industry in becoming second to none. Defra and its staff want a thriving, sustainable and profitable farming industry. It is part of our strategic objectives, which is laid out in the public service agreements from the Comprehensive Spending Review. The strategy is no different. It was set out in the sustainable food and farming strategy. It detailed how industry, government and consumers work together to secure a sustainable future for the industry. There was a vision to create a policy framework to help farmers compete successfully.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="07120641000283">Yesterday, travelling along George Street, I was reminded of the Plumgarths vans in Cumbria. They were initiated by the farmer of the year, who created a brand new business for local food producers in Cumbria. They serve 18 Asda superstores, one of which I went to visit, which are leading on using local food. I was thinking about the vans belonging to the farmer who did it himself with initial support from various agencies and now assist massive amounts of local producers and supermarkets, as well as local hotels. They are not in competition, but are working together. I make no apology for giving Plumgarths and Asda a plug.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="07120641000284">We have to focus on being a smarter regulator in order for the department to being able to deliver. The number of people in the department is not the issue that counts. People have referred to this, but I cannot go beyond what has been leaked in the press. Being a smarter regulator does not necessarily mean having the same number of people doing exactly the same jobs that they have been doing for a while. We need to make public food procurement better. To that extent, I plead guilty as a failure. The noble Lord used my words: French farming Ministers would not stand for what happens here. It is unpatriotic not to use local produce where it is available, and it is available. It is as simple as that. More government departments should do it. In the health service and education it is improving slowly, but in a couple of our key departments, it is not good enough. Defra pushes on this and I have told it: &#147;It is not your job to count the figures. It is your job to change the policies. That is what we are accountable for under the public service agreement&#148;.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="07120641000285">So, this has been a difficult year, as everyone has realised. There has been unpredictable weather&#151;no doubt we will get the blame for that as well. Whatever flood prevention measures we take, more than six inches of rain in 24 hours would overcome many of our defences. Volatile commodity markets have certainly contributed, and that volatility may continue. For arable and milk, it is not bad at the moment; but we must be aware that it is still volatile.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="07120641000286">The summer flooding provided a stark reminder of what we face if climate change becomes a regular feature, particularly in the middle of the growing season. No amount of planning would have prevented that. The Environment Agency is also a

I want to pay tribute once again to the emergency staff of the Environment Agency, who never got the proper thanks for the work that they did at the switching station at Walham, near Gloucester. They did not finish that work off, but they started by identifying it, and moved. The members of the emergency team of the Environment Agency were not on television with their badges and uniforms, but they actually prevented that flooding. Had Walham failed, it would have knocked out electricity for half a million  homes.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="07120641000287">In many of the problems, agriculture has a key part to play. Farmers are among the first to feel the effects of climate change, and to be in a good position to manage those effects. We will be able to debate that during proceedings on the Climate Change Bill. The Stern review on the economics of climate change said that agriculture accounts for 14 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we need farmers to adapt to climate change; it is that simple. Defra is putting millions of pounds into research programmes to assist with that, particularly to reduce agricultural emissions. That is a substantial amount of money.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="07120641000288">However, that money is just a drop in the ocean compared with the amount that we are pumping into the English countryside. The England Rural Development Programme has a budget of &#163;3.9 billion, of which  &#163;3.3 billion will be allocated to agri-environment and other land management schemes, including the environmental stewardship scheme, which is open to every farmer in the country. Some &#163;600 million will be made available to agriculture and forestry to make them more competitive and to enhance opportunity in rural areas. I am pleased to tell the House that this programme has, within the past 24 hours, been agreed by the EU. We will proceed to full implementation as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="07120641000289">Of all the things that I heard, the one that worried me&#151;and I do not get too worried&#151;was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling. The stopping of receipts for the entry level stewardship application form was done only while awaiting agreement on the rural development programme. Because neither the money nor the agreement from Europe was there, we had to stop processing applications. That is a huge tranche of money, but applications will now start to be processed again and all of the associated paperwork will start to flow. The noble Lord was quite right that people should receive acknowledgements for their applications.</p>

That is far different from the time when the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, and the noble Baroness, Lady Shephard, were running MAFF. In those days, the farmers were paid to dig out the hedgerows. It may have been as a result of the Common Market and everything else, but that was the reality. In one six-year period, a quarter of this

I am simply pointing out what I know; that over a six-year period before 1997&#151;since I remember being challenged about this during my first time round in MAFF&#151;we lost a quarter of hedgerows in the country, because farmers were paid to take them out. It is true that a lot of policy changes occurred before 1997, including on the building of supermarkets in out-of-town areas. For that important change in policy, John Gummer deserved the praise. So I do congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, as I mean none of this personally. My point was just that farmers were paid to take out the hedgerows, and we are paying substantial sums of money to maintain and put them back&#151;and that is coming from today&#146;s Defra, which was described as shambolic here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="07120641000293">For another practical scheme to improve the natural and historic environment, look no further than the ruined Norman moat and castle at Kilpeck in Herefordshire. Natural England&#151;another agency to which we pay money, but do not run&#151;negotiated a new agreement that changed the way the land was farmed, which in turn enabled the area&#146;s archaeological remains to come out of damaging cultivation. Livestock was brought back onto its small fields, which gave a purpose to restoring the ancient species-rich hedgerows that has helped to bring one of our ancient landscapes back to life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="07120641000294">In addition to the flooding, the summer has also seen a number of animal disease outbreaks, which have been listed here. In response to each outbreak the department worked along with key stakeholders. Not a single major decision has been taken in this situation without consulting a massive range in the chain of industry stakeholders. Swift action was required. Being up in Cumbria for three days&#151;about as far as you can get from Surrey while remaining in England&#151;I realise that farmers understood that, with foot and mouth, we had to move fast to shut down movement completely, not knowing where it came from but having proved that we had learnt the lessons of 2001. That has had an enormous cost effect on the whole industry, as I have admitted more than once, but I make no point about that. The contingency plans were delivered effectively on the ground.</p>

It has 1,700 staff in 25 offices around the country and is the first port of call at Defra for most farmers. We need to have those offices around the country. I am conscious that this was

All that the noble Earl said is exactly true, from his own circumstances. However, those 25 offices are managing the economic and public health risks of animal disease. In addition to their 700 field staff, they work closely across the country with several thousand local veterinary inspectors from the private sector. That is our resource; on call and under contract as part of the contingency plan, and that resource reacted rapidly to the foot and mouth outbreak and to avian influenza.</p>

<a name="71206-0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="07120641000296">Within hours, nearly 300 people were working from the local disease control centres&#151;first, for foot and mouth, in Reigate and Guildford and then, for avian influenza, from Bury St. Edmunds. Now, those people came from somewhere, but not from those local areas. They had packed their bags at half an hour&#146;s notice to come from virtually as far north as John O&#146;Groat&#146;s, or from Land&#146;s End, as part of the Defra team to assist the farming community in those areas to manage and stamp out these diseases. Again, they were working with our stakeholders. I am not getting into the blame culture, for the reality is that when the disease was there we had to deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="07120641000297">Therefore, we have established robust frameworks to deal with such things, and clearly we will have a debate about cost-sharing responsibility. I cannot answer your Lordships&#146; detailed questions on that, but nothing will be rushed and there will be a document around which we can debate. We can have no debate without a document, and I freely admit that I have pushed within the department to have one so that we can have a genuine debate.

Equally important to the framework is regulation. I agree with much of what has been said here about over-regulation, and with some of the examples given. I was given direct examples by farmers and others during my three days in Cumbria. We have a policy of delivering a 25 per cent reduction, and we are about to publish our annual assessment of that.

We have to stop such things happening over a seven-day working period&#151;some came without any warning, ignoring all the biosecurity arrangements at the farm gate as well.

I was in two valleys, both of them six-mile cul-de-sacs. I had to drive from one to the other, which was the drive of a lifetime I can tell noble Lords. They were both cul-de-sacs, so it was difficult to get across them. I knew about the families I was going to meet before I got there. I knew their ages, whether they had children who wanted to stay in farming or had left. I knew whether the farms were tenanted or owned. I could work out from the information that I had been given by my NFU colleagues and others that, in 10 years&#146; time, they could both be wilderness valleys if no one goes into farm them.</p>

Those are questions that we must ask. How we pay that, I do not know. Quite clearly, it will not work expecting sheep to go to market and come back through the food system. It appears that that is not a viable proposition. Those questions must be asked and answered.

The quality of education in our country is an important topic for debate and one in which this House has much to contribute. I am pleased also to speak about the policy Green Paper issued last week by the Conservative Party entitled <I>Raising the bar, closing the gap</I>. The paper sets out many of the party's proposals for improving the provision of education for children and young people in our society.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of hours have been devoted to research which explores what makes a good school. Politicians of all parties have struggled to find the golden bullet to transform our education system overnight, yet we heard only last week that we have fallen in the international league tables in key aspects of performance in reading, maths and science.</p>

<p><a name="07120641000502">During Labour's 10 years in office, social mobility has stalled and we have fallen down the international league tables for educational achievement. That is both socially unjust and economically inefficient&#151; an unforgivable betrayal of our children's future. Teaching quality and successful learning are, however, complex issues and politicians should tread on this ground with great care and without preconceived prejudice. We have suffered for a decade from the belief in Whitehall and of politicians that the way to improve standards was central control, bureaucratic directives, oppressive targets and a punitive inspection regime, which has demoralised and disempowered teachers. The evidence is starkly clear; that the top-down approach has not worked. Something quite different is needed.</p>

They leave school at the earliest opportunity and sometimes truant even earlier. A third of a million pupils fail to gain five good GCSEs including English and maths every year, while 130,000 young people each year fail to obtain a single C grade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="07120641000313">Sad though those figures are, they reveal a more unacceptable problem; that of social disadvantage. Clever children from the poorest backgrounds fall progressively behind less clever children from  higher socio-economic backgrounds. By the end of compulsory schooling, at key stage 4, children eligible for free school meals are on average 40 per cent behind their contemporaries. That is unacceptable in any society and policy must address that issue not only for the sake of the future economy but, above all, for the sake of social justice.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="07120641000314">The stakes for young people are high. Research has shown that five good GCSEs generate a financial return between 23 per cent and 27.5 per cent. Getting only one to four good GCSEs contributes less than half that financial return. For grades D or below, the return is zero. This is where life chances are won or lost for the majority of children, yet the difference between the best and worst schools is stark. The top 200 state schools get 95 per cent of their pupils five good GCSEs, while in the poorest schools, it is just four per cent.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="07120641000315">There is wide recognition that we have far too many schools where standards are below expectation. Ofsted reported that of the secondary schools inspected in the autumn and spring of 2006-07, 51 per cent were judged below the standard of good and  10 per cent were inadequate. Parents in more socially deprived areas may well despair of finding the ideal school for their child. The challenge to the Government is how to respond to that failure&#151;a failure to which their own well intentioned policies have contributed.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="07120641000316">The simple, sad truth is that there are not enough good schools to satisfy the parental desire to find one. The extent of parental desperation was shown in a recent poll in which just under half of parents with children at secondary school admitted that they would be prepared to use any underhand tactic to get their child into the right school. Those tactics include embellishing their religious beliefs, renting accommodation near the school or using an alternative address at which they have no intention of living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="07120641000317">For far too long, the debate in this country has been about the endless zero-sum-gain distribution of who gets the good school places. The real question is not about admissions policies, it is how we increase the total number of good school places so that no parent has to be disappointed. It is therefore to be warmly welcomed that the Conservative Party is taking as a model for policy the experience of Sweden&#146;s past 15 years&#151;another country with high educational outcomes. This system allows new high-quality, non-selective state schools to be created, free from any political control. All parents have the power to take the child out of the state school with which they are dissatisfied and apply to one of these new independent schools. The schools are free and the money follows the pupil from the former school to the new school on entry.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para5">

Crucially, this degree of parental choice and parental involvement has brought about a rise in standards in all state schools. In Britain, the new academies, just like their predecessors&#151;the city technology colleges of the late Lord Joseph&#146;s vision&#151;have often been able to demonstrate the same lifting of standards and life chances for children from all walks of life. I freely acknowledge the wisdom of this Government in establishing these new independent academies within the state system, but it is sad that the Government have allowed so many restrictions on the setting up of these schools that the policy has not flourished as widely as it should.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="07120641000319">The Conservative Green Paper promises 220,000 new school places in schools which would enjoy a great degree of freedom. That number would meet the demand from every parent who lost their appeal for the school of first choice in the most deprived boroughs. As in Sweden, the money would follow the pupil, but more than that, the Green Paper promises a premium for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds, so helping to ensure that they get first choice of the best schools and best teaching. To implement this policy as quickly as possible, the current obstacles of centralised bureaucracy and planning rules which prevent new schools being established would be removed. Parents, charities, philanthropists and existing school federations would be encouraged to set up such schools in areas where they were most needed.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="07120641000320">Good discipline is a necessary condition of learning, and it must be a priority of Government to restore the authority and status of heads and teachers, to enable them to exercise their proper role. When pupils can with impunity defy and insult teachers&#151;even sometimes with physical violence&#151;discipline has vanished, and learning is unlikely if not impossible. I reflect sometimes on my small, four foot 11 inch high mother, who was a phenomenally successful secondary school teacher, telling me, &#147;You just walk in and expect the children to behave. When they see that&#151;they do!&#148;. I wonder if the training of teachers today gives that sort of confidence to new teachers.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="07120641000321">I therefore welcome the Conservative Party&#146;s commitment to shifting the balance of power in the classroom back in favour of the teacher, and in the school, back in favour of the head. This will mean greater freedom for teachers in exercising their authority, recognition by government of the professionalism of teachers and an inspection system which enhances the role of the teacher, and disseminates widely those factors which enhance pupils&#146; achievement.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="07120641000322">In recent years there has been too much inspection which has demoralised the profession through naming and shaming bad teachers and failing schools. I have said in this House before that telling people they are bad and shaming them publicly does not make them better and it demoralises their high-performing colleagues. If the authority of teachers in their classrooms is to be restored, and if inspection is to truly bear on standards, inspectors must look for the growth potential and work with teachers to build on the best of practice even in the most difficult and underperforming schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="07120641000323">The Green Paper promises improvements in Ofsted&#146;s methods with more detailed inspections for schools where attainment is poor, and lighter inspection regimes for those schools where the outcomes are good. I welcome this, as I believe teachers will, too. Discipline, however, depends also on interesting, even inspiring, teaching which engages the pupil from the moment a lesson begins. If children are bored, and the teaching is lacklustre, discipline can quickly become a problem. The expertise of the teacher in her or his subject is central to their ability to engage the imagination and motivation of the pupils. Well-qualified teachers, up-to-date and confident in their subject, are the surest guarantee of good discipline and successful learning. The shortage of teachers in the sciences and in many other key subjects is therefore a matter of concern where government action is clearly needed.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="07120641000324">It is not only what goes on in the classroom which establishes a climate of good discipline in a school. I recently visited the new Petchey Academy in Hackney, where the children are seated for lunch at small tables, with one child in charge as host, serving the others politely from well arranged serving dishes. Total order and discipline are taken for granted. This in an area where many of the children have never experienced a family meal seated at table. The overall effect was most inspiring, and the efforts of the children to make me as a visitor part of their lunch-time conversation was a tribute to the climate the principal and staff had established.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="07120641000325">Teachers are the most important ingredient of educational standards, and policy must be directed towards raising the morale, motivation and thence performance of the profession, which has been so severely dented by the climate of central control and loss of autonomy under this Government. There seems to be a belief among politicians and the press that the education establishment is somehow opposed to traditional teaching methods and a strong curriculum. With my experience in recent years, I have no idea where this idea stems from. The teachers I meet, the union leaders and the schools I visit are wedded to traditional methods&#151;indeed, it is salutary to remember that the much-quoted success of synthetic phonics in two Scottish authorities was an initiative from the teachers themselves, not driven by any politician. Perhaps it is the long-ago memories of the 1960s and &#146;70s, when a fundamental error was indeed made by education enthusiasts who believed that innovative and non-traditional methods which were made to succeed by a handful of exceptional teachers and heads, could be also made to work on a national scale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="07120641000326">In the report of the Conservative policy commission on public services, of which I was co-chair with my right honourable friend Stephen Dorrell, we recommend a new partnership with the teaching profession, in which senior professionals have a part in developing policy and an input in determining the criteria for their own accountability to the public. We also recommend the establishment of a royal college of teachers, on the model of the royal colleges in the medical profession. This would be, we suggest, a body to give recognition to a cadre

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="07120641000327">Such measures would be more than symbolic, important though the symbolism would be. They would provide Ministers with a body of professional expertise on which to draw, and a link between politicians and the teaching profession which has been sadly lacking in recent years. It is striking that the country which enjoys consistently the highest standards of pupil attainment is Finland, where teachers have a high social status and the brightest and best of the nation&#146;s graduates enter the teaching profession. No, my Lords, they are not better paid than our teachers, they are simply selected to the course of training by the most rigorous academic standards. While in this country we too often accept applicants with very modest academic attainment to train as teachers, in Finland entry to the courses is highly competitive, and only those with the highest qualifications gain entry.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="07120641000328">The teaching profession has no wish to return to the long-ago days of low accountability and a lack of rigour in method and content which characterised some of the 1960s and &#146;70s here and in the US. We have today a profession of which we should be proud, with high professional standards, and solid academic achievement in the subjects taught. It is now widely recognised that the traditional methods of teaching, with which teachers are themselves most comfortable, achieve the highest outcomes in pupil attainment. High expectations, close monitoring of progress at classroom and school level and firm discipline all achieve results dear to the hearts of teachers as well as to parents and the general public. It is these principles to which the Conservatives have committed themselves. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

I will leave the detailed response in the capable hands of the Minister, tempted though I am to make some reflections of my own. In part, the noble Baroness&#146;s vision is somewhat stark, to say the least. The debate&#146;s title begs some questions: what do we mean by &#147;equality of opportunity&#148;? What do we mean by school standards and by good schools? Do we have a common understanding or just individual assumptions?</p>

Clearly one aspect of achievement and of being a good school is academic progress. It is unquestionable that standards have risen over the past 10 years. Funding per pupil has doubled; there are record numbers of adults in the classroom, a number of strategies to combat underperformance, more personalised learning and so on. The number of teachers and support staff is at its highest for 25 years. Ofsted has said that today&#146;s teachers are the best generation ever. I have to say that observing some of the teaching in the school where I am a governor confirms that claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="07120641000331">Of course, challenges remain, but this Government have set themselves firmly on course to improve the lot of children and to improve schools. This is apparent in their development of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda, their concern about child poverty, the Children and Young Persons Bill and a children&#146;s plan for the next 10 years, in addition to school initiatives. I wonder where in the history of government anyone has tried to support children more, and I think that credit is due here.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="07120641000332">Since 1997, the number of schools where fewer than 25 per cent of pupils achieve five or more GCSEs has been reduced from 616 to 26. Primary standards are at a high level. In 2007, 80 per cent of 11 year-olds achieved the target level four or above in English and 77 per cent in maths. In 1997, less than two-thirds of 11 year-olds achieved this standard in either subject. I am sure that the Minister will give many more indicators of success. But schools cannot do it all. A member of the party opposite in another place accused the Government of blaming parents. I do not see it like this. Parents have to be supported and the Government's family policies show that this is being done but parents also need to be held to account for setting aspirations and boundaries for their children. Learning and appropriate behaviour and expectations start in the home. Sadly, this is sometimes missing and schools have a great deal to do in making up for such a deficit. This is one of the reasons personal, social and health education is so important and I will return to that subject in a moment.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="07120641000333">I want now to look at what I think a good school should do. This was touched on by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. It should foster and encourage an atmosphere where learning can take place and where social skills are developed. For some children, schools provide the nurturing environment which their home does not. A good school develops a love of learning, ignites aspirations, curiosity and good communications skills. It is not just about academic achievement and league tables. A good school fosters physical activity, music, art and culture. Indeed, I argue that academic achievement in some schools, including the one where I am a governor, is not possible without preconditions of nurturing, developing social skills and having boundaries. A good school does not allow bullying. It has clear values and a positive ethos. It encourages staff to develop and be ambitious. It involves pupils in decisions about the school, perhaps through a school council. It has concern for the personal, social, moral and health education of its pupils.</p>

When will citizenship be statutory in primary schools? When will we really consider well-being and the social and emotional aspects of learning worthy of high importance?

It is about enabling young people to feel in charge of their lives and not wafted between contradictory forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="07120641000336">The school where I am a governor, which my noble friend the Minister has visited, has a strong programme of personal, social and health education, with a deliberate emphasis on fostering self-esteem in pupils so that they are confident, esteem others, communicate and learn the rules of behaviour. Each class sets its own rules and pupils monitor these themselves. Inspectors have remarked on the calm atmosphere in the school, the self-discipline of the pupils and their care for others and the environment. The school I am talking about is not an easy one. Most pupils receive free school meals, some do not speak English on entry and parents are difficult to engage. Nevertheless, the levels that pupils reach in academic achievement tests are in some cases quite remarkable. Some children move from a very low base of behaviour and achievement to good levels. I note in today&#146;s primary school league tables for London that the English results in my school are higher than those in some schools which are above it in the league tables generally. I find that quite remarkable. I am certain that this happens because of innovative, inspiring teaching but also because of the positive ethos developed by personal, social and health education across the curriculum, and by the involvement of pupils in initiatives such as the healthy schools standard, the Sport England active mark, the UNICEF rights respecting school programme and many local and national awards.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="07120641000337">The school&#146;s strong policy on PSHE includes the aims of increasing self-esteem, finding ways of resolving conflict, exploring values, offering opportunity and guidance on how to learn. I believe that such aspects of learning enable children and young people to go on learning and to be self-respecting and respect others.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="07120641000338">Yet I hear that four schools in the north-east have recently dropped PSHE in favour of something called &#147;financial management&#148;. Research at Manchester University indicates that PSHE in schools is being significantly reduced. Yes, efforts are being made to train teachers and a new specialist association has been set up, but there are 26,000 schools and we are training 2,000 teachers a year to deliver PSHE. Some of those trained will change job, retire, or have breaks from teaching. At this rate it will take 50 years to train teachers in PSHE, by which time the turnover will have caught up with the training. This important area of the curriculum should not be left to chance. Can the Minister offer any words of hope?</p>

I add my congratulations to hers to all the schools, children and teachers who work so hard and do so well. I agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said about what makes a good school. There can be no more important subject than discussing how we might help every child to achieve his or her potential, but in doing so we need to reflect on what is a good school. To me a good school is not just one that shows academic achievement; it is one that turns out children who are caring, kind, tolerant, sensitive and enthusiastic about life and learning and who will turn out to be well balanced, good citizens for this country, enjoying themselves and making a good contribution to their communities.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="07120641000341">In that context, talking about school structures and school standards is a bit like taking a journey from London to Glasgow but starting in Birmingham. On Tuesday, I spoke at a conference on how to achieve the best for children in the run-up to the publication of the children&#146;s plan, which we all look forward to with such enthusiasm. The agenda divided the work into four headings: prevention through universal and targeted services; personalisation, tailoring services to help a child to reach its full potential; positive childhood, helping a child to be healthy, safe and happy; and working with families, finding out what support they need. I took issue with this, not because I did not agree with the headings but because I thought that they were the wrong way round. If a child is not healthy, happy and safe, he or she will not learn.</p>

<a name="71206-0009.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="07120641000342">Family support must come first. The people who are most influential in the life of a child are, of course, the parents, if only because they spend more time with the child than anybody else and have a keener interest in that child&#146;s success than any professional ever could, however good. Parenting is very difficult, but we have nine months&#146; notice of it. We really have no excuse for not helping parents. Of course, helping parents is very cost-effective, because the vast majority of parents have more than one child. If you help one parent, you usually help several children. Child development is absolutely crucial to future learning and lifetime happiness. It is a complex issue and we do not learn about it in schools. Parents can often benefit from the assistance of highly trained professionals. I saw that last week when I visited TreeHouse&#151;I think that the board is chaired by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones&#151;which is a school for very special children who are on the autism spectrum. I have never seen a better example of family engagement, personalised learning and multidisciplinary working. I would like to send a bouquet of Christmas roses to all the staff, parents and children at TreeHouse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="07120641000343">I can understand why the organisers of the conference that I was at put prevention first. Prevention is better than cure, so early identification is the key. Parents are the key to early identification. The early years are not just the best time to address issues but the most cost-effective time. That is the time that benefits the child most so that it does not lose any time before its special needs are addressed. Then what? What if a special need is identified that is preventing that child from reaching its full potential and from benefiting from the education available to it? I can tell noble Lords what happens if the needs are not addressed and it will come as no surprise. If the needs are not addressed in the classroom, children will become disruptive and they will behave badly. They might be excluded from school or get into crime. That costs us all a great deal of money in the end. So we need integrated services that put the child at the centre and listen to its voice and that of its parents or carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="07120641000344">We need to do that not just for the sake of the children with special needs, but also for the sake of the other children in the class whose education is disrupted if that child is creating mayhem and distracting the teacher&#146;s attention. It is for every child. How do we get there? It is not through an enormous, expensive, risky database. I am glad that the Minister for Children has announced that the ContactPoint database has been postponed, given all the recent scandals about lost data. We get there through changing the mindset of professionals and through good leadership. It is about the training for understanding other disciplines and when and how to involve them and interact with them. That is what I saw at TreeHouse. It has the advantage, because proximity helps: you see other professionals working together with your little charges. That is why children&#146;s centres and Sure Start schemes, which this Government introduced, are a very good idea, as are extended schools, which give professionals the opportunity to work in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="07120641000345">Parents do not care what letters you have after your name. They just want you to work effectively together to help their child. They do not want to have to keep giving the same information over and over again, which is why a certain amount of record keeping and the common assessment framework are not only necessary but desirable. Parents do not want to be stigmatised. That is why we must start with a universal service that has no stigma and which has the potential to reach every mother in the land.</p>

I am not just talking about &#147;yummy mummies&#148; groups, but about those hard-to-reach families who are suspicious of authority. Parents learn from and feel supported by one another. Health visitors are in a very good position, with their professional knowledge, to facilitate groups of parents who can support and learn from one another and from the professional expertise of the health visitor. This must not be the nanny state taking over and knowing what is best for your child. It has to be voluntary and wanted,

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="07120641000347">I now turn to school structures. You only have to look at any school to which the parents have made a conscious choice to send their child, for academic, religious or selection reasons, to see how important parental involvement and commitment are. The schools that succeed are those where the parents are really involved. Many elements make a good school, and I hark back to what I said earlier about it not just being about academic results. Today&#146;s league tables are worrying, because they are still there. I notice in the <I>T</I><I>E</I><I>S</I> this week that the high master of St Paul&#146;s said that he believed that league tables played mainly to the media&#146;s desire to publish rankings rather than having any benefit for schools themselves and that they are the worst thing to have happened to education. I agree with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="07120641000348">I worry about the impression of how Ofsted inspects and how it rates a school. Schools will say, &#147;If we are not being measured on it, we won&#146;t do it, because we do not have time&#148;. It is important that Ofsted makes it clear that it takes into account all those measures that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, was talking about. Children will thrive in schools that have good leadership and good teaching, good facilities and buildings&#151;I wish that they all had those&#151;an appropriate level of testing that is supportive and in the interests of the child and not the Government, the involvement of the community and accountability to it, and a supportive system of monitoring how well public money is being spent. Most of all, there is putting the individual child at the centre and ensuring that the resources are sufficient for that child. My noble friend Lady Sharp will say a little more about the pupil premium. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, has scrutinised Lib Dem policy on that and agrees with it. Your Lordships&#146; House will hear more about that when my noble friend Lady Sharp stands up in a few minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="07120641000350">I will begin with a question. It is not my question but one posed by Mr Brown at this autumn&#146;s Labour Party conference. He asked:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"><a name="07120641000533">&#147;Why should we accept so many children destined to fail even before their life&#146;s journey has begun?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000503">By way of response, Mr Brown shared with the conference what he had learnt from a visit to a school in Hackney, where he sat next to a six year-old called Max. Mr Brown said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"><a name="07120641000534">&#147;Max had been falling behind at school, struggling to read. But because of the Every Child a Reader programme, he was now receiving one to one coaching, and he wanted to read us a story&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1872"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07120641000504">He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"><a name="07120641000535">&#147;Today in education, private schools offer one to one tuition. But why shouldn&#146;t all pupils and not just some benefit from extra personal help? And because I want every child to be a reader, every child to be able to count, we have decided that one to one tuition will be there in our schools not just for Max, but for 300,000 children in English and 300,000 in maths&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000505">Brilliant. Let us do it and do it fast. Could the Minister in his reply indicate what timetable the Government have in mind? Can the scheme be extended right away to those in secondary schools, including those who are soon to leave, who are illiterate, innumerate, whom we have failed, and who&#151;I quote the Prime Minster again&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000545">&#147;are destined to fail even before their life&#146;s journey has begun&#148;?</ul>
<a name="71206-0010.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="07120641000351">I have one point to add. The cause of the problem&#151;reading or sums&#151;needs to be expertly diagnosed. Either every primary school should have a specially trained teacher to identify the cause of, and the best teaching approach to respond to, the needs of the child, or the local authority should provide that expert diagnostic service.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="07120641000352">Reference has been made to the league tables. There is one thing that we could be doing before Mr Brown&#146;s proposals are implemented. I have in mind the league tables for key stages 1 and 2. The placards that I saw when I walked into the House today demonstrate the weight and influence that league tables carry in public opinion. I agree that SATs have done good, because they focused our minds on achievement. Goodness knows, we needed to improve it and still need to improve it, but inevitably SATs can lead to teachers concentrating on the near borderline children who have a chance of reaching the required standard, to the detriment of those who have no chance. Those are the children who are damaged. To avoid the damage caused by the present SATs and league tables, at least at primary level, we should either drop SATs completely until Mr Brown&#146;s policy has been fully implemented or restrict the information on them to value added, which is the whole purpose of education. We can monitor national and sub-national standards by sampling, using SATs-like tests. </p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="07120641000353">In the highly competitive business of education&#151;competition by schools for pupils and reputation and to avoid the risk of closure through inadequate performance&#151;the league tables produced from the SATs and public examinations inevitably have a powerful effect. While they have had an effect on things that are tested, they are not necessarily the same thing as preparing children for life. Therefore, they need to be rethought. An example that perplexed and troubled me when I was carrying out the review on languages was the influence of the SATs on head teachers who perceive languages as difficult and especially demanding in the levels of marking that apply to them. What has happened since languages became an entitlement as opposed to a requirement is that the proportion of pupils taking languages has fallen from 80 per cent to below 50 per cent. SATs have a powerful influence, as any head teacher  will tell you.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="07120641000354">My third point is on managing the transition from primary to secondary school, in which those who are furthest behind are in danger of being left behind for  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1873"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good. They move from the good shepherd of the primary school&#151;a small school where they are known&#151;to the anonym of the large secondary without a good shepherd. They get lost, give up, become disruptive and are destined to fail.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="07120641000355">We should do three things, which I ask to be considered&#151;I am not expert enough to be sure. First, secondary schools should be accountable to the inspectorate for using effectively the information on each child that they get from primary schools, incorporating that information into the plans for teaching that child, especially for children who fall behind. Secondly, the secondary school should continue a similar arrangement to that at primary schools where there is a good shepherd who knows the child inside out. Thirdly, there should be setting by ability. Again, I quote Mr Brown, this time from his Mansion House speech on 26 June. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"><a name="07120641000536">&#147;We need a renewed focus on setting by ability in the key subjects essential to our competitiveness&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07120641000506">I would add, to the child&#146;s chances&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000546">&#147;like maths, English, science and languages as the norm in our schools&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71206-0010.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="07120641000356">My final point is one that I raised in a debate last month. Mr Brown said, and I think that this Prime Minister of ours gets a lot of things right:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"><a name="07120641000537">&#147;Past generations unlocked just some of the talents of some of the people. In the new Britain of this generation, we must unlock all the talents of all the people&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000507">As I said in that debate over a month ago, commission after commission has lamented the way in which we have neglected the development of technology and skills in education. Not only have we thereby failed, in particular, young people whose talents and potential lie in doing things rather than through books, but we have been at a competitive disadvantage. Germany, which has been an exemplar held up to us committees of inquiry, has retained a large and successful manufacturing sector. Look at what has happened to ours. In that area, we have been playing catch-up, but we have never done it. What the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, said last December is what the Samuelson commission on technical education said in 1883; namely, that we have advanced but our competitors have advanced faster still. We are in fact 10 years behind the leaders. The <I>Financial Times</I> said in an editorial in 1990:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"><a name="07120641000538">&#147;The absence of a tier of technical schools is the biggest single failure of British post-war educational policy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="07120641000357">The Building Schools for the Future policy gives us a once-in-50-years chance to provide specially built colleges equipped to the best standards, with continually updated equipment, within the framework of the Government&#146;s policies for academies and trust schools promoted by universities, FE colleges and business working in partnership. These colleges would be vehicles for delivering the highly technical parts of the suite of special diplomas that the Government are introducing. They would prepare pupils to enter higher education for a technology-oriented degree or to progress through an apprenticeship. I am not talking about a narrow technical education alone; I am talking about an education with a particular focus, matching that of the best in the world&#151;not just in Europe, but in the Far East, for

I say again that I am not just talking about an education in technology, because I believe, for example, that the arts are for every child and young person. I invite the Government and the other two main parties to reflect with an open mind on that issue against two criteria: how best to develop the potential of every teenager and how best to remedy some of the most serious defects in the British economy. I believe that such colleges have a contribution to make to both.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="07120641000359">I shall focus on the words &#147;action plan&#148; in the Motion. I believe that many things need to be done and I will perhaps come back to the volume of those at the end of my remarks. However, there are one or two points that I wish to be taken into account by any such action plan, whichever of the political parties is responsible for drawing it up.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="07120641000360">The first point is the place of language in primary schools. My remarks come from my own link with a number of primary schools in some of the more difficult areas of this city and, indeed, further north, where there is a particular problem that I hope the Government will address. I commend the Government on the whole prospect of &#147;Every Child a Reader&#148;, which I think is magnificent because it is essential and at the heart of education. However, a number of our primary schools face a particular difficulty that I do not see being diminished across the piece&#151;in fact, it is growing in some areas. That problem is trying to teach the skills of spoken and written English and reading in schools where a very high proportion of pupils do not have English as their first language, and in which English very often is not the first language of home, if it is spoken there at all.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="07120641000361">There are serious issues here about the ability and opportunity of such children to learn to speak the language in the ways that are naturally available to most of the community. For example, one can go to such schools and find they employ translators on parents&#146; evenings. I am not critical of that fact. It has to be dealt with and communication with parents, as has been properly emphasised, is fundamental. However, it points to the fact&#151;of which teachers are well aware&#151;that English is sometimes not the first language in many homes and may not be spoken at all. Indeed, there is little conversation in any language in some homes, let alone English. Because of volume factors in certain parts of large cities, English may not be the first language of the playground. Again, the natural opportunities to exercise the skills that all children have the capacity to imbibe are equally reduced, to say the least.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="07120641000362">Some localities have significant and sometimes quite sudden rises in immigrant communities. Again, I am not being judgmental; this is a fact we must take account of. It poses a particular problem for schools, as for other public services, and a particular problem

I want the Government to look at how many schools are particularly affected by this&#151;I am sure that the information is fairly easily available through local authorities and Ofsted&#151;to see whether there is a specific need or problem and then, ideally, target the resources to meet that need. I am well aware of the &#147;Every Child a Reader&#148; programme and see it having great impact, but there is an additional twist to it. The importance of language does not need stressing: without the basic skills of language, most of the rest of education will be inadequate and, in some cases, even pointless.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="07120641000363">While I am on language, I welcome the Government&#146;s positive response to the report and recommendations of my noble friend Lord Dearing. I would love to be able to welcome the Government&#146;s commitment of additional funds to implement some of his recommendations, and hope that the Minister might be able to give us the opportunity to do that soon. May we expect an announcement on the implementation of those recommendations in due course?</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="07120641000364">The third area on my short checklist is music in schools; I declare an interest as chairman of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. I welcome the Government&#146;s recent initiative and proposals for music in schools, and particularly for the enhancement of the ability to sing within the school and school communities. This is magnificent, and perhaps at last a sign that we are prepared to take music education more seriously than we have in the past. The intention is to improve the ability and opportunity for many children, who have not had it hitherto, to sing well and in groups and communities. I hope that this is the beginning of a more serious engagement with music in schools, and that it will extend to increasing the opportunity for more children to master a musical instrument through the education we provide in the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="07120641000365">The final point on my list for action is more difficult to deliver consistently. The Government must take account, as must those parties who would draw up their own plans, of the constant refrain from huge numbers of teachers and head teachers who find themselves overwhelmed by central initiatives and the paper that goes with them. Whenever one visits schools, that is the constant story. Either they misperceive government intention, in which case the Government and the department should be taking steps to make their intentions plain, or this is a reality. I suspect that it is a reality born of good intentions&#151;but remember what Bernard Shaw said about good intentions: the way to hell is paved with them. I suspect it comes from something we all understand. Ministers and their departments feel the need to be seen to be doing something. Inevitably, therefore, they do. I simply ask them to begin to prioritise, to reduce the number of initiatives. I ask the Minister to take perhaps a little time over Christmas to reflect on the fact that there is such a thing as creative inactivity in this area. Doing something is not always better than not doing something&#151;although, of course, I would expect my own modest list of things to do to be exceptions to such a self-denying ordinance.</p>

I am proud to say that standards in education have been one of the key objectives of this Government since they came to office in 1997. I am glad to see my noble friend Lord Adonis will be responding to this debate as I know that school standards have been a passion of his during his time in this House and I hope that he will draw attention to the many things the Government have put in place since the previous Prime Minister&#146;s call for &#147;education, education, education&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="07120641000367">Today I would like to focus my attention on just one borough&#151;the London Borough of Lambeth. I have taken a great interest in that borough and I am sure noble Lords who know London will know why. In 1997 there were no outstanding schools in Lambeth; today there are 16 outstanding schools&#151;one of the highest figures for any London borough. In 1997 there were 14 failing schools and currently there are no failing schools. On the basis of improvement, one Lambeth school is now recognised as the sixth best nationally&#151;St Andrews CE. On the basis of value-added education, another Lambeth school is recognised as the eighth best nationally&#151;Kingswood Primary School in West Norwood. In 1997 there were no schools with post-16 provision. Today every Lambeth school either has or has plans for sixth form provision. There were no new secondary schools built in Lambeth for  40 years until the Lambeth Academy was opened in 2001. The Elmgreen School in West Norwood was opened this year; it is the country&#146;s only parent-promoter school. Evelyn Grace Academy in Brixton will open next year and there is work towards another secondary school for Brixton under the BSF. All this is because of investment in schools by this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="07120641000368">I am pleased that in Lambeth the children of African heritage are now out-performing national standards. Black African heritage pupils form the largest ethnic group there&#151;23.6 per cent. Although recent national research shows that black heritage pupils still lag far behind the average achievement of the majority of their peers, the pupils in Lambeth were consistently the highest achievers at both key stage 2 and GCSE in Lambeth schools between  2000 and 2005.</p>

<a name="71206-0010.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="07120641000369">These improvements have taken place since 1997. All this has been despite having 150 languages spoken in Lambeth schools, something schools outside London are only now starting to cope with and finding very challenging. But Lambeth is forging ahead despite having had this situation for many years now and I feel that the Government should be proud. I am sure the Minister will agree with me that these successes have been achieved not simply because of the investment and leadership of this Government but by the teachers, the parents and the pupils themselves.</p>

In a high-skill service economy in a global world, where communication is vital, those at the bottom need, more than most, to have as many communications tools at their disposal as possible. I would like to see all children in the state sector, not just those in top public schools, have the benefit of understanding the English language through a basic understanding of Latin, but I guess that might make me seem irretrievably out of date.</p>

Higher education was our goal&#151;that must be the standard set for educational aspiration&#151;and nurturing a desire to go on to study and equip oneself with knowledge at the age when education stops being compulsory. Here parents and teachers play a pivotal role; without that twin support all the government initiatives will come to nothing.</p>

This grand scheme was launched at St Anne's College in October this year and it flourishes. It is a very small and organic step-by-step programme to breathe educational aspiration into young black boys. I commend the scheme to your Lordships. By engaging with the boys&#146; attainment in the key subjects up to GCSE, through the discipline of attending events and lectures and through opening their eyes to the limitless potential, schemes such as the NBBCA hold the key to the future. Only by making a good education a &#147;must have&#148; and doing away with the culture that it is cool or hip to fail will standards of all boys&#146; education in this country rise.</p>

If they do not read well, they are blind to the greatest repository of literature and ideas and beauty in the world&#151;the English language.</p>

It is not a higher school leaving age we need; it is better schools and better teaching methods. Her Majesty&#146;s Government tinker about the edges instead of tackling the real cause of the problem. They should ensure that teacher training colleges teach systems which enable children to learn.

Since new methods were introduced, there has been a steady deterioration in the standard of literacy in this country. Traditional methods have evolved with time and are now so effective that the majority of children thought to be dyslexic can be taught to read without having to resort to specialists. Most of those children are just badly taught, with dyslexia used as an excuse for inadequate teaching methods. Mr Ed Balls is to be congratulated on the assistance for dyslexic children announced yesterday, but much of the problem of dyslexia could be cured by teaching reading using synthetic phonics.</p>

A new enthusiasm for learning has been generated as those pupils discover success, achieving an objective through work and endeavour. That has improved almost all aspects of their lives. That is not an isolated experience, as private and voluntary schools, currently under siege by government directives and regulations, could tell you.</p>

It is very timely, because we have the document, <I>Every Child </I><I>A</I><I> Reader</I>, in our hands. It is a very interesting document and shows that we are concentrating on the right end of the education system: the early years. However, I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Dearing that the transition from primary to secondary school is equally important and that many of the considerations that apply to the very early years must apply again when children change schools at that stage.</p>

Worse, in my view, are the low standards in state schools compared with independent schools. The gap is widening in many cases and we should work hard to narrow or eliminate it.

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="07120641000393">I should like to ask the Minister some questions. Is the practice of allowing children to take tests when they are ready underway? That is the ladder system proposed in connection with modern languages by my noble friend Lord Dearing. I think that the Minister will say that it is. Will it be extended to other school subjects? It is used in music, but other subjects, especially mathematics and science, would benefit enormously from such a system. Talented, interested, competitive and ambitious children should be allowed to take tests, not at a time governed by age, but when their teachers judge that they are ready. That system would be more complicated. It also involves trusting teachers to advance a child up the ladder and to judge whether a child is capable of taking a test or whether he ought to wait a year and take the test at an older age than the supposed proper one. We all know that children develop at different times. The difference in development goes on through the child&#146;s life. Equally, we know that there are children who are very talented in particular or in all directions. For those children it is a torment that they are held back, doing repetitive work over and over again, to take the test at the proper time. I know that the Minister is in favour of the suggestions of my noble friend Lord Dearing but I would love to hear what he thinks of extending the practice. Children are competitive. They like competing against themselves as well as other people. If they have exciting targets, they work much better, with more enthusiasm, and enjoy themselves more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="07120641000394">I declare an interest as president of the British Dyslexia Association. I share the enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, for old-fashioned teaching methods in reading. One of the reasons that I think that this is a good and proven system of teaching is that it makes it easier to detect early signs of dyslexia. We cannot deny that it exists. It is a neurological condition that applies to reading and, in certain cases, to mathematics. If we teach reading the old-fashioned way, it becomes easier for teachers to know who is finding progress difficult. Those children need to be taught by specialists. As much as I admire the Every Child A Reader programme, it is not necessary to talk about one-to-one teaching for children who are falling behind. If the child is found to be dyslexic&#151;many of those who fall behind will be so found&#151;it is essential that they be taught, not necessarily one to one, by teachers specially trained to teach dyslexic children to overcome their difficulties.</p>

<a name="71206-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="07120641000395">As I have said before in this House, this is one of the areas in which, disgracefully, the private sector is racing ahead of the state schools. Will the Minister say how far we have got in ensuring that, especially in the first year at school and then again as a check-up in the first year of secondary school, every child is watched to see whether they have dyslexia or whether they have the same neurological problems with numbers as other children have with words? If they have such problems, they should have access to a specialist teacher. It is no good their being taught one to one by someone who does not know the technique of teaching dyslexic children. They will be worse off than before, because, as I said, the failure will be even more acute when they do not make progress. If they are taught strategies for overcoming their dyslexia, they will make enormous progress and their behaviour and their pleasure in learning will be equally enhanced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="07120641000396">Finally, I strongly agree with my noble friend Lord Sutherland about the importance of music in schools. This is particularly true of singing, as it is cheap. No one has to go out and buy anything to be able to sing; they can simply do it, so long as someone is there to enthuse them. Here I put in one very nostalgic word for the old-fashioned schools programmes on the BBC, which used to be marvellous for getting people to sing together. I hope that the Government will put every kind of pressure on smaller radio companies&#151;not necessarily only in connection with education, but largely with that&#151;which could put on the same kind of programmes that would help children to sing together in schools, and would be an enormous help to some primary school teachers who are very unsure of themselves where music is concerned, having  had no training themselves. One can do wonders with the radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="07120641000398">The debate today has been about two things: first, making opportunity more equal; and, secondly, raising school standards so that we have good schools everywhere for everyone. A very interesting report, called <I>Reducing Inequalities: Realising the Talents of All</I>, was sponsored by the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the Institute of Education and the National Family and Parenting Institute, and published in September this year. It revealed that, by the age of three, children from poorer homes are six months behind those from more advantaged homes. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said, the gap increases as the child gets older. By the age of 16, those on free school meals are on average 40 per cent behind their counterparts in terms of achievement.</p>

Therefore, the question raised by this debate is what, if anything, can we do about this? Can the education system, per se, offset the effects of social disadvantage, rather than reinforcing them, as&#151;I think we must accept&#151;some aspects of the present system do?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="07120641000400">Where there is parental choice, middle-class parents flock to middle-class schools, filling the waiting lists and leaving no places for the less well-informed, less well-motivated and less knowledgeable families from the neighbourhood. Where schools are able to select their pupils, as Sutton Trust research has shown so clearly, these trends are exacerbated, since the schools are anxious to be high on league tables. Given the choice, they will obviously opt for pupils who are likely to do well and bring credit to the school. We have now moved to a situation in which we have the banning of interviews, banding systems and the like, in order to arrive at a fair admissions system. None of these systems seems to work that well; we end up with the same problems. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of Southwark, mentioned, a very large number of parents still fail to get their children into their first choice of school.</p>

In some senses the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, and the Conservative policy group have arrived at the same place. We have argued that those from disadvantaged homes need more resources spent on them. They need smaller classes and more specialist help. If we did as the Netherlands and Finland have done for some time, and these children carried extra funding with them from their earliest years, schools would, rather than shunning them, be encouraged to take a fair mix from all kinds of different homes. We call this the pupil premium and we believe that it would help to solve not only the admissions problem but quite a number of the problems we have seen. It picks up on what the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, was saying.</p>

It would mean spending in the region of &#163;9,000 to &#163;10,000 per year on every state secondary school pupil, whereas we spend around &#163;4,000 on every pupil. It would mean more than doubling what we spend. If we had those resources and used them correctly, we could achieve a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="07120641000403">Let me pick up on some of the points that have been made about how we could use them. At three years old, disadvantaged youngsters are six months behind their more advantaged counterparts. Why? There may be no books in the home, they may not be read to by their parents; they may not even be talked to by their parents. It relates to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland: many parents speak a different language at home, while pupils are expected to speak and write English at school. They may not be encouraged to play creatively. They must catch up with all this in nursery school. They have to learn how to play and how to talk before they can learn to read. </p>

<a name="71206-0011.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="07120641000404">In any reception class in a primary school that covers an area with a reasonably diverse social mix the teacher will be able to point to several youngsters who lag behind others for these very reasons. What we know, because it has been tried and tested, is that providing these children at the ages of five, six and seven with the extra help of a trained adult, who reads to them and talks to them, helps them to catch up. I am absolutely delighted that the Government are picking up Reading Recovery and Every Child A Reader. Some noble Lords may know that I have been banging the drum about this for two or three years because I have been education spokesperson for some time. It costs an extra &#163;2,000 per pupil, but as I once said to the Minister, surely &#163;2,000 spent at the age of six is infinitely better value than &#163;60,000&#151;the cost when a young person is in a young offender institution&#151;spent at 16. As I say, I am delighted that the Government are picking that up, but we must use it creatively. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, is right. It is no good just giving extra reading help. If there are underlying problems, they need to be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="07120641000405">That brings me to my next point. The report published in September is extremely interesting because it highlights, among other things, the importance of emotional well-being. It shows that performance in schools and in later life depends on the ability of the child to cope with stressful situations and not just on his or her ability to read and write. The lives of quite a few children outside school are chaotic and turbulent. For them, the school represents an oasis of stability. But, from time to time, some of them cannot avoid letting their internal anger and unhappiness get the better of them, and they become abusive and disruptive pupils. Something like 10 per cent of young people in schools suffer from some sort of mental illness and depression. They need help, but at present do not get it. Again&#151;this is another bee in my bonnet&#151;it is vital that all schools

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="07120641000406">There is a considerable worry about the results that we have seen. It seems amazing to me. I believe that we have one of the best teaching professions we have ever had. The Government have put a great deal of money into schools. As a school governor, I see that coming through, and standards have increased. Yet, when we look at these PISA studies and the poll study on reading, science and maths, we are falling down the league tables. Why? Other countries are moving up fast. There is also a certain quirkiness about how these studies are done and there is bound to be some moving around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="07120641000407">A couple of weeks back, I raised a very important issue at Question Time. It came from the Cambridge Primary Review; namely, whether we are testing too much. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, raised that issue in her introduction. It is interesting that the poll study found that children were not reading because they were no longer getting pleasure from reading. Fewer children enjoyed reading or had books at home. Most disturbing was the fact that performance had dipped particularly among those children who were the better readers. There are dangers that, as a result of too much testing and bureaucracy, we are squeezing out the creativity and the fun from school. It is vital to put that back.</p>

My noble friend&#146;s report highlighted, as she did today, the inequality of access to high-quality public services.

That will also allow the establishment of smaller schools with a more intimate learning environment.

I acknowledge what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, said about the resources that the Government have put into education, but after 10 years of huge amounts of money being poured into schools we see some results declining. Surely, the Minister will agree with us that we need to change tack.</p>

It will come as no surprise that right at the top were a strict uniform code, setting and discipline; parental involvement, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, spoke so well; and respect.

I cannot imagine how the Government will keep dissatisfied 16 to 18 year-olds in school training when they cannot keep hold of the ones they have now.

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="07120641000420">However, many children are disruptive because they are struggling. Tackling underachievement early must be a priority before it has a chance to have a knock-on effect and handicap a child&#146;s ability to perform in secondary school. For that reason, we were disappointed by the report published last month by the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study. It showed that since 2001, England has plummeted from third to 19th in the international reading literacy tables. Only Morocco and Romania saw sharper declines. When its last report was published in 2003, the Government took it as a sign of their achievement, so are the Government willing to take these recent results as a sign that not all is well?</p>

I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, that without language, most of what a child does at school will be inadequate and pointless. For us, every child reading by the end of their first two years at primary school, other than those with the most severe special educational needs, is not just a target: it is about our standards and values.

Will the Government do the same? Equally important, any review of underachievement must turn the spotlight on the many children struggling in mixed-ability classes.

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="07120641000426">I am glad to say that we have many good schools and that the number has been increasing in recent years. Ofsted now rates nearly two out of three schools as good or outstanding. The proportion of schools judged inadequate now stands at only 6 per cent. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, suggested that I would be relentlessly upbeat in my remarks. I do try to be generally upbeat: I think that it is the job of the Minister to be as optimistic as possible&#151;someone has to be. My motto in the area is &#147;no complacency&#148;. Visiting schools every week as I do, I am the last person to be complacent about the challenges that we face. I will be frank with the House: 6 per cent of schools that are judged inadequate is 6 per cent too many. Two out of three schools judged good or outstanding is not good enough: we need to see a significant increase in the numbers that are marked good or outstanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="07120641000427">It is a particular concern to the Government that more than 600 secondary schools failed to achieve our new ambition for every secondary school of 30 per cent or more pupils achieving five or more good GSCE passes, including English and maths. The figure was 1,600 in 1997, so there has been a great improvement. We need to see a more significant improvement still. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said that hundreds of thousands of hours had been spent by researchers in seeking to identify success factors in schools. That is rather depressing for me because I have about 15 minutes left in which to summarise those success factors and what the Government are doing to nurture them. However, I think that there will be general agreement across the House that there are five essential elements in producing more good schools: first, there need to be enough effective teachers and support staff. Without good teachers we will achieve nothing in education and we need more of them.</p>

<a name="71206-0012.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="07120641000428">Secondly, every school needs an effective head teacher and school leadership team.

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="07120641000430">The Government are focused on all five of those key priorities and I will take them in turn; first, I turn to teachers. There are now 36,000 more teachers in our schools than there were in 1997 and there has been a doubling in the number of assistants in our schools since 1997: 174,000 more. That is thanks to a significant increase in funding that has been made available. There has been an 88 per cent real-terms increase in funding in education since 1997, which above all else has enabled the increase in the number and remuneration of teachers to take place. The real-terms pay of teachers has increased by 16 per cent; the real-terms pay of head teachers has increased by 29 per cent; and a number of incentives to encourage the recruitment of new teachers have been put in place since 1997.</p>

<a name="71206-0012.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="07120641000431">I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that we have the best teaching profession that we have ever had. Ofsted reports certainly support that view. Meeting new entrants into the profession week by week, as I do, I am very pleased to see the quality of those we are recruiting. Our policy on the training and recruitment of teachers has a number of strands which have sought to address specific problems. We have sought to address the historical problem of the recruitment of maths and science teachers&#151;of whom there were acute shortages in the 1990s&#151;through dedicated recruitment incentives geared particularly to those groups. We have introduced golden helloes, which my noble friend Lady Morgan of Drefelin once famously described as golden haloes. That was a good way of describing them because we want to give them haloes as well. Golden helloes have had a significant impact in helping us to recruit science and maths teachers and we have continued those. We have introduced training bursaries, which are enhanced in shortage subjects, so that students no longer have to train at their own expense, which was the case in the PGCE year when they sought to train. They can now do so with a bursary in place.</p>

<a name="71206-0012.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="07120641000432">We have sought to increase significantly the training available, particularly in maths and science where it was deficient, with a national centre for excellence in mathematics education, the National Science Learning Centre and regional centres in science education which have sought to bring the worlds of higher education and schools together in the training of teachers. All these initiatives have borne fruit. The latest figures from the Training and Development Agency for Schools show that there is expected to be a total of 2,470 entrants to mathematics initial teacher training in 2007-08, compared to 1,500 in 1997, and the comparable figures for science are 3,700 recruited this year against 2,800 in 1997. So we have brought about a step change in the recruitment of maths and science teachers, and not before time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="07120641000433">We have sought to take forward two other crucial initiatives in enhancing the quality of the teaching profession. First, we have sought to boost the mid-career route into teaching. Like other professions, teaching will no longer be a lifelong profession that young people will choose immediately after graduation. We need to enhance the opportunity for career switchers to move into teaching. This is why we have very significantly expanded the graduate teacher programme that makes it possible for mid-career switchers to come into teaching. For the first time the average age of new teachers now in this country is 30. It has been rising steadily. This year there are 7,200 entrants into teaching by employment-based routes, most of them mature entrants, which is a huge increase on the position in 1997.</p>

<a name="71206-0012.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="07120641000434">Our other key priority is to attract more of our most talented graduates into teaching and for them to regard teaching as a career of choice. I pay tribute to all those who have played such an important part in establishing Teach First, the new programme aimed particularly at the highest achieving graduates. It is based on a completely new model which does not require them to undertake a PGCE but to train over the summer as a group, going into schools for two years in groups so that a real esprit de corps develops. It is branded and run by the private sector. Much to our surprise, the evidence shows that nearly half the students in Teach First have stayed on in teaching beyond two years, even though they could follow much higher paid careers. These could provide some of our most talented future school leaders.</p>

<a name="71206-0012.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="07120641000435">That leads me on to school leadership. We need more talented school leaders. That is why, for the first time in the history of our education system, the Government have provided for head teachers to be systematically trained. Before the establishment of the National College for School Leadership and the development of the national professional qualification for headship, NPQH, there was in this country no systematic training of head teachers whatever. When we come to look back on that, I believe that it will be regarded as a colossal failure in the provision of training and support within the education system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="07120641000436">We established the National College for School Leadership, which is doing excellent work under Steve Mumby in Nottingham, but with programmes run nationwide. In 1998, there were 780 teachers studying for the NPQH. In the last full year for which we have figures, there were 4,355, so there has been a big increase in the number of talented senior teachers who are now coming forward to take the NPQH to make themselves eligible for headship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="07120641000437">I believe that other reforms in the system have also enhanced the attraction of becoming a head teacher. In particular, I highlight the greater delegation of budgets and responsibility to schools. That reform goes back 20 years; we have enhanced it but it was started under the previous Government with the policy of local management of schools. If we want head teachers to be really in charge of their schools, they have got to be in charge of the budget, and they must have real managerial responsibility for those areas that determine the success of a school. That is

That leads to a real sense of ownership and of the rewards for leadership that come with being a head teacher and being a school leader in the wider sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="07120641000438">Several noble Lords referred to failing schools and the setting up of new schools. Very many underperforming schools are turned around without the need for drastic remedies such as closure or the establishment of new schools. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, in her Motion, refers to the need for an action plan. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, who was one of Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspectors, will be only too well aware, the term &#147;action plan&#148; in education comes with a particular reputation attached, because it is what Ofsted requires schools to produce when they are put in the category of underperformance or failure. The action plan regime at school level, concentrating the minds of school leaders on the need to bring about defined improvements where defined weaknesses have been identified, has been highly successful in improving schools. I gave the numbers earlier in respect of schools that have improved. Some 1,668 schools have come out of special measures since 1997, so there has been remarkable success in the Ofsted regime in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="07120641000439">However, sometimes schools do need to close, and it is important that there are mechanisms for establishing new schools. Those mechanisms have been significantly enhanced both by the academies programme which several noble Lords have mentioned, and by the new levers for local authority commissioning that are made available by the Education and Inspections Act, which the House enacted last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="07120641000440">Let me make it absolutely clear that the Government are accelerating the academies programme; we are not in any way slowing it down. We have 83 academies open and about 50 academies will open next year, which will be the largest number that we have opened in any single year. I can almost name them all because I have played such a role in respect of them. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that there is no weakening or slackening in respect of this policy at all. We are committed to a target of 400. I hope that we will be able to open 50 a year in the years after next year too. We have dispensed with the &#163;2 million sponsorship requirement in respect of universities and successful schools, which was an impediment to many successful organisations coming behind academies. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to the review, which is not in any way questioning the academies policy. It is helping us to ensure that we deliver as successfully as we can on the policy as it is announced. It would be quite remarkable if the Government were not seeking to analyse how we can make the best of our own policy.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Howard, so rightly said, a child who cannot read cannot learn. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we give primacy to the cause of literacy in our primary schools. He was wrong when he said that he thought that the Government had been hobbled in their commitment to synthetic phonics and tried-and-tested&#151;dare one say?&#151;old-fashioned mechanisms for the teaching of reading, which have been so successful. I come before the House unhobbled. I am unashamed in my support for synthetic phonics. The Government appointed Sir Jim Rose to conduct a thoroughgoing inquiry into teaching methods in primary schools two years ago, which has led us to introduce new guidance to schools giving absolute pride of place to synthetic phonics in the teaching methods that we expect in schools, because of the success that is so clearly apparent where it has been used.</p>

That is being rolled out. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, asked at what rate it was being rolled out&#151;it will benefit 5,000 children in 2007-08, increasing to about 30,000 by 2010-11. We want to see it increase, but, I should stress, that is the nationally funded element of Every Child a Reader. There is nothing to stop any primary school using its delegated budget to adopt similar techniques, including small group tuition, and if necessary, one-to-one tuition, for children who are falling behind. Most well run primary schools do precisely that. As in many other areas, we are giving a national lead in respect of best practice, which effective leaders observe in their schools in any event.

Only two weeks ago we announced an investment of more than &#163;330 million to enhance predominantly instrumental tuition in schools. We want every primary school child to have an opportunity to start learning a musical instrument free of charge. We are providing at least &#163;10 million a year for the purchase of musical instruments. We accept that the human voice is free and are keen for there to be a big expansion of singing.

Owing to that, and because in this speech I, too, shall be critical, I should like to make one thing clear from the outset: I accept, as did the whole committee, that the exchange of information between the security services and police of different countries can be vital in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime. However, the exchange of information about individuals also carries with it risks. The problem is to strike the balance between public security and individual privacy.

Pr1/4m is a small town less than 50 miles from Schengen and it shares with Schengen the distinction of having been virtually unknown until a treaty was signed there. Both treaties were the initiatives of member states that felt that matters at EU level were proceeding too slowly for their liking. However, while at the date of the Schengen agreement in 1985 there was no alternative procedure, by the time Germany began negotiations with some of its neighbours in 2004 to improve cross-border co-operation, the procedure of enhanced co-operation was available under the treaties. It had never been used; it still never has. Instead, negotiations took place with very little publicity and led to the signature of the Pr1/4m treaty in May 2005. That treaty provided a mechanism for seven states to exchange among themselves information on DNA profiles, vehicle registrations and what are called dactyloscopic data&#151;  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1895"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1895</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>though I prefer the Anglo-Saxon term, &#147;fingerprints&#148;. The treaty ignored work already being done at EU level. In evidence to the committee, Mr Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor, said that the states party to the Pr1/4m treaty had,</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000549">&#147;evaded the substantive and procedural requirements of enhanced cooperation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000510">He thought it arguable that the treaty breached the law of the European Union.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="07120641000458">The German presidency began in January this year. Within a fortnight, the German Interior Minister started his attempt to have the main provisions of the treaty incorporated into EU law and, within six months, he had succeeded. Yet that was achieved only because the proposal was put forward with no consultation, no explanatory memorandum, no impact assessment, no overall evaluation of the operation of the treaty, no estimate of the cost to member states and minimal involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments. The only involvement of this Parliament was the Select Committee&#146;s report. In such negotiations as there were, the only achievement of this Government of any significance was the removal of the provisions on hot pursuit across national borders.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="07120641000459">The decision incorporating the treaty into EU law was adopted at the end of June, but much of the detail was left to an implementing decision. This, too, was brought out in June, again without consultation, explanatory memorandum, impact assessment or cost assessment. The committee considered it in July and raised questions with the Government. Last week, the committee considered it again, but now it is too late for our comments to have any effect, as last month the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed the decision. This, the Home Office tells us, does not amount to a scrutiny override because only a general approach was agreed, not the final text of the decision. That, I submit, is an unreal distinction to draw. Any agreement, whatever name is given to it, that is reached on a document not cleared from scrutiny amounts to a scrutiny override if the result is that negotiations cannot in practice be reopened. That has for some time been the view of your Lordships&#146; committee, and that view is now shared by the European Scrutiny Committee in another place. The result is that this country has, in effect, been made party to a multilateral treaty with almost no involvement in its terms, let alone the involvement of Parliament. That is no way to legislate in a democracy.</p>

PNR consists of detailed personal information about airline passengers that has to be transferred to the country of destination if a passenger is to be allowed to land, or even to overfly, that country. The country that is understandably most anxious to be certain of the precise identity of passengers, and hence requires most detail, is the United States, which regards the exchange of personal information as a vital element of the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The purpose of PNR agreements is to ensure that only essential information is disclosed, that it is used only for the purposes intended and that it is kept for no longer than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="07120641000461">The first agreement with the United States was concluded in 2004. It left much to be desired, but was far better than nothing. However, it very shortly became nothing, for it was annulled by the European Court of Justice in May 2006 for technical reasons with which I shall not weary your Lordships. Suffice it to say that the EU had three months to negotiate a new agreement. The Commission negotiators thus started from a position of weakness. The US was not under any pressure of time, but the EU was. The interim agreement that they concluded repeated all the undertakings in the 2004 agreement but was accompanied&#151;and this is a significant point&#151;by a letter from the United States Department of Homeland Security, the DHS, which,</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000550">&#147;is intended to set forth our understandings with regard to the interpretation of a number of provisions of the ... Undertakings&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="07120641000462">However, the 2006 agreement was, as I have said, only an interim agreement. It expired in July this year. The EU thus had until then to negotiate an agreement with provisions that meant what they said. We suggested in our report what those provisions might be: limits on the data elements transferred to the US; limits on the uses to which they could be put; and limits on the time for which the data could be kept. All these matters, we argued, should be limited to what was essential to the fight against terrorism and should all be subject to effective safeguards. We called on the Government to use their considerable influence with the United States to help to achieve this aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="07120641000512">We hoped for an agreement that, even if it was not ideal, would at least mean what it said. We said that, in our view, the worst possible conclusion would be an agreement that again was accompanied by a letter allowing the United States to disregard its provisions almost at will. Yet this is precisely what emerged in July from the negotiations: an agreement that, taken alone, should and would have been a triumph for the Commission negotiators, accompanied by a letter from the DHS, agreed by the Commission negotiators, allowing the United States to interpret its provisions as broadly as it liked. The vital provisions are in the letter, not the agreement. It is the letter and not the agreement that lists the PNR data to be transferred, a list that appears to be shorter than the one in the previous agreement but in fact contains only two data elements fewer. It is the letter that states that the data will be retained for seven years instead of three and a half years as previously. It is the letter that explains that the United States will use the data strictly for the listed purposes,</p>

Why did they accept the proposal before an adequate data protection framework had been agreed? Why have they quite unnecessarily agreed an implementing decision that is still subject to scrutiny? In the case of PNR, the questions are still more serious. To what extent, if at all, did they make use of our special relationship with the United States to attempt to influence the negotiations? Why are they content to be party to an agreement that, like the bilateral extradition treaty, is so biased in favour of the United States?

It is more important than is apparent from the time slot it has been allocated. That is to pay no disrespect to the authors of the report. I have the highest regard  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1898"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1898</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Sub-Committee F, and, if I may say on a personal basis, for its former chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, who often visits us in Brussels in the civil liberties committee. Like him, I have no hesitation in stressing the need for data exchange, both within the European Union and across the Atlantic. We need to overcome bureaucratic obstacles, eliminate turf wars and jealousies and make our legal systems and the safeguards interactive. We need to have effective arrangements to ensure that suspected terrorists and major criminals are apprehended. Therefore, I do not wish anything I say from now on to give grounds to a charge of being soft on terrorism.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="07120641000466">The problem is that both the Pr1/4m decision and the PNR agreement have run far ahead of data protection safeguards and outwith proper democratic controls. That matters particularly because we are on what I will refer to as a merry-go-round, which is spinning faster and faster in terms of data sharing and the creation of databases. I believe that there is a sort of Ministers&#146; and officials&#146; playground in which they are using and abusing the inadequate framework for EU law enforcement efforts.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="07120641000467">There is a democracy deficit of both Pr1/4m and PNR. MEPs&#146; views could simply be ignored as we had no co-decision on either, and if you have mere consultation, believe me, it gives you no leverage whatever. On PNR, national Parliaments will be given a take-it or leave-it choice, simply being asked to ratify a concluded agreement. Pr1/4m is a particular scandal. It was negotiated as a simple international treaty, ratified by the Bundestag after a mere half an hour&#146;s debate and then pushed through the Council machinery in Brussels as a German member state initiative to emerge as an EU decision. That is not the way to run a whelk stall.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="07120641000468">The Government tell us in response to the committee&#146;s proper call to require the Commission to produce an evaluation report for the Council, the European Parliament and national Parliaments, that the Commission will submit a report after four years, but that it will be to the Council only and more detailed provisions will be set out in an implementing decision, which will not be subject to the views of anyone but the member states. That is not democratic. </p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="07120641000469">There will be periodic reviews of the PNR agreement by the parties. For the European Union that will be the EU justice commissioner Franco Frattini. The Government say that &#147;modalities&#148;&#151;that is a Franglais word&#151;&#147;will be mutually agreed&#148;. They claim that the information &#147;should be disclosed&#148;. I do not think it is good enough to rely on future modalities or some sort of promise that information should be disclosed. My actual experience for the evaluation of the 2004 agreement was that the review report was six months late and MEPs were only allowed restricted access. We were only allowed to go in a room and read the report, not have copies, and it had been redacted&#151;that is, censored&#151;so we never saw the full report.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="07120641000470">There is also a data protection deficit to both these instruments. When and if we get a data protection framework decision, it will be weak and hardly worth the paper it is written on. The promise was that we would have a high-quality data protection framework,  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1899"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1899</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on top of which specific measures appropriate to each instrument could be added.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="07120641000471">The Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s call that Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor, should be regularly consulted in the case of member state initiatives such as Pr1/4m, was that they saw no tangible benefits in such a requirement. Is the real reason that they do not like what he says? Two weeks ago he came to the civil liberties committee of the European Parliament and described the compromise on which there is now political agreement&#151;so it is too late to change anything&#151;as far from satisfactory, a minimum common denominator and unfortunate. He said that the text is neither consistent, effective nor adequate. His main objection is that the scope is limited to the exchange of data&#151;in other words, the data protection safeguards will not cover the collection of data or the processing of data.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="07120641000472">Pr1/4m is about setting up databases and collecting data. PNR is largely about collection and processing. So to restrict EU data protection rules only to the exchanges of data leaves a big loophole. Peter Hustinx draws attention to other weaknesses, such as purpose limitation and acceptable use; indeed he says it is weaker than the 1981 Council of Europe Convention. So, in over a quarter of a century, the EU has been unable to move further than the Council of Europe. He said that because it had to be agreed unanimously a minority of member states had watered it down because of the veto and the proposal would have looked a lot better under qualified majority voting. He drew attention to the fact that it does not regulate data protection as regards third party agreements already in place, which of course includes the PNR agreement with the US as well as other things, such as the SWIFT agreement on financial data. A cynic would wonder whether the three-year delay in getting the data protection framework decision&#151;we have not quite got it&#151;had some ulterior motive to it. In the mean time you get all these agreements through&#151;Pr1/4m, SWIFT, PNR&#151;and then say, &#147;Oh heavens, we cannot apply it retrospectively&#148;.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="07120641000473">I referred to what I call a merry-go-round which is, frankly, becoming out of control. Governments, Ministers and national officials are giving themselves arrogant licence to do what they like and then try to pull the wool over our eyes. If I sound rather harsh and strong, believe me, I am feeling rather fed up about all of this. We are told that measures are justified for anti-terrorism purposes. Then they get extended, as in the example of the PNR and, as the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, said, to any judicial proceedings or as otherwise required by law. That is potentially huge.</p>

<a name="71206-0013.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="07120641000474">The longer retention period under the 2007 PNR agreement will be retrospective to the 2004 and 2006 agreements. That was three and a half; the new one would be seven; after seven, in the so-called dormant period it will only need a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security to authorise the data to be processed again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="07120641000475">We were promised a push system three years ago instead of the law enforcement authorities being able to pull the data. Now we are told that January&#151;next  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1900"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1900</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>month&#151;is the target. We are told that the US unilateral undertakings are binding. Do they take us for fools? How can &#147;unilateral undertakings&#148; be binding? As the noble Lord, Lord Wright, says, they tell us that the data elements have been reduced from 34 to 19. This is just a merge of categories&#151;there has been no material reduction in the scope of the information. All we have to do is look at it and read it&#151;we are not illiterate.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="07120641000476">We were told that the US federal Privacy Act would apply, not by right, but by grace and favour, to the processing of data of EU citizens. Then, the automated targeting system which would process the PNR data was taken outside the scope of the Privacy Act, thereby totally pulling the rug from under that particular promise.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="07120641000477">My favourite one is the whole basis for the use of PNR for profiling. We could have a good argument&#151;which I do not intend to have now&#151;about whether profiling is useful, what are the civil liberties implications and what safeguards we need. The Government accept that, because they state that the system is,</p>
<ul><a name="07120641000552">&#147;an important source of data for risk assessment and intelligence ... through a combination of operational experience, specific intelligence and historical analysis, we can build up pictures of suspect passengers or patterns of travel behaviour. PNR data may then be used to indicate suspect behaviour by enabling the identification of individuals whose travel details share common characteristics with those pre-defined profiles&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120641000517">So it is a profiling system. Two weeks ago, Commissioner Frattini came to the civil liberties committee and gave a very similar description of the system to be used under the EU PNR system&#151;I do not have time to explain. Until he was blue in the face, he would not accept that it is a profiling system. So we cannot even have a discussion about whether profiling is useful or dangerous because there is no agreement. Member states and the Commission do not have their ducks in a row as to whether we are using a profiling system.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="07120641000478">I am running out of time, so I really must wind up. I wanted to draw the attention of the House to the dangers of where we are going. Mixing my metaphors, I think that we also have a problem of policy laundering, where one measure is used as a pretext for another. An EU measure is used as the justification for having to do things at national level, such as setting up DNA databases, which Pr1/4m will require. EU-US PNR is the pretext and model for an EU PNR system. We must end the democracy and data protection deficits, and end this out-of-control system. I hope that it will not take a catastrophe such as disk gate or the rendition of Maher Arar, who also testified to the European Parliament Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition, of which I was vice-chair, giving his harrowing tale, to make us realise that we are going in the wrong direction.</p>

Concerning Pr1/4m and PNR, I echo his thanks to Michael Collon and his team of Clerks and our advisers for all the hard work that they have done to help us with these two reports.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="07120641000480">I have considerable doubt and misgivings, as well as the ones, which I support, which have already been drawn to the attention of your Lordships&#146; House by both the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford. I am especially concerned about how DNA profiles are to be handled. The Pr1/4m treaty made arrangements for reciprocal access to national databases containing DNA profiles.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="07120641000481">The German presidency was extremely enthusiastic about that arrangement, but the truth is that there is no harmonisation on either the collection or the retention of DNA profiles. Most countries use those profiles and databases for serious crime only. That is not the case in the United Kingdom, where our DNA database is half as big again as the combined databases of all the other countries in the Union. In the UK new entries end up on the DNA database with all offences, whether serious or minor. If people are arrested, but subsequently not charged, then their DNA details go on the database. I see a problem. If other states use the UK evidence, they are in danger of assuming that the people on the database could have been involved in serious crime; they have different national standards.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="07120641000482">I must ask the Minister some important questions. Is the Minister happy that the UK will be divulging more DNA data than it receives? What does he believe the United Kingdom&#146;s share of the traffic between states of DNA details from national databases will be? What grounds does he have for believing that other member states will accept not being given full details, if we choose not to provide them? Will the implementing decision set that out fully, or will there be guidelines about how the information should be transferred? Has the Minister explained to other member states the basis on which we collect DNA information?</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="07120641000483">The noble Lord, Lord Wright, explained that there was no consultation, no Explanatory Memorandum, no impact assessment, and no cost-benefit analysis on the Pr1/4m treaty. The Germans have claimed a great deal of success with the passage of this information. They have told us that information exchanged under the Pr1/4m treaty has, in only two months, resulted in 1,510 hits by Germany against the Austrian DNA database. That included 41 hits on homicide or murder cases, 885 hits on theft cases and 85 on robbery or extortion cases. The German Government have suggested that figures will increase. Surely, that will not happen. Those rather dramatic figures are the result of clearing up a backlog of crimes committed before the means of transferring information was created. Once those backlogs are cleared, a decline in the figures is likely.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="07120641000484">Does the Minister not believe that the figures that the Germans have been peddling are highly misleading? Why were Ministers prepared to agree with the decision without any realistic assessment of

Has he made any estimate of the likely number of serious crimes that may be solved as the result of the Pr1/4m treaty that would not otherwise have been solved?</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="07120641000485">The noble Lord, Lord Wright, told us in his opening remarks that the PNR data quite correctly were allegedly to be used only to combat terrorism and organised crime. However, the notorious letter from the United States Department of Homeland Security that we have been hearing about tells us that the US will use PNR to protect the data subject or others from dangerous communicable diseases. It may be very worth while to use this sort of information to deal with dangerous communicable diseases, but does the Minister not think that, if we are to have an agreement of that sort, it should be done through an agreement negotiated for that purpose and not through an agreement to combat serious crime?</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="07120641000486">On the negotiating mandate, the present Leader of the House told the committee in her evidence that she was not prepared to disclose the Commission&#146;s negotiating mandate while negotiations were going on. However, they are now over, and I wonder whether the Minister can disclose to us now what that mandate was and say to what extent he believes the negotiators achieved their objective. I discussed the Pr1/4m treaty and the PNR arrangements at the European Parliament last week, and I said that I remembered my role many years ago as president of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, when I quite often became exasperated at the lack of negotiating skills of some people in the Commission. I caused some amusement when I said that I would not send some of them to market to sell a cow on my behalf. I stick by that, because many of them do not have the first idea of how to negotiate.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="07120641000487">Finally, on the European Union&#146;s PNR initiative, Jonathan Faull, the director-general at the Commission&#146;s Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, has said that the EU should have its own common approach to the PNR system. The Commission has now published a proposal. Sub-Committee F is still awaiting an Explanatory Memorandum before it can scrutinise that document. In order to help the committee, I ask the Minister to say whether the Government support this initiative and will seek to have a system as wide ranging as the United States system, or whether they will look for a system with guarantees for a purpose limitation, with full data protection provisions. I ask this because, when Sub-Committee F comes to examine this document, we may well consider making it the subject of a further short PNR inquiry.</p>

<a name="71206-0014.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="07120641000488">I have asked the Minister a good many questions. I hope that he will be able to answer all of them, but if he cannot answer some of them, I hope that he will write to me.</p>

In turning to the Pr1/4m treaty, I ask my noble friend why we so hastily agreed to these matters. Indeed, it seemed that we were bounced into agreeing to Pr1/4m when there was no proper consultation, impact assessment or costing of what it might mean for us and other member states. We resisted the German presidency ganging up, as it were, with others to present a fait accompli to us all at the end of the story. In many ways I accept Pr1/4m and would like to know why the British Government have been so reluctant to accept the treaty, lock, stock and barrel. I understand that this was under very serious consideration for 12 months and I invite my noble friend to say a few more words about why, in the end, we did not take the plunge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="07120643000003">With respect to passenger name records, there is concern that we have so readily capitulated to the Americans in the area of disclosure of personal data. My particular concern is not only that the agreement is so one-sided, but that another element of this was the American demand that any data received under these institutions should be capable of being farmed out to any institution within the United States that the Americans so choose. Indeed, they told us that this is what they were going to do. That really is reprehensible, and I wonder whether we could have exercised our influence under the special relationship to advise them that this was quite unacceptable.</p>

It did not surprise me that first question posed to the commissioner was why the USA and the European Union cannot trust each other more on these issues. Again, I invite the Minister to think about the relationship that we have had with the USA over so many years, which has been so fruitful and is often called the &#147;special relationship&#148;.</p>

I am very interested to hear my noble friend&#146;s views on what is legitimate or illegitimate profiling.</p>

On this occasion, we discussed justice, freedom and security matters. As the noble Lord said, the third session, which he addressed in his inimitable way, concentrated on and gave opportunities for us to discuss the Pr1/4m treaty and the PNR reports, which I understand are so valued in Brussels by our colleagues. It would be true to say that the tenor of the debate as it developed was one of trying to find a balance between personal data and the personal safety of the citizen. I do not think that the issue was resolved, but it was well aired, to the benefit of all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="07120643000007">I shall conclude with further information from that session in Brussels. Jonathan Faull, the director-general of the directorate concerned with justice, freedom and security, reported on the success of the European arrest warrant. Noble Lords may recall that it was the subject of high controversy in this country. He told us that the 7,000 arrests made in the 12 months since it came into practice is double the number of arrests of persons who were examined for nefarious activities of one kind or another relating to terror. That is an example of the member states of the European Union acting together and swapping information, thus easing our ability to bring to justice those who need to be brought to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="07120643000008">I say that because I return in particular to the Pr1/4m treaty. Sometimes there is a dislocation between the ambitions of our Government to alert us and the rest of the European Union to the very real threats of terror that beset us in the modern world and our reluctance from time to time to engage more closely with our European Union colleagues to put into practice those measures which would aid and abet us in that task. I have long thought that I should add my enthusiastic support for Labour Governments to my record in the hobbies section of <I>Dod</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s</I>.

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="07120643000010">First, the way in which Pr1/4m was handled demonstrates some serious shortcomings in how the EU operates, and the extent to which Parliament is able to scrutinise effectively what the Commission gets up to. I should say straight away that when we are dealing with urgent and serious challenges such as terrorism and crime, I have no objection to some countries in the EU getting together to make faster progress than might be possible if the Commission is left to initiate action on the basis of discussions with all 27 member states. However, that cannot and must not be a reason, let alone an excuse, for any agreement reached by that self-selecting group of EU member states being converted into EU law without the fullest consultation and discussion by all 27 members. That consultation takes time and may throw up problems. But rushing into legislation that has not been properly discussed will not only risk bad legislation but can irritate and even alienate individual member states and thus reduce the reputation of the EU among the populations.</p>

For the Government to have agreed on the incorporation by other states of aspects of Pr1/4m at the Justice and Home Affairs Council before our concerns were met and for the Home Office then to suggest that that did not amount to scrutiny override is, frankly, as deplorable as it is unacceptable.</p>

I say &#147;at last&#148; because it has taken 10 years from the time that the Government were required by Parliament to do so by Clause 39 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. It was originally my amendment, passed against Home Office wishes, with all-party support in this House. For years, the Home Office ignored it and then tried to sabotage it.</p>

The greater the threat we face, the more discriminating we must be in the methods of defence that we use. PNR was eventually forced through, virtually unamended, by the American Government and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wright, that it is lamentable that HMG did not stand up a great deal more firmly for our national interests. I feel that the FCO should have brought this issue to the notice of the American Administration at a high level, together with the other problems that we are having with the United States, to make it clear that it is wholly unacceptable for the Americans to treat the EU as some sort of third world country to be patronised and ordered about.</p>

Sadly, in all too many ways, the United States has in recent years been using its great power, which should be for the good of the world&#151;as it has been historically&#151;in ways that have reduced American international influence.

As ever, I am disappointed by the number of noble Lords present, but anyone who has been involved in European Union Sub-Committee reports presented to the House will recognise that this is a similar turnout to most other reports that are read. It is a shame that more Members are not here to listen to what has been a fascinating and important debate. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="07120643000022">Before I get there, I was leafing through some of my back papers on the exchange of data within the EU, which is relevant to this debate. I find that it always pays to keep past papers, no matter how old they are, because they can always be referred to and people can be reminded of what was said at the time. The then-Secretary of State, David Blunkett, so many Home Secretaries ago, in a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, the chairman of the Lords European Union Committee, said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"><a name="07120643000064">&#147;A large quantity of the data held by UK law enforcement authorities is tightly controlled even within the organisation concerned. This may be necessary for a variety of reasons, including privacy/data protection laws, national or personal security concerns, legal or ethical restrictions on the use to which information may be put, or the need to closely protect information during an investigation or pending a trial&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71206-0015.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="07120643000023">That is what Mr Blunkett said on 9 September 2004, and how hollow that statement now looks. During that inquiry into EU counterterrorism activities, the evidence we received from the Joint Supervisory Authority incorporating Europol, Eurojust, Schengen and Customs, also dated in September 2004, stated,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"><a name="07120643000065">&#147;In addition to the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR and reaffirmed by Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the new fundamental right to data protection is enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter. The draft Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe that includes the Charter, also guarantees in Article 1-51 the right to data protection and states that compliance with data protection rules shall be subject to the control of an independent authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000057">I wonder whether the independent authority was consulted in either of the reports that we are discussing today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="07120643000058">I turn to the specifics. Especially on Pr1/4m, of course we recognise the real value of the exchange of information between states in fighting terrorism and serious international crime. Most noble Lords have referred to that. The noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, in his opening, said that while accepting the exchange of information was critical in the fight against serious crime and terrorism&#151;a point addressed also by my noble friend Lady Ludford and the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, there was no consultation, no estimate of costs, no impact assessment and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="07120643000024">We must work closely with our international partners to ensure that those dangerous and serious criminals and terrorists who seek to threaten the UK and its citizens are prevented from doing so. However, our concerns are not about the intention of the Pr1/4m treaty but about the way in which it is being implemented. In that we agree with the concerns raised by the EU committee. The treaty of Pr1/4m, as we have heard, was negotiated and signed without  any parliamentary oversight. The intergovernmental nature of co-operation in the field of security in the EU inhibits democratic checks where a treaty is presented, already negotiated, for ratification or rejection. Changes are not permitted.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="07120643000025">In addition, transposing the provisions of the treaty of Pr1/4m into EU law through council decision will leave the European Parliament, whose rapporteur is still to be appointed, with the simple consultation procedure. Is that the appropriate way to proceed with such a treaty when we are dealing with sensitive personal data? I do not think so, and my noble friend Lady Ludford suggested that we are going too fast properly to scrutinise EU law enforcement efforts. She referred to Pr1/4m as a particular scandal and not the way to run a whelk stall. She said that it was a merry-go-round out of control and that periodic reviews are simply not good enough.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="07120643000026">We are very uneasy about how the security of such data can be protected when an exchange is taking place. We very much share the committee&#146;s concerns in paragraphs 81 to 98, where it recommends that negotiations on the data protection framework decision, instead of being sidelined, should proceed in parallel with those on the Pr1/4m decision. What are the Government doing to ensure that the very high standards of data protection that the UK has applied to information processed in the law enforcement field are replicated across the EU?</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="07120643000027">I thank the Government for their response to the recommendation in paragraph 102, in which the committee states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"><a name="07120643000066">&#147;The threshold for holding DNA profiles on the United Kingdom DNA database is far lower than in any other Member State, and the proportion of the population on the database correspondingly far higher. The Government should as a matter of urgency examine the implications of DNA exchanges for those on the United Kingdom database&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000059">I understand that there are roughly 4 million hits on the database at present. This worried me and I thank the Government for stating in their response:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"><a name="07120643000067">&#147;The UK (as with other Member States) will decide which profiles on the national database should be exposed to search requests from other member states. There need be no assumption that all profiles would be searched routinely under Pr1/4m&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000060">Can the Minister inform the House how the decision will be made about which profiles will be available for a search request? Will this be done, for instance, by type of crime or by sentence imposed? Will the DNA of those who have been arrested but not charged be available for searching? Will there be any parliamentary oversight of such decisions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="07120643000028">The EU-US Passenger Name Record Agreement is equally of great concern to us, as every noble Lord reminded us. Since the EU committee&#146;s report was published, a new agreement has been put in place,  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1909"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column 1909</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which seems to put EU citizens in a substantively worse position than under the 2004 agreement. As we have heard, the retention period has been extended from 3.5 to 15 years. The data will first be held in active analytical databases for seven years. The Department of Homeland Security will then move the data to &#147;dormant&#148; status and has stated that it &#147;expects&#148; to erase it after 15 years, although that expiration will be subject to further discussions.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="07120643000029">There will be greater data sharing across US agencies and with third countries. There is a weak legal mechanism for EU citizens to challenge misuse of their personal information. The data can be used,</p>
<ul><a name="07120643000069">&#147;where the life of a data subject or of others could be imperilled or seriously impaired&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000061">So this use is not restricted just to terrorism or serious crime.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="07120643000030">The agreements have ignored a number of questions. What data mining will occur? Rarely has there been much consideration of how these data are being put to use by the US Government. Why are all these data important and how are they being processed? The disclosures regarding the profiling system ATS raised more concerns in the US than they appear to have done within the EU, despite the fact that it leaves us to question whether the US is abiding by the agreements at all, while it implements secret risk assessment systems. How legally binding are these agreements? They do not hold the status of treaties within US law, and because they are not ratified by the US Senate, do not become binding  US law.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="07120643000031">Any promises made in the agreements regarding granting legal rights to EU citizens are not truly actionable. What about data from other sources? While major carriers have their own reservation systems, reservation systems are also outsourced or run by third parties. There are global reservation systems such as Galileo, Sabre and others, which are not within the remit of the agreement, because the agreement applies only to carriers&#146; databases. The computerised reservation systems&#151;CRS&#151;will permit broad access by US authorities to data regarding citizens from around the world without any restrictions, because many of the companies are based in the US or have databases within US jurisdiction. Similarly, EU citizens flying on any US-based airline, even from EU airports, have less control over their personal information, as those transfers are not governed by the agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="07120643000032">When I was travelling here in a taxi this afternoon, I was telling the driver about the debate in which I was about to speak, and I told her how difficult these arrangements are. I asked her whether she was aware that information on her would be picked up very quickly and known about if she decided to fly to the United States; and she was absolutely horrified. She asked, &#147;Why haven&#146;t we heard about it?&#148;. I ask the same question, because the majority of British citizens have no idea what is being held on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="07120643000033">Both reports raise a number of general concerns in relation to the mechanisms whereby the Pr1/4m treaty and the EU-US PNR agreement came into effect.

There have been insufficient opportunities for national parliaments to exercise any influence over the negotiations or to propose any modifications. Most worrying is the seeming lack of protection of the personal data that are to be transferred and the lack of any remedies for citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="07120643000034">Finally, how are we expected to believe that the Government, which cannot even protect the data of their citizens when they are being transferred between HMRC and the National Audit Office, as other noble Lords have said, have adequate procedures in place to protect personal data when they are being transferred to another country?</p>

He is a master practitioner.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="07120643000036">I am sure that the House would agree with the aim of both agreements, which is to improve cross-border co-operation in combating terrorism, serious border crime and illegal immigration, in the case of the Pr1/4m agreement and, in the case of the passenger name record agreement between the United States and the EU, to combat terrorism. The question is whether the agreements fulfil their stated aims on acceptable conditions. Like the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and other speakers, I find in that respect that I have to be rather critical.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="07120643000037">I shall take the PNR agreement first. Before I get to the substantive point, I echo the comments that have been made by a number of speakers to the effect that it is a pity, to put it mildly, that the Government&#146;s response to a report published in May came out only in October, almost five months after the report and two months after the agreement reported on had been struck. That obviously means that we are debating a report and a response after the point at which they can have any effect on the outcome. Moreover, a substantial number of the committee&#146;s recommendations have been ignored in the final outcome, and that is a poor outcome for parliamentary scrutiny. All of this is against the background of an unsatisfactory negotiation with the United States involving a unilateral interpretative letter from the Americans. I entirely concur with what my noble friend Lord Marlesford said about the public interest being the loser in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="07120643000038">On the substance of the issue, it is clear that there are many advantages to allowing the intelligence services of the United States to have access to certain information about people travelling to their country. My party supports such mutual help, provided that there are safeguards. Indeed, on this side of the House we would argue strongly that the United Kingdom would be better protected and more able to manage immigration if the Government took the importance of border protection as seriously as the United States. It is imperative to have real-time information about movement across our borders, so that at any time it will be possible to know and how many people are in our territory and jurisdiction and

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="07120643000039">In his reply, could the Minister say how relevant and successful the agreement with the United States has been in its proclaimed aim of combating terrorism? The committee expressed some anxiety that there was very little evidence on this point. Obviously, there may be a need for confidentiality, but it would be of interest to know whether such systems, which increase public and private-sector costs, are really effective in meeting their proclaimed objectives. We should not be frightened of reducing bureaucratic burdens if they turn out not to be fit for purpose or proportionate.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="07120643000040">Protection of personal data is another area where public authorities need to be conscious of their duties to the owners of the data&#151;in this case, airline passengers. It is very easy for the state in its various guises to treat information about people&#146;s identities as if it belonged to the state and not to the real owner, the individual. Now that personal data passes from airlines to US Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration, there must be an increased danger that the information may in practice be used for purposes for which it was not initially given. Can the Minister say if any regular monitoring procedures will be in place to ensure proper use of data and effective protection thereof?</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="07120643000041">This is not an idle consideration. Many UK citizens are going to be caught in this net. This is a real cause for concern on the part of ordinary citizens as more than 2 million Britons travel to the United States annually. In their response to the committee&#146;s report the Government said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07120643000070">&#147;the retention periods negotiated under the new Agreement will also apply to data collected under the 2004 and 2006 Agreements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000062">As the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, noted, given that the new agreement doubles the previous retention period, from 3.5 to seven years and adds on a further eight years of dormant, non-operational retention, can the Minister explain what has changed fundamentally since 2004 to require this long period of retention? Why is this necessary? To what purposes might this vast quantity of data possibly be put? I will posit one uncomfortable possibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="07120643000042">According to the Government&#146;s response to the committee, PNR may be used,</p>

<p><a name="07120643000063">Could the Minister explain the purport of this apparently vast let-out provision on potential use? Who is to judge the need for such use? Would British authorities be consulted in such cases? Indeed, would the UK authorities be informed? What would the data subject be allowed to know about the decision to protect their vital interests or those of other persons? Indeed, the PNR having been put in place in the  name of combating terrorism, here is a provision which would permit, in an apparently wholly uncircumscribed way, the use of information given for this purpose to be used in any&#151;I repeat, any&#151;

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="07120643000043">On this side of the House, our anxieties on that point are increased by the quantity of data demanded of travellers under the PNR. Anybody who has filled in the forms knows that they are quite intrusive and reach into personal and financial matters. Can the Minister please clarify the meaning of the quantity of data elements that are to be exchanged? The original agreement allowed for 34 types to be collected. The new agreement ostensibly reduces that to 19, but the Government&#146;s response to the Committee&#146;s report states that the number has been reduced as a result of:</p>
<ul><a name="07120643000068">&#147;merging of a number of data elements that cover the same type of information&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120643000044">As the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, remarked, that sounds less like a reduction in the amount of data that has to be given, than a recategorisation thereof; that is to say, bigger data groups. No doubt the Minister will inform us if another interpretation is possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="07120643000045">The second of the reports under discussion today deals with the Council of Ministers&#146; decision based on the Pr1/4m treaty concerning cross-border data exchange in three areas&#151;DNA profiles, fingerprints and certain vehicle registration data&#151;with the aim of combating terrorism, serious border crime and illegal immigration. The Conservative Benches are evidently not against such mutual assistance as a matter of principle, but the safeguards that apply at home to data protection&#151;which, in our view, are in any case weak in implementation if not in concept&#151;need to be present to safeguard much wider exchange across borders, where the risks increase. We do not believe that these safeguards are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="07120643000046">As with the PNR agreement, the Government had at their disposal the Committee&#146;s report before they gave their agreement last summer to the Council decision. Despite that, as many noble Lords who have spoken in this debate have noticed, a considerable number of the points it made&#151;some of them significant&#151;have not been taken up or reflected in the outcome.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="07120643000047">On the plus side, we on these Benches congratulate the Government on their success in removing provisions concerning the unauthorised entry of officials of one state into another. Against this, it is generally disappointing that more notice was not taken by the Government of the report. I share the view expressed by many speakers and I believe that the Government could have applied more leverage, given the need for unanimity to adopt the decision.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_397"><a name="07120643000048">Procedure is important. Noble Lords have noted the strong desirability of proper information provided alongside proposals, including impact assessments in particular. The Conservative Benches consider that, whatever the formal position in relation to initiatives taken by member states as distinct from the Commission, Her Majesty&#146;s Government will be serving the public interest in pressing for that rather than excusing failure to follow good practice. Rushing legislation through in the name of protection of the

It would have been a sign of seriousness of intent in this regard if the Government had accepted the Committee's proposed condition that member states be obliged to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor on initiatives with data protection implications.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="07120643000049">As others have noticed, the Government commented in their reply that they saw no tangible benefits in that. I hope the day does not come when they have cause to rue this view. Given the increased powers which the UK Information Commissioner now&#151;at last&#151;has had to be given by the Government as a result of the latest data losses in government, one might have thought that the obligation to consult the data supervisor would be seen as a useful protection for the Government and a potent means of forcing up other countries&#146; standards of data protection nearer to those already obtained in the UK.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="07120643000050">In his opinion, the European Data Protection Supervisor made a number of critical comments on that decision. If the Government are not disposed to listen to the committee of this House, perhaps they will take the views of the European Data Protection Supervisor seriously. He complains of ambiguity in the purposes of collection and exchange. He queries the scheme&#146;s proportionality, the failure properly to assess the value of data exchange so far and its relevance to wider exchange among all member states. He noted that some of the procedures governing handover by national authorities of data, on which HMG apparently intend to rely for protection, constitute derogations from the principle of availability. He does not say that this is wrong, but one is bound to wonder how long it will be before such reliance is challenged and the safeguards dependent on it weakened. What would then happen to the UK citizen&#146;s right to receive protection from UK courts?</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="07120643000051">The European Data Protection Supervisor states categorically that the lack of a harmonised legal framework for data protection, which he considers a sine qua non of cross-border data exchange on this potential scale, is a serious shortcoming. The Government, on the other hand, state in their reply that they do not consider it necessary to complete work on a data framework before proceeding. One wonders about the prudence of this. The committee makes the same recommendation. The Government ought to be listening to such experts and to Parliament, and take their advice seriously instead of waiting until they have another data accident. How many more do the Government want?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="07120643000052">Finally, like the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, I am concerned about the UK situation. We have over 3 million entries on the police database&#151;more than all other member states put together. On this database there are details of convicted criminals, people arrested but never convicted and volunteered samples of otherwise totally uninvolved people. It is, of

The comparable German register contains the names of convicted criminals only. Here is a big information mismatch.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="07120643000053">Secondly, the protections are different. Not surprisingly, and perfectly reasonably, the German protections are lower. Relying entirely on national practice, and in a situation where there is an obligation on the state receiving a request for data to follow it up, can the House be confident that there will never be a case of information about a UK national improperly and unnecessarily crossing borders and/or being improperly released, thus rendering such data exchange open to challenge&#151;quite apart from the damage that it might do to the individual concerned? I, for one, would not be so confident. It is surely unwise of the Government not to accept the need for national systems and practices in data protection and security to be made more compatible, if not fully aligned, before extending obligations in this field.</p>

<a name="71206-0015.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="07120643000054">At the very least, data on a database should be carefully categorised. The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, made some pertinent points on this. It would also be reassuring to know that, when a data file is handed over, there was a definite time limit on the retention of that data file by the third-party country; this point is obscure. What can the Minister tell us about these various issues which will help quieten well founded anxieties on these various scores? Moreover, rushing this decision has meant that the committee's recommendation that there should be a reliable estimate of start-up costs before incorporation into EU law has been neglected, despite the European data supervisor taking the same view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="07120643000055">Along with being willing to take risks with our personal information, the Government seem willing potentially to get into a financial muddle. They say they have an estimate: &#163;31 million, including running costs for the first year. They stress, however, that this is just an estimate and that a feasibility study will follow. I suggest that it is normal do a feasibility study beforehand; &#163;31 million is not a trivial sum and, given the history of undercostings and expenditure overruns in the public sector, I fear that the House is entitled to view this figure with considerable scepticism. Can the Minister give more detail which might increase our confidence in the accuracy of this figure and the value for money that it may represent? The Government say that the public benefit deriving from the high cost will be justified. What is the evidence? Illustrations from Pr1/4m have been cited as examples but as the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, has noted, it is open to question whether, when the backlog of crimes has been cleared, the &#147;hit&#148; system will make a yield which is nearly so fruitful. Can the Minister give us more detail on the Government&#146;s realistic expectations on the cost benefit of this measure and the increases in crime detection that are actually likely to occur?</p>

In this area there are now an alarming number of loose ends. On these Benches we hope that the Government will in subsequent negotiation pursue these important points and be willing to report further to the House on progress in establishing effective EU-wide rules of a sufficiently high standard. As I have said, the Conservatives welcome much of this agreement but the important questions raised on all sides of the House need to be answered to ensure greater clarity and public confidence, especially at a time when data security is so prominent in the public&#146;s mind. Confidence in this Government&#146;s record in this area is at present low, so I hope the Minister will be able to give some information which will go some way to restoring it.</p>

I shall address the points that have been raised in a moment, but first I should like to acknowledge and commend the European Union Committee&#146;s valuable and thorough work in its scrutiny of the European legislation and add my praise for the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, and his work in leading that committee.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="07120654000004">The committee recognises in its report the value of data sharing in the fight against terrorism and serious crime and the benefits delivered both for the United Kingdom and for all the participating member states. The Government are in agreement with the committee on this issue. Criminals do not respect borders, so it is vital that we develop a cross-border capacity to respond to crime. This includes co-operation with our European counterparts as well as those in the United States in sharing data specific to countering terrorism and combating serious crime.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="07120654000005">The review that I carried out, which was reported in the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement on security to Parliament on 25 July, also highlighted the importance of enhancing existing co-operation to share more information between police and immigration services and internationally across countries. The first line of defence against terrorism is overseas at other countries&#146; ports and airports, where people embark on journeys and where terrorist suspects can be identified and stopped before they board planes, ships and so on. The Government have already announced how the Home Secretary will enhance the existing e-borders programme to incorporate all passenger information to help to track and intercept terrorists and criminals. We also set out that, in the identification of potential terrorist suspects, there should be maximum co-operation internationally. Both the EU-US agreement on exchanging passenger name records data and the Pr1/4m Council decision are important tools in the fight against terrorism and serious and organised crime. Wherever we take steps to enforce security, there must be proper safeguards in place to protect the individual.</p>

On the EU-US PNR, the Government welcome the fact that a long-term agreement has been reached on the transfer of passenger data to the United States. This agreement recognises the need to balance preventing and combating serious crime and terrorism with providing data protection safeguards for air passengers. The letter from the United States provides the EU with assurances on the way in which the US intends to protect personal data under the agreement. In return, the EU has confirmed that, on the basis of the assurances that it has received, it considers the level of protection of PNR data in the United States to be adequate. There is a mechanism&#151;the periodic review&#151;for the EU to reassure itself that the assurances are being adhered to.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="07120654000007">The noble Lord, Lord Wright, went into more detail about this letter. All I would add is that the letter provides the EU with assurances on how the US intends to protect personal data. The agreement is a legal instrument. Paragraph 1 refers to the assurances. The assurances from the US are contained in a statement about how it intends to apply its policies. You cannot really unpick the agreement and the letter; they are a package. The agreed package contains important commitments on how the US will handle PNR in respect of data protection.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="07120654000008">The EU-led negotiations on PNR set out in the report were valuable. A copy of the report was given to the Commission and to the United Kingdom&#146;s permanent representation to the European Union, and it was discussed with them. The EU Commission was aware of all the points at the time of the negotiations, which I think was very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="07120654000011">The noble Lord, Lord Wright, also mentioned the view of the Commission and the presidency. The Commission and the presidency, which led the negotiations, were well aware of the views of  the European Parliament and the European data protection supervisor. A copy of the Select Committee&#146;s report was given to the Commission. As the Article 29 working party on data protection acknowledged, these were extremely tough negotiations, in which the United States had a strongly held position.</p>

A push system is obviously much better than a pull system for the reason that she gave. A deadline of 1 January 2008 obliges the DHS to move to a push system for all carriers operating out of the European Union that have implemented a system that complies with the DHS technical requirements.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="07120654000013">Noble Lords mentioned the use of PNR data. The purpose set out in the previous interim agreement was retained in this new agreement. The US receives only that PNR that is necessary to prevent and combat,</p>
<ul><a name="07120654000042">&#147;Terrorism and related crimes ... Other serious crimes, including organized crime, that are transnational in nature; and ... Flights from warrants or custody&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07120654000041">for these crimes. The agreement also states that PNR data may be used, where necessary, for the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or other persons, for any criminal judicial proceedings or as otherwise required by law. This use of PNR data is not a new concept; it was mentioned in former undertakings.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="07120654000014">I do not have the statistics for the agreement between the EU and the US on what has been achieved by PNR data. I would just cite Project Semaphore, which we have talked about in this House before. For example, on the very small quantity of PNR data that we have gathered on specific routes, we found that, as opposed to the one in 2,200 people whom in the past we were able to do anything about, we are able to get something like one in 12 of those people in whom we believe we have a legitimate interest. That shows the extent to which the data safeguard and enhance the rights of legitimate travellers who do not need to be subject to such detailed scrutiny, while successfully detecting the very small proportion of travellers who are breaking the law.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="07120654000015">A number of speakers asked about profiling. By using PNR, we can build up a picture of suspect passengers; it is more their patterns of travel than a profile of the person. This enables us to identify individuals conducting those patterns of travel and to see whether they share common characteristics. That has enabled us to identify people who are more of a risk to us. It can also be used to facilitate legitimate travel and allow us not to have to bother with people who are travelling legitimately.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="07120654000016">A number of speakers asked about the retention of data for longer. All I will say on that is that terrorist groups often operate over a long period and the recruitment and training of their personnel may be spaced over several years. It is therefore important that data be retained to allow retrospective analysis of intelligence to identify links between known operatives and others.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="07120654000017">The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked whether passengers were aware of what personal data were held and under what conditions. The main United Kingdom airlines already provide passengers with information about how their data will be used; the EU and the US work with the aviation industry to publicise PNR systems and to raise awareness among passengers. In terms of redress, the new agreement allows people to seek redress if they think their PNR data are inaccurate or have been used. Passengers can also ask for their PNR data from the Department of Homeland Security under the US Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. I cannot talk much more about that on the Floor of the House, but if the noble Baroness would wish, I can write to her, setting out the interface between the US Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="07120654000018">The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked about a proper mechanism for reviewing the workings of the agreement. The details of how the review will be carried out have yet to be agreed. For the European Union, the review will be undertaken by the commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security or by somebody who he designates.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="07120654000019">Finally, there was a question about PNR data elements and their purpose. The data will be received only to the extent to which carriers collect those data as part of their normal business, as they already collect a lot of data under the EU borders scheme. The agreement specifically limits the purposes for which they may be used.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="07120654000020">I hope that I have answered all the questions on the PNR side. This particular agreement is a proportionate measure. It provides certainty to air carriers that they may transfer passenger name record data to US authorities in compliance with their data protection obligations. The Department of Homeland Security has made a policy decision to extend administrative Privacy Act protections to non-US citizens. That is an improvement over the previous agreement. Furthermore, as I have already mentioned, greater visibility for notices describing the PNR system will enhance transparency.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="07120654000021">Turning now to Pr1/4m, the Government expect substantial benefits from this proposal for the work of UK law enforcement authorities. It will offer an enhanced UK law enforcement ability to search across the whole EU to establish matches of crucial forensic evidence in quicker time. This will allow officers to determine whether to pursue or eliminate lines of inquiry. The Pr1/4m model returns a hit or no hit on average in 50 seconds, but it can take up to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>

I want to reiterate that, despite my short time in this post, I am none the less more than aware of the importance of the parliamentary processes and seek to ensure that we work within them.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="07120654000023">The Government have endeavoured to keep Parliament informed of events as they have unfolded. The negotiations did move fast, but that is not necessarily a bad thing if it means that we see the benefits in quicker time.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="07120654000024">The negotiations did not however bypass the usual requirements. All member states were offered opportunities in the relevant council committee and at the JHA Council to question and propose amendments to the text, and indeed the UK secured three significant changes to meet UK concerns, including concerns raised by the European Union Committee. Specifically, we secured the deletion of the provision on hot pursuit, which was an issue that the committee felt particularly concerned about; we secured a limitation to vehicle registration data to serious crime; and secured data protection provisions that were both robust and consistent with national law and sought to include a council declaration on the application of existing non-automated data searching between member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="07120654000025">It was unfortunate that it was not possible to clear the proposal from scrutiny before it was agreed. In responding to the committee&#146;s report within a week, we hoped to be in a position to have this debate before the June JHA Council. That did not prove possible. As such, after much consideration, the then Home Office Minister decided to override the parliamentary scrutiny reserve and agree the Pr1/4m Council decision. The reasons for that were set out in a letter to the committee dated 11 June 2007.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="07120654000027">Coming to the data protection issues, I reiterate that the Government secured specific data-sharing provisions to be included in the Council decision to ensure a balance between the rights of the individual and the need to share data for public security purposes. We believe that the Pr1/4m Council decision and implementing agreement provide such provisions and safeguards.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="07120654000028">The noble Lord, Lord Wright, asked why we had been browbeaten into accepting Pr1/4m without cost analysis. We were not browbeaten. There was a full discussion of the text. However, it was not accompanied by full and proper cost analysis&#151;in that, he is completely right. I have to say that that was extremely unfortunate. During the negotiation, there was an expert seminar to explore the experience of the seven original Pr1/4m states, which allowed us to assess resource and cost implications&#151;it was not fully satisfactory, I have to say, but it gave us a baseline. The noble Lord asked why we accepted that before a data protection framework was in place. Pr1/4m has its own data protection framework, which is robust and tailored to the specific system. It is a bespoke system.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="07120654000029">The noble Lord also asked why we agreed to implement the agreement while it was under scrutiny. The Government do not accept that the general approach at the November JHA Council&#151;the ongoing negotiations are detailed in the annexe&#151;is an override, because we reserve the right to reopen the text at any time.</p>

<a name="71206-0016.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="07120654000030">A number of speakers asked about access to our own databases and the complexities of our databases compared with those in the European Union. It would not be appropriate to allow direct access to our databases; indeed, that is not intended. We would allow a search on data from reference or shadow DNA or fingerprint databases, but that would be only to ascertain whether there was a hit or no hit on the data. Further information would have to go through the current secure police channels, including mutual legal assistance, once we knew that there had been a hit. Consequently, any disclosure of personal information about individuals whose profiles are on the UK databases would be under existing conditions. That provides for a case-by-case consideration of the legal basis, as well as the necessity for proportionality and justification of disclosure, taking into account data protection and ECHR considerations.</p>

It is paramount to ensure that when we share information proper measures are in place to protect the data shared. Data sharing is a key part of keeping our communities safe and protected. With ever-increasing travel by offenders and the transnational nature of organised crime, the necessity to share information increases accordingly.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="07120644000006">Clause 1 agreed to.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="07120644000007">Clause 2 [<I>Traffic commissioners</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="07120644000008"><b><a name="71206-gc0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="07120644000111">Lord Hanningfield</b> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07120644000098"> Clause 2, page 2, line 12, after &#147;appropriate&#148; insert &#147;following consultation with the senior traffic commissioner and representatives from local transport authorities&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="07120644000009">The noble Lord said: In moving these amendments my primary concern is that, despite the increased flexibility of the traffic commissioner network proposed in the Bill, it could remain out of touch with local transport authorities, rather than working alongside their needs. Not only will these three amendments increase involvement for local authorities; they also emphasise the network&#146;s independence from central government. That is inconsistently applied throughout Section 1.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="07120644000010">In Amendment No. 1, I raise the question of the role of the Secretary of State, who is the sole person able to choose the number of commissioners to be appointed. It is sensible that any number considered appropriate may be appointed to deal with problems that currently have insufficient resources applied to them. If the traffic commissioner system is to function as intended, surely there is a case for the local transport authorities to have input into the arrangements. Local transport authorities are best placed to ascertain the transport needs within their boundaries and with that can ensure the correct level of resource to be allocated. Further, I contend that as the Bill seeks to place the senior traffic commissioner on a statutory footing, he too should have a say in the matter. Presumably he or she would be best placed to appreciate the budgetary restrictions on the number of traffic commissioners to be appointed and ensure that the very best people are recruited for the roles. Indeed, exactly how the framework needs to be resourced also requires further clarification from the Minister.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="07120644000011">For similar reasons I suggest that LTAs should additionally be consulted on the deployment of traffic commissioners. Amendment No. 2 would do just that. </p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="07120644000012">I reiterate that local transport authorities are certainly the best placed bodies to understand needs within their boundaries. Consultation with those LTAs to be affected by a deployment will make certain that the resourcing is adequate and appropriate. There may be instances when LTAs possess local knowledge over and above that of the senior traffic commissioner and can thus ratify or make suggestions to his proposals affecting present or future transport needs.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="07120644000013">In addition, the relationship between the traffic commissioner network and the LTAs in question will benefit and become stronger if they are consulted on such deployment, rather than having commissioners imposed on them. A co-operative relationship should be paramount.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07120644000014">I propose Amendment No. 3 for two reasons. As the clause stands, the senior traffic commissioner must consult a rather comprehensive list of people and bodies before giving guidance or direction to the traffic commissioners. Included in that list is a requirement to consult the other traffic commissioners themselves. I suggest that that will lead to a scenario where the senior traffic commissioner is obliged to consult the traffic commissioners on all that he intends to direct them or guide them to do. Given that earlier parts of this subsection place the authority of the position on a statutory footing, I can foresee that it will lead to unnecessary consultation. Of course, there may be occasions when the senior traffic commissioner can benefit greatly from consultation with his subordinates, but that does not necessarily have to feature in the Bill as a requirement.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07120644000015">Furthermore, subsection 3(e) gives the senior traffic commissioner the ability to direct commissioners as to circumstances in which a traffic commissioner must consult some or all of the other traffic commissioners before he exercises any particular function. Could the Minister provide some clarity about how that will work in practice? As I see it, and I have already become slightly confused when talking about all the consultation, the senior traffic commissioner will have to consult the other traffic commissioners when considering giving guidance about how the traffic commissioners might consult other traffic commissioners. The mind boggles. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07120644000016">The second effect of this amendment is to change consultation with traffic commissioners to consultation with local transport authorities affected by the guidance or direction. As the list given in subsection (4) is almost exhaustive, I presume that there is a case for LTAs to be involved in any guidance or directions to be exercised. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07120644000017"><b><a name="71206-gc0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="07120644000112">Lord Rosser:</b> My Amendment No. 4 is in this group. It would ensure that when the senior traffic commissioner is consulting on guidance and directions that he plans to issue to the regional traffic commissioners, local transport authorities are statutory consultees. The Bill provides that the senior traffic commissioner must consult a number of persons. As has already been mentioned, it lists the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers, other traffic commissioners and,</p>
<ul><a name="07120644000103">&#147;such organisations representative of passenger transport operators, and of road haulage operators, as the senior traffic commissioner thinks fit&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="07120644000018">Unless I have misunderstood it, there appears to be no requirement to ensure that the senior traffic commissioner also has the local transport authorities among the statutory consultees. As one can see from the Bill, it is intended that the traffic commissioners, to put it mildly, may have quite an influence on what a  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local transport authority may be seeking to do under the terms of the Bill. It seems entirely appropriate that there should at least be a requirement for the senior traffic commissioner to consult local transport authorities. That is the purpose of my amendment. I hope that my noble friend will feel able to take it on board.</p>

<p><a name="07120644000019"><b><a name="71206-gc0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="07120644000113">Lord Berkeley:</b> I hope it would be convenient for the Committee for me to speak to my Amendment No. 1A with this group. It fits very closely with the other four amendments. I, too, feel a bit confused about the role of the senior traffic commissioner. He or she is appointed by the Secretary of State and deploys other commissioners. He has a deputy. He has only occasional interference possibilities with Scotland. I am sure the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, will tell us more about that. He has powers to give guidance and he must consult his other colleagues. He cannot give guidance in Scotland and he gets extra money for being the senior one. That is fine, but the one group of people whom he is not required to consult are the customers&#151;those who use the buses. Presumably in this context they should be represented by the Public Transport Users Committee for England&#151;it applies only to England. It seems to me that the customers should have a very strong voice in this; otherwise everyone else, including the bus operators and the freight operators, will be telling or advising him what to do, with nothing coming from the customers. Maybe my noble friend can say that that is covered in the long list of all the people he should consult in new Section 4C(4), as my noble friend Lord Rosser said, which covers,</p>
<ul><a name="07120644000104">&#147;such other persons as the senior traffic commissioner thinks fit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120644000093">I put it to the Minister that making a specific requirement somewhere to consult customers is a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="07120644000020"><b><a name="71206-gc0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07120644000114">The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply that he sent to all of us, not only to me in particular. I asked at Second Reading whether the traffic commissioner for Scotland was barred from being the senior traffic commissioner. The answer was that such a person was not barred. When I hear words that do not mean anything in Scotland, such as local transport authority and the Public Transport Users Committee for England, I wonder how the senior traffic commissioner, who is wrestling with the partially devolved, partially reserved transport system in Scotland, will be an expert as well on these matters for England. Therefore, I continue to wonder whether the Bill really tackles the devolved/reserved issues and whether there was not a requirement for what used to be known as a Sewel motion, but is now known as a legislative consent motion, in the Scottish Parliament. Is this Bill fully up to speed? Is the Department for Transport ultimately one of those Anglo-UK departments which does not quite take devolution into account?</p>

I am sure that given the breadth of interests already expressed we shall have long and fruitful sessions on this rather uncontroversial Bill.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="07120644000022">Noble Lords have raised some useful points and issues in this first debate. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for including his amendment in this group, because it is an adjacent issue.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="07120644000023">The truth is that there will be a lot of consultation. The traffic commissioner will find him or herself very busy talking to a lot of people. I understand noble Lords&#146; disappointment that not every detail of who the commissioner might talk to&#151;and how he might talk to them and when&#151;is expressed clearly in the Bill. As anyone who has worked in local government&#151;and there are a few of us in the Committee this afternoon&#151;can confirm, how consultation should be carried out is probably not always best specified and set out in detail; it is something that one has to work away at and it becomes iterative. As we know, primary legislation, in particular, tends to be considered in a rather precise manner and for that reason can be very constraining. That is my first thought on the issue.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="07120644000024">I listened carefully to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, about the dangers of being out of touch. That is a very important point. However, the world of traffic commissioners will probably change a bit as a product of this Bill and they will have to develop different qualities and a range of relationships, but that should not obscure the fact that much will stay the same in terms of volumes of activity and particular areas of work that the Bill does not look at in detail.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07120644000025">Two factors influence our consideration of this amendment. The first is that traffic commissioners are under a statutory duty to discharge their obligations under domestic and, importantly, European law and the Secretary of State must, therefore, ensure that there are sufficient commissioners to fulfil those obligations. That is a specific statutory duty there for the Secretary of State. Those requirements can, of course, change over time&#151;hence the need for flexibility&#151;for example, in response to the changing needs of the industries or new European requirements.</p>
<h5><a name="07120644000108">2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="07120644000026">The second factor is that Clause 2 would remove the statutory requirement for a commissioner to be appointed to each traffic area, with jurisdiction in that traffic area only. This would create a pool of commissioners able to act anywhere in England and Wales&#151;that partly picks up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, that the cross-boundary flexibility is needed, for very good reasons&#151;with the additional prospect of individual commissioners working specifically in specialist areas, for example on bus service registration and punctuality. However, we must bear in mind that, for practical reasons, individual commissioners will still be allocated on an administrative basis to an individual traffic area.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="07120644000027">In practical terms, given the responsibilities of the senior traffic commissioner to move resources around to meet workload peaks and troughs, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Secretary of State  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to make decisions on the number of commissioners required without consulting them. Therefore, we believe a statutory obligation to do so is unnecessary. </p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07120644000028">It also follows that the number of commissioners required is directly related to the workload. For example, the volume of licence applications and variations is determined by the demands of bus and lorry operators themselves. The resources required to deal with HGV impounding cases will depend on how many are impounded by VOSA. The volume of bus punctuality work will depend in part on the performance of local bus services and the outcome of the ongoing work that the Government are doing with stakeholders to devise a punctuality regime. That will not be uniform across the country. It will vary from time to time and from place to place.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07120644000029">As I have already made clear, the Secretary of State, guided for practical reasons by the senior traffic commissioner, must ensure that there are enough commissioners to deal with the workload. While local transport authorities may have views in particular about the bus work of the commissioners in their area, they may not be in a position to see the wider picture across the whole of a traffic area, and across the whole spectrum of the traffic commissioners&#146; functions. We therefore believe that the amendments offer little to influence resourcing decisions usefully, while potentially imposing additional administrative burdens.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07120644000030">I shall now deal in more detail with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, which provides an opportunity to discuss how the interaction between the traffic commissioners and any new bus passenger watchdog might work. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising that issue. Traffic commissioners have a key role in the Government&#146;s drive to improve local bus services, particularly in relation to enforcing standards of punctuality and reliability. Any new bus passenger champion would rightly have an interest in such matters, and may want to influence key issues such as the setting of standards in this regard. However, it is also paramount that the traffic commissioners&#146; decision-making role must not be compromised in any way when deciding individual cases, and, in particular, in the exercise of their day-to-day duties.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07120644000031">On 4 December we published a consultation paper, <I>Options for </I><I>S</I><I>trengthening </I><I>B</I><I>us </I><I>P</I><I>assenger </I><I>R</I><I>epresentation</I>. It was designed to create stronger passenger representation by enhancing the role of Bus Users UK, which is a non-statutory body. We are also including powers in the Bill which would enable the Secretary of State, if this option were chosen, to add functions to the statutory Rail Passengers&#146; Council, which is also known as Passenger Focus. If following the consultation it was decided to expand the remit of Passenger Focus, for example, the purpose of this amendment would be lost.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="07120644000032">Any new statutory bus passenger champion would be able to make recommendations to the Secretary of State on matters in relation to prescribed public passenger transport.

<a name="71206-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07120644000033">In my opinion this would be a far stronger avenue for the views and recommendations of any new bus passenger champion to be channelled through to the traffic commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="07120644000034"><b><a name="71206-gc0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="07120644000116">Lord Berkeley:</b> Before my noble friend leaves that subject, if there is a proposal to merge Passenger Focus for railways and buses it sounds very good and well worth looking at. This probing amendment may be in the wrong place. The duties on the senior traffic commissioner to consult are on page 5 of the Bill, as my noble friend Lord Rosser said earlier. It worries me to hear that the number of traffic commissioners appointed will depend on the workload, including impounding of lorries. One of the groups the senior traffic commissioner is required to consult is the road haulage operators, who have a vested interest in not being impounded. I understand why they should be consulted, but, if the Bill specifies that road haulage operators and passenger transport operators should be consulted, I do not see why customers are not, whether it is Passenger Focus or somebody else. Alternatively, on Report perhaps we should consider deleting paragraph (e), leaving just the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers, other traffic commissioners and &#147;such other persons&#148;.</p>

Similarly, we will want to ensure that all those in local government are consulted as well. There may well be a continuing need to ensure that we have iterative consultative forums. It is important to recognise the value of local consultation. We must ensure that there is effective strategic oversight. That is how we see this best working.</p>

I can see that it could happen in local government regional offices. I am concerned because, although there is a lot in the Bill about traffic commissioners consulting other traffic commissioners&#151;I got confused about that&#151;there should be something a bit stronger about them consulting local government. The LTAs are paramount, as the Minister has admitted. I want to strengthen the role of LTAs, which are obviously the focal point. I am not asking for very much.</p>

The Secretary of State will need to reflect from time to time on that. I do not want to impose a burden in the legislation that so constrains how consultation might work at a local level that it becomes unworkable. I think that noble Lords will understand what I mean.

If the senior traffic commissioner is to make the decision to deploy other commissioners, will the Secretary of State provide guidance on how to do that? If so, this is hardly the bottom-up approach that takes into account the needs of areas that would work best.

If we are in the business of making the senior traffic commissioner similar to the independent rail regulator&#151;I should have thought that independence and local accountability were a very good idea&#151;then that is a major step. On the other hand, if he is just a sort of paid lackey of the Secretary of State, which I am sure he would not be, then we have to look at the issue in a different way.

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07120644000064">We should remember that the effect of the amendment on the Bill would be to remove the existing power under Section 4(4)(a) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 and the corresponding power in the goods vehicles legislation for the Secretary of State to issue directions to the traffic commissioners over the exercise of all of their functions. This is a significant step which further reinforces the commissioner&#146;s overall independence.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07120644000065">Given the Secretary of State&#146;s responsibilities for the overall policy and work of the operator licensing system and the statutory functions of the traffic commissioners, as well as general responsibilities to Parliament and compliance with European legislation, there should be a statutory requirement for the senior commissioner to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State as to the exercise of powers under this new section. It is only a requirement to have regard to such guidance, not to obey directions. There is a difference.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07120644000066">Given that and the significant moves that we have already made in regard to the Secretary of State&#146;s powers in this area, I would encourage the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment. I understand the desire that noble Lord&#146;s may have to secure autonomy in this area of activity, but there is a necessity for some level of political accountability. We need to strike a balance between autonomy on the one hand and accountability on the other. Ultimately, the Secretary of State is politically responsible for this and, unless there are some levers and methods of accounting, we could reach a situation where the accountability route breaks down. I am not sure that the autonomy gained as a by-product of that would necessarily secure some of the advantages and improvements that we all want to make through this legislation.</p>

That is why I am seeking to clarify whether this really is a bottom-up approach. Being professional people, the traffic commissioners should be allowed to sort out the problem without too much political interference. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. He is nodding his head.</p>

That is why we have been prepared to move some way in underwriting the independence of the traffic commissioners. I am sure the noble Lord will appreciate from his own work in government that there has to be a time when the leader of a council says, &#147;I am ultimately responsible here. I have got to make clear our view, and the way to do that is through guidance&#148;&#151;on school admissions, catchment areas or whatever the subject happens to be. There has to be that line of accountability. Then, of course, the operational effect of the work that is done closer to the ground by officials has to be considered, and it is that balance that we are seeking to strike. We are at one in wanting to ensure that the service close to the ground works well and is in tune with what is required locally and by necessity.</p>

<p><a name="07120644000073">On the basis that the traffic commissioners will receive guidance, it is worth exploring whether that guidance should include the matter of bus service performance. Looking at public transport as a whole, we see that enormous efforts are made to make the trains run on time and that they are getting better. There is independent rail regulation, Network Rail, penalties and other things. I know that trains are different but it is remarkable how much the rail service has improved, possibly as a result of such incentives. My noble friend may say that that cannot be applied to buses because of traffic jams, but we could try to have a performance regime that addresses not only speeds and journey times but whether the bus runs at all. It seems reasonable to say that if the traffic commissioner is taking a greater role, which I welcome, there should be guidance on the performance of bus services so that customers&#151;passengers&#151;can be more confident that what they expect to occur will occur. I beg to move.</p>

I understand his concern about bus speeds and timings. Within the industry it is a matter of endless debate whether it is better to have a bus service that aims to be fast but is often late or to have one that is slow but always on time. The passenger&#146;s point of view may depend on where on the route he is waiting for the bus. If he is getting on near the start and making a long journey, he will hope that it is as fast as possible and will accept that it will sometimes be a little late or very late, whereas someone waiting near the end of the route will be looking for the greatest certainty about when the bus will turn up. These are very local issues which are affected by local conditions. The ideal is that bus services are reasonably fast and reasonably punctual, and to achieve that there has to be co-operation. I agree with my noble friend that what is needed is the co-operation of the traffic authorities as well as better performance by the bus operator. We shall be looking at that in some detail when we turn to Part 4.</p>

It is rather odd that after debating the degree of independence which a traffic commissioner should have from the Secretary of State, we are now considering an amendment to give the Secretary of State a very specific power&#151;and this is why I mentioned micromanaging&#151;to intervene in a matter which the traffic commissioners ought to be able to sort out for themselves.

On the question of performance, when is a late bus a cancelled bus? I was in Cornwall a couple of years ago and waited an hour for a bus that did not come and got the next bus. The same thing happened on the way back. I wrote to the bus company chairman and said that his bus had not come either way. I asked whether, given that he received a six-figure subsidy from the county council to operate the service, he should not make his buses run. The answer was, &#147;Well, the driver didn&#146;t turn up&#148;. If that was the case with a train, there would be questions here if it happened too often.

We must also remember that responsibility to Parliament for the performance of the licensing system and the commissioners themselves rests solely with the Secretary of State, not with the senior traffic commissioner. The Government therefore believe that it is right that only their employer&#151;that is, the Secretary of State&#151;should have a statutory power to weigh up whether individual commissioners are performing to a satisfactory standard.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07120644000090">Of course, in practice, the Secretary of State would take all relevant factors into account, and, as the noble Earl, Lord Astor, said&#151;I am sorry, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee; I am giving the noble Earl a new title&#151;particularly the views of the senior traffic commissioner, who would have responsibility for the deployment of traffic commissioners, and the issuing of guidance and directions to them. But other views are also important, such as those of the bus and lorry industry itself. Therefore, in practical terms, we believe that it is the Secretary of State who is best placed in the end to weigh up all the views and factors put to him and decide what is necessary. I should add that the amendment would also have the unwelcome effect of allowing the senior traffic commissioner a say in determining his own competence, which would clearly be inappropriate.

I am probably at one with him in seeking to ensure that we work very closely with the local authorities on the work that they undertake to guarantee that local transport plans consider the impact of their transportation policies and projects on the environment, whether it is the landscape, biodiversity, noise or air quality or climate change.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para32">
<p><a name="07120650000010">As the local government White Paper of 2006 made very clear, we are trying to ensure that local authorities are not overly burdened with guidance and targets from central government. However, we are committed to ensuring that transport contributes even more to reducing carbon emissions and improving the environment. It is vital that local authorities are fully aware of government policies on the protection and improvement of the environment as they develop and evolve over time. It is for that benign and important reason that we must be free to issue guidance from time to time, obviously at suitable intervals so as not to burden local authorities, to offer them support, encouragement and advice as they develop and implement their policies and plans in tackling issues such as climate change and in protecting the wider environment. So it is a benign feature of the relationship.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0002.htm_para33">
<p><a name="07120650000011">We think that local government can benefit from that sort of guidance and that it is valuable to establish benchmarks, quality thresholds and so on. Guidance is a useful and helpful way in which to do that, and guidance that is produced nationally has the benefit of drawing on the experience of many different local authorities and perhaps helping to illuminate and elucidate some of the better practices that local authorities such as Essex might develop. So we look at this in a positive sense rather than seeing it as over-centralising. It is there to assist and enable the better development of environment policies through the development of good-quality transportation planning.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para0">
<p><a name="07120650000015">The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. Amendment No. 7A is about integrating road and rail policies&#151;or, as the former Deputy Prime Minister, my right honourable friend John Prescott, used to say, &#147;integrated transport&#148;, which I always thought was rather a good idea. The Bill requires each local transport authority to produce local transport policies,</p>
<ul><a name="07120650000243">&#147;for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport to, from and within their area&#148;;</ul>
<p><a name="07120650000187">but it also puts a duty on local transport authorities to take into account any policies announced by government which relate to these things.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="07120650000016">In the integration of road and rail transport, there is already good contact between Network Rail, which tends to lead these things, and many local authorities, but I am not sure that that is quite enough. The new integrated transport authorities have a duty to consult, and Network Rail&#146;s new route utilisation strategies which already cover much of the country have been taken into account. It is, however, interesting to reflect on what the House of Commons Select Committee on Transport said about the Bill. It said that Clause 57, the relevant clause in the draft Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="07120650000244">&#147;should be revised to place a duty on authorities to take account of the full range of national transport policies. Reducing the effects of climate change is only one of a number of vital policy objectives that should be observed in PTA decision-making, and one such objective should not be singled out on the face of the Bill&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="07120650000017">Local authorities are already consulted on these route utilisation strategies, but it would be good if the Bill provided for a formal requirement for consultation between road and rail operations; otherwise some local authorities will undoubtedly decide not to do it. It is quite easy to change bus routes, bus stops and all the other things we will talk about when we reach the relevant part of the Bill, but it is sometimes difficult to change the rail side even with the route utilisation strategies&#151;which are very good and have had lots of consultation. If local transport bodies are to develop safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport locally as the Bill requires, they must take into account the area&#146;s current and future rail capacity as well as all the other things. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000018"><b><a name="71206-gc0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="07120650000267">Lord Hanningfield:</b> I speak to Amendments Nos. 9 and 10, which complement Amendment No. 7A. An authority's consultation requirements when producing a local transport plan are stated clearly in the subsection of the Bill to which this amendment applies. I suggest that there is a case to include two further points to the consultation requirements to ensure that local authorities are best informed when devising their plans. Having these on the face of the Bill will ensure that due consideration is given to the issues. As I say, such provision would also complement what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has just said.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="07120650000019">First, an authority should have regard to plans and strategies published by any relevant rail infrastructure manager, such as Network Rail's route plans and route utilisation strategies. I know that Network Rail has close and regular contact with a number of local  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authorities. In order to build on these relationships and ensure consistency in the degree of regard given between authorities, both integrated transport authorities and local transport authorities would benefit from consulting such plans and strategies.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="07120650000020">Route utilisation strategies are central to the forward planning activity of the rail industry. They set out the current capacity, passenger and freight demand, operational performance and cost projections going forward to address the future requirements of rail users, funders and key stakeholders. The rail utilisation strategies then perform the development and delivery of timetables, infrastructure, maintenance and renewals of the network. If local transport bodies are to adequately develop safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport within their area, as it says in the Bill, they should presumably take account of current and future rail capacity in that area and therefore provide the very best possible plans for transport users.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="07120650000021">The second part of the amendment concerns consultation with transport users. It is vital that the Bill highlights the importance of consulting representatives of local transport users if a plan is to be successful and achieve transformational results. In particular, getting around is essential to children and young people meeting the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes, which include being healthy, staying safe and achieving economic well-being&#151;everything we are aiming for. All too often the needs and views of children are neglected, which is why we are proposing an extra consultation. That is especially pertinent when considering the high rate of transport accidents and lower reported feeling of personal security on transport. Developing local transport plans is central to meeting people&#146;s needs and expectations. I beg to move.</p>

I have a question about one aspect of the relationship between road and rail. Every year, at the point at which they physically meet&#151;level crossings, in other words&#151;some 1,800 pedestrians and motorists are reported as in some way abusing the level crossing. Not only do they put themselves in great danger, they also endanger the lives of the passengers. In broad planning terms they also cause havoc because bridges have to be closed, as do roads and rail lines. Will the Minister update the Committee on actions that the Government intend to take following the Road Safety Act 2006? My noble friend Lord Bradshaw, who cannot take part in this Grand Committee, was very keen to table amendments to that effect but was ruled out of order by the Public Bill Office. However, they are not able to stop me today.</p>

I reiterate the Government&#146;s strong support for promoting integrated transport at every opportunity. My noble friend almost said this as an aside, but I shall pick up on it: if local authorities decided, for instance, not to consult rail users or operators, they would soon find themselves dragging behind their neighbours in the standards that are expected.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="07120650000027">The Government agree that consultation on local transport plans with interested and affected parties and consideration of their plans and strategies is vital in securing transport policies and projects that best serve local people. We are grateful to the National Children&#146;s Bureau for its input on this aspect of the Bill. It is important that the views of children and youth groups are taken into consideration when producing and implementing local transport plans.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07120650000028">We are also grateful to Network Rail, the Campaign for Better Transport and others for their proposals for railways and local transport plans. As my noble friend Lord Berkeley said, the integration of local railways with other local transport services already forms a key component of many plans, and we support that and will continue to encourage it. In many cases, it is right that organisations such as Network Rail and representatives of young people should be consulted on local transport plans. We believe that such groups are already likely to be covered by the duty the Bill places on local transport authorities to consult such other persons as the authority considers appropriate.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07120650000029">The Government consider that it is more appropriate for local authorities to decide which organisations they consult, taking account of local circumstances. Similarly, local transport authorities must take into account a wide range of plans and strategies when developing and implementing their local transport plans, including those of Network Rail, but also other relevant local, regional and national strategies&#151;for instance, regional spatial strategies. It is for local transport authorities to decide which of these are most relevant to them. To aid them, the Government intend to publish guidance that will include, among other things, suggestions about the kinds of bodies that it would be appropriate for local authorities to consult and the kinds of plans and strategies that should be considered. We believe that that is preferable to the inclusion in the Bill of such a long list that it would over time become increasingly out of date.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07120650000030">The noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, asked about the actions that are being taken to prevent level-crossing accidents. This matter was also considered during the passage of the then Road Safety Bill. Level crossings now represent the greatest risk to the overall safety of the railway. In the vast majority of cases, however, accidents are caused not by failure of the crossing equipment or the actions of the train driver but by motorists who ignore the warning lights and seek to get across as the barriers  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>descend or to zigzag around half-barriers before the train arrives. Some accidents at level crossings are also as a result of deliberate acts, such as suicide attempts, rather than misunderstanding or deliberately ignoring the warning devices to avoid being delayed.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="07120650000031">Local transport authorities have responsibilities to promote the safe operation of transport across their area. While one accident at a level crossing is one too many, we should not lose sight of the small number of accidents at level crossings compared with the number on the rest of the road network. Local transport authorities need to apply their resources across their area, and the noble Baroness will know that that always has to be a consideration. Local transport authorities already have a duty under Section 108 of the Transport Act 2000 to formulate transport policies that promote safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport and to carry out their functions so as to implement those policies. Local authorities have duties under Section 122 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to ensure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic, including pedestrians.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="07120650000032">There are numerous other statutory powers that concern safety at level crossings. For example, Section 1 of the Highway (Railway Crossings) Act 1839 places a duty on Network Rail to maintain such crossings. We consider that sufficient protection is provided by Section 1 of the Level Crossings Act 1983, which enables the Secretary of State to make an order providing for the protection of those using the level crossing to take into account their safety or convenience. The Office of Rail Regulation, which, as noble Lords will know, is the health and safety regulator for the rail industry, can impose a duty on the operator of a level crossing to request that the Secretary of State make such an order. Therefore, we do not see the need to impose a duty on local authorities as existing statutory powers can be used to ensure safety at level crossings.</p>

That is very commendable, except that my noble friend has just said that most of the accidents on the railways now are on level crossings.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000039">The railway industry has no capability of improving safety at level crossings because it has no control over the drivers. When we were debating the transport safety Act, we failed to increase the penalties on drivers who do things that they should not do. Will the Government look favourably on increasing the penalties, as that seems the only way of stopping such drivers? You can have as many policies and white lines as you like, but unless somebody is severely fined, or has their licence taken away, they will take no notice. We failed on the previous occasion to increase the penalties. It would be nice to think that somebody could relent, and that an amendment could be tabled on Report to achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000048">The noble Lord said: I welcome the Bill&#146;s proposals for authorities to replace their local transport plans as they see fit. At present, the requirement to produce a new document every five years can prove rather arbitrary. True locally-driven reform should acknowledge that transport needs may change beyond such a rigid framework, and the ability for that to be determined at a local level will lead to better planning.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para19">

<p><a name="07120650000188">be added after the requirement to replace plans as authorities see fit. I believe that the Bill needs to acknowledge that authorities may need to update their plans according to the manifold pressures they face. Explicitly providing that the production of plans is a requirement in major changes within authorities' boundaries will allow LTAs to demonstrate the implications of large decisions. As an illustration from Essex County Council, the building of a new runway at Stansted Airport would have major implications on the transport strategy for the whole county. I would like the fact that the authority would be compelled to produce a revised plan to be made known when such large decisions are considered. I am sure that all noble Lords will agree that transport planning should not be a secondary issue to be considered as an afterthought.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000050">The local transport plan is presently used to secure funding. If nothing else, the five-year framework allows authorities to plan in that respect and allows the Department for Transport to allocate funding. As I read the Bill as it stands, authorities would be able to produce a plan until it is deemed necessary for that plan to be superseded. If that is the case, will the Minister please confirm how authorities are to plan their budgets accurately? Further, will there be a requirement to bid for a certain length of funding? The plan will very much affect the funding, as I said. The second part of the amendment seeks to make it clear that local transport plans are to be for an initial specified length of operation for that reason.</p>

However, I question the point of this amendment. I am not sure whether it is meant to limit what is provided for in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, seemed to be glad that an authority may replace its plans as it thinks fit, as distinct from the five-year restriction that has existed until now.

Several of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments have been designed to provide greater flexibility from the bottom-up but this one seems to restrict flexibility.</p>

When one is in opposition, even if one supports parts of legislation, as I do in this case, it is still one&#146;s job to get clarification&#151;as I am seeking to do through these amendments. My amendment is not to change the gist of the Bill but to get clarification on how it will work, as I said at the end of my introduction. I want clarification on how this will work and how the five-year plans result in funding. If there are to be different types of five-year plans, they still have to relate to the funding of the highway infrastructure that is given to local authorities. I would like the Minister to clarify how that might work, or how it will work with funding requirements in the future. It is very important for local authorities to understand that.</p>

The Government agree that it is important that authorities regularly review their local transport plans. The delivery of transport projects requires very careful planning and project management, and plans need to be responsive to emerging risks, changing demands, new pressures and, importantly, local issues. That is why the duty to keep plans under review will continue to apply to all authorities.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07120650000056">That is why we believe it is right that authorities should have the flexibility and adaptability to replace their local transport plans in ways that best suit their local and regional strategies and circumstances. That flexibility will not only serve the needs of diverse authorities; it will also be welcome to those authorities that choose to produce their local transport plans as a long-term strategy and one or more shorter-term implementation plans. For example, the implementation plan might need to be reviewed more frequently. It is the Government&#146;s intention to include provision on the suitable timing of replacement of local transport plans, including longer-term strategies and shorter-term implementation plans in guidance, rather than on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000057">The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is right to ask for assurance that local transport plans will continue to be updated according to local transport need.

I hope he feels reassured by our approach to these issues.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000058">On the back of that, the noble Lord asked how plans would be funded. Current funding runs until 2011, when the present phase of plans ends. Funding may well depend on plans but we have not yet reached the stage where we can make a decision. Of course, there will be a continuing need for funding for transportation plans, although we have not finalised exactly how that will happen, as I am sure the noble Lord will understand.</p>

It is fair to say that local transport plans are very important core plans for local authorities, either singularly or working in co-operation with others, and we certainly understand the overall impact that local area agreements have on strategic thinking in local authorities. They are significant and, as the noble Lord said, they sometimes involve many millions of pounds of expenditure. It is right that local area agreements reflect local transport planning and that the local authorities involved in constructing LAAs and LTPs work carefully with each other. It is hard to prescribe how that should work but clearly we have some thoughts on it and I should like to review it before I give a definitive answer.

<p><a name="07120650000070">I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I agree with everything he has said about the desirability of the longer-term idea. We all know that we suffer from short-termism. When it comes to investing in new facilities, be they buses or other types of transport or the infrastructure that goes with them, the experience is that you get a much better service and investment if there is a longer-term assurance that the services and the partnership will continue. The same applies on the railways. Ten to 15 years is enough time to get a really good structure going. That is one of the many options for operating buses, and it could be a major benefit in attracting new investment and new services and therefore increasing the volume of passengers.</p>

There is already provision in the Transport Act 2000 and in amendments made by the Bill requiring consultation on these quality partnership schemes, and their coverage already includes routes, frequencies and fares. Provision is therefore made elsewhere for some of what the amendment proposes. </p>

<p><a name="07120650000072">In our view, a specific duty for local planning authorities to have regard to bus partnership schemes would create a precedent for having a similar express duty relating to many other areas of policy interest. In transport there are other schemes that might carry similar weight with local planning authorities; for example, freight quality partnerships and road safety proposals. There will also be similar examples in other sectors. Local planning authorities already have an administrative duty to have regard to all such schemes where they are relevant to their functions.</p>

This concerns the thorny issue of boundaries. Wherever there are administrative boundaries, cross-boundary issues always emerge. I wish to reflect further on that because local transport plans are drawn up by local authorities and therefore reflect local authority boundaries. Clause 9 continues in that vein by amending the Transport Act 2000 but retains transport planning within discrete local authority boundaries.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0004.htm_para13">
<p><a name="07120650000080">However, there are areas where local authority boundaries do not reflect what happens in real life, particularly in regard to transport. For example, in Suffolk, where I live, people in the south-east of the county live in Suffolk but work and shop in Colchester, in Essex; people in the north go over to Diss and so on. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, referred to Yeovil in Somerset, which is right on the Dorset border. The point he made was that Somerset County Council cannot sponsor a bus service in Dorset even though it might be to the economic advantage of Yeovil to encourage people from Dorset to come into what is their nearest town.</p>

It is quite often not political differences between one local authority and another that causes problems when bus services cross boundaries, it is personal prejudices or whatever.

<p><a name="07120650000084">On this vexed question of bus services that cross boundaries, most local authorities are fairly artificial entities; people cross them on a regular basis without thinking twice about it, as do bus services. One of the most famous bus services in Birmingham is the 11C, which meanders around the Birmingham conurbation crossing every trunk road into the city. Its punctuality led to me and other members of the board regularly receiving angry letters from understandably concerned passengers. It crossed many local authority boundaries&#151;all of them being highway authorities as they were district councils&#151;and we had to negotiate with, I think, eight local authorities. I am speaking from memory now about trying to make proper bus provision for this particular route. The fact that it had to cross eight local authority boundaries in 28 miles, which was the total mileage of the service, indicates the difficulty.</p>

I asked the noble Baroness at the time whether that was in accordance with Liberal Democrat Party policy.

I am not sure that my noble friend the Minister, in replying, can do anything about them during the passage of the Bill, but I am sure that what happens in the wilds of Norfolk and the conurbation of the West Midlands can be repeated in other parts of the country. A coherent approach from district councils anywhere in the United Kingdom appears to be pretty difficult. Will the Minister offer me and the noble Baroness any words of comfort that such an approach will be attempted during the passage of the Bill?</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Snape, and I share some political experience in the West Midlands, which goes back some way. I appreciate the difficulties in the West Midlands conurbation that he mentioned and the problems of joint working. We take travel-to-work areas seriously. We recognise that there have been significant changes in recent years in the distance which people are prepared, or have, to travel to work, especially around our major urban areas. This means that the boundaries of the existing passenger transport authority areas may not always accurately reflect people&#146;s actual travel patterns. Increasingly, as the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord Snape will know, journeys may start or end outside PTA areas. Clause 77 recognises this, and allows the Secretary of State to make an order to expand the existing boundaries of an integrated transport authority where the relevant authorities have given their consent. That opportunity exists.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000089">Outside the existing PTA areas, there are already six joint local transport plans involving more than one top tier or unitary authority, reflecting wider travel-to-work areas.</p>

One objective was to facilitate more joint working where appropriate, to have a wide-area, longer-term strategy alongside authority-area based implementation plans. The Government are also facilitating joint working across local authority boundaries through multi-area agreements. These are agreements between two or more top-tier unitary local authorities.

<p><a name="07120650000101">This proposal, which is supported by ATCO&#151;the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers&#151;is for tendered network zones, a new structure which would enable a local transport authority to co-ordinate one clearly identified network of bus services, which cover what one might call the commercial or tendered side, and the small local bus services. It would cover more than one route and there would clearly be a lot of synergy between the services included in this and in the other networks and services. As drafted, existing local bus services would not be affected by the tendered network zone designation, except that they would not be able to make changes except on the dates agreed by the local transport authority and those changes would be expected to be in accordance with the supporting criteria. This may be a solution to enabling local authorities in areas where most services are tendered to provide better co-ordination by integrating all the bus services in an overall network.

I do not wish to pre-empt the discussion on quality contracts&#151;and I hope that we do not come to that or we may be here a long time&#151;but I suspect that it will prove to be the most controversial part of the Bill.</p>

My Latin is fairly sketchy and is based on my very short experience as an altar boy more than 50 years ago, so if we are to use words such as de minimis, they should be explained better for simple former bus and rail men such as me. This new clause does not appear to make any sense at all if the hope is that the industry in general will see an influx of new services in certain areas. It is a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="07120650000104">I have two questions that I hope my noble friend will be able to answer when he speaks at the end of this debate. They relate to the amount of backing that would be needed to enforce such a tendered network zone. How many people would be involved and how much would it all cost? How many new services does he think would come about, particularly as a result of proposed subsection (2) in his amendment?</p>

I certainly recognise the novelty of the proposition put forward by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. I can see that it is an interesting concept and that it would be an option in some rural areas in particular. However, sympathetic though one might be in those terms, I am sceptical about whether it can work. My noble friend Lord Snape put his finger on the matter very well. Enforcement would certainly be an issue, as would cost, and I question whether the scheme would deliver new services.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="07120650000106">However, one should not be entirely dismissive, and I certainly recognise the warm spirit in which the amendment has been moved. In describing it, one could characterise it as being neither a partnership between the local authority and the local transport authority nor a quality contracts scheme; it seems to be a bit of one and a bit of the other but not really something that, in practical terms, appears to be workable. It is not a partnership because it does not require the authority to do anything other than play its part in advising the traffic commissioner on whether to allow services to be registered; nor is it a true quality contracts scheme because, although a majority of the services in the zone have to be tendered, the network will include some that are provided entirely on a commercial basis. Therefore, it is hard to see the proposal being operable.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000108">Although I do not want to appear entirely negative about the proposal, the real questions are whether any bus operator would be willing to sign up to such a scheme and whether it could possibly go ahead

As I and other noble Lords mentioned at Second Reading, the public interest should be paramount when considering bus services. The introduction of fares, frequencies and timings is therefore to be broadly welcomed. However, for a partnership to function properly, there is a need for the arrangement to be fair for both the authority and the operator. I hope to raise some points to develop this argument.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000116">We read with interest Clause 12(4) on the proposed new registration restrictions. I should not like to see the use of quality partnerships unjustly restrict access to the market. The introduction of a quality partnership along a route does indeed raise some points when proposed new services alongside the partnership are considered. Under the clause, the Bill will allow local authorities to specify restrictions on the registration of any local services where they consider it necessary or expedient in cases where such services would be detrimental to the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000117">The proposals under the clause have potential but I have some concerns. It must be remembered that a low-quality operator by definition would not be able to use the facilities and services provided by the local authority under some of the arrangements. Certainly in regard to the provision of bus shelters, the existence of a quality partnership would preclude the operator from using the corridor anyway as the bus would not be able to pick up passengers from the shelters unless operating in a &#147;hail and ride&#148; manner.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para13">
<p><a name="07120650000118">There may be legitimate reasons for certain services running close to each other rather than at an even headway&#151;for example, buses with vastly different routes may converge coincidentally on a quality partnership corridor at a similar time. In this case, timings at other points in the network or scheduling efficiencies may be the main concern&#151;for instance, meeting a rail service. Does the Minister agree that these factors should be borne in mind when devising registration restrictions?</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="07120650000119">On the local transport authority side, Amendment No. 12 would allow local authorities to specify minimum periods of operation on services within a quality partnership area. If the minimum term was, say, a year, that would discourage a bogus operator from deliberately disrupting the market and undermining the quality partnership approach. Frequent changes to the arrangements of bus services all factor into the public perception of unreliability.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07120650000120">For similar reasons, Amendment No. 14 seeks to place restrictions on the number of times an operator can change its service per year and to increase the notification period required for each change. At present, 56 days&#146; notice is required in England before changing a service; in Scotland, it is 70 days. My amendment proposes that under a quality partnership scheme this would increase to 90 days to discourage services being changed too frequently. As I have mentioned, alongside punctuality, one of the main determinants of the public&#146;s perception of reliability is how consistent a service remains over time. Overly frequent changes can serve to undermine the benefits that a collaborative approach would bring.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="07120650000121">The amendment has been included in the quality partnership section as it could have real potential in encouraging local transport authorities to take up a quality partnership arrangement. This would prove an additional benefit in setting up a scheme and would further differentiate the quality partnership approach from the voluntary scheme. I beg to move.</p>

I certainly agree that there is often merit in ensuring that services in a quality partnership scheme are not varied too frequently, as that could undermine the objectives of the scheme. Thinking of my own experience, I expect a local operator to change its services in the spring and the autumn to reflect different patterns of movement and perhaps also to time with school and college terms and so on. This is not a precise science. The noble Lord is right that the public like to have certainty and knowledge of frequency. I have been particularly pleased in our locality about the use of

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="07120650000123">Moving away from that, I do not think that Amendment No. 12 is necessary because of the provisions which would be inserted into Section 114 of the Transport Act 2000 by Clause 12(4). Taken with Clause 42 of this Bill, that would enable a local authority making a quality partnership scheme to place appropriate restrictions on registrations, or variations or cancellations of registrations. Where these registration restrictions applied, the traffic commissioner could not accept an application from an operator to register a service, or to vary or cancel a registration, without first consulting the local authority that made the scheme and any operator that might be affected by the application.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07120650000124">If a scheme includes registration restrictions, it must also specify criteria for the traffic commissioner to apply in deciding whether or not an application will be detrimental to the provision of local services under the scheme. Having considered any representations made in response to the consultation and having applied the registration criteria, the commissioner must then decide whether to accept the application, disallow it or require it to be modified in some way.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07120650000125">In the case of variation or cancellation, it would be possible for one of the criteria to be that the service must have been operated, without variation, for a minimum length of time. Even if that is not a criterion as such, there may be other reasons why, by applying other criteria, a variation or cancellation might be refused. There may also be cases where within a comparatively short term a variation might be beneficial and should not be ruled out; for example, if a service connects with a local train and the train timetable has changed. We would need flexibility for that. I am sure the noble Earl would accept that one would not want to disallow such a variation simply because six months, or whatever time was specified, had not elapsed since the previous variation.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07120650000126">I hope that the noble Earl will accept that there are ways of dealing with this matter under the Bill as it stands, and that he will feel able to withdraw that amendment.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07120650000127">Amendment No. 14 covers the same subject and I fully understand the purpose behind it. A longer period of notice of registrations, variations or cancellations would certainly make it easier for the local transport authority and other operators to plan ahead. There have been similar suggestions from various consultees, with various periods proposed. However, we argue that the amendment is unnecessary because the 56-day period which normally applies to local service registrations is not specified in primary legislation but in regulations made under Section 6 of the Transport Act 1985. Any change to the prescribed period could also be specified in regulations. The notice period has already been amended once&#151;originally it was only 42 days and in

The regulation-making power is sufficiently broad to allow different periods to be prescribed in different circumstances, so it would certainly be possible to prescribe 56 days for services wholly outside the area of a quality partnership scheme, and 90 days, or any other period for that matter, for services wholly or partly inside the area.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000128">The Department for Transport is intending to review a number of aspects of the existing regulations on local service registration in the light of the new provisions of this Bill and the related policies. One option may be to provide for different registration periods in particular circumstances, but this would be done only following detailed consultation with stakeholders, and there would certainly be plenty of opportunities to set out the case for longer periods of notice for bus registrations, whether in a quality partnership area or more generally. All this can already be done under existing primary legislation and without the need for a specific amendment to the Bill. I think that that addresses the issue that the noble Earl has raised and I therefore hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

For example, new buses, bus lanes, video cameras, imaginative ticketing promotions and accessibility measures all have a part to play but the skills dimension is often overlooked in various initiatives to get greater quality into bus travel. For example, increased driving skills provide a better ride for passengers and reduce accidents; more attention to customer service should mean fewer complaints and more satisfied passengers; and disability awareness is part of good customer service, as is good communication with passengers.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000135">The development of skills has been given significant backing through the recent Leitch review, which in particular proposed an employer pledge on basic skills and a first level 2 qualification. It also proposed increasing to in excess of 90 per cent the number of people with a level 2 qualification by 2020. The Leitch report called for a more demand-led approach to skills. That means that employer skills needs are at the forefront of the provision, and that differs from what has sometimes been the previous approach of trying to supply a blanket amount of skilled provision.</p>

<p><a name="07120650000136">The bus industry has had voluntary skills and qualifications and progress has been made. As I said, GoSkills, the sector skills council for the passenger transport industry, works with employers and operators in the passenger transport sector to address problems such as recruitment and retention, skills shortages and sourcing training solutions. Now that we have enhanced national targets and a skills pledge as a vehicle, and we have also had the Leitch report with a renewed emphasis on progress, it would seem appropriate to embed that process of skills development and provide for it to be vested in the close local transport authority/operator relationship set out in the Bill.</p>

Two questions immediately come to mind: how many and how much? If we are to give local authorities these powers and write them into the Bill, it is incumbent on my noble friend to tell us the cost of such a scheme and from where local authorities will get the expertise that he demands in his amendment. The bus industry does not&#151;and never has, as far as I can see&#151;throw the keys to a &#163;250,000 vehicle to someone who walks in off the street. Many companies have specific training schemes for their drivers.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para30">
<p><a name="07120651000006">On seeing the amendment, I consulted the Confederation of Passenger Transport on whether there is a general consensus throughout the bus industry. It told me that new drivers undergo at least a three-week training programme prior to passing their PCV test, followed by a further two-week training programme before being allowed to drive on their own. The initial training programme covers topics such as company and depot health and safety procedures, carrying out safety checks on vehicles before leaving the depot, defensive driving, fuel-efficient driving, Highway Code knowledge, hazard-perception training, customer care training, including dealing with the requirements of disabled and elderly people, children and difficult customers&#151;as anybody who rides on buses late at night knows, there are plenty of those around. Post-test training is not forgotten either. It includes vehicle familiarisation, route learning and potential hazards on each route, how to issue tickets and cash handling, drivers&#146; hours and working time directive, PCV legislation generally, on-road experience with a senior driver, and obtaining NVQ level 2 or BTEC qualifications. Many companies in the industry also offer access to key skill training in English and maths through local courses. From September of next year, much of this training will be incorporated into driver CPC when they are engaged by the company. My noble friend should tell me what the local authorities would do in excess of what the industry already does now.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para31">
<p><a name="07120651000007">I have already indicated that my noble friend wants to give them powers for which they have no expertise at the present time. I do not want to sound over-critical of the passenger transport executive in the area where I used to work, but there are more than 300 people working there now. They are not running buses and not running trains&#151; they are always complaining that they are not doing either&#151;and demanding greater powers. How many additional staff would local authorities need? Where would they recruit staff with the vast expertise that my noble friend demands?</p>

<a name="71206-gc0005.htm_para32">
<p><a name="07120651000008">Again perhaps my noble friend will answer this question: how much will this extra expenditure benefit the passenger, the customer or the person who rides on the bus, however you want to describe them? If this amendment were accepted it would create another vast local authority bureaucracy which would in no way benefit the passenger.</p>

I do not want to pre-empt the Minister&#146;s reply. So it should be: driving a train is a bit more complicated than driving a bus. That is not to undermine the skills necessary to drive buses. I was always full of admiration for our drivers for coping as well as they did with the present-day traffic conditions, not to mention the present-day drunks late at night. These drivers are enormously talented.</p>

<p><a name="07120651000011">I hesitate to stir up problems between the T&amp;G section of Unite and ASLEF or the RMT, but there is a considerable disparity in wages for driving a bus when compared to driving a train. Although that is not strictly relevant to the passage of the Bill, it is possible, within six months, to start on the railways and then drive a Pendolino train at 125 miles an hour between Euston and Manchester. I do not want to undermine in any way the skills necessary to drive modern trains, but the railway is a vastly different place from what it was in the days of steam. These are dangerous waters&#151;I might get letters from ASLEF about this&#151;but it is a lot easier to drive a train these days. Conversely, given present day traffic conditions and modern society, it is a lot more difficult to drive a bus.</p>

<p><a name="07120651000012">Bus companies are as keen to see proper standards of training for their drivers as the railway industry or anyone else.

<p><a name="07120651000015">As I mentioned in my opening contribution, there has been a new emphasis on skills in the light of the Leitch report and the Government are urging a raising of skills standards.

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="07120651000018">My noble friend Lord Snape also raised some very important issues concerning the scope and possible consequences of the amendments. My noble friend Lord Rosser has enormous experience in this area. He rightly set his amendments in the context of the national importance of skills and improving skills and referred to the ground-breaking Leitch report. I, for one, am proud of the Government&#146;s record on encouraging skills throughout our country.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="07120651000019">My noble friend raised some very important points about driver skills. We certainly recognise the importance to the bus industry of having a skilled workforce and of the industry being able to recruit and retain in sufficient numbers skilled drivers, mechanics and other essential staff. In this regard, I take the opportunity to welcome the work of GoSkills, the sector skills council for the passenger transport industry, in raising the profile of skills and training in the industry, building on much existing good work by the industry. The Department of Transport works closely with GoSkills and has given it financial support over the past two years.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="07120651000020">I agree that local authorities and the industry should work together on these issues, and I want that to be more than a platitude, as I hope will be recognised throughout our deliberations on the Bill. Indeed, one product of them working together closely has been the publication by the Bus Partnership Forum&#151;on which local government, the industry and the department are represented&#151;of a best-practice guide on staff recruitment and retention in the bus industry. The guide shows what can be done on this issue and I commend it to all those involved with this aspect of the industry&#146;s performance. A copy is on the Department for Transport website.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07120651000022">Against that background, the two amendments are not necessary or appropriate. The legislation on quality partnership schemes in the Transport Act 2000 is drafted in broad terms. Operators must undertake to provide services to a particular standard. The definition of &#147;standard&#148; is not exclusive, and there is no reason to think an authority could not, in appropriate circumstances, specify driving standards.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07120651000023">The Bill, as my noble friend Lord Rosser has said, makes a great deal of detailed provision about frequencies, timings and maximum fares which are outside the current scope of a standard of service as part of the quality partnership scheme. That is because there are particular difficulties and sensitivities that need to be addressed&#151;one of the reasons, no doubt, why they were not dealt with in the 2000 Act. However, there is no similar problem about making provision for drivers&#146; skills or a host of other issues that contribute to the standard of a bus service. If we start to specify that, we shall end up having to specify everything that a scheme could possibly include, and inevitably we will forget one or two. The amendment, while very well intentioned, would not improve the Bill.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07120651000024">My noble friend&#146;s second amendment would add a provision to the definition of a quality contract. As drafted, the amendment would make that not an option but rather a mandatory feature of every contract let under a quality contract scheme. Among other things, it implies that there is always a driver skill deficiency that needs to be improved and that one cannot get satisfactory driver standards without a quality contract scheme or a quality partnership scheme. As I have said, evidence suggests that that is simply not the case. The driving test for passenger-carrying vehicles, PCVs, is itself very stringent, as many Members of the Committee will know. There are training requirements to be met, including regular refresher training. The accident rate for buses is extremely low compared to any other form of travel by road. With a response that I hope is positive, but which may not go so far as my noble friend would like, I hope I can persuade him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Members, including my noble friend, might not agree with the views I have expressed but they are based on 15 years of experience as either director or chairman of a bus company&#151;in fact, the biggest municipal bus company at the time in the United Kingdom. I took the trouble to consult the main body for bus and coach operators, the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK, about this specific amendment. That might be smug and complacent, but at least it is based on some degree of experience. I did not read out a brief provided by a third party.</p>

<p><a name="07120651000027">Incidentally, GoSkills, which the Minister mentioned, wrote to all of us who took part at Second Reading asking for support for this amendment. Is it not true that GoSkills is largely funded by the bus industry? A considerable amount of GoSkills&#146;s income comes from it. I say that not out of any desire to prod my noble friend into further action, because the brief he read out earlier might not mention that. But it indicates, as I hope the Minister would agree, not only that the bus industry is concerned to see proper safety and driving standards maintained, but that it is prepared to fund an outside body like GoSkills to bring about the happy situation that my noble friend&#151;erroneously, in my view&#151;believes can be brought about by local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="07120651000028">Of course there are complaints about people with disabilities and their poor treatment on some bus services. Of course there are some drivers out of the many thousands in the United Kingdom who, despite the amount of training they have had, do not do their jobs properly. The same thing applies to local authorities, I am afraid. Unlike my noble friend, who spent most of his years as a general secretary or an officer of a trade union, I had considerable experience as a Member of Parliament in the other place dealing with local authorities. The same specific complaints that my noble friend evidently believes apply only to the bus industry were frequently used about local authorities&#151;the very bodies to which he wants to give powers for which, I repeat, they are in no way qualified either to administer or to enforce.</p>

I assure him that there is no problem legislatively about the meaning of &#147;fare&#148; in the clause. The wording would be inserted in Part 2 of the Transport Act 2000. Section 162 of that Act applies the definition of &#147;fares&#148; used in the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981. That definition reads as follows:</p>
<ul><a name="07120650000254">&#147;&#145;fares&#146; include sums payable in respect of a contract ticket or a season ticket&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120650000199">Although the term &#147;contract ticket&#148; is no longer in common use, we all understand what a season ticket is. Anything like a weekend travelcard or even a day rover ticket would be included in the term. It is therefore safe to say that any payment for a ticket that entitles a passenger to one or more journeys is constructed as a &#147;fare&#148;. The term covers all eventualities.

<p><a name="07120650000177">Amendment No. 16 is a probing amendment.

<p><a name="07120650000178">The removal of the obstacles that have prevented the setting up of quality partnership schemes and quality contracts have been welcomed by disabled people&#146;s organisations, which believe that it will encourage bus operators to provide buses and bus services that are more accessible to blind and other disabled people. The Government have indicated that quality partnerships can be used to facilitate the introduction of a key accessibility feature for blind and partially sighted people; namely, visual and audible announcements. The proposal to remove the bar on quality partnership schemes specifying minimum standards relating to frequencies, timings and maximum fares is also welcome. Difficulties with frequencies, timings and the bus timetable can make using the bus difficult for disabled people, particularly blind and partially sighted people.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="07120650000179">However, Clause 12 provides that quality partnership schemes will be able to include requirements on frequency, timing and maximum fares only if there are no admissible objections from operators. We are concerned that objections may be admissible that would jeopardise the ability of quality partnership schemes to provide for the needs of disabled people. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 16.</p>

Section 122(3)(e) provides that regulations may make provision as to the meaning of &#147;admissible objection&#148;. I do not necessarily object to the idea of admissible objections, but they ought to be scrutinised carefully. I am therefore not quite sure about Amendment No. 16A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, which would leave the meaning of &#147;admissible objection&#148; as a matter for guidance from the Secretary of State and thus almost entirely outside parliamentary scrutiny.

<p><a name="07120653000007">For example, is it possible that there could be agreement on a quality partnership scheme between a local transport authority or authorities and a bus operator or operators, and a third bus operator could make a challenge to the Office of Fair Trading on the basis that an uncompetitive or non-competitive practice had been put in place by the agreement of the quality partnership scheme between the local transport authorities and two bus operators rather than three, the third bus operator being the one that is complaining? For example, a quality partnership scheme might provide four buses an hour on a particular route, and a third operator wants to come in because he believes that the market could stand six buses an hour. Could he be denied the right, perhaps by traffic commissioners&#151;I do not know who&#151;to run those two additional services? Could he then go to the Office of Fair Trading on the basis that the quality partnership scheme was affecting the ability to compete?

<p><a name="07120653000008">The issue of admissible objections is a weakness in the Bill&#146;s proposals. If a local transport authority is investing significantly in new facilities, it should be able to specify standards on fares, frequencies and timings. As I mentioned in the example that I used in relation to the Office of Fair Trading, a quality partnership may specify that there should be four buses per hour on a particular corridor and that those services should be evenly distributed for the benefit of passengers and to try to avoid bus war scenarios, one of which is still going on in Preston. Under this provision, you could find that, although this had been done to assist passengers and stop bus wars, it could then be thrown out under admissible objections.</p>

Objections are allowed by &#147;relevant operators&#148;. The definition of who might be a relevant operator seems wide-ranging; it might be any operator who operates or has operated services in the area covered by the quality partnership scheme. I am

To reiterate what has already been said, where does the issue or the role of subsidy come into quality partnership schemes? Where does it come into it in such a way as to negate any admissible objection by a bus operator seeking to argue that services provided for within the quality partnership scheme were not necessarily all commercially viable?</p>

I simply make the point that, whichever side of the divide you are on, the need for clarity and certainty in this area is absolutely paramount. One cannot expect bus operators to make the sort of investment that they might make unless they can be clear that the agreement will stick and that, as the noble Lord has just said, the Office of Fair Trading cannot suddenly intervene and pull the rug from under their feet.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000013">Equally, from the point of view of local authorities, it is not just the amount of money that they invest in a quality partnership but the political capital that they invest when they do it. There is now a consensus that tackling congestion is the key to tackling a range of problems. Whether they are economic growth or environmental issues, tackling congestion is essential. Local authorities that are prepared to allocate road space in a different way take a huge amount of grief; indeed, they lose elections because of it. That is why many of them are so reluctant to do it. Where they do it and it is part of a quality partnership arrangement, they need to be sure that the arrangements will stick.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000014">The existing quality partnership arrangement has been a waste of time. Without fares, frequencies and timings, there is nothing in a current statutory quality partnership that cannot be achieved by a voluntary route. Indeed, I was involved in putting together one of the very first ones in Suffolk in 1993 where, incidentally, the quality of driver training formed part of our voluntary quality partnership. If quality partnerships are to move on to the next level, they need to include these issues, but that means that we need to build in certainty for both sides. If the guidance is clearly understood and debated before the Bill completes its passage, that will provide clarity for everyone as we move forward.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="07120653000016">The Bill amends the Transport Act 2000 to allow frequencies, timings and maximum fares to be included in the partnerships. That seems sensible, and many noble Lords have commented that any proposed scheme should principally take the public interest into account. I was interested to see that the Bill lifts the Transport Act provision that schemes can include requirements as to frequency and timing of services only,</p>
<ul><a name="07120653000092">&#147;in such circumstances as may be prescribed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120653000087">What does that mean in practice? Why are some schemes that provide frequencies, timings or maximum fares acceptable while others are not?</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07120653000017">It is clear that all authorities should have the ability to set requirements. This is particularly important in rural and remote areas. Where 16 per cent of rural houses are without a car, the lack of mobility causes significant difficulties, including isolation and social exclusion. For people who live in rural areas, bus services are an essential, not a luxury. The ability of authorities to help remote and rural communities with the problems they face depends fundamentally on minimum frequencies at a cost that is not prohibitive. However, it is almost as important that such services are linked up and co-ordinated with the essential services intended by the journey. This argument applies equally to non-rural areas, which is why there are no circumstances in which this should not be the case. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation of what,</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Low, was braver than me when he said that instead of guidance we should have regulations. He is quite right about that. I suggested that the guidance needs to be redefined every five years but, as other noble Lords have said, the key issue is what is included in it. Perhaps the 148-page document from the Department for Transport and the OFT will give us the answers. Like other noble Lords, I have not read it all in the space of a day, but we need clarity, which I hope it gives, about whether it allows bus operators to know whether they are forming a cartel and whether they are allowed to charge the same fares. I live in Oxford and two companies run a bus up my road every few minutes. They both charge the same fare, which seems quite high, but the tickets are not interchangeable, which is crazy. That needs clarification. However, you will have to be pretty keen to do these things if you are to go through this document and ensure that you will not be looked into by the Office of Fair Trading for running a cartel or whatever. Perhaps my noble friend can clarify some of these issues.</p>

I shall be extremely brief in what I have to say. It is fascinating that one of my noble friends thought that partnerships included fares and services. There have been demands for them to do so but partnerships mean just that, and you cannot call it a partnership if you lay down detail to that extent. We will come in due course to the debate on quality contracts and their value or otherwise, but if you are in a partnership, fares and services should be discussed. The view in the bus industry is overwhelmingly that if you are spending &#163;750,000 a time on a double-decker bus, you want some say in the fares charged to passengers on that bus and in where and at what time of the day you operate it. That is not unreasonable.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000020">I welcome the proposal to ease the present restrictions. Again, at the risk of boring noble Lords, during my time as chairman of Travel West Midlands, we introduced a new service in Coventry known as Prime Line in partnership with the city council. I emphasise that the city council provided the infrastructure. The service was quite successful and the number of passenger carriers increased dramatically. Along came another operator who wished to operate on the same route. Despite the view that the private sector is full of wicked capitalists and pirateers, TWM could make no objection to that. In fairness to the other operator, he too provided new vehicles to a satisfactory standard, which is not always the case. The problem was that, under the existing legislation, we could not co-ordinate fares or timetable services because of the danger of the OFT saying that we were colluding unnecessarily. It is impossible to talk about integration of various modes of transport when, under the existing law, directors are likely to find themselves getting their collars felt if they try to integrate one mode of transport&#151;that is, the bus. I hope that the Minister will offer us some comfort on that point. We will return to the vexed question of fares and services under a later clause.</p>

I know that the company that provides the service is very mindful of people with disabilities and provision is sensibly made to ensure that a wide range of customers find the service easily accessible. It is probably a model of good practice. I know other areas are moving in the same direction, if they have not already got there.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000025">That said, the issue of admissible objections is important. I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have addressed it, even though the purpose of the amendment is to strike away the provision. Perhaps I should explain how we arrived at our position on this concept. In the draft Bill, published last May, the provisions on quality partnership schemes included a requirement that, if a local authority wanted to specify maximum fares as a standard of service, the scheme must include a procedure for reaching agreement with operators on the initial determination or subsequent revision of such fares. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, picked up on the point that the draft Bill included no such provision for requirements about minimum frequencies or the timing of services.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="07120653000026">In consultation, operators argued&#151;we thought not unreasonably&#151;that they could be put at very grave financial risk if provisions on any of these matters were imposed by local authorities without their agreement. In fact, any sensible local authority would take care to consult operators, even before consulting the public, to ensure that its proposals were practicable and cost-effective. It seems highly unlikely that a requirement would be imposed over the heads of operators.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07120653000027">The Transport Committee in another place commented that it is not right that one party to a partnership&#151;the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Snape&#151;can set bus frequencies, timings or anything else without the consent of the other parties. It recommended that the Bill should include provision to guarantee that partnership criteria such as frequencies and timings are set by agreement between the authority and the bus operators. The Government accepted the committee's view that the spirit of partnership needs to be maintained as far as possible.

<p><a name="07120653000028">At the same time, we do not want to enable operators simply to veto any proposal to include frequency, timing or maximum fare provisions in a quality partnership scheme. In particular, we would not want a single operator to be able to block a scheme that had good support from other operators in the area. In short, operators should have a right to object, but not all objections should be of sufficient weight to rule out frequency, timing or maximum fare provisions being included in a quality partnership scheme.</p>

Rather, they would have one option left open, which would be to withdraw services entirely from the area covered by the quality partnership scheme&#151;in other words, the exercise of a veto. We can argue that that would render the scheme worse than useless, and it would obviously have a seriously detrimental effect on the interests of passengers. Indeed, if the Government accepted these amendments, the potential effect would be contrary to one of the stated aims of the Bill, which is to improve the provision of public transport.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000031">Therefore, we need to strike a reasonable balance.

I make the commitment that that careful further consultation will take place, and we will work closely with stakeholders on the development of the regulations, so there will be an iterative process.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000032">Meanwhile, the draft guidance, which has been made available in the Library of the House, gives a clear indication of the Government&#146;s intentions in this provision. They are set out in box 1 of volume 3, which deals with quality partnership schemes. I stress that this is only a preliminary view, and the Department for Transport will no doubt develop its thinking further in the light of the views of interested parties and, of course, in the light of the comments made today in Committee.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07120653000033">To summarise the description in that box, the Government consider that an objection should be &#147;admissible&#148; if, first, it is made in writing within a specified time by an operator of services directly affected by the proposals; secondly, it is made either on the grounds that it would not be reasonably practicable for operators to meet the standards of

<p><a name="07120653000034">Although that represents the Government&#146;s current thinking on this matter, we do not wish to set it in stone in the Bill when we clearly need to consult the parties further and ensure that we have the balance right. Even after consultation, we may find that we need to refine the definition from time to time, and that is the advantage of putting the detail in regulations rather than in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="07120653000035">I hope that my noble friend Lord Rosser and the noble Lord, Lord Low, now understand the purpose of the &#147;admissible objections&#148; provision&#151;I am sure that they did before&#151;and, in view of what I have said, that they will not press their amendments.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="07120653000036">I turn to Amendment No. 16A in the name of my noble friend Lord Berkeley. My noble friend has come at this from a different angle, suggesting that the definition of &#147;admissible objections&#148; should be dealt with in guidance from the Secretary of State&#151;and presumably from Welsh Ministers&#151;rather than in regulations. It is a matter of judgment which form of rule-making is preferable in which case; one fits in one set of circumstances and another fits in a different set of circumstances. Regulations have the force of law, whereas guidance, even statutory, is generally something which people must have regard to, take account of, think about, reflect on and so on. They are made by statutory instrument and laid before Parliament and are therefore subject to greater scrutiny and consideration. That is not the case with guidance, unless special statutory provision is made. Introducing a parliamentary procedure for guidance may remove some of the necessary flexibility achieved by setting our provisions in guidance in the first place. Guidance is helpful as it is more easily amended over time to reflect different trends, pressures and even different sorts of services.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para25">
<p><a name="07120653000037">I am not attracted to the idea that guidance should be reviewed every five years, which seems arbitrary. It may be better to review it after shorter periods&#151;it depends on the need of the time. It might need to be reviewed more quickly in the light of experience, or it may be so robust that it lasts for longer, but we would know only once it was in place and properly tested. Regulations can be amended at any time. I do not see how the amendment would improve the Bill. For the reasons that I have given, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para26">
<p><a name="07120653000038">The amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, is interesting, too, because it comes at &#147;admissible objections&#148; from a slightly different direction. If I understand the amendment properly, it would not delete the provisions on admissible objections as they would apply to quality partnership schemes which make requirements as to frequency, timing or maximum fares. Rather, it would provide a power to disapply those provisions by regulations, and, I

We could, at least in theory, try out both approaches and see which worked better.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para27">
<p><a name="07120653000039">I am not persuaded that anything is wrong with the provision as drafted. It would allow regulations to provide that new Section 114(6B), the admissible objections rule, would not apply,</p>

<p><a name="07120653000089">The phraseology has that benefit. The rule could then apply in some circumstances, but not in others. Virtually every circumstance could be prescribed, although it would be an unusual use of the power to disapply the rule in all circumstances. I am not sure that much is to be gained by the amendment, and a great deal could be lost because the power to disapply the rule in some circumstances would be lost.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para28">
<p><a name="07120653000040">I shall respond one or two of the questions and points that were made in addition to those that I have covered. The noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, mentioned services in a partnership having to be profitable. Nothing is specified on that issue, but companies clearly seek to make an overall operating profit from their commercial services. Not each specified service has to make a profit from that perspective; companies operating across the piece will seek to ensure that those services are profitably run. Quality partnership schemes do not rule out some services being subsidised; they cover subsidised services. Local authorities would be able to subsidise socially necessary services which would not otherwise be provided, as they do at present.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para29">
<p><a name="07120653000041">The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, referred to the draft Bill and the quality partnership scheme including maximum fares with the agreement of operators. We have extended the scheme also to frequency and timings, as I have made clear, simply to ensure that authorities cannot impose unrealistic requirements on operators. We have introduced the idea of admissible objections to ensure that operators do not have a carte blanche veto. Instead, they would have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the traffic commissioners that the requirements in the scheme were not deliverable or viable. That is an important test.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para30">
<p><a name="07120653000042">The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, raised the question of the role of the OFT in quality partnership schemes. The local authority function of making quality partnership schemes must satisfy the competition test. That is why the OFT is involved in this issue. In Part 1 of Schedule 10 it is made clear that any registration restrictions would also have to satisfy that test. The OFT is the enforcement agency and could require changes to a scheme if it were found not to meet the competition test.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0007.htm_para31">
<p><a name="07120653000043">The noble Lord asked about the general role of the OFT and why it is on the front page of the guidance. It largely drafted volume 5 of the guidance, as agreed through the Bus Partnership Forum. The OFT has a role under Schedule 10 to the Transport Act 2000 to adjudicate on whether quality partnership schemes satisfy the competition test.</p>

The admissible objection process is clearly an area of concern and one on which there are strong views. We see it as a way of ensuring that we can make partnerships work so that operators can work with local authorities, transport authorities and so on to ensure that we have genuine partnerships that operate to the benefit of all. It is right that issues such as frequency, timing and maximum fares are part of that debate so that we can try to get consensus and an understanding of each others&#146; problems in providing services.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord&#146;s comment. The danger is that in recent years the operations of the Office of Fair Trading have related to competition in an intellectual sense. It has lost track of its original purpose, which was to ensure benefits to the consumer. I am not confident that we have progressed that issue much further from when I first came across it in the mid-1990s or from when the Transport Act 2000 passed through your Lordships&#146; House.

Making sure that people understand the importance of that is critical to ensuring that these measures work well. I am grateful to everyone for their contributions.

Would that information be made available to the local transport authority, or&#151;since it presumably related to the finances of the bus company&#151;would it be information made available only to the third party and not also to the local transport authority whose quality partnership scheme was faced with an admissible objection?</p>

In other words, as a result of the changes in the quality partnership scheme, although the services were still, strictly speaking, viable, the returns to the bus operator would be reduced.

It enables more of what needs to happen&#151;namely, those sensible discussions&#151;than is currently seen as being the case. The competition test in Part 2 of Schedule 10, which is introduced by Schedule 2, means that operators will not risk fines from the OFT by co-operating with local authorities.

<p><a name="07120653000071">The noble Lord said: The Bill does not seek to amend the people and organisations required to be consulted when setting up a quality partnership scheme. In addition, the consultation requirements when proposing a quality contract remain unmodified. Therefore, the Transport Act 2000 applies, as has possibly been said before. In that document is a comprehensive list of organisations for both schemes. Included among others is the requirement to consult,</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07120653000072">Amendments Nos. 17 and 43 would make it a requirement for authorities to consult neighbouring local transport authorities. While that already may be the case in the majority of proposals, such as when bus routes cross LTA boundaries, there is a need for the consultation of neighbouring authorities to be more explicit. This should be the case especially for quality contracts.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07120653000073">Consultation will allow authorities to have their view on any proposed scheme and raise any concerns. Conversely, taking a more positive outlook, consultation would allow neighbouring transport authorities to collaborate and make provision in their own transport plans for proposed changes in their neighbour&#146;s area. Either way, consultation would surely prove a beneficial exercise.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="07120653000074">In addition, the right to appeal against a quality contract, given on page 23, line 23, is based on whether a person has been consulted during the consultation stage. Assuming neighbouring authorities have this right will ensure that schemes are properly thought out and implemented.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="07120653000075">Amendment No. 44 would ensure that Network Rail and local train companies are consulted when a quality contract scheme is proposed. For similar reasons to those on the other amendments, I would argue that bodies to do with rail infrastructure should be explicitly mentioned on the list to be consulted. That is relevant to some previous amendments that we moved today about comprehensive transport arrangements. This will enable local transport authorities and the local rail industry to ensure good connections between local road and rail services and rail stations, and co-ordination of bus and rail timetables. That joint working is particularly important given the powers in the Bill to enable local authorities to introduce road-charging schemes&#151;something that we shall get on to later. Such charging schemes will inevitably displace drivers and freight from roads and place extra pressure on rail and bus services, which makes co-ordination all the more important.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="07120653000076">Especially when considering the role of new integrated transport authorities to consider integration between all modes of transport, it makes good sense that local transport authorities should consult Network Rail and local train companies on any plans produced when specifying the extent and quality of bus services through quality contract schemes. Requiring local transport authorities to consult Network Rail and local train companies on the provision of local bus services will help to ensure that local areas develop a comprehensive, integrated public transport system across all modes that is able to cope with the added pressure of road-charging schemes. Would the Minister agree that the amendment is justified given the overall tone of the Bill to improving public transport in the broadest sense? I beg to move.</p>

However, I do not agree that the two amendments are necessary, because adequate provision is already in the Transport Act 2000 that the noble Lord quoted.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="07120653000078">Both Section 115 of the Act, for quality partnership schemes, and Section 125, for quality contract schemes, require the authority promoting the scheme to consult any relevant local authority that might be affected by it. These include other local transport authorities, district councils and authorities in London and Scotland that by definition cannot be directly affected by a scheme under the 2000 Act.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07120653000079">Any local authority, in determining whom it should consult, must act rationally and reasonably in carrying out any of its functions. As the noble Lord will know from his vast experience in local government, any failure to do that could be challenged in the courts. On that basis, I do not believe that any more than that is needed, and I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="71206-gc0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="07120653000080">On Amendment No. 44, I am not persuaded by the noble Lord that the introduction of a quality contract scheme would be likely to have a significant effect on rail infrastructure. It can never do any harm to consult&#151;the noble Lord raised integrated transport, on which we agree consultation would be important. Local transport authorities are not confined to the list of statutory consultees in Section 125 of the Transport Act 2000. If it is appropriate to consult a manager in Network Rail, they should do so. It may be as helpful to them as it is to Network Rail to have a dialogue of this kind. However, I do not see any merit in making this a statutory requirement which must always be complied with. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

She certainly sympathised with my view that these people need to be consulted. We would have liked them to have been mentioned. One could say that while local authorities are sufficiently covered, there is no requirement for the rail side of things. Road, rail and buses will increasingly be drawn together. I know that proposals exist to create new stations, which will affect bus and other modes of transport. It would therefore be sensible to include rail among the statutory consultees. However, I was reassured by what the noble Baroness said on the local government side. We will reflect on the rail issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_head0"><h3 align="center"><a name="07120719000002">Adoption: Guatemala</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0">
<a name="07120719000019"><b><a name="71206-wms0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07120719002266">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Lord Adonis):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Kevin Brennan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"><a name="07120719000020">I am today announcing a suspension of adoptions of Guatemalan children by UK residents in response to concerns about adoption practice in Guatemala. The suspension takes effect immediately.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="07120719000021">We have had long-standing concerns about the adoption process in Guatemala, as evidenced by the imposition of additional procedural checks administered by the British Embassy in Guatemala and the UK's objection to Guatemala's accession to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption in 2003.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="07120719000022">I am now introducing a suspension of adoptions in response to new evidence which demonstrates that there are insufficient safeguards in the Guatemalan adoption system to prevent children being adopted without proper consents being given and improper financial gain being made by individuals in the adoption process. In particular, there is a trade in babies being sold for overseas adoption and mothers are being paid, or otherwise encouraged, to give up children for adoption. Such practices are, of course, contrary to the principles of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="07120719000023">I have given careful consideration to the position of UK prospective adopters currently in the process of adopting from Guatemala. I have decided that the suspension will take effect at the point when a certificate of eligibility is sent to Guatemala by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (or, in a Northern Ireland case, by the Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety). This is the last point in the application process administered by the DCSF (or the DHSSPS).</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"><a name="07120719000024">Applications already sent to Guatemala will be not be prevented from proceeding in the usual way&#151;subject, of course, to the usual checks&#151;but only in exceptional circumstances will I consider that any other application may proceed. A decision about any application for an exception to the suspension will take account of the best interests of the child and all the facts of the particular case.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"><a name="07120719000025">I understand that the Guatemala authorities intend to legislate so as to implement the Hague convention in the coming months, but I consider that the nature of the information currently held means we must act now. I will, of course, consider the effect on the ground of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Guatemala, in keeping the suspension under review.</p>

<a name="07120719000026"><b><a name="71206-wms0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="07120719002267">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"><a name="07120719000027">I have today made details available of our proposed distribution of special grant funding to local authorities to meet the additional costs of the new statutory minimum bus concession.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"><a name="07120719000028">Around 11 million older and disabled people will gain better access to vital services and leisure opportunities from 1 April 2008 when the statutory bus concession is extended to free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England. By removing the issue of local authority boundaries as a barrier to free bus travel, no older or disabled person in England need be prevented from bus travel by cost alone and this represents a major step forward in tackling in social inclusion for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"><a name="07120719000029">Additional funding of &#163;212 million will be provided by special grant for the period 2008-09, followed by &#163;217 million for 2009-10 and &#163;223 million for 2010-11. This is in addition to the funding that the Government provide each year, through the formula grant process, for the existing statutory minimum concession of free off-peak local bus travel. The Government are confident this additional funding is sufficient to meet the total cost to local authorities.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"><a name="07120719000030">A full breakdown of the amounts for each authority will be available on the DfT and CLG websites shortly. The distribution reflects responses received to our consultation on the special grant which closed on 23 November. We will publish a summary of responses shortly. The grant will be paid under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and a full report will therefore be laid before the House in due course.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS217"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column WS217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"><a name="07120719000034">I am today publishing a Command Paper&#151;the Government&#146;s response to the report by Baroness Corston of a review of women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system (Cm 7261). Copies are available on the official documents website at www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm72/7261/7261.asp</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"><a name="07120719000035">The paper indicates how the Government are responding to the 43 recommendations made by my right honourable and noble friend Lady Corston in her report. I am delighted that it has been possible to accept almost all the recommendations.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"><a name="07120719000036">Secondly, it gives a commitment to produce a detailed delivery plan within the next six months that will provide the mechanism by which all the commitments identified in the response will be implemented. This will be driven forward by establishing a new cross-departmental Criminal Justice Women&#146;s Unit based in the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"><a name="07120719000037">I am very grateful to my right honourable and noble friend  for the report which provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the many and complex issues affecting women offenders and women at risk of offending. The Government agree that more needs to be done to address these issues and to tackle problems at an earlier stage&#151;in the community in particular. The duty of the Government is to protect the public but it is right that we continue to look at how the penal system treats women and, importantly, to look at what is most effective in preventing reoffending.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"><a name="07120719000038">My right honourable and noble friend considered that the key to success was the need for high level governance and better mechanisms for cross-departmental working. I am therefore very pleased that we are able to set out in the Government response the action that will be taken to improve governance arrangements. The inter-ministerial group on reducing reoffending will provide the governance for this work, we will establish a cross-departmental Criminal Justice Women&#146;s Unit within the Ministry of Justice, and we have identified a ministerial champion&#151;my honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice, Maria Eagle&#151;who will have responsibility for taking forward this work.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"><a name="07120719000039">The response also sets out a number of ways in which services for women in the criminal justice system will be developed.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"><a name="07120719000040">I would like to thank my ministerial colleagues and officials in their departments who have contributed to the development of this response. I look forward to working with them, and our non-government stakeholders, in taking forward these commitments together. I am determined to make sure that more is done to ensure that we have in the 21st century a system that is properly responsive to the needs and characteristics of women.</p>

In the field of transport, the Commission concentrated on its initiatives on the internalisation of external costs, intelligent transport systems and the freight logistics action plan.

The Athens Convention provides for compensation for death or injury or loss due to an accident at sea. The agreed text of the regulation is acceptable to the UK. Shortly before the council, the draft recast directive amending existing directives governing the activities of ship inspection and survey organisations (classification societies), was divided into a directive and a regulation, as had been requested by a number of member states, including the UK. The new directive contains the provisions directed at member states, and the regulation contains the provisions directly applicable to recognised organisations (&#147;ROs&#148;, the classification societies approved to work in the EU). The regulation will give the Commission the power to levy fines on ROs for non-compliance, after consulting member states.

<a name="07120719000793"><b><a name="71206-wms0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="07120719002276">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para33">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_757"><a name="07120719000794">On 16 November 2006, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing (Tony McNulty) announced a review of police pay arrangements led by Sir Clive Booth. The first part of Sir Clive Booth's review looked at the arrangements for determining police officer pay in 2007. The second part considered the effectiveness of the current police pay machinery.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para34">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_758"><a name="07120719000795">On 21 February this year my right honourable friend published Sir Clive Booth's report on Part 1 of his review. His report <I>Fair pay for police officers</I> contained recommendations for determining police officer pay for 2007, including that the police officer pay award for 2007 should be based on a new public sector facing index. My right honourable friend made it clear in publishing Sir Clive Booth's report that the method for determining police officer pay for 2007 would then be progressed through the Police Negotiating Board, before the Home Secretary took the final decision.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para35">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_759"><a name="07120719000796">The Police Negotiating Board has considered the recommendations in Sir Clive Booth's report and the police officer pay award for 2007. Unfortunately the board was not able to reach agreement and the matter was therefore considered by the Police Arbitration Tribunal (PAT). I received the Police Arbitration Tribunal's recommendation for the police officer 2007 pay award on 29 November 2007. The PAT recommendation was to increase the pay of all ranks of police officers covered by the three standing committees of the PNB by 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 September 2007.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para36">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_760"><a name="07120719000797">I have considered this recommendation very carefully. In doing so, I have taken account of the tribunal's findings and reasoning, the need to ensure value for money and the best use of resources, affordability and government policy on public sector pay.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS233"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column WS233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para37">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_761"><a name="07120719000798">The tribunal's recommendation for a 2.5 per cent increase is based on a new index expanding that proposed by Sir Clive Booth. Having fully considered the PAT findings, I accept the recommendation of the tribunal for an award of 2.5 per cent. However, I have given very serious consideration to the implementation of this award and concluded that in the interests of affordability, and government policy on public sector pay, the implementation of this award should be staged. This year's police officer pay award will therefore be 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 December 2007. Staging will mean that around &#163;40 million extra will be available in 2007-08 to invest in the provision of policing services to the public.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_762"><a name="07120719000799">The index suggested by the PAT for the 2007 award could inform discussion and negotiation of the police officer pay award for next year. However, I will continue to give careful consideration to any proposals from the police pay machinery on next year's pay award. This consideration will include how any such award can make the best use of resources, affordability, the need to ensure consistency with government policy on public sector pay and that the needs of the service and of the taxpayer and public are best served.</p>

In his report on Part 2 of his review, Sir Clive Booth recommends that: (i) a pay review body for police officers should be created; (ii) the pay of police officers and police staff should continue to be determined by separate mechanisms; (iii) the existing Police Staff Council machinery should be retained for the time being; and (iv) that chief officers are covered by the proposed pay review body for police officers, but if that is not created chief officers should become one of the groups covered by the Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>

We note that in due course unified officer and staff pay machinery may be considered, in particular as police workforce developments are progressed, but do not think that this is a practical proposition for the time being.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para46">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_770"><a name="07120719000809">I understand that the position of the British Retail Consortium is that there should be no such charges on businesses in a primary authority partnership. In informal discussion during the consultation on the draft Bill with a number of businesses, however, it was put to us that the inclusion of a power for local authorities to recover the costs of the service provided from the business would not be unwelcome, provided that the service provided ensured a reliable level of consistency in the regulatory approach taken to the business across the country.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para47">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_771"><a name="07120719000811">Making best use of taxpayers' money is essential in the allocation of funding to transport schemes. With that in mind the Government announced in 2005 that they planned to commission a review of options for the A303 Stonehenge improvement after a substantial increase in the estimated cost of the proposed  2.1 kilometre bored tunnel scheme. The approved budget for the scheme when it was taken to public  


<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS235"><b>6 Dec 2007 : Column WS235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inquiry in 2004 was &#163;223 million. The latest reported cost estimate is &#163;540 million which reflects a number of factors including unexpectedly poor ground conditions, more stringent requirements for tunnelling work and rapid inflation in construction costs.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para48">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_772"><a name="07120719000812">The review identified a shortlist of possible options, including routes to the north and south of Stonehenge. After careful consideration we have concluded that due to significant environmental constraints across the whole of the World Heritage Site, there are no acceptable alternatives to the 2.1 kilometre bored tunnel scheme. However, when set against our wider objectives and priorities, we have concluded that allocating more than &#163;500 million for the implementation of this scheme cannot be justified and would not represent best use of taxpayers' money. I am today placing the final report of the review on the department's website.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0005.htm_para49">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_773"><a name="07120719000813">I am therefore today withdrawing all the draft orders which were considered at the public inquiry and I have instructed the Highways Agency to withdraw route protection for the complete scheme including the proposed bypass of Winterbourne Stoke.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_774"><a name="07120719000814">The Government recognise the importance of the A303 Stonehenge improvement scheme and that today's announcement will come as a considerable disappointment to the scheme's supporters. The Highways Agency will investigate possible small-scale improvements to the A303 as part of its overall stewardship of route. The department also plans to discuss with the south-west region the implications of this decision for the wider strategy for improving the A303/A358 corridor to the M5 at Taunton.</p>

The decision will be subject to a detailed assessment and public consultation, but we recognise the importance of this issue to the sustainability of the World Heritage Site.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0007.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2216"><a name="07120719002258">Earlier this year I commissioned a status review of the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office in Taunton to establish the optimum future structural and ownership arrangements for the UKHO.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2217"><a name="07120719002259">This review has now been completed. I can announce that I have accepted the principal review recommendation that, given the current regulatory and market conditions, the UKHO should retain its current trading fund status, and ensure that the potential benefits of this

The review considered carefully options to transfer some or all of UKHO functions to a government-owned company and a range of structural and ownership arrangements which might assist UKHO succeed in the challenges it faces. As the report contains commercially sensitive information, a copy of the executive summary only has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2218"><a name="07120719002260">As part of normal MoD business, this decision will be subject to regular review in the light of business needs, or as a result of any significant change in the regulatory or market environment.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2219"><a name="07120719002261">We previously announced that UKHO will remain based in Taunton. As part of our commitment to UKHO's future, we will be investing in a new building and substantially improved working conditions for UKHO's staff. We are currently looking at detailed options and expect to make a final decision early in the new year.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2220"><a name="07120719002262">The status review and further studies have been carried out to ensure that the UKHO has a sustainable future, focused on its core business and capabilities, providing best value for money for the taxpayer. In addition to meeting the core defence hydrographic needs of the Royal Navy and support digital navigation, the UKHO continues to operate in a competitive international commercial environment. Continuous efficiency gains and effective cost control are vital to

In particular, UKHO management has identified those skills and capabilities it believes will be required to succeed in the developing and challenging market for digital navigation products.</p>

<a name="71206-wms0007.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2221"><a name="07120719002263">As a result of this work, and subject to further detailed planning, I have approved the start of full consultation with the UKHO trade unions on the optimum future size and shape of the organisation. Study analysis indicates that a total net headcount reduction in the UKHO of between 250 and 300 permanent posts over the next five years may be required in order to focus resources on the core business. It is hoped that this net reduction can be achieved through natural wastage and the full use of wider MoD restructuring arrangements. As far as possible we will avoid compulsory redundancies.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2222"><a name="07120719002264">UKHO senior management is committed to taking forward the consultation process quickly to provide all staff with clarity regarding their futures.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2223"><a name="07120719002265">With these proposed changes, I believe the UKHO's future will be secure, and it will remain a significant employer in the south-west, with more than 800 staff. I am clear that these are the right decisions we need to take now if we are to deliver a viable and sustainable future for the UKHO and its staff, and value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0">Whether they have made an assessment of Oxfam's recent report which indicates that more than &#163;7 billion of international aid money spent in Afghanistan in the past six years has not met the urgent humanitarian and development needs of the Afghan people because aid has been either insufficient or delivered ineffectively. [HL512]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_0">
<a name="07120652000026"><b><a name="71206w0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07120652000171">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for International Development (Baroness Vadera):</b> DfID welcomes Oxfam's latest report and agrees with a lot of its conclusions. DfID agrees that there needs to be a stronger co-ordination and greater alignment of aid with national and local priorities and increased use of Afghan resources; that further major reforms are required in public administration, anti-corruption and the rule of law; that sub-national governance needs to be reformed and resources channelled more directly to communities; that each PRT should develop a phased, conditions-based exit strategy; and that more investment is required by the donor community in the areas of health and education.</p>

<a name="71206w0001.htm_para0">
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"><a name="07120652000027">DfID also realises that while expectations for development in Afghanistan are high, improving the capacity of the Government and civil society in Afghanistan is a long-term process. We have seen evidence of some improvement and this will need to continue with full support from the international community.</p>

<a name="71206w0001.htm_para1">
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"><a name="07120652000028">The Government of Afghanistan recently outlined their views on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan in a draft aid policy paper. A key proposal within this paper is increased co-ordination behind the Government's own established national priorities. DfID and other like-minded donors fully support the proposals outlined and will help ensure that they are implemented. The Government&#146;s full plan for reconstruction and development, the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), will be presented to the international community in March 2008.</p>

<a name="71206w0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"><a name="07120652000029">Although it is the second largest bilateral donor, DfID's &#163;107 million commitment this year is small compared to US and multilateral financing, which accounts for a large proportion of the &#163;2 billion plus committed to development in Afghanistan this financial year. This is why co-ordination of international assistance and improved effectiveness of aid is a major objective of DfID's policy support to Afghanistan.</p>

The emerging findings show that young people value a single point for information and application on apprenticeships, while employers value the opportunity to advertise their vacancies and receive applications through the vacancy matching service. There are no plans to publish a report on the trials. However, the current apprenticeships review will receive proposals from the LSC on the shape of the national online matching service.
