<a name="40907-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will hold an inquiry into the recent disturbance at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  Yes, my Lords, this was announced by my honourable friend the Minister for Immigration by means of a Written Statement on 21 July. In that Statement it was said that Francis Masserick would undertake an internal investigation. I can now tell the House that this work is instead being undertaken by Sue McAllister, former governor of Onley young offender institution and now head of security within the Prison Service.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister honestly think that an internal investigation of this kind is   a satisfactory response to what happened at Harmondsworth? Has the department yet received the report of Mr Stephen Shaw on the events which took place in February 2002 at Yarlswood, and is it going to sweep under the carpet what happened at Harmondsworth for two and a half years? Does not the noble Baroness agree that a public inquiry would be the right way of proceeding and that there is no reason in precedent why that should not be done, bearing in mind the investigation conducted <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_434"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 434</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by Mr Justice Keith into the death of Zahid Mubarak in Feltham young offender institution coterminous with a police inquiry into the same event?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I think that this is an appropriate response. The noble Lord will know that my honourable friend Des Browne announced that there would be a full investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman for England and Wales into the death, together with the internal inquiry. We do not yet have the report of the inquiry as regards Yarlswood, and it is right that the noble Lord should know that when that report comes out it is likely to cover certain generic issues which will apply to the whole estate. I am sure that the noble Lord will agree that it is likely to be a full and comprehensive report, which the Government look forward to receiving.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness able to tell us whether any Immigration Act detainees are now being held in prison? Further, are any being held for longer than three months, beyond which point detention becomes unacceptable?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, 40 detainees are currently being held in prison. We hope that all of them will be moved out during the month of September.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend explain what further measures the Government are taking to try to expedite the removal of those whose claims for asylum have failed in order to ensure that the period during which some of them are detained is kept to the absolute minimum?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we are working very hard to ensure that, wherever possible, consensual arrangements are made with detainees and that when they are detained, it is for the shortest possible time. Some people are detained for only a couple of hours, while others are detained for a number of days. However, we are doing everything possible to ensure that detention is kept to the absolute minimum.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, how many detainees have been charged with criminal offences following the disturbances at Harmondsworth? Further, can the Minister inform the House whether arrangements are in hand to ensure that witnesses are not deported, and that those who have been deported will be brought back to this country so that a fair trial can take place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am not in a position to provide that information because, as noble Lords know, it is privileged information. We know that the police are investigating these issues and it would be reasonable to assume that a number of people may be charged. Regrettably I am not able to respond to the specific issues raised by the noble Lord. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_435"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 435</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

However, I can assure him that all proper measures will be taken to make sure that any subsequent trial is conducted appropriately.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, pursuant to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, how many of the 40 prisoners who are being transferred in September will have served more than three months?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am not able to give the noble Lord that precise information. However, I shall ensure that those details are obtained and write to him accordingly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify whether these centres are regularly inspected by an external body? Is that body Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Prisons?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, noble Lords will know that these establishments are regularly inspected, although I cannot tell him precisely how that is done. Again, I shall be happy to write to the noble Lord. I can give noble Lords my assumption, although I am not quite sure whether it is correct since I do not have specific briefing on the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel: </b>  My Lords, does the Minister recall that in the report published last year, Ann Owers described the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre as &quot;an unsafe place&quot;? She said that there were no means of locking down the centre in the event of concerted indiscipline. Why was not a fuller response made to her report in order to prevent that happening?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, a very full response was made to Ann Owers&#039;s report. Over 101 of its recommendations were accepted and/or have already been acted upon, while around 14 recommendations made primarily in relation to family accommodation&#151;which are no longer directly relevant as a result of changes that have been made&#151;were not acted upon. The Government have done absolutely everything to ensure that reports are acted upon properly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that in Scotland, whenever someone dies in custody, a public inquiry is held by the procurator fiscal? Does she not think that that would be a good thing to adopt into English law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40907-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord knows that whenever someone dies in this country an inquiry is set up. The ombudsman undertakes those inquiries. There has never been any suggestion that the efficacy and ability of the ombudsman is such that that is not an appropriate course to take.

<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Why the implementation of the new National Health Service dental contract has been put back to 1 October 2005; and what interim arrangements they will make to improve immediate access to National Health Service dental treatment for patients.

<a name="40907-01_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, responses to our consultation on the proposed new contractual arrangements indicated a preference for the new contract to be implemented in October 2005 rather than in April 2005.

</p>

<a name="40907-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>We have allocated additional funding of &#163;59 million in 2004&#150;05 specifically to improve access to NHS dentistry, especially in primary care trusts with the most pressing access problems. We will be increasing the dental workforce capacity by the equivalent of 1,000 additional dentists by October 2005. Funding will be devolved to primary care trusts from October 2005, with a 19 per cent increase in expenditure over 2003&#150;04&#151;which is an extra &#163;250 million a year.

<a name="40907-02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Will he join me in congratulating Martin Anderson, the principal dentist in a Sunderland practice, on winning this year&#039;s international Picker award for the advancement of patient-centred care? Further, what can the Minister say to reassure me that the deferment in 2005 he referred to in all those dates is not simply related to the date of the next general election?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I join the noble Baroness in offering congratulations to Martin Anderson on his award. It was for patient-centred care and we are seeing much more of this in the NHS under this Government.
</p>

<a name="40907-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>This deferment was a result of consultation with the profession and other interests. We listen to people with whom we consult and we have deferred to October to meet their wishes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, why has it taken seven years for the Government to announce the extra 170 places which were announced in July? During that time the problems of NHS access to dentistry have been growing and growing and we have had questions and debates in your Lordships&#039; House. Why has it taken so long?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord will not be surprised when I say that some messes which we inherit take rather longer to clear up than others. He will <br>&nbsp;<br>

recall that we have said on a number of occasions that the flight from NHS dentistry started with&#151;and I use the word advisedly&#151;a &quot;shambles&quot; on contracts in arrangements introduced in the early 1990s by his party&#039;s government. I remind the House that his party shut down two dental schools.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, would my noble friend confirm that the 1991 contract had the result of penalising NHS dentists for doing more NHS dentistry by clawing back money that rightfully belonged to the dentists? Does that not show that we need to get the contract right rather than rushing into it&#151;if indeed the details are not complete?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. He has given a clearer explanation than that involving the technical term &quot;shambles&quot; that I used in describing the discussions on the contract under the previous government in the early 1990s.
</p>

<a name="40907-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>My noble friend is right. The profession has called the contract arrangements a treadmill. That is why we are moving dentists off that treadmill with discussions over a new contract which will reward prevention as well as treatment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, Options for Change suggested that many of the changes that were needed&#151;for instance, the move from invasive to preventive health care&#151;should be field tested. Can the Government assure us that we can take advantage of the extra time to conduct field testing, given that much of the dentistry profession seems to think that it has been pre-empted?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we are continuing discussions with the profession on some of the detail of the new contract and I am sure that people will take the noble Lord&#039;s point into account.

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, where are all these extra dentists going to come from? Was there a sudden influx of people studying dentistry some years ago? If so, why were we not told about it when we formed queues to get a place in a dentist&#039;s surgery? Are they coming from abroad?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, my right honourable friend pointed out in his statement of 16 July that we will be increasing capacity by the equivalent of an additional 1,000 dentists. About one third of these&#151;probably a shade more&#151;will come from increasing the NHS commitment of existing dentists who have mixed practices, so the balance between their NHS and private work will change. We are working on a programme of getting more returners to dentistry. We are helping overseas dentists who are already here to qualify by working with the General Dental Council and others to speed up that process. We are also recruiting dentists from a number of foreign countries, <br>&nbsp;<br>

including Poland, Spain and India. Dentists from Poland are already being interviewed for work in hard-pressed parts of the country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, will the new contract help to offset the problems which occur between the higher-cost areas in the south-east and the north where this model practice is? What will the new contract do to equalise things? The cost of premises and staff in the south is a problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there is much more variety of arrangements for dentists to practise. They can commit themselves to much more work with the NHS&#151;a much clearer commitment under the new contract. There are better rewards for preventive work under these arrangements. As I said, we are introducing dentists from a wider range of sources to work in some of the hard-pressed areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, when the Minister referred to one-third, or thereabouts, of 1,000 dentists increasing their service to the National Health Service, is he double-counting them in terms of the number of dentists in the service, or is he giving us the full-time equivalent figure of their extra work?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   No, my Lords, I was saying that a great number of dentists in this country have mixed practices&#151;part private patients and part NHS treatment. We will be increasing the proportion of their time in a number of places to take on more NHS work. That is the equivalent of about a third of the 1,000 extra workforce capacity that I mentioned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel: </b>  My Lords, is the Minister aware that while 72 per cent of children in public care&#151;that is, children fostered or in residential care&#151;had dental check-ups in 2002, 75 per cent had check-ups in 2003? Is he pleased with the progress being made in this area, particularly against the background of these children&#039;s poor dental health in the past?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I think we are making progress in this area, and that is good news. There is still more to do, and that is why we want to ensure that there is better dental access in some of the poorer areas for people who have in the past not always had access to the dental care they need.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40907-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, what assurance can the noble Lord give that the measures he has talked about will end the existing shambolic situation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>

We are confident that, with the new contract this will improve the quantity and quality of NHS dental care.

<a name="40907-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Trefgarne: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for that reply, as far as it goes. But is it not the case that noble and learned Lords have on this occasion, it would seem, sought to change the law rather than simply explaining or clarifying it?

It appears quite illogical for the Government to expect people to travel from a safe area in Iraqi Kurdistan to an unsafe area in Kirkuk to obtain a British visa. The FCO seems to be indulging in a somewhat contradictory policy in this area. UKTI sponsored a conference on direct investment in Iraqi Kurdistan only in June.

interlocutors that the embassy office is based in Kirkuk rather than Erbil. However, most of those with whom I have spoken have expressed satisfaction that there is a third office in addition to the embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Basra.
</p>

<a name="40907-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Let us be clear: there are no current plans to open an office in Erbil, but none of the decisions is set in   concrete. We will watch security developments; security in part informs the decision. We shall also watch developments on constitutional issues over the next period and, if necessary, the location can be reviewed.

<a name="40907-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister in a position to say whether the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan regional Government raised the matter personally with Mr Straw in their meeting on 24 June? Do the regional Administration consider, if there is a consulate in Kirkuk, and now possibly one in Mosul, that after the boundaries between the regions are   decided by the transitional government in January 2005 the northern region may be left without consular representation, which would be harmful not only to inward investment&#151;as my noble friend said&#151;but to the possible development of tourism and academic and cultural exchanges between Britain and the Kurdish region?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40907-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, it is precisely because the situation in Iraq is developing and we do not know the likely future constitutional position of Erbil and Kirkuk that I placed a caveat on my remarks to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about keeping matters under review.
</p>

<a name="40907-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right to say that the issues have been raised, but they were not raised in   the spirit of despair that the noble Lord, Lord   Clement-Jones, seemed to imply in his supplementary question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40907-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, the Minister will be aware that over a long period Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials travelled from Ankara to Iraqi-Kurdistan. Does she agree that that strengthens the case for moving the existing office from Kirkuk to Erbil or somewhere similar?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40907-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I cannot agree. Our representative in Kirkuk, Mr Noel Guckian, has been travelling to Erbil. He has seen the leaders of both the principal Kurdish parties and, from the most recent reports of meetings that he has held in the past week, which I received from him only this morning, I would say that he has established excellent relationships.
</p>

<a name="40907-03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Your Lordships should not underestimate the importance of Kirkuk, which is a key city politically, as many noble Lords know. Many of your Lordships will also know that it is the subject of a great deal of controversy because of the policy of Arabisation pursued by Saddam Hussein. To answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I would say that it is also of enormous commercial importance.

I have no doubt that Postcomm is looking at performance this year with the same critical scrutiny. We are assured by the chairman that the present level of performance is completely unacceptable. The noble Baroness is right that all classes of consumers are suffering badly from a lower level of performance by the Post Office than we have the right to expect. Everyone in Royal Mail is fully aware that standards must be improved.

<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </b>   My Lords, it is not compensation that the public want from the Post Office, but a good service.

<a name="40907-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I want to emphasise to the House and to my noble friend that in   indicating that Postcomm had obliged the compensation to be paid I was not saying that that was a solution. I am eager to emphasise that Royal Mail is all too aware that the public expect a higher standard of service than that at present and that the targets that have been set and committed to should be reached.
</p>

<a name="40907-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>My noble friend will recognise that throughout Royal Mail there has been major change in operation.

<a name="40907-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government are all too well aware of the crucial role which the Royal Mail and the Post Office play in our national life; that is why we sought the assurances from the chairman that he recognised that targets had to be reached and performance improved. He gave those assurances and for went his bonuses for that past year. Of course, the whole House has had the opportunity on past occasions to emphasise the fact that, unless the Royal Mail improves on its performance, the concept of bonuses for key executives will be regarded with considerable distaste.

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   My Lords, of the targets agreed between the Government and the Post Office, which have been met?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the reason why this Question was tabled was because, at the beginning of August, the Royal Mail indicated that the 15 main performance targets which it had set had not been met. That is a source of very considerable concern. Those figures were for the first quarter of the year, and we do see some degree of improvement from that point. But let us be absolutely clear: the Government, on behalf of the nation, are not prepared to tolerate the Royal Mail&#039;s failure to hit the targets thus far. That is why, on all sides, it is necessary that everyone serving in the   Royal Mail plays his part in ensuring that performance improves.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not accept that the situation, which is quite dreadful, is totally self-defeating? Small businesses, and many medium-sized businesses, have turned to other means of sending mail, such as e-mail, or other means of delivery. The only people who are left are the most vulnerable, who cannot afford to use other means of postal delivery. The targets have not even been set at 100 per cent; I have never understood why we have targets below 100 per cent. The situation is getting worse and worse, the losses are getting greater and greater, and that will go on unless the spiralling situation is brought under control.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the House should be fair to Royal Mail and the Post Office. There are a number of factors behind the present difficulties, but one important factor has been the massive reorganisation that the Post Office and Royal Mail has effected over the past two years as a consequence of the   very point that the noble Baroness sought to emphasise&#151;that customers were turning elsewhere for services. Of course, there is also international competition to provide such services. That is why Royal Mail and the Post Office were obliged to engage on a major reorganisation of their activities. We have been going through that reorganisation for many months, and the Government had certainly expected <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40907-04_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can help me. On two separate occasions, I have sent cheques to British Telecom, neither of which have been received, resulting in my telephone being cut off and resulting in a &#163;20 charge for reconnection. Am I able to collect that &#163;20 from the Royal Mail?
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as I indicated, there is a structure whereby compensation can be given. However, I would just say to the noble Baroness that cheques being lost in the post have rather a long history in British life.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord accept that cheques are even longer in the post than they ever used to be? Does he also accept that this is not about targets but about people? If the Government would only stop the silly business of targets and deal with real people and a real service, the situation would be a great deal better. I am sure that noble Lords will want to put further questions in the months to come to see what progress has been made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, of course, the Royal Mail is a service industry, and the quality of the people and the work that they do are important. That is why the Royal Mail has given every assurance that   it will tackle the issue, which my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead has raised at previous Question Times, about the use of casual labour and the necessity of seeing that such casual workers are adequately trained. The Royal Mail is committed to effecting that.
</p>

<a name="40907-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The issue with regard to targets is straightforward. If the target of 90 per cent of first class mail being delivered the next day were hit, the service that people received would be far better than it is presently. It is right that a target should be set, and it is also right that that target should be hit. I have not the slightest doubt, either, that when the Royal Mail hits that target, we shall expect higher standards to be set beyond it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept the unsatisfactory position that post offices are continuing to be closed, which obviously has a direct effect on people? Does he accept, too, that that is partly due to the Government&#039;s stand, and their insistence, that welfare and benefit payments are paid through people&#039;s banks, rather than through the post offices? That adds to the demise of urban and, particularly, rural post offices; hence, the service is declining, and people have greater difficulties in gaining access to the facilities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40907-04_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that situation partly reflects a changing environment with regard to bank accounts and the efficacy of payments. But the noble Baroness is right: everyone regrets the closure of <br>&nbsp;<br>

a local post office, because all local post offices provide a significant service that is valued by people in their locality. Let me make the obvious point that the Post Office intends that everyone in an urban area should be within one mile of a post office. That is a significant commitment to providing the standards of local service that we value.

<a name="40907-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I cannot go into detailed figures at this stage, but I can say this: it was made clear to the Royal Mail that the losses that obtained on the question of second delivery were making the service hopelessly uncompetitive with others entering the field, and that those losses were being borne by the whole service and by all paying customers. The Royal Mail has engaged in a transformation of its operations to wipe out that area of loss. I am not in a position at present to demonstrate how efficacious it has been. Certainly, none of us would want to see an improvement in its finances at the cost of quality of service to our people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="40907-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that in the days when the Post Office conveyed a far higher proportion of its mail by rail, it met a much higher proportion of targets for next-day delivery?

</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="40907-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I hear what my noble friend says, but I believe that he would also recognise that we must be fair in comparing a steady state that obtained for more than a century, with a great deal of our mail being transported by rail, and a situation that has obtained only for a matter of months, with the transfer of a great deal of mail to road. The Royal Mail will need some time to establish that it has in fact effected a worthwhile economy in that regard; but, of course, it would never have embarked on that action if it was not persuaded that such economies would be effective.

</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is now more than two months since the sovereign Interim Government assumed power in Iraq. As your Lordships will recall, Dr Allawi&#039;s Government was put together painstakingly as an interim government representing a wide spectrum of groups in Iraq, with advice from the United Nations. These two months have continued to present enormous challenges to the people of Iraq and their new Interim Government, but not only to them. The international community, close neighbours in the region, and those whose armed forces make up the multinational force, as well as the wider community, are also having to adjust to a new set of circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>First, the Government of Iraq are a sovereign government. They are making their own decisions, on internal issues as well as on their international relationships. They are planning their own future on the basis of the model agreed under UN guidance, so that by the end of 2005 they will have a new constitution, a new government and enhanced security capacity.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Whatever opinions there may be about the rights and wrongs of the military intervention in Iraq last year, the overwhelming view of people of good will around the world is that Iraq should now be a success for its people, for the region and for international stability. But of course doubts remain. There are those who will never be convinced that the decision to intervene was right; or those who will always believe it was a decision that was not taken in good faith. There are those who believe that Iraq&#039;s future will be dominated by violence, divisions within the country, coupled with constant friction with its neighbours; and those who believe that Iraq&#039;s recent history has undermined international security through provoking increased terrorism. We are all familiar with the arguments. To be honest, I suppose that our debate today will not resolve them, but we shall do our best. I look forward to the maiden speech from the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, giving us the benefit of his wisdom on the issue.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I suggest that resolution will take not only months&#151;the next months of moves towards a constitution and an elected government&#151;but years, as Iraq&#039;s identity as a sovereign state becomes clearer and the nature of its people&#039;s chosen government is established. But today I hope that we can discuss at least some of the latest developments on security; on the political process; on Iraq&#039;s internal development; on reconstruction; and on Iraq&#039;s relationships with its neighbours and others. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_449"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 449</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I shall also touch on some of the issues arising from the reviews we have had of our own involvement in the   conflict.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I shall begin with what, I believe, remains the toughest issue: security. Iraq&#039;s security is a dominant theme, understandably. Without real security on the ground, it is impossible for democratic institutions to flourish and for daily lives to function. Schools, hospitals, transport systems, economic growth and cultural energy are all affected. But it is also the case that in all those spheres&#151;making people&#039;s lives better, democratic inclusiveness, functioning social services and economic prosperity&#151;the appeal of violence as a means to achieve an end is undermined. So security and democracy, civil order and the rule of law are all interdependent. Terrorists know that as well as the rest of us, which is why they attack ordinary institutions so indiscriminately. They attack Iraqis who want to join the police force or to work on oil production or electricity generation. Some terrorist attacks have followed a familiar but horrifying pattern of vicious suicide bombings. Only last Friday, a car bomb outside a police training academy in Kirkuk killed at least 17. Iraqi leaders have been assassinated and the MNF continue to be targets. What is noticeable of course is the way in which terrorists target not only foreign nationals associated with security or reconstruction, but Iraqi nationals who are trying to build a more secure future for their families and society.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The latest round of kidnappings and brutal murders is a further hideous twist. Any country with a presence in Iraq is a target, and any issue, such as secularism in French schools or Turkish efforts to help a neighbour, is fair game to terrorists who will stop at nothing to try to ensure that Iraq&#039;s future is as bleak and wretched as its past.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>At a different level, Moqtada al-Sadr&#039;s rebellion in Najaf has posed an early test for the capability of the Iraqi security forces and the authority of the Interim Government. Prime Minister Allawi&#039;s sensitivity towards the sanctity of the Imam Ali shrine for the Shia community and his restraint in using force to quell the rebels have been instrumental in bringing an end to the fighting. The Interim Government, Ayatollah Sistani and other senior religious leaders have shown that they do not accept violence and that Iraq&#039;s future will be secured only through peaceful means. But as we have all heard today, there is now fresh fighting in Sadr City. Prime Minister Allawi is now considering how to tackle the continuing insurgency in the so-called &quot;seven towns&quot; of the Sunni triangle.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Having said all that, I must also say that the picture is not universally grim. Prime Minister Allawi is making a determined effort to implement a national reconciliation process through an amnesty law aimed at low level, non-lethal insurgents, while concurrently creating special police units trained and equipped in counter-terrorism and insurgency and forming a new Iraqi National Guard.

<a name="40907-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>There is much to be done tackling border security and tackling neighbouring governments about their own security controls, as well as effective policing in towns and cities. But the Iraqi security forces now number over 200,000 and are gradually assuming full responsibility for restoring law and order. The multinational forces continue to support this effort acting under the mandate in UNSCR 1546 and under the policy of a sovereign government of Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I pay tribute to the 9,500 men and women of the British Armed Forces serving in Iraq, to those who have served there over the past 18 months, and to the many civilian volunteers who have willingly put their life at risk to help the Iraqi people. Let us not forget that Iraq is a vast country and for many, although there are outbreaks of violence and other setbacks, rebuilding and improving security are evident on the ground.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>While the world&#039;s attention has been focused on the intense fighting around Baghdad, Kirkuk and the Sunni triangle, British troops, stationed in and around Basra, have played a vital role in improving security and rebuilding southern Iraq. They are providing extensive training and mentoring to the Iraqi security forces in the south and we have other personnel engaged in Iraq-wide training programmes to help meet the challenge of restoring order. I thank the commanding officer and our new Consul General, Simon Collis, and their teams for their dedication and professionalism.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Try as they might the men of violence did not disrupt the transfer of power to the new government. They will now try to impede the political process, a process which, if it goes well, will undermine any claim they make about puppet governments, exclusion from political institutions or the truly Iraqi nature of the future leaders of their country.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The bald fact is that political stability will bring security but without security a political process cannot   take root. The national conference in August brought together 1,300 Iraqi delegates across Iraqi society, including members of Sunni tribes opposed to the interim government and representatives of Moqtada al-Sadr. After vigorous debate a broadly representative 100-member national council was elected. Twenty-six per cent of the members are women.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The council has an important role to play in holding the government to account, in advising Ministers and approving the budget. It has already held its first meeting at which it elected a Speaker and agreed operating mechanisms and a work programme. But, of course, the council&#039;s task is not an easy one. It must work closely with the interim government to prepare for the January 2005 elections. Those elections are the key milestone in the transition towards election for a constitutionally based Iraqi government by the end of next year. A new constitution is key. By mid-2005 we hope that the transitional government will have a draft constitution ready for consultation with the Iraqi people. Subject to its adoption, constitutionally based elections will be held at the end of next year. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

timetable is an ambitious one, but with real commitment by the Iraqi government, the Iraqi Elections Commission and the United Nations, and with the full support of the international community, the groundwork for the elections can be completed on time.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Post Saddam there has been a strong appetite for elections across Iraq, and ad hoc local elections have taken place in a number of cities including Najaf, Salah Ad Din, Dhi Qar, Basra, Ninewah and elsewhere. Iraqi election officials are learning lessons such as the need for effective organisation, effective security and proper funding.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>A number of commentators have said that the United Nations should now take a greater role, implying perhaps that leading members of the multinational force have somehow been an obstacle to this. This Government have made it clear that we welcome the UN role but we must be patient and understand that the UN must be satisfied with its ability to fulfil its duty of care to its own staff before it can confidently redeploy to fulfil its full range of duties under the mandate given to it by UNSCR 1546. But I am pleased that this is well in hand and that, throughout July and August, the UN has begun to redeploy in Iraq and that this will continue with the imminent arrival of Ashraf Qazi, the Secretary General&#039;s new Special Representative, and his team.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Just as Ambassador Brahimi&#039;s patient negotiation with Iraq&#039;s political and religious leaders was vital in preparing the handover, so Ambassador Qazi&#039;s will be in the next stage of supporting the Iraqi Election Commission. We shall continue to do everything that we can to support that process. We welcome our own diplomatic relationship with Iraq&#151;our ambassador Edward Chaplin now in Baghdad and Ambassador al-Shaikhly, who is very welcome here in London. We wish them well.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Economic development is the lifeblood of any country. That must be particularly true for an economy which has suffered decades of mismanagement, embezzlement and war under Saddam. Huge debts were accumulated and poverty was endemic in some parts of the country. The economy was starved of investment across all sectors: electricity, water, health and education, as well as oil production, which provides almost all of Iraq&#039;s income. However, there has been real progress since May 2003. The International Monetary Fund expects Iraq&#039;s economy to grow by 33 per cent this year. The newly independent Central Bank has kept inflation below 30 per cent and the new Iraqi dinar is holding its value internationally. The financial sector is at last beginning to grow again.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>However, many areas of Iraq&#039;s economy are still in need of major reform. Fuel prices remain hugely subsidised, draining the budget and encouraging smuggling to neighbouring countries; no charges are collected for the electricity and water supplied by the state; food is handed out virtually free to everyone, rich and poor alike; and many inefficient state-owned enterprises are running up great losses. But reforms&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_452"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 452</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and they are much needed&#151;must protect people who are already poor and vulnerable. DfID is providing policy advice on subsidy reduction programmes and the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Iraq&#039;s health and education services are also in need   of reform and, of course, large-scale investment. The United Kingdom is supporting these sectors, along with others, through DfID&#039;s contribution of &#163;70   million to the trust funds set up by the World Bank and the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development visited Iraq last week to see for himself progress on reconstruction on the ground. He met with Prime Minister Allawi in Baghdad, other key members of the government and representatives of the UN, civil society and the Electoral Commission. He was struck by the change that had occurred since the handover of power on 28   June. The Iraqis are now clearly in charge, although recent events in Najaf have inevitably dominated the IIG&#039;s first couple of months in power.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>My right honourable friend was able to see the progress made on reconstruction since his previous visit in February 2004. Forty-five kilometres of water   pipes have been laid in Basra and electricity distribution is now more equitable across the national grid. My right honourable friend also announced &#163;50 million of new bilateral projects, in addition to the &#163;78 million that we have already committed. The bulk of that will be spent on building Iraqi capacity and employment creation.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>My right honourable friend was left under no illusion: security will be a major factor affecting the pace of reconstruction. However, I know that he joins me in thanking all those who have made tireless efforts on reconstruction and have kept working under difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions; military and civilian personnel who are helping Iraqis to build a better future.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I turn to international questions. Iraq is now taking its place in international fora around the world. Its Foreign Minister, Zebari, has become a familiar and welcome participant at the UN, in the Arab League and at EU meetings with regional representatives. He has put Iraq&#039;s case clearly and effectively to Iraq&#039;s neighbours, on difficult issues concerning security and border controls. Of course, UNSCR 1546 calls on all member states to support the new government in Iraq. The international conference planned for later this year will be an important opportunity for the international community to come together to provide more support for Iraq, which it so desperately needs.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>However, the fact remains that the war in Iraq has divided international opinion. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions that he respects the view of those who disagree with the war because of a difference of judgment on the right thing to have done. It may be a decision that will continue to divide opinion for years. However, I hope that the accusation that it was a decision taken in bad faith can be laid to rest. Just before your Lordships went to a well earned summer <br>&nbsp;<br>

Recess, we received the Butler report, and I note that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, is to speak later in this debate. The report is thorough; it is detailed, and in places clearly critical of some aspects of the intelligence processes in this country. However, the noble Lord&#039;s inquiry, like the three that preceded it, including that by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, found that the allegations of misusing intelligence or being deliberately misleading were wrong and misplaced.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and their teams, including the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, for their hard work and their contribution to the important debate on terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Let me be clear: the report of the noble Lord, Lord   Butler, raised important questions about intelligence-gathering, intelligence analysis and presentation. As my right honourable friend the Prime   Minister said on 20 July, the Government fully accept the report&#039;s conclusions and criticisms and have   already taken action to implement its recommendations. I have no doubt that there will be further comment on the report during the debate and I look forward to responding to it in my winding-up speech.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>It is important to emphasise that our intelligence services do an outstanding job for this country and have made a significant contribution to exposing the extent of illicit weapons programmes, and the threat they pose, around the world. The joint operations on counter-terrorism, now run across government, are highly effective. This huge effort against terrorism, coupled with our concern to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are key issues, certainly for us here in the United Kingdom but also for countries across the globe. The appalling and heartrending events in Russia are an horrific and stark reminder of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism: terrorists acknowledge no limits to who they attack or the numbers they kill. Our hearts go out to all those who have suffered so grievously in recent days.
</p>

<a name="40907-05_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>While acknowledging this dangerous and turbulent backdrop of terrorism, we must learn the lessons of the past 18 months in Iraq. We need to acknowledge our own shortcomings: what might have been foreseen and was not, and what we can learn about helping countries which wish to come closer to a democratic and peaceful future. While we look back&#151;and it is right that we should do so&#151;I hope, too, that we shall also concentrate on the next 18 months in Iraq. We must look to the future. It is going to be very tough. There will be many setbacks. But the overwhelming majority of people in Iraq believe in their future. They believe in a better, more peaceful and fairer society: a democracy under the rule of law and at peace with their neighbours. Iraqis believe they have a real future now. Let us do our best to help them to that future.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40907-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for bringing us up to date with the situation in Iraq and wider issues. I certainly look forward to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, as he expounds on and illuminates his fascinating report, and to the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, who has enormous expertise in middle-eastern affairs.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>A great deal has happened in Iraq, the wider Middle East and in the wider world of terrorism generally, since we last met here. It all seems to be part of a huge network of connections, examples and copycat activities. Foremost in our minds, as the Minister has reminded us, are the hideous events of the past few days at Beslan, west of Grozny, in the heart of the Caucasus and the continued slaughter in Darfur, about which my noble friend Lady Rawlings may have something to say at the end of the debate. We cannot forget&#151;indeed, one is not allowed to forget&#151;the endless bombings of airplanes, buses, metro stations, the massacres and the shooting down of innocent workers which have filled the daily columns throughout August.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As to Beslan&#151;and I know it is not the main theme of our debate&#151;I have read some rambling comments and articles speculating about the connection, or lack of it, between this almost unspeakable atrocity in Number 1 School, and the Al&#039;Qaeda and other terrorism in Iraq and elsewhere. I think that misses the point, in a way. People have criticised Mr Putin for claiming that Al&#039;Qaeda is involved. I do not care how many or how few Islamic fanatics were involved in slaughtering children at Beslan. The point is that the new terrorist mentality which we are all up against has   now infected extremism everywhere, so that beheadings, kidnapping, torture, the slaughter of women and children and maximum injury to innocent civilians has become the monstrous norm&#151;not just in Iraq, alas, but around the entire world.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I see that President Bush has now redefined what he originally called a &quot;war on terrorism&quot; as a struggle against totalitarian murders, people who cut off heads, bayonet children, shooting in cold blood, almost casually, randomly, to make their case. Terrorism combined with a suicidal mentality&#151;for that is what we are up against&#151;is now a pattern of global crime which, if it is not checked, makes free and open civil society, and normal life, impossible. That was a point wisely made from these Benches right at the start of these events by my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon. He is not with us today, but I know we all wish him a speedy recovery from his recent illness and a rapid return, which will certainly take place. Until the people with such mentalities and methods, whether in Iraq or elsewhere, are crushed, we have no society and no security in Iraq or anywhere else.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I turn to the details of the situation in Iraq, where there have been many developments, some positive&#151;to which the Minister has quite rightly alluded&#151;and quite a lot, I am afraid, negative. On the positive side, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_455"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 455</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Moqtada al-Sadr and his rebels were successfully winkled out of the holy mosque at Najaf. Everyone was dreading what would have happened if that had not occurred. Incidentally, I cannot help noting that when Saddam&#039;s forces mercilessly bombarded that same mosque in 1991, there was scarcely a murmur from the wider world. This time, one bullet off the golden dome and everyone seems to be in uproar.

</p>

<a name="40907-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>There is also the new sovereign government, to whom the Minister also referred, under Dr Iyad Allawi, whom stays firmly in place. They are brave men, all under threat to their lives. They act toughly and clearly. The Iraqi army and police are beginning to gather strength, and a credible national security force is emerging. The country has not yet fallen apart, and some areas are prospering and doing extremely well. Enterprise is flourishing and, of course, elections are in prospect.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>On the negative side, the deal with al-Sadr and his Shia minority&#151;because that is what it is&#151;is only temporary. His gunmen are still around and may regroup at the first opportunity, especially if the Iraqi Government try the tactic of wiping them out while Ayatollah Ali Sistani is trying the different approach of conciliation. I foresee many great dangers if that happens. Indeed, there is news even today of more killing in mosques and so on by the Iraqi official forces. Seven more US marines died only yesterday at Fallujah.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Meanwhile, my own reports from the front tell of a very big deterioration in Basra, with our consulate having been under siege. I hope that is better now. The Ba&#039;athist thugs are back in position, wheeling their relatives and friends into all the jobs. There is very little rule of law. There is corruption. Sects and tribes are busy murdering each other. British troops now have less power, in the sense that they are part of the multilateral force, and I am afraid they are inevitably less respected. I believe they have in all instances been driven back from foot patrols into armoured vehicles, making their very difficult job more difficult still. At Al-Amarah, I am told, there have been 450 mortar attacks on British troops in a recent 10-day period. Under these conditions, it is an absolute marvel that our troops have managed to retain control&#151;just&#151;of the Basra region. This reminds us of what a fantastic and brilliant job they are doing. But, I am afraid, there are still too many stories for comfort about inferior equipment and concerns that the armed forces of other countries have better tax treatment than ours and things like that. Meanwhile, there is a lot of rubbish everywhere, and open sewers. Services are better, as the Minister says, but they are still not working. We must be realistic and balanced about what is actually happening.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Are we further forward with our objective of a democratic Iraq as a source of Middle East stability, instead of turbulence and terrorism? Was there an imminent threat in the first place? Are the Saudis and others now pressing ahead with serious reform? It is very hard to give an answer to these questions. There <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are, inevitably, doubts all around, shared by many sincere people and, dare I say it, possibly even by the Minister herself.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>It may be that in Iraq we have stopped Saddam&#039;s third try for nuclear dominance. After the first two attempts we may have stopped him building up again that which he appeared to have got rid of temporarily&#151;the stock of chemical and biological weapons. But Iran will get its nuclear weapons inevitably. Proliferation is all too easy, given that people like AQ Khan in Pakistan provide the know-how and send round the catalogues of equipment. It is a very difficult task to stop proliferation. It needs to be brought under control and to have transparency, but it may be impossible to stop it.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The truth is that the new terrorism has its own agenda of which Iraqi developments are only part and which is being driven by a raft of considerations&#151;not least by the Palestine/Israel situation, about which I hope we shall hear more. That is one of the key issues that is still worsening further in a crazy tit-for-tat slaughter.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Turning to the bigger picture, we now have, as the noble Baroness reminded us, the interesting report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler. I know that we shall hear more from him but, for me, having had the time to read his report at leisure during August, it contains three main messages. The first is that the report, if read carefully, is a tough indictment of the intelligence services and of the JIC. Rather bravely&#151;perhaps I should say, loyally&#151;the report talks about intelligence &quot;successes&quot;, but the text cannot disguise the obvious failures and urgent needs for repairs in our intelligence services.

</p>

<a name="40907-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>What went wrong? The answer is, quite a lot. The SIS&#151;that is MI6&#151;and the JIC involvement in the disgraceful dossier episodes revealed &quot;serious weaknesses&quot; in the process, although Ministers carry much of the blame for that as well. The report makes clear that it was wrong that the key expert Dr Brian Jones was not shown the nonsense regarding the 45-minute arming of missiles. The key judgments of the JIC put up to Ministers were plain wrong all along&#151;both in March and September 2002&#151;about Iraq having a current CW and BW capability. The JIC,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;misread the nature of Iraqi governmental and social structures&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>which is deplorable if it is true&#151;which I am sure it is. One wonders where, if anywhere, these great experts had been and how much history they had read. As for intelligence sources and validation procedures, they were a sorry tale. The report confirms that &quot;a high proportion&quot; of sources were duds and key information from them had to be withdrawn later.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>All of that is worrying and it is to be hoped that the reforms will put it right, but it takes second place to the extraordinary distortions imposed on us by the Prime Minister and others and the way in which they took already dodgy intelligence and converted it into apparently hard facts. We were indeed deceived, not deliberately, and that has tainted the whole enterprise. A good case for the original invasion, which many of us adhere to firmly, was messed up not by dishonesty, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_457"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but by stupendous naivety and undoubted exaggeration. The world is waiting to hear and will go on waiting to hear why those fanciful and misleading distortions came to be uttered by the head of the British Government.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The third main message&#151;which is a mild criticism of report and I am ready to be put down firmly by the noble Lord, Lord Butler&#151;is that the authors are curiously and almost cavalierly dismissive about the real case for getting rid of Saddam; not the one the Government rather clumsily put in the end, but the one about Iraq&#039;s promotional links with the rise of hyper-terrorism, for which there is growing evidence, and the glaring fact that Middle East stability matters because the region is still sitting on two-thirds of the world&#039;s oil reserves&#151;and the cheapest two-thirds at that. As some of us argued from the outset, before the invasion&#151;and it is not being wise after the event&#151;and as I said at this Dispatch Box in February 2003, it would have been far better if the emphasis had been put from the start on the converging interest between Saddam&#039;s Iraq and international terrorism.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I realise that the remit of the Butler inquiry related to weapons of mass destruction and intelligence. But what is the most glaring fact about all the terrorist events since 9/11? It is that none of those horrors had much to do with WMDs&#151;not 9/11, not Bali, not Madrid, not Moscow, not Beslan, not the embassy slaughters, not the sickening hostage taking and beheadings in Iraq or the bombs in Riyadh and Jiddah, or the endless barbarities against innocents through suicide explosions in crowded public places or in aeroplanes. This is the new form which terrorism has taken in the information age. It uses grisly old-style methods but is empowered by the mobile telephone, communications technology and by the mentality which the communications revolution has helped to stoke up and incentivise. The influence of Al-Jazeera TV, which now dominates Arab opinion, not to the exclusion but the downgrading of the BBC&#039;s Arab service, is a prime example. Iraq was in the forefront of all of that and I do not know why we have to shut our eyes to that fact. It was the main but largely unstated case for changing the regime there.
</p>

<a name="40907-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>We need to see officials and intelligence agencies from all responsible countries working still more closely together on both homeland and international measures to protect us against that backdrop of the new terrorism&#151;whether its sources are in the Middle East or elsewhere. The operations of those agencies are now closely interwoven&#151;national and international, &quot;homeland&quot; and international. In my view, stabilising Iraq is just one part of the larger jigsaw of containing the global and local terrorist virus. The kind of intelligence work to which we should now be giving priority is that carried out by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre, which gets an honourable mention in the Butler report, and similar organisations and agencies, and that is where intelligence reform, which is needed, should now be focused&#151;together with the necessary resources.

<a name="40907-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>A free Iraq undoubtedly lies&#151;although some will argue otherwise&#151;on the path to a safer, more stable, Middle East and to the more successful struggle against fanatical terror worldwide. Unfortunately, the Iraqi experience to date&#151;which we hope will turn positive and that the bottle is half full not half empty&#151;tells us, regrettably, that at several levels of government the necessary focus has been severely lacking and that the hand on the helm of our Government is not always as steady, trustworthy or reliable as we hope for and need. That is a matter of the deepest concern to every man, woman and child in this kingdom.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40907-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for her opening remarks. This debate has attracted an extraordinarily high level of interest in this House. I agree particularly with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that we much look forward   to the maiden speech by the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson, and to the undoubtedly expert contribution that will be made by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and others in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Before I plunge into the debate itself, perhaps I should say first how much we welcome the new ambassador to this country from Iraq and we hope that he will follow carefully the proceedings of this House and the other House&#151;we are sure that he will. Secondly, I should like to follow the noble Lord, Lord   Howell, in saying a word about the unspeakably awful happenings in Russia at the weekend. There are some occasions when the very values upon which humanity itself stands begin to be washed away. That was such an occasion. All of us feel totally inadequate in being able only to offer our profoundest sympathy to the parents and families so bereaved as a result of that terrible occasion.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Perhaps I may add one more word. I hope and pray that in responding to such terrible outrages we understand that if we ourselves destroy those same humanitarian values there will be nothing left to hope for. This is a moral as well as a political challenge, and it should be seen in that light.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Fourteen months ago, when the Prime Minister advocated the invasion of Iraq in his speech to the other place, he set out objectives that he asked us to bear in mind and to consider embracing them in a new United Nations resolution. It seems appropriate 14 months on to remind the House of those objectives: an international reconstruction programme; the use of all oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people on a transparent basis; an appropriate post-conflict administration in Iraq that would be dedicated to the concepts of human rights and the rule of law without distinction between the peoples of Iraq. The speech had all the oratorical brilliance of which the Prime Minister is so capable. It was the basis of a humanitarian crusade and the basis of the argument that we were absolutely right to go ahead with the invasion of Iraq.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_459"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 459</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>In May, the military victory was complete and President Bush could have said that the military mission was accomplished. However, he did not add that qualifying adjective, but said only that the mission was accomplished.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Since that time we have had four inquiries in this country, culminating in the brilliant report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler. In the United States there have been innumerable congressional investigations, many of which are still continuing. What has come out already is that Iraq was invaded on the basis of misleading intelligence, misleading individuals, such as Mr Chalabi, and on a set of assumptions that have not been borne out in fact or in history. Those include the strongly held belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and moreover, was developing further such weapons. That was based on the belief that there was a close link between Al&#039;Qaeda and the Government of Iraq. Despite what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, all the evidence is that there was no such link, and even the United States Administration have recognised that.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>In addition, we had the confident claims of the neo-conservative elements in the American Administration that military victory in Iraq would be followed by a great welcome by the Iraqi people for the incoming invading forces, and that establishing a new regime would be relatively straightforward and easy. Sadly, the promise of that stable and democratic Iraq has turned into a grim and deeply dispiriting irony.

</p>

<a name="40907-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>So far, for all those events that I have outlined&#151;I shall not repeat them&#151;not a single senior person has been found accountable; not one. From the atrocities in Abu Ghraib prison through to the maladministration of the Iraq development agency, which I shall discuss shortly, no senior person been made accountable either by the British Parliament or the United States Congress, even though there are clear indications that at the most senior level there must have been some recognition of the atrocities against prisoners both in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and even though there is clearly official recognition in the report of the inspector general of the CPA on how financial development has been conducted that there must be senior people who, at the very least, are answerable for serious mismanagement. It is not much of a lesson to a country, which we have said we wish to bring to democracy, that we ourselves are utterly incapable of finding anybody accountable for what has gone wrong.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>That is an issue not only in Iraq. I draw attention again to the Butler report. It is not only a matter of shaky intelligence being exaggerated, but what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, had to say in his report&#151;and my colleague and noble friend Lord Holme of Cheltenham will have more to say in this regard&#151;about how government business was conducted. There were no minutes at meetings; decisions were not registered; the Cabinet was excluded from a good deal of information that it should have known. There was clearly a misunderstanding, or at least a failure to recognise that experts were risking their careers to give desperate warnings. Dr Jones was only one of those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_460"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 460</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

experts who were either simply ignored or had their recommendations and evidence dismissed or set on one side. It was not a happy period for our Government and their proper machinery.

</p>

<a name="40907-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We were given two further promises. First, we were told that there would be a more stable and secure Iraq. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has already said some of the things that I wanted to say, so I shall limit my speech as much as I can. The chaos, deaths and attacks continue. The largest number of US servicemen and women ever injured occurred last month&#151;August 2004. So much for a reduction in the levels of tension. Sixty-six American soldiers lost their lives, as did four British soldiers. Since then there has been the further attack on American marines near Fallujah. We are very far away from achieving security in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>In attempting to try to build some kind of security, the new interim Iraqi Administration has already fallen into some of the ways of coercion. They have tried to silence elements of the press and to use coercive measures to get the better of the desperate situation.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The Foreign Affairs Committee of another place, in a brilliant report, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;Iraq has become a battleground for Al&#039;Qaeda&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Al&#039;Qaeda was not a serious threat in Iraq two years ago, but it is a serious threat today. That is at the heart of the Liberal Democrat objection to the war. It has not addressed, weakened and undermined terrorism, but tragically&#151;although nobody intended it that way&#151;it has led to the development and expansion of terrorism in the Middle East.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>We do not know how many Iraqi casualties there have been because we do not count them. It might have been a good thing if we had done so. Independent reports suggest that there are many thousands, and those many thousands are being added to every week that passes.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Secondly, we promised to reconstruct Iraq&#039;s battered economy. The Prime Minister, in our name, pledged the use of Iraqi oil revenue for that purpose, and for the benefit of the Iraqi people. The truth has been different. Even though the US Congress voted for $18.5 billion in addition to the sums from the Iraqi oil revenue, only 2 per cent of the money spent on Iraqi reconstruction has come from those US bilateral funds. Almost all of them remain unspent. Almost all the money came from the Iraqi development agency&#039;s funds, which were subject to far less tight controls and regulation than those of the bilateral arrangements of the United States.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The easiest thing for the Coalition Provisional Authority was to switch contracts from one source of money to the other, which it did in case after case. Of some 37 contracts worth $5 million or more assigned for the reconstruction of Iraq, 85 per cent went to American companies, and two thirds of that 85 per cent went to one major company, called Halliburton and its associated subsidiaries.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Halliburton is currently under investigation for allegedly charging more than $1.5 a gallon to Iraqi civilians for oil supplied, as distinct from the 98 cents a gallon that the Iraqi oil company would have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_461"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 461</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charged. If that is true, what an extraordinary thing to do. Not only would the Iraqi oil agency have needed the revenues and used them for Iraqis, it would have provided more employment for a country in which some 60 per cent of people are currently unemployed.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Worse than that, questions about those Halliburton contracts and about the general administration of the Iraqi development agency which were raised by the United Nations international advisory and monitoring body, set up last spring, were not answered. The United Nations is still seeking answers to many of its auditors&#039; questions.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The Coalition Provisional Authority, towards the end of its life, withdrew 1 billion dollars from the remaining funds which, we must not forget, were meant to be for the benefit of the Iraqi people. We do not know where that 1 billion dollars went nor what it was to be spent on. It would be helpful if at the end of the debate the Minister could comment on the CPA&#039;s administration of the money.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Even the general accounting office of the US Congress said that the CPA had failed to meet its targets for water, transport and electricity; that all production amounts to only two thirds of the target set for December this year; and that oil exports from Iraq are today at their lowest level since well before the Iraq war.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>On every criterion of success, whether that be security, economic recovery or the grounding of democracy in Iraq, we cannot claim success. The evidence points to failure. I agree with what the Prime Minister said in his press conference today&#151;and he said it directly&#151;that the battle now is between the terrorists and the ordinary, decent people of Iraq. Of course, in that battle none of us&#151;none of us&#151;can shrink from supporting the battle against terrorism. But we cannot even pretend that the decisions made by our Government, committed both to the invasion and the implementation of the post-war recovery, and the terrible misjudgments associated with them&#151;admittedly, some of them made primarily by an extraordinarily arrogant American Administration&#151;have nothing to answer for in respect of the outcome in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The conclusion was not inevitable. There were alternatives. Looking back, would it not have been much better to have kept Iraq under the control of the UN inspectors rather than embark, as we did, on an outcome which we could not imagine and cannot even now calculate?
</p>

<a name="40907-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In conclusion, we are entitled to ask the Prime Minister: was it for this outcome that so many lives have been sacrificed? Was it for this outcome that so much destruction was permitted? Was it for this that we have now brought about an even more difficult situation <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the terrorist threat so movingly described by both the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Howell? Have we any reason to believe that all that price was paid for a better outcome?

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40907-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Butler of Brockwell: </b>   My Lords, I hesitated over taking part in this debate because, if the review that I chaired has done its job, people will feel that they have enough evidence to form their own conclusions about the matters that it covered and can move on&#151;as, indeed, this debate is rightly doing. As the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, said, we cannot wipe out the past; the present and the future matter more.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>However, since some of your Lordships clearly want to refer to the review that I chaired, it may be useful if I say something about some of the comments made in its aftermath. I want in particular to thank my noble friend Lord Williamson of Horton, on this first occasion as Convenor, for waiving his high spot in the batting order to allow me to do so.

</p>

<a name="40907-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>This is my first opportunity in the House to thank my colleagues on the review. Although our subject matter was such a controversial one, we were a congenial group, my noble and gallant friend Lord Inge being in the van. I particularly thank Mr Michael Mates for his courageous decision to continue serving on the review after the Leader of the Opposition withdrew his support from it. We would have liked to have had a Liberal Democrat representative, but if Mr Mates had withdrawn, the committee would have been politically unbalanced and, I believe, it would have collapsed. That would have been a pity because we have been able, I hope, to perform a useful role.

</p>

<a name="40907-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, for her favourable comment on the thoroughness and detail of the report. That would not have been possible, particularly in the time given to us, without a first-rate staff, led by our secretary, Bruce Mann, for whose skill and dedication no praise of mine is adequate. I also want to point out that the members of the staff of the review were all civil servants, predominantly drawn from the departments and agencies which were the subject of the review and where their futures lie. Yet there was never any question in the mind of the committee&#151;nor has any question been raised outside&#151;about their objectivity and commitment. Similarly, the committee was entirely dependent on the co-operation and transparency of the   government departments and agencies we were examining. They, too, took immense pains in providing us with a huge volume of documents. There are few countries in the world where such commitment could be so unquestioningly counted on; that is a great tribute to our Civil Service.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>In the time remaining, I should like to comment on three aspects of the report which have received attention: first, the suggestion that no one was blamed for the shortcomings and the handling of intelligence; secondly, the report&#039;s comments in support of Mr John Scarlett; and, thirdly, the comments on Cabinet government.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>On the first, we did not of course say that no one was to blame for the shortcomings. At the press conference, I said that no individual was to blame. Although none of us on the committee doubted, or doubts today, the good faith of the Prime Minister and the Government in concluding that Saddam Hussein <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_463"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 463</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

had concealed stocks of chemical and biological weapons&#151;and with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that view was shared by most other countries and by Hans Blix&#151;the Government&#039;s dossier in September 2002 did not make clear that the intelligence underlying those conclusions was very thin, even though the JIC assessments had been quite clear about that. How grave a fault that was in the context of the lead-up to the war is a matter on which people will and should reach their own conclusions. But we regard it as a serious weakness&#151;a weakness which subsequently came home to roost as the conclusion about deployable stocks of chemical and biological weapons have turned out to be wrong.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>That brings me on to the position of Mr Scarlett. The committee was well aware that the consequence of our criticism of the September 2002 dossier, for which the JIC took responsibility, was likely to be&#151;and indeed has been&#151;demands that Mr Scarlett should not take up his appointment as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. If the report had not said what it did, it now seems to me very likely, perhaps certain, that Mr Scarlett would have found himself unable to take up that post. Suppose that had happened. If so, he alone among the many people involved would have paid the penalty for the shortcomings we identified. That indeed might have satisfied the public&#039;s demand that some head should roll, but it would have been unfair in respect of what were collective shortcomings.

</p>

<a name="40907-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>But, in my view, there is a wider point than fairness; that is, the national interest. The question whether Mr Scarlett should be the next head of the SIS&#151;a hugely important post particularly in present circumstances&#151;should turn on whether he is the best person for the post, taking into account all the circumstances. That was not a decision for our committee to take; but nor was it a decision which should have been determined by the public desire, however understandable, for some head to roll. If what we said in our report has helped to prevent that happening, I do not regret it.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>With regard to what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, among many generous comments on the review, by way of mild criticism about the case for removing Saddam Hussein&#151;there were many aspects to the case for removing Saddam Hussein&#151;the link between the Iraq regime and the spread of international terrorism was not supported by the intelligence. The intelligence, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said, was not there on that and indeed the American Government have acknowledged that.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Finally, I come to the comments in the report about Cabinet government. As the report said, we were not suggesting that there is an ideal or unchangeable system of collective government; indeed, one of the glories of the British constitution is its flexibility. Still less were we suggesting that the procedures are in aggregate any less effective now than in earlier times. I would go further and say that, during my time as Cabinet Secretary, I do not think that we cracked the problem of adapting the systematic but somewhat ponderous procedures of Cabinet government set out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_464"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 464</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the ministerial code to the requirements of a faster-moving, more media-driven world. But the positive features of that system, designed to draw in the expertise available in all parts of the government in a systematic way, and to subject policy decisions to constructive criticism and challenge from those political colleagues with a wider perspective than those grappling with the issues day to day, are still worth pursuing.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Some of the decisions which turned out worst for the governments I served were, in my view, due to bypassing that procedure. I hope that this and future governments will take these points seriously, in the interests not of constitutional nicety but of effective governance.

<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40907-08_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </b>   My Lords, my overriding concern now is for the security, stability and renewed prosperity of Iraq. Whatever our views about the rightness and wisdom of the war and whatever lessons need to be learnt from the mistakes made in the early stages of the occupation we need at this stage to unite in a determination to bring order out of chaos and long-term stability out of the present turmoil. So I will not rehearse old arguments but will concentrate simply and solely on the present serious situation and on how we might move towards a more ordered, flourishing society.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The present instability and violence in Iraq is very serious indeed. So I would like to begin by paying tribute to all those who are putting their life at risk there in the name of a new, better order. First, our own service men and women, who continue to show their characteristic courage, together with their usual constructive approach to keeping order. Then there are the UN officials and members of NGOs and all those working in the areas of aid and reconstruction. Finally, and not least, there are the Iraqis who are exposing themselves to great risk by being associated with the new regime and by being willing to become policemen or administrators. A new and better Iraq is very literally dependent on the bravery of these and other such people.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The present situation in Iraq is fraught with danger for a number of reasons. There have been&#151;and still are&#151;most obviously, those whom the media have termed insurgents, many of them foreign, who are set on opposing the present Interim Government as an agent of the occupying power by every violent means possible, including suicide bombing. In addition to that, there are other elements that give rise to increasing concern.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>First, there is the emergence of traditional tribal loyalties and feuds. It is widely recognised that the creation of Iraq in 1920, on the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, was carried out along somewhat artificial lines and that Saddam Hussein&#039;s cruel and tyrannical regime battened down many potential conflicts. The situation now is not unlike the break-up of the former Soviet Union, with the eruption into the open of long-standing tensions, though on a smaller scale.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_465"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 465</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Secondly, there is the rise of criminal elements, exploiting the present chaos, particularly through hostage taking. More than 150 hostages have now been taken in Iraq. Very often, they are taken by one group with a financial motive and passed on to other groups who wish to exploit the hostage for political purposes. I am afraid that the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein, with the anarchic aftermath, bears out a very Hobbesian view of society. But it is important not to despair and to remember that the Hobbesian view, according to which people can be held together only on the basis of strong government, is only half the truth. There is also our human capacity to see the wider good and our powers to persuade and be persuaded in the interest of that common good.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Here I draw attention to all those working with traditional tribal and religious leaders, as well as with potential new political leaders, to find a new consensus for a new Iraq. For good or ill, here religion has a crucial role to play. As is well known, Iraq is composed not only of different tribal and ethnic groups, but of different religious groupings&#151;Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, as well as the 3 per cent of Christians and other minority groups.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>People sometimes accuse religion of being the cause of conflict. Sometimes, sadly, it has been just that. But in the modern world it is true to say that religion is more often a marker of identity in a conflict which has begun for other reasons but which can, as such, be exploited by unscrupulous people to exacerbate that conflict. The religious dimension can also be brought into play to emphasise what is held in common between different groupings and what can unite them. Here in particular I draw attention to and commend the work of the Iraqi Institute of Peace and its international director Canon Andrew White of Coventry Cathedral, who has been spending much if not most of his time in Iraq, liaising with different tribal and religious leaders to encourage a common religious vision for the future of Iraq. Through a major conference for religious leaders this month and by setting up six fora dealing with different aspects of society in which religion has a key role to play, that is, I believe, a crucially important element in work for a better future.
</p>

<a name="40907-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>It is also highly dangerous work. When Baghdad airport was closed recently and Canon White had to get into Iraq across the borders, his journey involved some 27 security men. I was particularly disturbed yesterday to receive an e-mail which seemed to indicate that a significant section of the Iraqi police force was in fact out of control. In relation to all that, I pay tribute to Her Majesty&#039;s Government, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, for the strong moral support that she has given to this work as well as the financial backing for it. The work has recently been evaluated by the Foreign Office and is, I know, well thought of. It has the potential to make a crucial commitment and contribution to that area because religion can divide or unite. It is desperately important that in such a fraught security situation it is a force for unity and healing.

</p>

<a name="40907-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I make one further point. It is a mistake to believe that western-style liberal democracy can simply be imposed on a country with a very different culture and religious tradition. We may believe, as I do, with Reinhold Niebuhr and Sir Winston Churchill, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Democracy is the worst possible system in the world . . .  except for all the others&quot;.</p>

<a name="40907-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>In that spirit I would like Iraq to be a democracy, but Iraq&#039;s traditional tribal and religious forms of government cannot simply be ignored. The hope must be that within Islam there are seeds of democracy, as we understand it, through the traditional emphasis on consensual government and through the traditions of creative interpretation of the Koran, which are there together with the literalist ones. A friend said, not long ago, that what we needed were,

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Those can be congruous with, and perhaps develop into, western-style liberal democracy, but the task has to begin with recognising a very different cultural and religious context. So I express the hope that the emergence of democracy in Iraq will develop in close consultation with religious leaders in particular, so that what emerges may not be regarded as alien to the culture, but compatible with and, indeed, a flowering of it. But it is clear that, if democracy is to have a long-term future in Iraq, it needs to be appropriated in Islamic terms, not simply imposed in Western, secular ones.

<a name="40907-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </b>   My Lords, I have always made clear that I consider military action against Iraq to be morally, legally and politically justified. Morally justified because no one can dispute the unmitigated evil of the ruthless reign of terror which the Saddam regime practised in Iraq and was able to continue to do so after 1991 because the coalition made the cardinal error of halting military action too soon. It was legally justified because if defiant refusal to comply with 16 Chapter 7 resolutions of the UN Security Council is not a legal basis for action, then I do not know what is. It was politically justified because this unpredictable, dangerous, rogue regime was a menace to its volatile region and, through <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_467"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 467</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that, a menace to the world&#151;a menace all the more threatening in the light of new dangers that we all face from new forms of international terrorism.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I know that others start from a different premise. One cannot but be troubled at the moment at the present state of affairs in Iraq. But let some things be said clearly. Military action was brilliantly successful, unexpectedly swift and meticulously planned and executed by the alliance forces, who deserve great credit for that. Many problems predicted did not materialise&#151;the expected flood of refugees, and so on. But the awful problems with which we are all now living are enormous although, I believe, not insurmountable, given time, patience and sustained effort.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Of course, we all wish that some things had been done differently. The abrupt disbanding of the Iraqi army struck many at the time as unwise and fraught with danger, although I understand the thinking behind that, as well as for not acting immediately against Moqtada al-Sadr when the moderate young Shia cleric leader al-Kooie was murdered when, without armed protection, he visited the holy Imam Ali shrine in Najaf on his return to Iraq from the UK and exile. It was no doubt considered more politic to wait until an Iraqi judiciary could deal with it, but one must wonder if swift action on that murder would have caused more bloodshed than the two uprisings that al-Sadr has now led.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>We can all hope that the efforts of the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani will continue to keep Najaf in some kind of peace, but Moqtada al-Sadr remains a viciously dangerous force and I, for one, hope that the murder of the talented moderate al-Kooie will not be forgotten. All people of good will have to hope that the provisional government of Iyad Allawi succeeds in holding his country together and restoring some kind of normality to a society that has not been normal since Saddam took power in 1979.

</p>

<a name="40907-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Listening to people who were currently knowledgeable about Iraq, such as my honourable friend Ann Clwyd, it is clear that there are some good news stories among the unmitigated black reports from the media. I agree with my noble friend Lady Symons and the noble Lord, Lord Howell, about that. No one with any sense or experience underestimates the problems, but they can be dealt with, given time, patience and careful investment of resources. The murder of Iraqis trying to reconstruct their society is evidence of the determination of those ex-Baathists, as well as extremists, Iraqi and foreign, who do not want that reconstruction, as my noble friend Lady Symons said.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>But let us try to look clearly at the overall picture. There are specific problems with some of the Shia community, especially those connected to al-Sadr, but, with the assistance of the respected leadership of the majority of the Shia, those can be resolved. There are security problems among the Sunni community, especially in the Sunni triangle&#151;readily understandable from ex-Baathists, aided by foreign volunteers, but also from a community accustomed to being in control and fearing the Shia majority. They need reassurance.

Its leaders are so far displaying maturity in playing their part in an integral Iraq and not being tempted into a dangerous move to secession, with all the perils that that would unleash in Iraq, as well as in Syria and Turkey.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>There is now an interim government and a national conference has been held, which was concluded on 18   August. That was never intended to be fully democratic or any kind of substitute for the general election scheduled for January, but it did hammer out an agreement on an interim parliament&#151;a new national council&#151;described by my noble friend Lady   Symons. As the <i>Economist</i> commented at the time,

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Perhaps it is, as some have said, going to be, for a time, &quot;a rough democracy for a rough country&quot;, but let us admit that many did not think that we would be even this far by now.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I conclude with a comment on something that has featured so prominently in Iraq debates: intelligence, its acquisition and processing&#151;a field in which I spent some 22 years. I firmly believe that secret intelligence should never be put into the public domain. I know that that is not in the spirit of the times and I well recall the clamour from the media and others to show us the intelligence. But whatever the fashionable pressures, I think they have to be resisted. If there was one thing that dismayed me about the otherwise excellent Butler report, it was the implication that the next time that intelligence was published, procedures should be different. That dismayed me because I fervently believe that there should be no next time.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>In parenthesis, perhaps I may say how much I welcome what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, said about John Scarlett. I think that it would have been outrageous if the due process of selection of the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service were to have been diverted from choosing the best person for the job. John Scarlett is someone whom I have known for a great number of years and whom I admire for both his professional ability and personal integrity. But the whole point was that the due process should take place without any external interference. The Butler report did exactly the right thing in what it pronounced on that point.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I say that I fervently believe that there should be no next time for the publication of intelligence not because I am not in favour of transparency and accountability, but because I know the enormity of the problems of producing the substance of intelligence reports for an audience unused to reading it and not given any on guidance on how to read it. Much has been written and said about &quot;caveats&quot;, but it is much more complicated than it appears. The concept of caveats regarding an intelligence report encompasses a variety of quite different and specific signals designed to give the reader road signs at different, defined points&#151;source description; <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 469</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

introduction; field comment; desk comment&#151;all to help the reader understand and evaluate the report without betraying the identity of the source.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Unfortunately, time prevents me from explaining that in any more detail, but all of those together are, if you like, what can be classified as caveats. But there is no way that you can incorporate them into a public exposure of your core intelligence. So-called caveats are just one of the reasons that it is well nigh impossible to put intelligence meaningfully into the public domain.


</p>

<a name="40907-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Another example of where some caveats are necessary, but difficult to spell out, is the chairmanship of the JIC, which has changed greatly over the years. There have been many misunderstandings attached to that title, which might have remained an esoteric subject except that the media have taken to parading it as a powerful credential for the pundits that they produce to criticise the Government on Iraq. For example, in one case, the lady held that office for a bare two months.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Also, until 1983, when the Franks report on the Falklands recommended that the practice be discontinued, the chair was taken automatically by the Foreign Office representative on the JIC&#151;a career diplomat&#151;whose day job was that of an FCO deputy under-secretary, which would include intelligence among its other responsibilities. So the chair of JIC can mean very different levels of experience in intelligence. It all depends on when and in what context people come to be in that position. In this&#151;as in so much connected with intelligence&#151;things are not always what they seem and they are rarely straightforward.

<a name="40907-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the fact that your Lordships&#039; House chose to debate the issue of Iraq after our Summer Recess. It is essential that at the earliest moment we should send the message to our forces in Iraq that they are not the forgotten army; that they are facing an increasingly dangerous and difficult time; and that the thoughts of this House are with them in the difficult and important task that they are undertaking.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Those of us who wish them every possible success often find it very difficult to keep in touch with what actually is happening and the current situation. My noble friend Lord Howell gave some worrying figures about the amount of attacks that are alleged to have occurred against British forces in Basra and the region during a recent 10-day period. Will the Minister confirm that there is no truth in the rumour that there was a news blackout imposed by the Government during that time of great tension and attack? If that was so, it was wrong and contrary to the spirit that we try to follow in such matters. It would have been unfair to families and to the Armed Forces who are engaged in the situation. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a clear answer.

<a name="40907-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I pay the warmest tribute to our forces and the way in which they have discharged themselves. Anyone who has had any involvement with them would not be surprised that they have discharged their duties as they have. I also pay tribute to the US forces in the very difficult challenge that they are undertaking. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, referred to &quot;mission accomplished&quot;. Today, I think I saw a figure that, since &quot;mission accomplished&quot; was announced, there have been 1,000 fatalities in the US forces. I have no knowledge of the number injured and wounded, but that too will be very substantial.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>We have paid tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his report, from which we all learned quite a bit. I note that the Prime Minister learned something that he had never heard before; namely, that the crucial intelligence on which some of the main claims were based had been withdrawn. The Prime Minister was never informed and it was only when he read the Butler report that he learned of something that had occurred a year before.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Butler, made a powerful defence of the position of Mr John Scarlett, for whom I&#151;as does the noble Baroness&#151;have considerable respect. But since the House rose, allegations have been made that Mr Scarlett sought to influence the Iraq Survey Group report. Apparently, he wrote to the Iraq Survey Group suggesting that 10 possible &quot;nuggets&quot; could be included in their report. I am not sure if the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his colleagues were made aware of that or whether there is any truth in it; it was in a report by Mr Tom Mangold. Obviously, that is a serious matter because it suggests further involvement in what would appear to be the presentation of intelligence, which many might have thought was not appropriate action to undertake in that way. Perhaps the noble Baroness may clarify that.

</p>

<a name="40907-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>While the noble Baroness said that the Butler report was carefully studied, is being followed up and acted on, one cannot help but notice that the Government have already acted in contradiction of one recommendation of the report as regards the chairmanship of the JIC. I accept that the Prime Minister has announced that this appointment is an interim appointment. But it is against the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his colleagues. The post of chairman is being held by someone who has experience of dealing with Ministers in a very senior role, who is demonstrably beyond influence and thus probably in his last post. Mr William Ehrman has now been appointed on an interim basis and is doing it on his way to his new ambassadorial appointment.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I have the highest regard for Mr Ehrman, but it is interesting that a key recommendation about the chairmanship of the JIC has been immediately ignored by the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, used to see the reports of the Intelligence and Security Committee: this was a recommendation that we on that committee have made consistently since 1999. We were merely drawing on the advice of Lord Franks at the time, which the Government have consistently continued to ignore. I just make that point.

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I feel very much for the position of our troops. While I trust that no one in this House will do anything but offer the fullest support to our forces in their very difficult task, that does not mean we are embargoed from criticism of the Government. I think that the Government have served our forces very unhelpfully. It has been a PR disaster. Mr William Hague made a very good speech on 20 July in a House of Commons debate on Iraq. He said that he thought the policy was correct, but that the Government have ruined the case for doing so. He first coined the phrase &quot;PR disaster&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Against that background, I note that the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee are now reopening their inquiries, which is right in the light of the further information that has come to light. It is against that background that I turn to the events in Iraq. We have all been observers of the tragic events&#151;whether in Najaf or the heightened tension and the much greater violence in the Basra district. I noted that the noble Baroness used a carefully crafted phrase to say the situation was not universally grim. I understand why she said that. It is an understatement of the year for some of the people.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>If I am being unkind or unfair about the position, again I say to the Government, and to the noble Baroness in particular, that it is extraordinarily difficult to have an accurate position of what is really going on in Iraq. What is the position about the reconstruction efforts? What is the position about electricity and water supply? What is the position that is faced in the rebuilding of the Iraqi security forces, the police and the Army?
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The noble Baroness will know that I have raised that issue on a number of occasions. On the first occasion I was referred to the DfID website, which I did not think was the total answer to the request that I had made. If we are to have public support for what we are doing, it is important that we have proper information from the Government on the situation.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>About the only cheerful note that I noted in preparing for the debate was the encouraging letter from the BBC World Service. The efforts of the BBC and its Arabic Service, and the way in which they are trying to communicate British values as well as accurate information, is important.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I have one further point. The current situation is putting great strain on our Armed Forces. In certain areas there is the risk of deterioration. Against that background, I think it extraordinary that the Government should choose this moment to introduce some difficult and damaging cuts to the defence programme, ones that will impact in particular on some of the regiments that may well be asked to face very difficult times. I draw the parallel that we produced <i>Options for Change</i>, but shortly after we announced it Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. We withdrew the programme at that point because we did not want there to be any conflict whatever.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I agree entirely with the right reverend Prelate that we must see this through to see order come out of chaos. However, the challenge is not simply that which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_472"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Baroness spoke of when she quoted the Prime Minister today: that it is a battle between decent Iraqis and terrorists. The problem is that decent Iraqis are not likely to form a cohesive force and that in trying to restore order out of chaos, we cannot get ourselves into a situation where we back individual factions. That, in the end, is something that the Iraqis will have to decide for themselves.
</p>

<a name="40907-09_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>We face a very challenging situation and we have to stand together to see it through. I hope very much indeed that we can secure wider support in the world to help us to do so.

<a name="40907-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, many of my noble friends on these Benches will deal with where we go from here in Iraq, but at this point in the debate I want to ask how was it that we got here. Paragraph 382 of the Butler report reveals that on 12 March 2003, the Chief of the Defence Staff required confirmation that it was lawful for him to issue the order to commit military forces to action. That was not and is not an irrelevant legal quibble.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The use of armed force by one state against the sovereignty of another state is a crime against peace. Personal responsibility was clarified at Nuremberg, where in his opening statement Lord Shawcross said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;it is both logical and right that, if the act of waging war is itself an offence against international law, those individuals who shared personal responsibility for bringing such wars should answer personally for the course into which they led their states&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Saddam Hussein is to face trial on just such a charge, laid against him personally, for the invasion of Kuwait. However, it is not a charge that is limited to the head of state, as the execution of the German Chief of Staff, Field Marshall Keitel, demonstrated at Nuremberg. So the question of legality raised by the Chief of the Defence Staff was not only crucial to him on a personal basis, but was also one that exercised the people of this country, many of whom demonstrated their concerns on the streets of our major cities.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>There are two sets of circumstances where the use of force against another state is justified. The first is self-defence, and the Attorney-General has never wavered on this point. Having considered all the evidence, he concluded in his initial advice that there was no threat to Britain or to British interests which justified a pre-emptive strike on the basis of self-defence against Iraq.

</p>

<a name="40907-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The second justification is the authority of the United Nations Security Council. On this score, for the invasion to be a legal act, there were two questions for the Attorney-General to answer: first, was the United Kingdom authorised by the Security Council to be its agent to carry out such an attack? On 21 April last, I pursued this matter in debate with the Attorney-General, and I summarise my points by saying that the United States and the United Kingdom sought specific authority in October and November 2002 and again in February and March of 2003, and failed absolutely to get the necessary trigger words authorising military action into   any resolution. As the report acknowledges, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_473"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Miss Wilmhurst, the Foreign Office legal adviser, resigned over this issue. Moreover, last week, Mr Cheney denigrated Senator Kerry for saying that he would like to see American troops deployed,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;only at the directive of the United Nations&quot;.</p>

<a name="40907-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Noble Lords will recall the jeers with which the Republican delegates greeted Mr Kerry&#039;s correct interpretation of international law.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>But the second question was equally important to establish the legality of the war. Was there a breach of a Security Council resolution of such importance and materiality that it was justifiable in fact and in law to invade Iraq? Until the publication of the Butler report we had all assumed that all the relevant circumstances would have been placed before the Attorney-General for him to make an independent and impartial assessment of whether there had been a material breach of the resolutions. That was his duty.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>But that is not what happened. His advice, as is disclosed in paragraph 379 of the report, had been that the Prime Minister had to be satisfied that it was possible to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-co-operation by Saddam with the terms of Resolution 1441. But if there was such hard evidence, it was not put before the Attorney-General for his opinion.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>What happened was this: on 14 March, two days after the request of the Chief of the Defence Staff for   legal advice, the Attorney-General sought confirmation that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;it is unequivocally the Prime Minister&#039;s view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in paragraph 4 of resolution 1441&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>On the next day, the Prime Minister&#039;s Private Secretary informed the Attorney-General that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;it is indeed the Prime Minister&#039;s unequivocal view that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations, as in Operative Paragraph 4 of UNSCR 1441, because of false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq to co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>In other words, no independent analysis and opinion was obtained from the Attorney-General himself. The assessment of the evidence, if there was any, that there was a material breach of Resolution 1441, was that of the Prime Minister rather than of the person charged with the duty to make that assessment. The result is that the Attorney-General can say, &quot;Well, it&#039;s not my fault. The Prime Minister decided that there was a breach of the terms of the Resolution. It was not me because I never had to consider it&quot;. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister shelters behind the Attorney-General by saying, &quot;I have a legal opinion which says that it was all right&quot;, and his advice was based entirely on the Prime Minister&#039;s own unsupported assurances. No one was to blame.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>What was the basis of the Prime Minister&#039;s &quot;unequivocal view&quot;? The officials&#039; advice to Ministers referred to in paragraph 267 of the report had been that any authorisation to use force in the original Resolution 678, which was passed before the 1990 Gulf War, could be revived only if the Security Council&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_474"></a>

not the Prime Minister&#151;was convinced of a breach by incontrovertible proof of large-scale activity. In their advice officials added that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;Current intelligence is insufficiently robust to meet this criterion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-10_para11"></a>

<a name="40907-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The JIC made its initial assessment on 18 December, before the fresh inspections by Dr Hans Blix under Resolution 1441 could be evaluated; he had been in position for only three weeks. No update was sought or received by the Prime Minister when he made his pronouncement of an unequivocal breach of the resolution in March.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The Foreign Secretary, Mr Straw, in his letter of 17 March, justified the Prime Minister&#039;s position by reference to the 12th quarterly report of Dr Blix to the UN Security Council. However, in that report Dr Blix said that he wanted more time, and that things were going much better than they had in the past. But he did not get that time.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I must disagree, as I did on 17 March last year when the tanks began to roll, with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale. The war was clearly unauthorised; we were not the agents of the UN Security Council; and it was illegal. Today the Prime Minister approves of an American Administration that professes belief in the pre-emptive strike rather than self-defence and jeers at the need to obtain United Nations authority for military action. That is the ethical foreign policy of New Labour.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>One of the things that I have noticed about this debate is the absence from the Government Benches opposite and from the speakers&#039; list of those who cheered the Government on in March 2003, at the time when the decision was made.

<a name="40907-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Owen: </b>   My Lords, those of us who supported in this House the invasion of Iraq have a very special responsibility to question our judgments and to ask ourselves how it could be that a brilliantly successful military operation could have been followed by so great a degree of ineptness and incompetence in the handling of the occupation.

</p>

<a name="40907-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I hope that I am ready to say that I have made a mistake, but I still believe that the toppling of Saddam Hussein was justified. We need to recover from the abysmal record of those early few months&#151;and we are recovering. In that context I agree with the very measured evaluation of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, of where we have been successful and where we have failed.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>It is by no means certain that we will recover. It is by no means certain that there will be a successful transition in Iraq. But it is profoundly important that it is successful. There can be few other things on the agenda of the international community that are more important than making a success of this transition.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>We are not doing enough&#151;neither quickly enough nor with enough resources and capacity&#151;to train the Iraqi police or military. There can be no better investment than to put that to rights quickly. If it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_475"></a>

necessary to have more troops in Iraq to do this, then that need should be met. All our efforts in the short and medium term should be put into shifting from British and American defence forces and building up a capability inside Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>An insurgency is a very difficult thing to defeat. We all know that. The word &quot;patience&quot; has been used on a number of occasions. That is the only way in which an insurgency will be defeated. There can be no time scales, there can be no planned exits. However well the Iraqi people build up that military force and that police force and however well the relationships between their religious leaders such as Sistani and the Iraqi Government work out, they will still need a mobile force equipped with helicopters and, if necessary, with aircraft with all the modern capabilities that are mainly attached to American forces. That force could be utilised to act as a constant deterrent to the insurgents from making crippling attacks on the emergence of this democratic government.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford got very close to arguing a case that these countries&#151;and Iraq in particular&#151;cannot have a democracy. We made grievous errors&#151;and I include myself in this&#151;in believing that the Arab world was different from everybody else, and that we could therefore turn a blind eye to what was going on in Saudi Arabia and justify monarchs and regimes for year after year that we knew lacked the support of their people, for which there was not remotely a consensus. We often sought refuge&#151;not only in the Middle East but in Africa too&#151;in tribal customs and tribal leaders and found excuses for not going for that essential discipline: one person, one vote and the ability to throw people out of office. That is what democracy is about.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>And so to the future. I hope that this House will demonstrate its commitment to the overwhelming view&#151;although there are notable exceptions&#151;that we must now persist, monitor and watch those decisions being carried out. The first step is the sort of debate that we have had today. I come from a profession that believes that a post-mortem is not much use unless it stops people making the errors that caused death.

</p>

<a name="40907-10_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>We need to start with the intelligence. We have done so in the committee review of the noble Lord, Lord Butler. There are many conclusions and many recommendations tucked neatly away in that document that could easily be forgotten. The noble Lord, Lord King, has mentioned that the Government have already sidestepped the clear-cut recommendation about the chairmanship of the JIC on the justification that this is an interim appointment. It is a scandalous decision not to follow through on their decision to accept the review committee&#039;s recommendations and to evade one of its most clear-cut recommendations within weeks.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The question of John Scarlett is a difficult one. I gave evidence on the day that John Scarlett was appointed. I thought that it was an outrageous decision in advance of hearing from the committee. I refused to give evidence until I got an assurance from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the chairman that this would not fetter the committee from making criticisms of John Scarlett. To its credit, it did not fetter it and it did make criticisms. It then came to the conclusion that, nevertheless, he should be appointed. I came to the conclusion that I cannot accept its recommendations and then pick and chose between them.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>It is of fundamental importance that the authority, competence and trust that we have given MI6 hitherto be restored. We must now give John Scarlett&#151;who was among other things the agent responsible for the most important Soviet agent in almost the whole of the Cold War&#151;and the service that he leads every support in making the necessary changes recommended in the Butler report and in going on to prove, as it has often done in the past, that it is a very effective intelligence service.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I turn to the other recommendations of the Butler report. It is a pity that the committee members did not go further into the question of the conduct of governments in foreign and defence policy. I understand why; it was, after all, an inquiry about intelligence. The committee members had to steer within the intelligence remit, as I had to in my evidence to them. Nevertheless, nobody reading their reports on this matter can be in any doubt that there have to be substantial changes in the manner of cabinet government. We must monitor this particularly carefully.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>In previous speeches I have criticised the creation inside No. 10&#151;and therefore within the political and public relations framework of No. 10&#151;of the conduct of foreign policy to the extent that has happened. It is one thing to have Cabinet Secretariats who are answerable to the Cabinet; the present machinery is quite another thing and it has failed miserably over Iraq. Downgrading the Cabinet Secretary&#151;effectively taking him out of the intelligence sphere&#151;and having another person answerable to the Prime Minister with oversight of intelligence has not worked either. I would like to go back to the broad overriding remit of the Cabinet Secretary which has served us well over many decades.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I am worried about receiving an invitation to mark the end of the United Nations department in the Foreign Office after 58 years of continuous service. I am told that this may not be as bad as it seems, as there may be two departments or its function will spread across them.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>One of the biggest mistakes that was made over Iraq was the decision to go for a second UN resolution. There can be no doubt about that. Why was that decision taken? The French said, quietly and privately, that they would live with the first resolution. They might not vote for it, but they would not act against it. Some people might say that they did not mean to carry that out. I believe that it was the act of a friendly power. That was the message delivered in Washington. None of the senior Americans wanted a second resolution and&#151;most importantly for those of us who believe in the role of the UN&#151;nor did Colin Powell. Why did we pursue it?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40907-10_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The role of the UN representative is not unmonitored. The existence of the UN department inside the Foreign Office was to monitor the Permanent Representative and, quite frequently, to challenge the judgment of the Permanent Representative across a broad range of government decisions and to come to the Foreign Secretary with recommendations that were not always the same as that of the Permanent Representative.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I think that a strong UN department is essential for foreign policy&#151;never more so than now, when the Security Council ought to be, and often is, working much more effectively than it did during the Cold War. The Prime Minister cannot make these decisions about voting, with the short time span that he can give to these big events. He needs independent advice on these questions. Yet we hear that the Prime Minister was ringing up the Permanent Representative, not just once or twice but day after day, on frequent occasions, as if he could sense whether some small country would vote yes or no in the Security Council. That is a very difficult judgment to make, and what one is told at one time is often quite different another time.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I shall not belabour the point but I hope that the Foreign Secretary will give very careful thought to dismantling a powerful department, which the UN department was, and come to us all, perhaps with a consultation paper, before he makes that irrevocable decision, after 58 years. It is very important that it carries weight; it is very important to have that department in trying to develop an overall view of our foreign policy. We have an EU department that co-ordinates all matters, as the Cabinet Office used to do&#151;sadly, that is now in the political offices of No. 10. I hope that an equivalent independence, integrity and knowledge base will not be lost for the UN in the Foreign Office.
</p>

<a name="40907-10_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Finally, on Iraq, I hope that at every stage the Government will send out a message that we are going to stay, that we will be patient and persistent, and that we will see a successful democratic transition in Iraq. In my judgment, nothing would show that better than to put Saddam Hussein on trial before the end of the year and give him a fair trial. It may need to take a long time, such as the trial of President Milosevic.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40907-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </b>   My Lords, since I intend to be critical of the Government&#039;s policy in some respects, I shall start by associating myself with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord King, about the performance of our armed services in Iraq. They are made up mostly of very young men and women. The task they are carrying out&#151;in this, if nothing else, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Owen&#151;is necessary, thankless and dangerous. It has been carried out, for the most part, with very great care and in the best traditions of the British armed services. I ally myself with all noble Lords who have taken this opportunity to thank them for what they are doing.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>It is particularly appropriate, from these Benches, to thank the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his committee. I believe that they have done Parliament and the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_478"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 478</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

country a great service in their report. As the noble Lord well knows&#151;he referred to it&#151;we on these Benches thought that the terms of reference were too narrow, confined as they were to intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. We still think so. We still regret the absence of a synoptic overview of the origins and operation of what can be seen more clearly every day to have been one of the greatest disasters for British standing in the world since Suez.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Nevertheless, it is right to acknowledge that, far from producing what was widely, and unfairly, predicted to be an establishment whitewash, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, actually stretched the terms of reference as far as he could. In my view, he has produced, within constrained parameters, a powerful and damning report. Some people may say that it does not sound very damning, but that is because they do not speak mandarin&#151;that elegant and carefully nuanced language which no doubt many of your Lordships speak. I confess that I do not, but I have had the benefit of a skilled translator. This is an example from paragraph 611, in which the noble Lord and his colleagues say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;we are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the Government&#039;s procedures which we saw in the context of policy-making towards Iraq risks reducing the scope for informal collective political judgment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Or, as my translator put it in the vernacular, &quot;What a shambles&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>On the dossier, a close reading of the Butler report, as well as the sadly neglected appendices of the Hutton report, which bear close study, can leave no reasonable doubt that this was a piece of journalistically driven, politically inspired, public advocacy to make the case for the defence of the action which the Prime Minister had already agreed with the United States. It has been a tragedy for the JIC and the whole intelligence community that they allowed themselves to be used as builders&#039; labourers, handing the bricks to those skilled builders of walls of spin who reside in No. 10.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>As has been referred to several times in this debate, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, very chivalrously threw his protective cloak around John Scarlett. Here, perhaps, the system did close around its own, but I wonder whether even the noble Lord realised what his defence meant and what its significance is. If the JIC information was, at best, filleted and exaggerated and, at worst, misrepresented, and since we are told by the noble Lord&#151;and who would argue with him?&#151;not to blame John Scarlett, the chairman of the JIC, for that, it follows that the responsibility lies elsewhere. Where else does it lie but with that serial charmer, the Prime Minister, and his coterie of advisers, whose fingerprints are all over the e-mails? John Scarlett, like others before him, got too close to the sun. Thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Butler, his wings are still intact but the whole intelligence community today is the weaker for it.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I come back briefly to Al&#039;Qaeda, to which the noble Lords, Lord Butler and Lord Howell, referred. That is one feature of the report which was &quot;in clear&quot;. There was no co-operation between Al&#039;Qaeda and the Saddam regime. This is important, because of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_479"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 479</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

elision and confabulation that the US Administration has made from the beginning of the war on terrorism and the war on Iraq. The Minister will be well aware that public opinion polls in the United States throughout this year have shown that approaching two thirds of the US public, believe that Saddam was somehow involved in 9/11. Yet despite the clear conclusion of the Presidential Commission, as well as the noble Lord, Lord Butler, that that was not the case, as recently as two months ago, Vice-President Cheney was still asserting that there was indeed a connection between the two. Of all the political pressures on the intelligence community emanating from Washington, that which tried to establish this link between Al&#039;Qaeda and Saddam was one of the most malign and distracting. I have good reason to believe that the British intelligence services were not immune to such pressure. That is all the more reason to welcome the clarity of paragraph 484 of the Butler report.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>It is clearly high time for a total intelligence review. If we are serious about the so-called war on terrorism&#151;a phrase, incidentally, which I mistrust increasingly; it is time to disaggregate and focus on aspects of terrorism rather than aggregating it as one impermeable mass&#151;we need a comprehensive analysis of what we do and how we do it. Are we, for instance, relatively underinvested in human intelligence? Is there adequate inter-agency co-ordination and liaison? Is there, as other noble Lords have asked, adequate global co-ordination of intelligence agencies? How can members of the JIC be ring-fenced and firewalled from their mates in No. 10, to recall Alastair Campbell&#039;s phrase? I agree with other noble Lords that the omens are not good when the committee&#039;s advice on the chairman of the JIC was disregarded.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>We must ask ourselves again whether our system of parliamentary supervision and oversight is adequate. As has been mentioned often in the House over the past year, it is certainly time to have a Civil Service Act, which would more clearly define the roles of advisers and officials. I look forward to the Government telling us when they will bring that forward.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Finally, the Prime Minister&#039;s technique with regard to Iraq, looking ahead to the election, reminds me irresistibly of Basil Fawlty&#151;&quot;Don&#039;t mention the war&quot;. He tells us quite often that he would like to move on. I have no doubt that he would like to move on. How nice it would be if the past two years could be spun away&#151;if we could spin away our damaged credibility in the world, the abandonment of the road map in the Middle East, and the clear and present danger of Iraq slipping into the hands of one or other set of mullahs and becoming a theocracy rather than the democracy that we all want. The accession to the cause of anti-Westernism of countless new young enthusiasts, who are therefore potentially a pool of terrorists, must concern us all.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Of course, we all want to move on. I agree that we have to stick with this course of action, now that we have embarked on it, but it would be difficult, if not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_480"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 480</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

impossible, for the Prime Minister to move on politically without some expression of contrition and regret&#151;an apology, if you like&#151;for having misled Parliament and the public about the reason for going to war. I accept what the noble Baroness said, so let us not call that bad faith, let us call it over-enthusiasm. But whatever the reason, it is quite clear that Parliament and the public have been seriously misled.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The <i>Observer </i>on Sunday, although not necessarily a Bible in these matters, tells us that No. 10 aides are now saying that they would advise an apology from the Prime Minister. I may have sounded critical of the coterie in No. 10 earlier but it cannot always be wrong; in this respect, at least, I think it is right. I sincerely hope that its advice will be taken so that we can all move on and that the wishes expressed by the noble Baroness at the beginning of this debate may be realised.

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40907-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Craig of Radley: </b>   My Lords, the valuable report of my noble friend Lord Butler and his committee has done a lot to explain the workings of the intelligence system, and I congratulate them. Delving into the report, I was struck by the expos&#233; in Chapter 1. Clausewitz&#039;s quote on war at the start of the chapter hits the nail on the head. This chapter is a valuable introduction to the intelligence process. Noble Lords who have held high ministerial or official office will be familiar with the JIC process; others should certainly study Chapter 1.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Assessments do not merely report facts; they try to foretell and foresee the future. The human element is always present and what a reasonable man might do will not be the inevitable choice of a dictator. So there will always be caveats, not solely because the available source material may be sketchy or incomplete, but because of the essential element of judgment about what the target will actually do. One example of this was the judgment about Saddam&#039;s intention to use chemical or biological weapons. The Prime Minister and other senior Ministers expressed the view, based on assessments, that that was likely. Noble Lords will recall the Prime Minister&#039;s foreword to the September 2002 dossier. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Saddam has used chemical weapons, not only against an enemy state, but against his own people . . .  his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>A presumption of use was heavily hinted at.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>But, rather like the dog that did not bark in the night, scant attention seems to have been paid to another, by then historical, fact. Saddam possessed WMD during the first Gulf War but he did not use them, even though the coalition forces were invading Iraq as part of their strategy to drive his forces out of Kuwait. In the light of the experience of 1991, why, when Saddam faced once again a similar coalition of nations and another invasion of Iraq, was a presumption of use rated likely by 2002? Indeed, the presumption of possession of WMD now seems demonstrably wrong. But, of course, the UK Government&#039;s rationale for embarking on military <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_481"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 481</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

operations was disarmament, not regime change, although, to give him his due, the Prime Minister said in his Statement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;We know, again from our history, that diplomacy not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 24/9/02; col. 5]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Nevertheless, I have reservations about a policy of major pre-emptive action against a nation state that is not posing an imminent threat to our interests. In the run-up to hostilities, with our Armed Forces committed, it was not the right time to air them.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I have listened to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, with great interest. There seems to be a presumption, even international agreement, that if the United Nations is confronted by a material breach of a resolution and has authorised all appropriate measures necessary to deal with the breach, this legalises the use of force in all circumstances against the offender. But is a UN resolution directing a country to take steps to correct a material breach within its own territory to be treated in the same way as a material breach of failure to withdraw forces from a neighbour&#039;s territory?
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>In 1991, Iraq was in material breach as its forces were in neighbouring Kuwait. But in the case of its failure to respond to Resolution 1441, Saddam might have argued that, as he had already disposed of his WMD stocks, he could not be in major breach of a resolution requiring him to dispose of them. Noble Lords will recall that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General required the Prime Minister,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;to be satisfied that there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>in order to underpin the legality of pre-emptive action.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I also noted that the Chief of the Defence Staff, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, was concerned about the legal position before ordering military action, as has already been mentioned. I fully share his concern to be satisfied about the legality of pre-emptive action. I suggest that, in the relative calm of the present military situation, greater clarity about a policy of pre-emptive action and its legality is required. Is there a legal distinction between the use of air power to carry out occasional punitive raids and the full-scale assault of another country followed by prolonged occupation? It is a slippery slope and every pre-emptive operation must have its own exit strategy in place.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I turn to the present unsettled state in Iraq. Regrettably, the terms of reference of my noble friend Lord Butler did not require his committee to examine assessments and papers relating to the post-hostilities phase. The committee only touched on this in the commentary about the machinery of government. I am sure that it was a confident UK assessment that the weight of coalition air effort, followed by overwhelming use of ground forces, would soon overrun Iraqi defences and eliminate all but some sporadic opposition. But the pre-hostilities statements by the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers painted a rosy picture of Iraq following regime change and the removal of Saddam. Was this just blind faith <br>&nbsp;<br>

or was it based on a close and careful review of the likely political and other developments within Iraq? Certainly, nothing that was said before hostilities gave any sense of the chaos, and continuing security problems, that still confront the Iraqis today.
</p>

<a name="40907-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>In his Statement on 24 September, the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Iraq deserves to be led by someone who can abide by international law, not a murderous dictator; by someone who can bring Iraq back into the international community where it belongs, not leave it languishing as a pariah; by someone who can make the country rich and successful, not impoverished by Saddam&#039;s personal greed; and by someone who can lead a Government more representative of the country as a whole while maintaining absolutely Iraq&#039;s territorial integrity.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, liberated from Saddam, they could make Iraq prosperous and a force for good in the middle east&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 24/9/02; col. 6]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40907-11_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Where is that someone who can make Iraq rich and successful and who is representative of the country as a whole? It would be interesting to learn how the Prime Minister was persuaded that the removal of Saddam was going to bring a quick peace and stability and prosperity to a people who had been terrorised for so long. We have seen the difficulties that nations emerging from under the heel of the Soviet Union had in overcoming their fears of repression and a permanent lack of freedom. Surely it was expecting far too much of Iraqis, given the different strands of race and culture within Iraq&#039;s borders, to be better at moving from dictatorship to democracy than ex-Warsaw Pact countries. On this, not only the Iraqi people, but the whole world, were misled. It is a serious blot on the Government&#039;s and the coalition&#039;s handling of the whole Iraqi affair.

<a name="40907-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend the Minister was right to recognise the courage of our military personnel and civilians working among the agonies of Iraq; she was right, too, to urge us to look to the future. On one point, I am sure that we shall all be agreed: if we will the ends, we must will the means, and there must be no stinting of resources to ensure the successful building of a future Iraq. It is easy to generate resources for war; it is sometimes much more difficult to generate resources for winning peace. That must not be the case in Iraq; unfortunately, there are indications that it has been the case in Afghanistan.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I hope my noble friend will agree that it would be perverse not to ensure that the lessons of Iraq inform our future conduct of foreign policy as a whole. I briefly make five points. First, it has become clear that it was unwise and misguided to take action on the scale involved, with all its implications, in the absence of a sufficiently widespread global consensus. The importance of a specific Security Council resolution was not some necessary ritual in a religion of multilateralism; it would have represented the seal on the consensus that should have been built.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>It is of course argued that that consensus was impossible because of the determination of the French to use their veto. However, on reflection, that may be to misinterpret the position of the French. To their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_483"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 483</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

credit, they wanted the UN inspectors to finish the job and report to the Security Council so that the basis for a well-informed debate on what action was required would be there. I have no doubts that inspectors should indeed have been allowed to complete their task. The denigration of the work of Hans Blix and his staff in some quarters of the coalition was deplorable. Fulsome apologies from those responsible would not go amiss.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>My second point is that our experiences have underlined that the international rule of law is indispensable for the future of humanity; any tendency to rough-ride over the international rule of law could bring us perilously close to the abyss of global anarchy. The challenge is to make international institutions more effective, not to desert them in favour of the law of the jungle. We must help our American friends to see that the historic role for them, with their unrivalled power, is to contribute that power in helping to build a viable multilateral system.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Thirdly, simply because the regime of Saddam Hussein was so cruel, tyrannical and cynical, it was and remains essential to demonstrate clear contrasts. To go to war with one set of justifications and then to begin advocating a new set when the first set proves invalid is not the way to establish the indispensability of transparency and integrity.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Fourthly, we have learned that intervention can prove complex and full of pitfalls. For example, there is the difficult issue surrounding the internalising of political responsibility, when, whatever the talk of sovereignty, those outside the country have in effect assumed responsibility for its strategic future. There is also the acute need to think through the range of potential consequences of intervention and prepare for them. In the case of Iraq, a great deal, to say the least, has been left to be desired in that respect.

</p>

<a name="40907-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Fifthly, we take our eye off the battle for hearts and minds at considerable cost. Whatever our minimal formal regrets, our failure convincingly to demonstrate real and continuing concern and compassion for the loss of Iraqi lives is lamentable. Thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children have been killed in the bombing and bombardments; large numbers of Iraqi servicemen, who under the sinister regime had no alternative but to serve, were killed. The inexplicable refusal to register the scale of that loss of life is wrong. It has also provoked alienation, resentment and recruits for the extremists.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>The same is of course true of the treatment of prisoners. Abuse is not simply nauseatingly wrong and unprincipled, but drives people in their desperation to extremism. Along with rash and insensitive brutality in Chechnya and the grotesque realities of Guantanamo Bay, it is a recruiting agent for terrorism. A genuine commitment to hearts and minds demands the highest standards, a consistent determination to protect human rights, and civilised sensitivity at all times, whatever the provocation.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The forthcoming consultative conference will have a vital role, but it must be as inclusive as it is possible to be. Difficult, not just more amenable, participants <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_484"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

must be there. As wide a cross section as possible must be won to the political process. To drive by exclusion any who could potentially be so won into the arms of the irreconcilable rejectionists and wreckers would be unforgivably short-sighted. The conference must be imaginative and sensitive to history and culture. Realities of power within the existing society will have to be faced, not avoided.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>There is no single stereotype for democracy; democracy is not necessarily equivalent to, or inseparably linked with, the free market economy. There are different forms of democracy and accountable government, and both the conference and the power brokers in the wings must be open to that. As we have seen too often in recent years, elections of themselves can prove hollow and even damaging, unless the context for meaningful elections has been generated.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Events in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and in Chechnya, North Ossetia and Ingushetia, are making one reality clear. Peace and stability cannot sustainably be enforced from above, but must be built from sound foundations, upwards. Short cuts, however tempting in pressing circumstances, are fraught with the dangers of counter-productivity.

<a name="40907-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale: </b>   My Lords, the Hutton report, the Butler report and other investigations of the war in Iraq have been prompted by the concerns of ordinary voters and Members of Parliament. Those concerns have raised a number of questions, but I shall deal with only one of them, as eight minutes is not a long time.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Within the limits necessary to protect our intelligence sources and services, were people and Parliament properly and fully informed of the facts as believed or known before Parliament made the decision to support the invasion? The Prime Minister to some extent based his advocacy of the invasion, or the American position, on the intelligence services. He said, on 24 September 2002:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;people will have to take elements of this on the good faith of our intelligence services&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>not of our politicians&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;but this is what they are telling me, the British Prime Minister, and my senior colleagues. The intelligence picture that they paint is one accumulated over the last four years. It is extensive, detailed and authoritative&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 24/9/02; col. 3.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I suspect that, in the uncertain world of intelligence, the Joint Intelligence Committee would not want to be called &quot;authoritative&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The impression surely was that the Government&#039;s public statements would be based on the authoritative advice of the intelligence services. There are a number of statements that raise doubt about that&#151;and I illustrate with an example. The September dossier said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Intelligence indicates that as part of Iraq&#039;s military planning Saddam is willing to use chemical and biological weapons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_485"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 485</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>That is a simple statement. But, at that time, the JIC believed that Saddam would use chemical and biological weapons only if he was threatened by internal revolution or external attack. The draft prepared by the JIC said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;Intelligence indicates that Saddam is prepared to use chemical and biological weapons if he believes his regime is under threat&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40907-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>That caveat was left out of the dossier. The two versions are contradictory rather than complementary. The omission of the last clause could significantly change the reader&#039;s perception.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The dossier told the truth and it did not lie, but it did not tell the whole truth. It is possible to mislead or deceive by failing to tell the whole truth, as is recognised in the oath that we swear in our courts every day. This leads to the Hutton report. At page 320, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;However in the context of the broadcasts in which the &#039;sexing-up&#039; allegation was reported and having regard to the other allegations reported in those broadcasts, I consider that the allegation was unfounded as it would have been understood by those who heard the broadcasts to mean that the dossier had been embellished with intelligence known or believed to be false or unreliable, which was not the case&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>He is saying that the dossier was not embellished; it did not have anything added to it. But the Hutton report apparently failed to consider fully that sexing-up could be achieved by omission as well as by embellishment. Would the noble and learned Lord&#039;s conclusions have been different if he had considered the possibility that just by omitting the fact that the famous 45 minutes related only to battlefield weapons, it may be thought that the document was sexed up? The omission may have been an oversight, even a slightly negligent oversight, but it could have been part of a pattern of omissions, each of which tended to support the case for war. Which was it? It is an issue that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, did not investigate seriously, as his terms of reference in that area were,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;to investigate the accuracy of intelligence on Iraqi WMD up to March 2003, and to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict, and between that intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>That is also in Mandarin. What it says is that the noble Lord was not authorised to investigate the use of intelligence by the Government. He was authorised to question the intelligence and compare it with the outturn.

</p>

<a name="40907-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Sir Humphrey, Jim Hacker or someone had drawn up the terms of reference in a way that stopped any questioning at the political door. In those circumstances, when intelligence output did not accurately reflect the essence of the intelligence input, that was OK, which is where we had misunderstandings. The point is this: suppose the Prime Minister had said, soliloquising, as he and his loyal staff saw the first draft of the September dossier, &quot;Will no one rid me of these wimpish words that may reject a just war on Iraq&quot;; and suppose that his closest No 10 colleagues then called in the JIC chairman and asked him for a statement of the current position; and suppose the chairman said, &quot;The JIC believes that Saddam has only small amounts of chemical and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_486"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

biological weapons, much of them no longer dangerous due to decay, and we also believe that he has a very small number of ballistic missiles of short range, which in the past have been very inaccurate&quot;, that would have been a simple statement. It sounds as if Saddam is not an immediate and serious threat to his region, let alone the whole world. Now edit that statement by removing some words but not adding any, thereby showing no &quot;embellishment&quot;: &quot;The JIC believes that Saddam has chemical and biological weapons, and we also believe that he has ballistic missiles&quot;. The revised sentence is true, but creates a different, almost opposite impression to the original JIC draft. The failure to demand the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is clearly open to abuse.
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Your Lordships may say that that example is absurd; and indeed it is. But is it really different in kind from removing the JIC caveat on Saddam&#039;s chemical and biological weapons, that he would use them only internally or if his regime was threatened?
</p>

<a name="40907-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I hope that the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, will volunteer to complete its excellent report by a small amount of additional investigation. The evidence is easily available to investigate the whole truth of the information provided to MPs and others before the vote on war. That would give a signal for the future that in such matters being economical with the truth is not an acceptable form of conduct.

We all look forward with great anticipation to hearing his future contributions to debate in this House.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>A number of us had the opportunity on 14 July to make some preliminary comments on the Butler report immediately after its publication and the Prime Minister&#039;s Statement. I would nevertheless like to add a few comments today, having now had the opportunity to read the report in full. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Butler and his colleagues for a clear and balanced report. It is no less than I would have expected from many years of working closely with him both in 10 Downing Street and later as respective heads of the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office.

</p>

<a name="40907-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The Butler report was necessarily limited in scope, as was the earlier report by my noble and learned friend Lord Hutton, by its remit to exclude any questions related to political or diplomatic misjudgments or strategic assessments and priorities. I shall similarly avoid today repeating my earlier comments on the conflicting and dishonest reasons given by Washington for invading Iraq when we did, which has led to many <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_487"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 487</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

thousands of deaths among Iraqis and members of the coalition forces, a toll that tragically continues to mount week by week.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Unlike the report by the committee chaired by Lord Franks following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982, the report by my noble friend Lord Butler deliberately devotes no attention to the legal or political&#151;as opposed to the intelligence&#151;case for going to war, beyond noting the view of officials frequently echoed by ministerial statements, that regime change of itself has no basis in international law.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The report does, however, contain some useful and pointed criticism of the machinery and processes of government, at least one of which, on the relative lack of use of established Cabinet Office machinery, echoes a point made by Lord Franks when he criticised the failure of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, to call meetings of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee in the weeks preceding the Argentine invasion. When I asked a related Question in this House on 7 October last year, I was assured by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House that there had been regular Cabinet discussion of Iraq and the Middle East from September 2002 until &quot;after the conflict&quot;&#151;if indeed the conflict can even now be said to be over. The Butler report makes it clear that those discussions in Cabinet were unscripted occasions without the benefit of the papers that had been prepared by officials for discussion in Cabinet Committee. The Prime Minister told Members of the other place that he accepted my noble friend Lord Butler&#039;s report in full, and I hope that, as my noble friend himself said today, he will have paid particular attention to that important procedural point in the conduct of government&#151;on which it would be difficult to find a more experienced exponent than my noble friend Lord Butler of Brockwell. I have commented before on the important point in the Butler report about the relationship between the political and press advisers in No 10 and the intelligence assessment machinery of Whitehall. As a former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, I have been shocked by accounts of discussions of intelligence assessments and of their public relations handling in apparently informal and unrecorded meetings chaired by the then Director of Communications and Strategy in the Prime Minister&#039;s office. I also find it curious that the Butler report states as a matter of fact that the dossier,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;was not intended to make the case for a particular course of action in relation to Iraq&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>a point surely contradicted by Mr Jonathan Powell&#039;s e-mail, in which he complained that the draft was inadequate to support the Government&#039;s case for going to war. If the dossier was not designed to convince us that we should join those in Washington who had long been pressing for military action to remove Saddam Hussein, what on earth was it for?
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I do not intend to waste your Lordships&#039; time by rehearsing yet again the extent to which the decision to go to war in Iraq was based not only on what now <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_488"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 488</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

turns out to be false intelligence, but on the inadequate use of diplomacy and regional and technical expertise. What I deplore is the extent to which the war in Iraq has diverted attention from the wider and more pressing priorities of the Middle East, including the appalling current situation in Israel and Palestine, where the prospect of creating a viable Palestinian state along side a secure Israel appears to be attracting no attention whatsoever in the White House.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I hope that there will be other opportunities before long to debate the problems of the wider Middle East. I ask again at this point: what has become of the road map and the hopes of negotiating a two-stage solution in the next year or two, and what has happened to the assurances that President Bush gave the Prime Minister in Belfast last year that he would put as much effort into trying to solve the Palestinian problem as the Prime Minister had put, was and is still putting, into the problems of Northern Ireland?

<a name="40907-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, for a most thoughtful and persuasive maiden speech.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford, I want to concentrate on one particular aspect of the Butler report: the light that it throws on the legality of the war. In fact, it throws a good deal of light on it. Until then, all we had seen in the way of legal advice to the Government was a one-page summary of the views of the Attorney-General published on 17 March 2003 and supplemented by a somewhat fuller statement from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office published on the same day. Both of those documents are set out in Appendix D to the report.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Thanks to the report, we now know a lot more about the legal advice given to the Government before 17 March. I start with the legal advice given to the Government in March 2002 by officials from an unidentified department, presumably the FCO. That is covered in paragraphs 266 to 269. That advice said that neither regime change nor self-defence was a justification for action. Military action could be justified only if Iraq was in breach of Security Council Resolution 687. The advice was that at least one of three conditions must be satisfied before the Security Council could take the view that Iraq was in fact in breach.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The first condition was proof that Iraq was in breach of its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. The report quotes the paper directly in paragraph 267:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Proof would need to be incontrovertible and of large-scale activity. Current intelligence is insufficiently robust to meet this criterion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The second condition was a refusal by Iraq to re-admit inspectors after a clear ultimatum from the Security Council. The third condition related to a situation in which inspectors were re-admitted to Iraq and found sufficient evidence of weapons of mass destruction activity or were again expelled trying to do so. In the event, none of those conditions was satisfied.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_489"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 489</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Resolution 1441 followed, and the inspectors went back into Iraq in November 2002. They found only one significant breach of the restrictions put on Iraq following the first Gulf War. That was the construction of al-Samoud missiles and the engines for them, with a range somewhat greater than the permitted 150 kilometres. Most of those missiles were destroyed by March 2003. It is not suggested that they in themselves justified the war on Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>We next discover from paragraph 378 of the report that the Attorney-General expressed his views of the legal position in a meeting with three senior members of the Prime Minister&#039;s staff on 28 February 2003 and put his views in writing on 7 March. The Butler committee saw that advice, and in paragraph 379 it summarised the crucial part of it as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;It did, however, require the Prime Minister, in the absence of a further United Nations Security Council resolution, to be satisfied that there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the Security Council and that it was possible to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-co-operation with the requirements of Security Council Resolution 1441, so as to justify the conclusion that Iraq was in further material breach of its obligations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>That was a vital qualification to the Attorney- General&#039;s views. At paragraph 381, the report states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;The Attorney-General decided that it was in the interests of public servants, both civil and military, who would have to carry though any decision to take military action, that a statement should be made in clear and simple terms as to his view of the legal position&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40907-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The Attorney-General&#039;s office then wrote to the Prime Minister&#039;s private secretary asking confirmation that it was unequivocally the Prime Minister&#039;s view that Iraq had committed further material breaches of Resolution 1441. The private secretary replied that it was. That was the wrong question for the Attorney-General to ask. The right question was raised in his advice of 7 March: did that hard evidence exist?
</p>

<a name="40907-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>As a result, the Attorney-General&#039;s published statement of 17 March was too clear and simple. It did not repeat his call for hard evidence of non-compliance and non-co-operation; it simply assumed non-compliance. That assumption was based on intelligence, and in that context I believe that paragraph 362 of the Butler report is of critical importance:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;we are surprised that neither policy-makers nor the intelligence community, as the generally negative results of UNMOVIC inspections became increasingly apparent, conducted a formal re-evaluation of the quality of the intelligence and hence of the assessments made on it. We have noted in departmental papers expressions of concern about the impact on public and international opinion of the lack of strong evidence of Iraqi violation of its disarmament obligations. But those involved appear to have operated on the presumption that the intelligence was right, and that it was because of the combination of Iraqi concealment and deception activities and perceived UNMOVIC weaknesses that such evidence was not found&quot;.</p>

forced to the conclusion that the evidence of serious breaches of Resolution 687 and 1441 was at best equivocal. That would have been insufficient to justify the war. Why, therefore, did not the Government do what the Butler report says that they should have done? I believe that the Government&#151;I borrow a phrase from the Hutton report&#151;may have been subconsciously influenced by the fact that a change of view would have been extremely embarrassing for them. By March 2003, logistics had taken over from legality. It is plain that the American Government were unwilling to leave their troops sweltering in Kuwait through the summer while the inspectors were given the time that they needed to come to a final conclusion. If the Government had backed out in March, they would have lost all influence with the Americans, who would have gone it alone, while a last-minute conversion by the United Kingdom would not have restored our credit with France and Germany and the other advocates of delay. Politically, we would have been left with the worst of both worlds, and the Government would have had a great deal of egg on their face.

</p>

<a name="40907-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The Butler report does not expressly draw those conclusions from its own findings in paragraph 362, but I believe that those conclusions are inescapable and devastating. Had the Government done what they should have done in reviewing the validity of the intelligence, the Attorney-General would, in all probability, not have been able to advise that the invasion of Iraq was legal, and we would not have gone to war.

Neither of the two noble Lords who previously congratulated him commented on the fact that he has been 15 years in this House without making his maiden speech. It was certainly worth waiting for. Those in my party who know the noble Lord know very well his great skill and his forensic abilities that he demonstrated to the full in his speech.

resist the conclusion that No. 10 was desperate to grasp at any evidence to support a decision that it desperately wanted to make. Like other noble Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Butler, for his excellent report. Thanks to him we know that the JIC lamented the fact that the intelligence was sporadic and patchy. His report was struck by the thinness of the intelligence. Thanks to him we know that the policy shift from containment to the more aggressive stance was,

<a name="40907-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Since the time when I supported the war I have reread the Prime Minister&#039;s speeches and the intelligence dossier. The intelligence dossier in particular makes ironic reading, not least the chapter entitled,

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The Prime Minister&#039;s speeches for war lent almost exclusively on the threat posed by WMD and, indeed, the very Motion on which the House of Commons voted lent extensively on the existence of WMD.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The way that the Prime Minister chose to make his case has had the unintended consequence of making us all less safe and more vulnerable to terrorism. The threat of a catastrophic attack by WMD armed terrorists is certainly real, but the next time the politicians call for military action even more people will refuse to believe them.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Rereading the Government&#039;s dossier on Iraq&#039;s alleged WMD, I was struck by the very precise estimate that the Government made of the number of people who were killed by Saddam Hussein through the use of mustard gas in the Iran/Iraq war&#151;20,000. The precision of that estimate, of course, stands in complete contrast to the Government&#039;s coyness and refusal in response to repeated questions to make any estimate of the number of Iraqis who have been killed in this war&#151;a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady   Williams of Crosby, and also by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. I find it very difficult to reconcile the willingness to estimate Saddam Hussein&#039;s actions in killing people and our inability to estimate how many people we killed in a war in which we participated and in which we fired the ammunition and in which we know how much ammunition we fired.

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>To watch last week the Republican Convention in New York was to watch a gathering in denial that seems to have turned this war into a fantasy. We know that the two governments were wrong and out of touch with reality before the war. The question is: are they any more in touch with reality now? The two governments continually assert that the people of Iraq are much better off. Many are but some might question that, particularly the families of the 15,000 to 20,000 dead civilians and military personnel. So, too, might the Christians who have lived peacefully for years in Iraq and now find their churches bombed and fired. Some people in Fallujah might disagree. This was formerly a Sunni city, a near secular city, which today, according to the <i>Washington Times</i>, is a city where Sharia law is now in force, Western haircuts are banned, men are <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="40907-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The invasion of Iraq has been discredited also by the subsequent chaos hugely influenced by Iraqi exiles who have their own agenda. The &quot;American appointed government&quot; control only part of Baghdad; even there its Ministers are car-bombed and assassinated. According to the press, Baquba, Samara, Kut, Mahmoudiya, Fallujah and Ramadi are all outside government authority. In their efforts to retain and regain control the Iraqi Government re-employ some of Saddam&#039;s generals and re-recruit his secret police. Mr Allawi has said that he wants to slash some throats. This has led some Iraqis such as Sheik Mahdi al Sumayda to compare Mr Allawi&#039;s new public safety law with the rules that Saddam used to wield.

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>When the United States transferred sovereignty over Iraq things did not improve. Forty-two Americans died in June, 54 in July, 66 in August. The death toll of Iraqis in Baghdad alone reached 700 in July, the worst month since the invasion ended.

<a name="40907-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Last month&#039;s national political conference in Baghdad was supposed to provide a broader base for the government than Prime Minister Allawi&#039;s narrow exile dominated cabinet. In her opening speech the Minister referred to that and to the wider grouping which met to influence the cabinet. However, her conclusion was not one that was shared, for example, by the <i>Herald Tribune</i> of 23 August, which stated that the whole proceedings were influenced by a familiar cast of characters drawn from the same narrow sources as the first US-appointed Iraqi governing council, and that an opportunity had been lost to draw disaffected Iraqis into peaceful politics.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>The question that the Government should ask themselves is why is it that even the Shias of Sadr City&#151;among the people most oppressed by Saddam Hussein&#151;turned against the coalition. This was an area of Baghdad where it was rumoured that Saddam Hussein had dug trenches around the city and filled them full of petrol in order to prevent the inhabitants aiding the Americans. These were the same people who flocked south to fight at Najaf&#151;why?
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The other night I watched on BBC2 an excellent programme, &quot;Randall in Iraq&quot;. It was simply a programme in which ordinary people in Iraq spoke. It was not unsympathetic to America. It included many interviews with ordinary Americans and Iraqis. However, one point was made repeatedly by the Iraqis. The words were more or less always the same: &quot;When someone does something bad&#151;&#039;bad&#039; was the word that they used&#151;the Americans always take it out on a hundred of us&quot;. And so it was in Fallujah where the US military followed similar tactics to the Israelis. It is an approach that is doomed to fail. Each day America creates more terrorists than it is killing.

<a name="40907-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The Prime Minister says that the world is a safer place today, but Iraq has become a magnet for international terrorism. There was no link between Al&#039;Qaeda and Iraq but there is now. We have unleashed forces of religious fanaticism that were <br>&nbsp;<br>

previously contained. We have squandered the sympathy that there was for the United States immediately after 9/11. The Minister says that people will never agree about the war but this is not just an academic question; it is a question that affects Arab opinion right across the world. Not just Arabs, but, increasingly, Muslims have turned intensely hostile towards the United States and the West.

<a name="40907-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>This war has been the worst foreign policy debacle since Suez. No doubt we have to soldier on, as others have suggested, in order to find the least bad answer.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="40907-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, it is, I believe, one of the strengths of this House that we should be debating the significant and, in my view, very well marshalled and judiciously weighted report by the noble Lord, Lord Butler and his colleagues, not in the heat of the moment, or a day or two after its publication when tactical considerations and instant reactions predominate, but rather after a period of careful reflection when the waters have calmed a little and a sense of perspective is easier to achieve. I say this not to criticise the other place, but to make the point that these are complex and tangled matters of considerable importance to our own national security, which should not be addressed only by a quick debating response. In concentrating so single-mindedly on systemic issues rather than on the ever- fascinating topic of the responsibility of individuals and the implications for them, the report surely made the right choice. For it is those systemic weaknesses in the way we gather, analyse and present intelligence, and what the Government do to remedy them, which will have a lasting effect, for better or for worse, on the effectiveness of the intelligence and the intelligence services in safeguarding our security.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>One of the first aspects to which a sense of perspective surely needs to be applied is the extent of the intelligence failure in respect of Iraq&#039;s WMD programmes. That there were failures in the gathering, analysis and public presentation of this intelligence is not in doubt. The report analyses these failures meticulously, and the facts on the ground&#151;or rather, the lack of them&#151;reinforce those judgments. But, to judge from the media hype, this was one of the greatest intelligence failures of the last century. Is that really so? I rather doubt it. Should this rank alongside the failure to spot the Japanese fleet approaching Pearl Harbour, the German divisions marshalling on the Soviet Union&#039;s western border or the invasion of the   Falklands in 1982? I would suspect not. Indeed, the intelligence failure to spot in 1990 how far advanced were Iraq&#039;s WMD programmes&#151;in particular the nuclear programme, which would in all probability have given Iraq nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery by 1993&#151;was of much greater potential risk to us and our allies. What was a mistake, as the report says, was to put more weight than it was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_494"></a>

able to carry on intelligence material which was patchy and hard to verify. But do not let us now swing from one extreme to another, and say that because intelligence may be patchy we should simply ignore it. When we are dealing with ruthless totalitarian regimes, that may be the only timely intelligence we ever get. Do not let us embrace, as if it were a given truth, the idea that a piece of intelligence which cannot immediately be confirmed by a second source is of no value at all.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>It is not only generals, but also diplomats, politicians and journalists who have a slight tendency to focus on the last war and to allow that tendency to distort their view of future threats. Therein lies one of the greatest risks to us from the series of events under scrutiny: that because mistakes were made in this instance, we will undervalue the indications derived from intelligence on future occasions when the use of force has to be contemplated. The report&#151;rightly, in   my view&#151;recommends a complete separation between the gathering and analysis of intelligence on the one hand, and its public presentation on the other, the latter being a matter for the Government, with the intelligence agencies&#039; role being limited to checking the facts which the Government plan to make public. But is there now not a risk that reliance on intelligence at all in such circumstances will be treated as flawed and unsatisfactory? In any case where the use of force by this country does have to be contemplated, there will be, as in this case, honest and deeply-felt differences of opinion. But we should surely try to avoid the kind of group-think whereby reliance on intelligence is simply shouted down.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>One thing is sure. We have not heard the last of threats to international peace and security from the proliferation of WMD, nor of the risks to the whole international community if these weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists. In this context, the report most valuably underlines the pre-emptive role that international inspections can play in countering these threats. The credit here given to the work of UNSCOM, of UNMOVIC and the IAEA is overdue, welcome and merited. International inspection regimes are often denigrated as imperfect and easy to circumvent, an opinion expressed in neo-Conservative circles in Washington&#151;most recently today in an article by Mr John Bolton in the <i>Financial Times</i>&#151;and one which has led the present US Administration, unwisely in my view, to resist the establishment of an intrusive inspection regime for biological weapons.
</p>

<a name="40907-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The sensible response, surely, is to strengthen these inspection regimes in the light of experience, and to make them more effective. In the case of Iraq, the evidence now is that while these regimes were indeed inadequate before Iraq&#039;s invasion of Kuwait, they were a lot more effective thereafter. They were one of the main reasons why, despite Saddam Hussein&#039;s continued determination to acquire such weapons systems in the future, there were in fact no stockpiles of them found after last year&#039;s invasion. The UN Secretary-General&#039;s panel, on which I have the privilege to serve, is focusing seriously on this area of proliferation and will be reporting before the end of <br>&nbsp;<br>

this year. It will then be for the member states to decide how best to strengthen the international defences against the proliferation of all these weapons systems. It will, I hope, be seen to be in our own national interest to play a prominent and constructive role in such effort, and urge the US Administration and others to do so too. We cannot possibly afford to shrug our shoulders, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford did, and say Iran will get its nuclear weapons.

<a name="40907-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Time does not permit me to say a great deal about the current situation in and around Iraq. I will mention only one point, relating to regional security. For far too long, the Gulf has been an area of instability. Each of the three principal regional players&#151;Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq&#151;have faced off against each other. Now there ought to be an opportunity to set off on a new course, to consider how this sub-region can find a basis for co-operation and confidence building, and could gradually reduce the rivalries and mutual threats which have contributed to the feeling of insecurity which has prevailed. After all, Iraq desperately needs the co-operation of its neighbours if it is to find stability. But its neighbours equally desperately need a stable and unthreatening Iraq if the mistakes of the past are not to be repeated. Clearly, too prominent a role by non-regional powers in any attempt to establish sub-regional co-operation is likely to be counter-productive, but it would be helpful to hear from the Minister how she views the prospects in this respect.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>In concluding, I would like to return to the issue of Britain&#039;s intelligence assets and the report by the noble Lord, Lord Butler. We often in this House praise the professionalism and courage of our Armed Forces, and rightly so. They are our main line of defence. But they are not the only guarantors of our security and, in the shadowy struggle against the forces of international terrorism in which we are now engaged, it is already clear that the use of military force will be the exception, and that intelligence-based pre-emptive action through police co-operation on a worldwide basis will be the crucial determinant of success or failure. After all, if you reflect on it, the only case of the use of military force so far in the struggle against terrorism took place after the events of 9/11, and after intelligence-based pre-emptive action had proved wanting. So we depend on the professionalism of our security services.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Having worked alongside the intelligence services for more than 40 years, I believe them to be as good as any in the world. But they will not remain so if we do <br>&nbsp;<br>

not give them our full support and backing&#151;not just in material terms, although that is vital, but also in terms of political and moral support. Mistakes were made on this occasion, and not only by the intelligence services. They must now be remedied. But, as with our Armed Forces, let us be no more stinting of praise when it is due, than we are of criticism.

In passing, I must say that I admire the impeccable <i>sang-froid</i> of Mr O&#039;Brien and the Minister&#039;s private offices. Despite telling them of my plans, asking for travel advice for both Turkey and Iraq in two telephone calls, I was not briefed or rung back. Either they were quite rightly very confident about the region and its security or it is an illustration of just how dispensable opposition politicians are so far as concerns the private offices of Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Your Lordships need little reminder that the Iraqi Kurds helped the coalition forces during the invasion. They are the only people who gave direct military support, and are one of the few instinctively pro-Western Muslim societies.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The political structure of the region was essentially founded in the period after the no-fly zone and safe haven was imposed by the US and UK&#151;John Major must take a great deal of credit for that&#151;after the Kurds of northern Iraq had suffered appalling hardship at the hands of Saddam Hussein on several occasions, particularly at Halabja and during the so-called Anfal campaign, when 4,000 villages were destroyed by Saddam Hussein&#039;s troops.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>In contrast to those terrible times, the future is bright for the region. It is probably the only place in Iraq about which one can say that here and now. With little resource other than border tolls and an inadequate proportion of the UN Oil for Food money, the KRG has done wonders in starting to build a modern infrastructure. They have built a religiously tolerant, secular, pluralistic democratic society. It is notable that many of the Cyhaldean Christians retreating from the bombs in Mosul are taking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan. Women comprise 45 per cent of the undergraduates in the region&#039;s universities. There is a free press.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>It is now by far the most stable and secure part of Iraq. No US or UK soldier has been killed in the region. The transport infrastructure is rapidly improving, with quality roads being constructed. Hawler (Erbil) International Airport is due to open shortly, both for cargo and passengers. Great progress has been made in providing universal education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels in Kurdistan, even in the smallest village, and in adult education.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>There are other building blocks yet to come into place which are important and need to happen, but where the timing is less certain. Agreement will be needed between the PUK, which controls Sulemania province, and the KDP, which controls Dohuk and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_497"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 497</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Erbil provinces, to form a joint administration. Regarding the return of oil-rich Kirkuk province to Iraqi Kurdistan, although not contained in the Transitional Administrative Law, there appears to be an understanding between the KRG and the central interim government on a process for return which should start in the relatively near future with the repatriation of dispossessed Kurds and culminate in a referendum. But the outcome is uncertain and Kirkuk remains unstable&#151;a political battle probably lies ahead.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>There appears to be a commitment from international donors and the interim government for the funding and construction of the Beckhma dam, which will have a major impact on agriculture in the region and generate hydro-electricity for the whole of Iraq. But that is a major project costing some 500 million dollars and it is unclear just how much of the money committed by donors to Iraq has yet been received. Agreement on ownership of oil assets and share of oil revenues is also further down the track but, as Nechirvan Barzani, the Prime Minister of the region, has indicated, that is a matter of negotiation.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>In the meantime, there is a degree of trust between the KRG and individual members of the central government in Baghdad because the deputy Prime Minister and foreign Minister are Kurds and because the Prime Minister, Dr Allawi, is very familiar with Iraqi Kurdistan and has many friends in the region. As an act of faith the KRG has been prepared to forgo revenues that previously they had regarded as being essential for the administration of Kurdistan, namely the border tolls, and assign those to central government on the basis that the central government will in future allocate funds fairly to them.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Another building block not yet in place is the future shape of the legal system after the TAL (the provisional constitutional agreement reached before handover by the Central Provisional Authority) gives way to a new permanent constitution and legal system. The contents of the TAL and its acceptance by the members of the transitional government are, however, highly significant: acceptance of Kurdish as an official language; specific recognition of the Kurdistan regional government and its current functions, particularly over policing and security; and the right of the Kurdistan regional assembly to amend laws, except those falling within the exclusive competence of the federal government.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>However, there is no guarantee that it will apply after the elections due to be held next year. As the Minister said, a new permanent constitution needs to be agreed. One of the stumbling blocks for the US, UK and the CPA has been the failure to understand the nature of the federal way forward for Iraq. In the UK we have what might be called asymmetrical federalism, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the intended English regions having very different powers; likewise, in Canada. There is no neat solution in Iraq but any constitutional settlement there must recognise the political, social and economic contribution that <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40907-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Given so much progress and the co-operation between the KRG and the transitional government, you would have thought that the British Government would be doing their bit to help Iraqi Kurdistan with its development. Yet, as we have heard from the Minister today, they are not even planning to set up a consulate in Erbil. The FCO has, or intends to have, consular facilities in Basra, Baghdad and Kirkuk, all of which are far less secure than Erbil, the administrative centre of Iraqi Kurdistan and its fastest growing city.

In June, UKTI&#151;UK Trade and Investment&#151;sponsored jointly with the Kurdistan Development Corporation a direct investment conference which the KRG Prime Minister, Nechirvan Barzani, attended. Mr O&#039;Brien, the DTI/FCO Minister, welcomed the participants to it. The failure to install a consulate is a complete contradiction of the enlightened approach of UKTI. It amounts to shooting British business in the foot; yet it appears to have been done on cost and security grounds. Is this a case of the FCO, as ever regarding the Kurds and Iraqi Kurdistan, listening to the wrong advice?
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Needless to say, I hope that the Government will adopt a more helpful attitude, try to solve some of the problems now facing Iraqi Kurdistan and help it to develop economically. The consulate is one matter; another is using its influence in the EU to ensure that Turkey improves conditions at the Khabur border point with Iraq. When I crossed in August this year I found that essentially nothing had changed since a piece was written in 2001, which describes the run down towns from Diyarbekir to the Kurdistan border, &quot;shabby and threatening border controls&quot;, and where,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;several check points and controls to be inspected, to have this and that paper stamped and our passports cleared&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>In summary, the piece said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;The strained and Kafkaesque image of the Turkish side of the border control could not have been a greater contrast to the scene that was awaiting me on the Kurdistan side of the Khabur Bridge&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I felt exactly the same sentiments. My return journey was, if anything, worse, with border guards describing my literature about agriculture and education as a &quot;problem&quot;, because it mentioned the words &quot;Iraqi Kurdistan&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>Border traffic is restricted by the Turkish Government to 750 trucks a day. Currently it takes four days for a truck to pass through from the Iraqi side of the border to Turkey. These are not administrative processing problems. The Iraqi Kurdistan side of the border can process 3,000 trucks a day. Currently Turkey, as a threat to Iraqi Kurdistan, is also proposing to build a new border point with Iraq through Turkomen populated territory and to close the existing border. Economic development in the Kurdish areas of south-eastern Turkey is reported by the independent commission on <br>&nbsp;<br>

Turkey to be taking place, but it is certainly not very apparent. It appears that the Turkish military is now resorting once again to clearing Kurdish villages in the name of security, continuing an oppressive policy that has been carried out for the past 15 years.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I have visited Turkey many times in the past 30 years and I admire many of the developments that have taken place there. I respect it as a staunch member of NATO and I am keen to see it as a fully fledged member of the EU. In particular, I hope that the EU summit agrees this December to start negotiations for accession. However, it is vital that the UK and other member states make Turkish entry conditional on a change of approach to both its own Kurdish people and the Kurds of Iraqi Kurdistan. There are enlightened voices in the Turkish Government and they must be given every encouragement to accord full human rights, a free press, autonomy and economic development to their Kurdish population in south-eastern Turkey. Turkish companies are playing a major role in Iraq generally, but particularly in Iraqi Kurdistan, so it is greatly in Turkey&#039;s economic interest to recognise the economic potential of the region.
</p>

<a name="40907-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The KRG and the major parties in Iraqi Kurdistan do not have separation from Iraq on their agenda. Kurds elsewhere, particularly in Turkey, are much more interested in economic development than separation. I hope that this Government above all recognise the realities in the way that they treat the region in their policies.

<a name="40907-16_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   My Lords, a cartoon in one of today&#039;s newspapers depicts the supposed evolution of homo sapiens from semi-crawling ancestors on the one hand to a black-hooded terrorist holding a gun against the head of a small child. This debate is inevitably coloured more than slightly by recent tragic events in Beslan, and I shall return to that mal-description of human evolution in a few moments.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Anything worth saying about Iraq seems to have to carry both what might be called a credible particularity as well as some moral depth, as has been clear from all the speeches in the debate, including the distinguished maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I shall briefly address two areas. First, I shall speak about Guantanamo Bay and, secondly, I want to make some observations about the handover of power. I have always been doubtful about our involvement in this war, and I have a profound admiration for members of our Armed Forces of all ranks who had similar doubts, but who went where they were ordered to go&#151;into new darknesses.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>On the issue of Guantanamo Bay, the policy of detaining non-US nationals at Camp Delta constitutes one of the most questionable unilateral actions by the US Government in international law. There are now approximately 585 detainees, although in total, about 700 have been held there at various times, including <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

juveniles as young as 13. Detainees include an Australian and four UK citizens. We all know that five were released earlier this year.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Because the US Government have steadfastly refused to describe them as prisoners of war, they cannot claim rights under the third Geneva convention of 1949. Instead, they are detained under a military order issued by President Bush in November 2001, just over two months after 9/11. In practical terms it means that the same military official, or his or her delegate, is responsible for laying the charges against the detainee, selecting the members of the tribunals that will hear the charges&#151;the official commands authority over them&#151;and potentially making the final decision as to the detainee&#039;s guilt or innocence from which there is no appeal.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>This state of affairs merits the description of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn, as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;a monstrous failure of justice&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>which places detainees,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;beyond the rule of law, beyond the protection of any courts and at the mercy of the victors&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I would go further and suggest that, first, such action infringes detainees&#039; rights to trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, in a speech he made in France in June said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;While we must be flexible and be prepared to countenance some limitation of fundamental rights if properly justified and proportionate, there are certain principles on which there can be no compromise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>Secondly, it infringes detainees&#039; rights to a speedy trial. Thirdly, it violates detainees&#039; rights to a fair trial because they admit evidence obtained through torture&#151;that is a saga in itself. Fourthly, it fails to ensure that the fundamental rights afforded to US citizens are also afforded to non-US detainees.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I shall now make a few observations about the handover of power in Iraq. There have been many occasions in the House when the role of the United Nations has been highlighted as one which could well have delivered more and which needs as much strengthening as possible. The Minister indicated that in her opening remarks, and it has recurred in the debate.

</p>

<a name="40907-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The role of UK forces has been well and favourably reported. It has even been suggested more than once that their softer approach on the ground has helped to build up some degree of trust with local communities in Iraq. But what training have Iraqi troops been given to deal effectively, but in a restrained way with insurgents? Is there a timetable for the final withdrawal of UK troops? There are also some worrying factors that are in danger of clouding public debate and heightening awareness of easily overlooked issues. They include the increasing election climate in the US where involvement in Iraq and elsewhere is in danger of becoming a touchstone for supposed toughness.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>In that respect, I can speak for other religious leaders who are becoming a bit tired of accusations that we do not live in the supposed real world when we say things that some find unpalatable. It is not the first <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_501"></a>

time it has happened, but if any noble Lord would like to shadow my work for a week, he will see an interesting line of human nature in my work which is a great privilege and a joy.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Concerns have been expressed by the BBC World Service about the danger of too much government control of the media in Iraq, and the recent bombings of Assyrian and Chaldean Christian churches that represent communities that have lived in what we now call Iraq&#151;an unnatural 20th century invention&#151;since the dawn of the Christian religion. Those bombings make one ask serious questions about that litmus test for a just, sustainable and participatory society&#151;how it treats its minorities.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>I shall counterbalance that observation by echoing the words of my colleague, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, on historic Islam and ways of local consensus that are democratic in ways that do not necessarily coincide with western secular models.

</p>

<a name="40907-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>All that makes me come back to the cartoon depicting our&#151;supposed&#151;evolution into an unthinkingly violent animal. The history of human conflict is as old as the history of the human race, however and whenever that is defined. There are always debates about that. It tells us a simple but hard truth, which is that the temptation to become a mirror image of one&#039;s attacker can become almost irrestible. But it always has profoundly negative consequences.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I do not think that the Prime Minister lied to us. I share much of what the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said about the Prime Minister&#039;s motives and the Butler report. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Butler, for his speech, and for his observations on Cabinet government, about which I am sure lessons have been learnt. In any organisation when events move fast, it is sometimes very difficult to keep everybody up to speed. None the less, the lessons are there.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>However, I am not a determinist, and I do not think that we are evolving into black-hooded terrorists. Nor do I believe that forgiveness and reconciliation at both local and international levels can be ordered from a department store or the all-night corner shop. In order to know more about those profoundly human qualities, we need to find new ways for the western democracies to engage in dialogue with the Arab world. They are not all members of Al&#039;Qaeda. There is an urgency, too, about the need to rebuild international trust.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>I shall quote from an article in the <i>Times</i> by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury in March of last year, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;So it is not enough to have been critical of the way war with Iraq came about. We need urgently to develop better methods of working together. Too often, the Security Council seems to be incapable of functioning as more than the sorry sum of its frequently disparate parts. Would we be helped, for example, by a standing body, more broadly drawn, and charged with formulating and clarifying options for dealing with such crises? Could we imagine such a group taking in NGOs as well as diplomatic representation, so that issues about humanitarian relief and social reconstruction could be fully factored in to the main discussion?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I believe that those questions still stand.

<a name="40907-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Early this morning in my chapel in Fareham, I happened to be reading with my chaplain some words from the prophet Isaiah&#151;a book that is regarded as sacred by all three Abrahamic faiths. It is quite eerie that this canticle was set for Tuesday. It states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Then I thought of coming here. Those words are part of a description of a world made new, that is not airy-fairy and out of touch with reality, but takes seriously human nature as being capable of both good and evil. I do not think that one could find a better foundation for the long reconstruction of international trust in this debate.

<a name="40907-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Butler, for the singular work he has done on our behalf. It was the fourth inquiry into the veracity and good faith of the Prime Minister. Each of them found our Prime Minister not wanting in those respects and   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and his committee for what I hope we can take as an opportunity to get on and debate the future of Iraq rather than spending quite so much time going over the genesis of the problem.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>In my opinion, it is futile to continue to examine the genesis of the war. It will change none of the fundamentals concerning where we are now and where as a people we need to be. I say that as one who supported the Government and still does. I assume that all of us are now agreed about what we want for a post-war Iraq. We want a free Iraq, run by Iraqis, with the best possible basis for economic progress and the creation of stable democratic institutions.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has recently rendered singular service in publishing Anthony Cordesman&#039;s analysis of the strategic lessons of Iraq entitled <i>The War After the War</i>. I am most impressed by his reading and his argument. He argues that strategic engagement requires objective rather than ideological assessment of the problems which demand action. He goes on to argue that that assessment must include the size and cost of the effort necessary to achieve these decisive strategic goals. Without such a systematic approach, it can be as easy to lose the peace as it was militarily easy to win the initial conflict.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Today, despite many excellent activities&#151;and I commend the role of DfID&#151;it is not yet possible to predict a successful outcome of the combination of, first, the activities of nation-building; secondly, the low-intensity continuing conflict; and, thirdly, the Iraqis&#039; efforts to recreate their nation whose complexity we sometimes overlook. Of its population, 60 per cent are Shia Muslims; 20 per cent are Sunni Muslims; 15 per cent are Kurds; and 5 per cent comprise Turcoman and other groups. It can be further subdivided by tribes, by differing rural and urban lifestyles and by differing religious and secular lifestyles.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_503"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 503</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>It is a country whose complexities have been further exacerbated by serious demographic explosion. In 1980, the Iraqi population was 13.2 million. Today, it is estimated at 25 million and projected to grow by 7 million a decade for at least the next two, taking it to 44 million by 2030. Today, 530,000 people seek to enter the workforce&#151;and there is 50 to 60 per cent unemployment.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Post-conflict security and the whole process of nation-building should have been subjects of clear operational plans, formulated before military action began and subjected to at least as rigorous cost appraisal and risk analysis as the military action. That failure to have a seamless transition from the war to the imperatives of security and nation-building created a power vacuum. That power vacuum left the coalition appearing too often as remaining in conflict with Iraqis; too often as being the enemy; too often as being an unwelcome occupier; and decreasingly as being a force liberating Iraq from tyranny.

</p>

<a name="40907-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>In my opinion, the power vacuum made the creation of the provisional government more difficult. That power vacuum has made it more difficult to address what I consider to be the central needs of Iraq&#151;those relating to economic reconstruction. Few governments in the region have over the decades less experience of either a free market or of participating in global competition. Belatedly I believe that we need a grand strategy for security and nation-building and that we must look then to the economy on which Iraq&#039;s future will rest.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I want to mention four aspects of that economy. The first is investment. Iraq has no recognisable banking system. Industrial employment was largely in some 250 state monopolies and the military ones have been destroyed. The remainder offer no basis of industrial competitiveness and are unable to compete in any foreseeable way either as exports or with imports.

</p>

<a name="40907-16_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The second area for economic reconstruction is the country&#039;s infrastructure, especially the utilities which have been systematically neglected for more than 20   years. Saddam Hussein favoured obscene consumption by his regime at the expense of his people&#039;s need.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The third area for economic reconstruction is the agricultural sector. Historically, it has been run on the basis of a hopeless combination of state planning and subsidies. The results have been and remain appalling. Poor productivity and poor quality have left Iraq importing 60 per cent of its food needs and an agricultural population with no experience whatever of how to finance its farming or how to market its crops.
</p>

<a name="40907-16_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The fourth area is oil, where the situation is dramatically bad. Today, oil is the only meaningful export earner. The United States Department of Energy estimates that in constant year-2000 dollar prices, the value of oil exports has fallen from 58   billion US dollars in 1980 to 12.3 billion in 2002; probably falling to between 9 billion to 12 billion in 2003, and possibly rising to 15 billion in 2004 and 19   billion in 2005.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_504"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-16_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Those figures indicate the value of Iraq&#039;s oil exports to be about a quarter of the real-terms figure in 1980. Anthony Cordesman estimates that even with an expansion of oil exports to 6 million barrels a day,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;it is unlikely that real per capita oil income during the next decade can be more than half what it was in 1980 in constant dollars&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40907-16_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>Against that background, I conclude with the expression of hope that soon we will be able to see a grand strategy; one which does not deal individually with jigsaw-puzzle pieces of Iraq, but deals with that country holistically. It must deal with the stabilisation operations and security; the nation-building operations; the creation of democratic self-government; and with a coherent programme of the various aids necessary for the reconstruction of the economy in the areas of investment, infrastructure, agriculture and oil. Then, I will begin to be confident that we can win the peace as well as we won the war.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40907-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   My Lords, we have listened to a most impressively knowledgeable speech which I for one look forward to reading.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has resumed his place because he said that those who had cheered on the Attorney-General when we last debated the legality of the war were singularly absent from today&#039;s list of speakers. I diffidently draw his attention to the fact that I supported the Attorney-General then and continue to do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>I may not have cheered him on, but I said that there was more than one view that it was possible to take conscientiously on the legitimacy of going to war. I said that the better view was that of the Attorney&#039;s and that if it were not the better view it certainly ought to be. I hold to those views today and without repeating the arguments I want to explain why, notwithstanding the absence of any finding of weapons of mass destruction so far, the legality of the fundamental basis of the case for the Government&#039;s invasion of Iraq remains sound.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>First, I want to draw attention, as a number of noble Lords already have done, to the lamentable consequences of the way in which the dossier of September 2002 was compiled and the tendentious, not to say disingenuous, manner in which it was subsequently made use of&#151;unfortunately by the Prime Minister among others. There are three aspects of the damage that has been done which we do well to recall.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>The first has been that it has managed to make the credibility of the Government a casualty of the Iraq war, almost, some might think, a fatal casualty. That is of enormous importance because the Government need every ounce of credibility they can muster to carry the country and the international community with them through the difficult decisions that have to be taken from now on.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>Much has been achieved. We are in danger in this country of neglecting sometimes the success of our actions. I am happy to acknowledge those parts of the Minister&#039;s speech that drew attention to them. But <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_505"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 505</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

credibility has been gravely damaged. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said a few minutes ago that it will be very difficult to justify and to carry the country&#039;s support for any use of military force said to be based upon intelligence. That point carries a great deal of wisdom.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Secondly, it is a sorry thing for the Armed Forces&#151;who trusted in the reliability of the case that the Government put forward for going to war, and went on, as we have all acknowledged, to carry out with great bravery and indeed brilliance a dangerous task which the Government imposed upon them&#151;that the legality of the whole thing has been seriously called in question in terms of reliance upon the way in which the dossier was drawn up and subsequently made use of.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Perhaps, above all, that has contributed more than any other factor bar one to assertions&#151;mistaken as I believe they are&#151;that the whole case for going to war was dodgy, and that the legality of this enormously important decision by the Government was shaky to say the least. That other factor is the failure so far to find weapons of mass destruction. I emphasise those words &quot;so far&quot; because of a passage in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler&#151;a report to which I like everybody else pay most respectful tribute&#151;which I think has not been mentioned. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;We believe it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of Iraqi possession of stocks of biological and chemical agents, or even of banned missiles, does not exist or will never be found.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>We would do well to remember those words.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I want to focus in the minute or two remaining on the absence so far of weapons of mass destruction because it is now said that that emasculates the whole basis of the legal case for going to war. But it does not. The lawfulness of the actions, whether taken by individuals or by governments, surely has to be assessed in the light of the information available at the time those actions were taken and in the light of the perceptions and deductions that reasonably could have been held, and of fears that reasonably could have been entertained, which those actions were intended to avert. Surely that is ordinary common sense.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Governments, like individuals or bishops, have to operate in the real world. It has become an increasingly unpleasant and terribly dangerous world by reason of the actions of a proportion of mankind. That point has been laboured today. There is no need to go into it more than to say that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, referred to it as the calculus of the threat of terrorism having changed. We all know that it is because of the arrival on the scene of people who do not care a bit about how many they kill. Or rather, they do care, because they desire mass murders and mass destruction. They do not mind if they get blown up at the same time; indeed, in some circumstances they desire it.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>That has changed the whole calculus and made it vastly more difficult for governments who, on behalf of their countrymen, have to take a line of maximum protection, and which if they happen to be permanent members of the Security Council with military means <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_506"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 506</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have to secure the enforcement of Security Council resolutions. They have to exercise their judgment in that capacity as well. Everybody realises how dangerous the world now is. I found nothing in the report to lead me to reverse the view I have held from the beginning that the Government acted lawfully&#151;as of course they always must.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>My last point is that we now know what was actually going on quite irrespective of weapons of mass destruction. We found it in the conclusions set out at paragraph 397 of the report. For shorthand purposes and time I will read just three. The Iraqi Government:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;Had the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes . . . </p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;In support of that goal, was carrying out illicit research and development, and procurement, activities.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;Was developing ballistic missiles with a range longer than permitted under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>To have neglected those circumstances would have been criminal and they fully justify the unequivocal view expressed by the Prime Minister that there was ongoing material and serious breach by Iraq of its obligations under 1441.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>I believe that the war was necessary, alas. I am certain that it was legal. It could not have been necessary if it was not legal. It could not have been legal if it was not necessary. The pity of it is that the case, genuinely and conscientiously argued by those who take a different view, has been so unnecessarily strengthened by the way in which the dossier and related matters were handled.

<a name="40907-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, there can be few considering the circumstances surrounding this debate, coming as it does after a weekend of unparalleled, unlawful violence in Russia, who would question the belief that the lawless use of force between and within the member nations of the United Nations is one of the great challenges of our time. It is therefore not a matter about which one needs to apologise if one focuses, as so many have done during the debate in this House, upon the issues of the legality of the war in Iraq. I was grateful to the Minister for her kind words, when opening the debate, that it was all right to look back. Indeed, we needed to look back. Certainly, as she put it, we must learn the lessons. She is in a better position than most of us in this House to chart what is happening on the ground in Iraq. We must pay due deference to her reading of what is happening there. I will return to that point.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>For me, the Iraq war is, as the noble Lord, Lord   Lamont of Lerwick, put it, the greatest diplomatic defeat of this country since the 1956 Suez adventure. In many ways, it is a worse defeat than that. To some extent, that situation was recoverable by the intervention of our long-standing friends in the United States. On this occasion, the boot is very much on the other foot.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The terms of reference for the inquiry by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, were regrettably narrow. We are grateful to the noble Lord for interpreting them <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_507"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 507</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

creatively to allow him to look at some of the issues that were so vexing the public, not least the issue of the Government&#039;s purported legal justification for the military invasion.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Perhaps it is a little difficult to dig out what that committee had to say on the subject, but, none the less, it is clear. In paragraph 429 of the Butler report, it is clear that as early as March 2002 British Government officials had advised not only that regime change of itself had no basis in international law but that any offensive military action against Iraq could be justified in Iraq only if Iraq were held to be in breach of its disarmament obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 or some new resolution. Proof of that breach would need to be &quot;incontrovertible&quot; and of &quot;large scale activity&quot;. At that time, the intelligence available was insufficiently robust to meet such criteria.

</p>

<a name="40907-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>It is a matter of some satisfaction that the committee also recorded its surprise that policy makers and the intelligence community did not, as the generally negative results of the UNMOVIC inspection became increasingly apparent, re-evaluate in early 2003 the quality of the intelligence. In the absence of that re-evaluation, it is plain that the Prime Minister took it on himself to determine the necessity of the action.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>In his interesting intervention, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, spoke of the systems of government that allowed advice to be forthcoming when required. It is plain that on this occasion, in the critical three months prior to the war, not only was such advice not sought, it was not proffered. Nor was there any updating action to enable the British Government to claim in the United Nations or anywhere else that the situation merited the response proposed.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>It would be wrong to focus entirely on that point. The Iraq war has brought death in uncounted thousands. It is fairly clear that it has sustained and extended support for terrorism in the Middle East&#151;even in Iraq itself&#151;such that it has become, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, who opened the debate from the Opposition Benches, the monstrous norm. It is also clear that this war has diverted the international community from addressing the central danger in the Middle East&#151;the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It makes any aspiration to impose, by force or any other means, democracy on another country in that part of the world a vain aspiration.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The greatest sadness and the greatest need in this debate is the requirement that we should recognise how the international legal order has been undermined by that action. Article 39 of the United Nations charter spells out that the Security Council should determine,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make any recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>It is spurious to claim that articles decided in the context of the Kuwaiti liberation had any direct bearing on the circumstances that led to the invasion in March 2003.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_508"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 508</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-17_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The requirement now is for the international community to recognise that this system of peaceful resolution of disputes has been challenged by some of the greatest powers among its members. That the law is not universally accepted or universally regarded as acceptable is clear. The Prime Minister was not wrong in his Sedgefield speech to businessmen on 5 March to point out the need for a general debate on the updating of international law to make it capable of dealing with the new threats. But it is not acceptable that he should have taken the law into his own hands with an attempt to describe as legal what was essentially a political justification.

</p>

<a name="40907-17_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>Political justifications may be acknowledged and understood but they cannot be accepted, as was made entirely clear by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua case in 1986. It is time that that task was taken on by the international community. No doubt a first step has been taken by the Secretary-General in establishing his high-level panel of which the noble Lord, Lord   Hannay of Chiswick, is a most distinguished member. But it will require more than that no doubt highly political report. It will require a longer period of persuasion to bring to a conclusion the procedural steps that are required to take away from the nation state the capacity in law to inflict such mayhem as we have seen.
</p>

<a name="40907-17_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>In such crises, the ultimate question is whether the use of force may be justified beyond the cases provided for in the charter&#151;I am thinking of humanitarian cases and drug trafficking&#151;which threaten lives and livelihoods. The question is: who is to make the determination that such action is necessary? That cannot be simply a decision for those with the greatest power to impose themselves on others. We had hoped that that system would have been put to bed by the UN charter, but it needs updating.

<a name="40907-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Inge: </b>   My Lords, given my involvement with the Butler review I had reservations, as did my chairman, about taking part in this debate. However, I should say at the start how much I enjoyed working under his chairmanship, a view that I know is shared by all the other members of that committee. I should also like to say that I strongly support his comments, not least those he made about Mr Scarlett. Mr Scarlett has been through a difficult time, but I am sure that he will have learnt from this testing experience about the way he has to lead what I believe is a remarkable Secret   Intelligence Service. I strongly endorse the remarks made about the service by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. I also believe that Mr Scarlett will get right his relationship with policy and decision makers. He has to work with them, but not be part of their club.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I would like to make one or two personal comments about the Butler review. The chapter in the report that deals with the nature and limitations of intelligence is a seminal piece of work which should be studied by every policy maker and decision maker dealing with intelligence material. This is particularly relevant given the current security situation we face from the threat of international terrorism. That threat poses the intelligence services of the free world with a huge <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_509"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 509</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

challenge. We are not dealing with a nation state, but fighting an organisation that is diffuse and scattered, and wishes to cause mass casualties among innocent people. It is not afraid to use weapons of mass destruction. I am not convinced that the threat is fully understood or recognised, and what a challenge it poses. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, I think that it would be a disaster if, because of some of the things that went wrong over Iraq, we become reluctant in the future to use military and other force where necessary.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>The final point I want to make about the Butler review is not directly related to the committee. However, during my work on the committee I began to recognise starkly the huge responsibility put on our policy and decision makers when a nation looks as though it is going to go to war. I asked myself what were the qualities they needed if they were to look after the interests of the nation. I came to what your Lordships will probably consider to be a rather simplistic conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The two qualities I felt were most important were, first, that of judgment. I sense you can have judgment only if you have knowledge, which I believe includes a sense of history and an understanding of what it means if you commit your nation&#039;s armed forces to military conflict. The nature and limitations of intelligence have to be understood.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The second quality that I felt was fundamental was that of moral courage. Only then will a policy maker or adviser, even if he has the knowledge, have the courage to challenge or perhaps support a decision&#151;which is a very difficult decision&#151;at the highest level.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>That is enough about Butler. I shall turn to Iraq in a moment, but first I want to mention post-conflict planning, where there is a major lesson for the future. A part of my military education was that, prior to conflict, a key part of the political and military planning process was to look at the consequences of the use of military force. While I recognise that it is not an exact science, we must consider what will happen and what it is likely that we will have to deal with after conflict has finished. It is clear that in this case that that proper planning process did not take place, or if it did, it was ignored. Equally importantly, it was not adequately resourced in terms of money, people and capabilities. That was a serious planning failure which must be a lesson for the future.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Whether or not one supported the war, noble Lords have already pointed out that the key issue is now to recognise that we are in for the long haul. If we were tempted to walk away, that would be disastrous and have serious and major implications for the security of the whole region. It would send a terrible message to the people of Iraq and give great encouragement to terrorists in that country and beyond. We are in for the long haul, and it will be a time that requires great wisdom and courage. In all this, I should also point to the important role that the media have to play. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to what our Armed Forces have achieved.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I turn to Iraq today. The Minister gave us a measured and balanced view of the situation in Iraq at the moment, but I have to say that I remain deeply <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_510"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerned about the security situation&#151;not only because of the threat posed by terrorists, but also because of the limits of the influence of the interim government. It will be a long time before a government in Iraq have any major impact on the country as a whole. Moreover, the capabilities of Iraqi security forces in the form of its police and armed forces are extremely limited. Not only are they badly trained&#151;it takes years to develop effective security forces&#151;but I am also concerned about the effect of the ballooning in the number of private security organisations now operating in Iraq. That cannot be right when seeking to co-ordinate a proper security situation.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I remain gloomy, but we must remember that we are talking not only about Iraq, but also about Iran, the Palestine/Israel problem and the Gulf as a whole. What happens in Iraq will be watched closely by the people of the region.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40907-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Watson of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, Monday&#039;s news of seven United States Marines killed by a car bomb near Fallujah brings to just under 1,000&#151;in fact, 993&#151;the number of American soldiers killed since the war in Iraq began. Over the past two weeks, 500 people have been killed by terrorist actions in Russia. At least 338 people lost their lives in perfectly appalling circumstances in Beslan. The casualty lists in the war on terrorism are lengthening: soldiers, civilians, children, the old and infirm, and the young and strong. There is no sign of the carnage ending. There are moments, perhaps, when the imprudent banner displayed on the United States aircraft carrier, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, and voiced on that occasion by President Bush&#151;namely, &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;&#151;may seem justified, but only as a respite and not, sadly, as a conclusion.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Nothing&#151;no explanation and no cause&#151;can diminish the crimes of those who have slaughtered so cruelly in Manhattan, in Bali, on Israel&#039;s buses and in the schoolhouse in Beslan. Nothing justifies those crimes. But if the mission of ending terror is ever to be accomplished, political processes are vital and must be resolutely pursued. To defeat terrorism, its roots have to be understood, its motivations comprehended and   its causes addressed. We have urgently, as an international community, to seek out and dry up the springs of horror. President Bush sees America&#039;s role in Iraq and in the wider war as &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. But what point is there in draining the swamp if it instantly refills? To eradicate what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to earlier as &quot;hyper-terrorism&quot;, we must seek to do more than counter it; no matter how hard or impossible it may seem, we must seek to cure it. How to do this is surely the most difficult challenge we face.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Military action is necessary but clearly not enough. As my noble friend Lady Williams said from these Benches today, it is a fact that one result of the allied invasion of Iraq is that Iraq itself has become a battleground for Al&#039;Qaeda. That was not what was intended, of course, but it is one result.

</p>

<a name="40907-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Two American voices in that country&#039;s increasingly anguished debate this summer about Iraq struck me by their candour. A few weeks ago, George Packer wrote in the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;The Iraq War, from its inception in Washington think tanks to its botched execution on the ground has always been a war of ideas . . .  By now facts have reduced most of these to rubble, notably the argument that this was a war of urgent national security. Only two serious and competing versions of the war&#039;s meaning are left standing&#151;one, that it is a war against tyranny and for democracy; the other, that it is a war of American domination&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The other voice that I wish to quote speaks directly to that second point. Earlier this summer, Senator Joseph Biden said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;The President must forge with the United Nations, with Europe, with our friends in the Arab world, with Iraq&#039;s political leaders . . .  a common plan for Iraq . . .  there are people around the President who will tell him to reject this . . .  that reaching out will make him look weak . . .  an admission of failure . . .  the hour for hubris and arrogance is long past. It&#039;s time for leadership.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, said in this debate that there are few more important things on the international community&#039;s agenda than to make a success of the transition to democracy in Iraq. He is absolutely right to say this. And to make a success of this, the international community must be involved&#151;militarily, yes&#151;but also in addressing where we can the very springs of terror.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>It is for this reason that the effective abandonment of the Middle East road map is so dangerous. Some may argue that it is simply postponed by the US election, but that is almost certainly wishful thinking.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Here the Prime Minister is the pivotal figure&#151;and his and this country&#039;s credibility is at issue. The Prime Minster has sought from the start in his relationship with the United States Administration to trade loyalty for influence. To that end he has taken great risks with our standing in Europe. To that end he has discarded the advice of wise friends of this country such as Nelson Mandela of South Africa. To that end he bent all his persuasive skills to take Parliament and the country with him over the nature and, absolutely critically, the timing of the Iraq war.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>For such loyalty what does he have to show? He must surely now demonstrate real influence in persuading the Americans to do two things: firstly, as Senator Biden has advocated, to reach out to the international community&#151;including the transatlantic community and Europe&#151;to build a much wider and deeper involvement in, and commitment to, the challenge of nation-building in Iraq; and, secondly, to use America&#039;s power and influence with Israel to reinvigorate the Middle East road map for peace.
</p>

<a name="40907-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>In another context the Prime Minister coined a memorable and influential phrase. He proclaimed the need not only to attack crime but to attack the causes of crime. So too with terrorism. We must attack terrorism in Iraq and beyond, seek to capture its leaders, cauterise its effects and defend ourselves and others. But we must also attack its roots, demotivate it by addressing the causes of hatred and prove its ultimate futility by showing that political solutions can achieve what terror can only destroy.

<a name="40907-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skidelsky: </b>   My Lords, it is not my intention to go over old ground. The war in Iraq was a mistake. The reasons given for it did not stand up at the time and stand up even less well today. Nevertheless, we are there and we have to make the best of it.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>To do so it is important that we face up honestly to the challenges and be clear about what we want to do and the resources that we need to do it. I am glad that the Minister admitted mistakes and did not shirk the difficulties ahead.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>The fact that dominates the situation is the general insecurity of the non-Kurdish parts of Iraq. This security situation is not being adequately reported because journalists stick close to compounds for fear of being kidnapped or murdered. Thus the general impression that the security situation has improved since the handover of power on 28 June is seriously misleading.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>The facts on the ground are that radical Shia militias control most of the cities. Coalition forces have failed to protect public property. Government buildings are routinely seized and their vehicles destroyed. Our forces have failed to protect the Iraqi security forces from violence or intimidation. The main road from Basra to Baghdad is unsafe, with vehicles regularly being hijacked or blown up, with all the consequences of that for the movement of goods. In Nasiriyah, Italian forces rarely leave their barracks and I am told that this is also true of the Poles and Ukrainians: they thought they were being sent as peace-keepers and discover that there is no peace to be kept.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Making up numbers with coalition forces may have been politically necessary, but it creates the illusion that all the coalition forces are available for establishing security when this is palpably not the case.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>British forces have also been withdrawing from security operations. In the last seven weeks they have ceded control of the streets in Basra not to the forces of the new government, but to groups led by the Sadr miltia. A few days ago the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reported that Basra&#039;s civilian administration is holed up in one of Saddam&#039;s palaces under almost daily mortar fire.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>It goes on. The recent bomb explosion in Kirkuk is a symptom of the fact that ethnic tensions are rising in mixed Kurd and Arab cities. With contentious issues of land and representation unresolved, it seems to be only a matter of time before serious violence breaks out there.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The stand-off with the Shia cleric Muqtadr al Sadr in Najaf, brokered by the Ayatollah Sistani, can be deemed a success, but temporary peace was only attained with enormous concessions and after great loss of life. Sadr, who has demanded the expulsion of all foreign forces, is very far from being a broken force.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The consequences of pervasive insecurity are obvious and they were spelled out by the Minister in her opening remarks. Without security there can be no political or economic reconstruction. What does that mean? At present it is too dangerous to hold provincial elections. Have we got any real assurance that it will be <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 513</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

possible to hold a general election in January to elect the successor to the interim government? Iraq&#039;s civilian administration cannot be set up because of the level of intimidation. And that means that reconstruction money cannot be spent.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>The US Congress has allocated over 18 billion dollars&#151;roughly 750 dollars per person&#151;in additional reconstruction money, but reconstruction projects cannot be started because administrative infrastructure is not in place to develop them.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The oil position is better. Oil production has recovered to about 2 million barrels a day from its low of 1.3 million barrels in 2003. However, Iraq is capable of producing 6 million barrels a day and, under the UN Oil for Food programme of the late 1990s, it averaged about 3 million. So, after 15 months, output is still much lower than it would be in a stable situation. That is the measure of the instability that still exists. Insecurity still dogs the attempt to reconstruct essential services&#151;health, education, electricity, water transport, communications, and so on. Electricity transmission lines have continued to be torn down.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>What we have is, quite simply a crisis of legitimacy. The coalition has failed either to establish its own authority or to allow Iraqi authority to be asserted in an appealing and convincing fashion. Many of our troops feel that they are doing nothing useful and want to get out.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>In appraising what needs to be done, we have to face a number of important questions. First, do we have enough troops in Iraq to secure the minimum level of security needed for the transition period? Are we willing to give our troops the necessary mandate to keep order? It was reported that the Prime Minister wanted to send more troops to Iraq. What stopped that from happening? Apparently, he was convinced of that need.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>This review has to be taken jointly with the Americans, because they are mainly responsible for the security situation in Iraq, where we are very junior partners. I understand that that cannot happen until after the presidential election is over, as no one is prepared to take any major decisions.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Having embarked on this adventure, we must recognise that we cannot restore Iraq on the cheap. If indeed it is true that the majority of Iraqis want to live in freedom and peace&#151;and I have no doubt that they do&#151;then it is our duty to ensure that the security without which nothing solid can be built comes into existence. You cannot go into a country, destroy every structure of its ordered life and then leave before you have put something better, much better, in its place. We have not got there yet. So we have to stay, but we must also think very carefully about what we can do to achieve the fine words that we speak.

<a name="40907-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rea: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Symons knows of my long interest in Iraq, and I am sure that she has warned my noble friend Lord Triesman of this dangerous tendency. It arises initially from concern about the humanitarian plight of children suffering <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_514"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 514</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the disastrous economic effects of the sanctions regime and the possible effects of depleted uranium. My noble friend also knows that I strongly opposed the war. I should be grateful if, in her reply, she could give us, as far as she is able, a brief and up-to-date report on the nutritional and health status of the people of Iraq, with the accent on children, including the current state of Iraq&#039;s public health infrastructure and health facilities.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Clean water, sewage disposal, reliable electricity supplies and adequate nutrition are the basis of public health, as the Minister knows full well. There have been many reports indicating that progress in reinstating this infrastructure has been agonisingly slow.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>In her speech, the Minister gave us a rather more hopeful and upbeat picture than we get from the media of the unnecessary and expensive quagmire that our Prime Minister led us into on the coat tails of President George W Bush and his coterie. Our forces are behaving with much more restraint than the Americans, and making better relations with Iraqis because of this and because of some of the rebuilding activities that my noble friend described. However, it is perfectly clear that, even in the British zone, the coalition forces are resented and opposed. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, has pointed out, there has recently been a flare-up of resistance in Basra.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>In the US zone, the occupying forces are hated more than ours because of their trigger-happy behaviour. The choice of Saddam&#039;s infamous Abu Ghraib prison in which to hold detainees was, in itself, an act of extreme insensitivity, let alone the well publicised conditions under which thousands of often entirely innocent people were held there.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>A long catalogue of mistakes has been made since the end of full hostilities in May, which many noble Lords have pointed out, starting with the decision to disband Iraq&#039;s army and police force instead of retaining and reforming them. Looters were allowed, even encouraged, to ransack government offices and steal or spoil records and equipment, thus destroying the basis of orderly government. Saddam&#039;s Iraq was despotic and corrupt, but it was by no means a failed state.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>It is a truism to say that the US won the war in a brutal but mercifully short campaign but has fairly conspicuously lost the peace. Far from safeguarding Iraq&#039;s oil exports, they are now less than under Saddam, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, has pointed out, contributing to a record rise in world oil prices. There is no evidence that international terrorism has decreased since the war&#151;rather the converse, as the recent tragic events indicate. There is no obvious connection with Iraq, but the whole tenor of militant Islam may well have been given a boost as a result of our activities in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>It was unlikely that there would have been a decrease in terrorism as a result of our attacking Iraq. There was never any evidence of international terrorist acts being organised from within Iraq. In fact, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_515"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 515</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Saddam, with his secular regime, was no friend of Osama bin Laden, who, if he is still alive, could well be applauding Saddam&#039;s downfall.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The war has increased anti-American feelings in the Arab world, which may make it easier for Al&#039;Qaeda to recruit followers. In Iraq, there has been a huge escalation of terrorism and crime, including suicide bombing and hostage-taking, resulting in death and misery for thousands of innocent people, let alone those killed in the war itself. This, tragically, included Sergio Vieira de Mello and 27 other UN staff last year, who were in Iraq with the most excellent motives and, more recently, the 12 innocent Nepali workers. They were all tarnished in the eyes of some militants because of their perceived association with the American-led CPA, now the multinational force. Completely innocent passers-by, who have had nothing to do with co-operating with the Americans, have been killed. The situation has been horrific.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>It is uncertain how many acts of terror in Iraq have been committed by non-Iraqis, from Iran and elsewhere. In fact, it seems that there is a dearth of intelligence about the insurgents in Iraq and a lack of rapport between the appointed IGC and Iraqis on the street. I suppose that this lack of intelligence is not surprising, considering the quality of the intelligence that was misused and even manipulated by the US Administration and, sadly, by our Prime Minister. I am afraid that the report of the noble Lord, Lord   Butler, does not, to my mind, contradict the assertion that this rather imperfect intelligence was used to justify the war.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>It is very hard to believe that they did not know, as Robin Cook and many others did, that Iraq posed no military threat, even if it did have a small number of WMDs, as many of us thought it did. We were extremely surprised to find that there were no WMDs; even Hans Blix was&#151;we have just been listening to him speak in another committee room in the House of Commons. In a sense, it is a failure of intelligence.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Judd and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, that it is hard to believe that no official attempt has been made to estimate the total number of Iraqi casualties, civilian or military, during the full-scale war or afterwards. Can my noble friend explain why that is the case? It is, of course, difficult to gather such information, but in previous conflicts in which we have been involved, an estimate of the number of &quot;enemy&quot; casualties has usually been published as well as our own. Now, the job seems to be left to non-governmental organisations such as Iraq Body Count. It has done a thorough job with its research, but its figures remain unofficial.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>I am not alone in suggesting that there will be no peace in Iraq as long as the multinational force remains visibly present. Even many Iraqis who originally welcomed it now despise it and resent its continued presence. In evidence of that, I cite the remarkably courageous report by Sean Langan on BBC4 on 2 September. He managed to make contact with resistance fighters as well as to interview US <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_516"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 516</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

troops and many ordinary Iraqis. On the strength of that evidence, I feel that, as long as the multinational force remains, Iraqi resistance is likely to continue in some form or other. Iraqis who serve in the police may be regarded as aiding the occupying forces and may also be targeted. In any case, they have difficulty taking part in counter-insurgency operations that involve killing their own countrymen.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Having said all that, I want to end on an optimistic note. I think that sanity will prevail. There are many highly intelligent and able Iraqis of moderate views who wish to see a united Iraq. They are proud of their country and they need a chance to put Iraq&#039;s house in order. The sooner the coalition forces withdraw from the front line and take a back seat, the more likely they are to succeed.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>I consider that the continued presence of foreign troops is provoking violent disorder. It is hindering Iraq&#039;s progress towards independence and economic recovery. The funds that have been allocated for rehabilitation and recovery, which are, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, told us, still largely unspent, will be much more effective if obvious military presence is reduced. Security enforced by Iraqis is more likely to succeed if coalition forces move out of the limelight and, as soon as possible, out of the country altogether. Iraqis should play a much larger role in brokering and settling disputes.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Economic assistance, which is available, should not be necessary for long, although it should be given generously to begin with. Many other noble Lords have discussed this. Iraq is potentially a very wealthy country, fully capable of successfully standing on its own feet. However, the very large international debt, made worse by the absurdly high reparations claimed by Kuwait, must be faced. Some of it should be written off&#151;the United States has suggested that&#151;and the rest effectively rescheduled. We must all hope that wise counsel permits this to happen.
</p>

<a name="40907-19_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>I believe, along with many other speakers, that Iraq&#039;s new Government must be allowed early full independence for which they will need temporary economic assistance. If a foreign military presence continues, the prospect will be for more stormy weather ahead.

<a name="40907-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, if the war in Iraq has proved anything, it has proved that the special contribution that British forces have made, in addition to their high professional competence and courage, has been the human factor and the skills that they have developed in peacemaking, which come of years of working and training together under a strong, self-imposed discipline. However, our defence policy seems to be driven by the need to save money in order to invest in kinetics options and high technology so that we can operate more effectively with the Americans. We should surely play from our strengths and complement their technical war-making, rather than try to match it.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;As the post-conflict stage in Iraq has shown, a great deal more is required to achieve the objectives of an effects-based operation, than advanced military technologies in the hands of numerically small forces . . .  While we note the co-operation between the MoD and the FCO at the policy level&quot;,</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;The UK&#039;s future security challenges, on the scale of effort envisaged, require the retention of the existing scale of forces, plus the benefits of network enabled capability . . .  as further extensive peace support operational experience has demonstrated, the UK may also be called upon to provide presence and for that there is still no substitute for numbers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Finally, the Committee believes that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;Any reduction in the establishment of the Army would be premature&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>Let us not be driven by short-sighted Treasury pressure to reduce the existing platforms in advance of acquiring the new capabilities and demonstrating their effectiveness. In the case of the Navy, for instance, are we giving enough weight to the importance so clearly demonstrated in Iraq of sea-based operations independent of host nation support? The asymmetric threat, unlike our long-standing Sovbloc experience, calls for an ability to respond quickly to the unexpected. Who would have thought that such brilliant success as our Armed Forces have had in Iraq and Afghanistan, would lead to cuts, not funding?
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>We have to recognise the importance of training and what has been called the moral component of fighting power derived from the ethos and cohesion of individual units, putting a premium on unit and service identity. How does that square with the proposed service cuts? Treasury policy under the new resource accounting and budgeting requires the MoD to pay a charge on the assets it holds. That, and political pressure, led to the need to secure equipment at short notice for Operation TELIC because it was not on the shelf, and that highlighted our reliance on other nations for our sources of supply. That risk should not be taken again.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The FCO too&#151;another vital player in Iraq and Afghanistan&#151;is being effectively severely cut. How can a geographical department function as it should if half the<i> </i>desk officers are abolished and there is no money to visit posts? DfID, which is generously funded, is worthy, but DfID workers abroad, often outnumbering by far the embassy staff, by the nature of their work do not meet and form long-term friendships with persons of power, as good diplomats, and indeed members of the intelligence service, do. As countries in Africa and the Far East become ever more vulnerable to the operation of terrorists, whether domestic or with an international agenda, so it becomes more necessary for our representatives to be in place to learn to understand them and to be understood. Far too much of the FCO&#039;s budget is going into strengthening embassy buildings against terror attacks at the expense of funding the people who <br>&nbsp;<br>

should be in them and who are so vital to our understanding of other cultures. You must live in a country to know it. E-mails will not do the job.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The excellent Butler report, in discussing the machinery of government, has identified a serious threat to the principles of accountability to Parliament and the people through Ministers, and of collective decision-making in the Cabinet. Under the present regime at No. 10, the role of Ministers and their ability to hold the Prime Minister and the intelligence services accountable have all profoundly changed. Since the Secretary to the Cabinet, who attends Cabinet meetings, transferred his intelligence function to the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, who does not, Ministers still receive excellent papers from officials, but they are not brought to Cabinet or discussed in Cabinet committees. Instead there are, we are told, frequent unscripted occasions when the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Defence Secretaries brief the Cabinet orally. Ministers will not be prepared. The Secretary to the Cabinet cannot, as he would have done in the past, add anything to the discussion and the man who could is not present.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>Add to this the practice of taking decisions in No 10 on major issues on the basis of informal discussions that are not recorded&#151;the Hutton report brought out a flood of e-mails but no formal minutes&#151;and it is difficult to see how Ministers can discharge their duty and their right to take responsibility on the vital matter of war and peace. The Butler report&#039;s measured reference to the informality and circumscribed character of the Government&#039;s procedures is deeply disturbing.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Later in the report, under &quot;Lessons for the Future&quot;, we are warned that the dossier has set a precedent for openness and that there will be demands for Government to put intelligence into the public domain in arguing the case for a particular course of action. I share the reservations and anxieties of the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>To do what is being proposed will be fatal to intelligence recruitment and operations, since what our friends learn from this open approach our enemies will also learn. Potential sources in a most dangerous environment will simply not take the risks and we shall lose the HUMINT, which interprets the enemy&#039;s intentions and vitally complements the product of GCHQ, satellite imagery and other sources.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>It was a mistake to identify relevant intelligence in the dossier instead of allowing JIC reports, as in the past, to form part of the private decision-making process under which the JIC would have contributed to Ministers&#039; thinking and assessment along with policy consideration and much overt knowledge.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Incidentally, the JIC was careful to make it clear that although there were contacts between the Iraqi regime and Al&#039;Qaeda, there was no evidence of co-operation. We must protect the JIC from being made, as the report says, into a tool of government. The ISC works well, and that is enough.

</p>

<a name="40907-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>I have read much of the voluminous 9/11 report by the commission in the US. The problem was, is and will be, on the one hand, a flood of detail from NSA, GCHQ, the FBI, the CIA, liaison services, the Immigration Service and so forth; and, on the other hand, a lack in the CIA of enough competent linguists and specialists with the field experience to make assessments. The SIS too has had such problems. In the past few years there have been lean times which led to severe reduction after the first Afghan war in, for instance, experienced operational cadres who were Arabic and, it seems, some dangerous cost-cutting on the validation side.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>It takes time to transfer field resources, already limited, from one target to another, particularly when the requirement is both for first-hand operational experience of the cultural and geographical area and for some highly technical knowledge of new targets. On both fronts it seems the service was seriously under-resourced. Even so, it has had some remarkable successes, for which the Butler report gives due credit.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>Today the requirement is not only to produce intelligence on the undeclared and secret intentions of coherent governments but also to cover an amorphous inchoate octopus: a network of individuals; a shifting target very difficult to penetrate. It is one thing to have a mass of detail from technical and other sources which takes precious time, in a fast-moving scene, to interpret. It is quite another to get inside the mind of a terrorist with whom, unlike a potential Soviet defector or agent in place, there is no common cultural or political ground and no incentive for the target to make any relationship outside a closed circle.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>As recent tragic events have shown, these people are not inhibited by any fear of causing international outrage, nor very often by the wish for any quid pro quo. As the Butler report says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;The targets which the UK intelligence community needs to study most carefully today are those that structurally and culturally look least like the Government and society it serves&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>However, we also need to relate to those governments that share our interest in having forewarning of the threats posed.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>This is a dangerous world, not least because Russia, for instance, despite significant investment by the UK, the EU and the US, still has nearly 40 tonnes of chemical weapons, has not started the destruction and wants the destruction deadline advanced to 2012. Russian bureaucratic delays are preventing action, already funded, on plutonium disposition, and we can be sure that weapons and knowledge are being sold and that Russia has neither the will nor the effective security resources to prevent this.
</p>

<a name="40907-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>I hope with all my heart that my former service will be left to get on with the job it can do so well if it is properly resourced and that John Scarlett, an officer with a distinguished record of high professionalism and courage, will be supported in the excellent job of which he is capable.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40907-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   My Lords, as the Butler report points out, this was a war of choice. The intelligence community saw regime change as an option to achieve Iraqi disarmament. It was for the Government to make the choice for war: there was no necessity to do so in the form of an imminent threat to Britain.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>We also know from section 5.4 of the review that the continuation of sanctions was a credible option but was disregarded. The Government sought to align themselves with the United States in the mistaken view that Iraq was part of the more general &quot;war against terrorism&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Looking forward, one of the clearest lessons from Iraq is that sanctions&#151;an option open to the Government at the time&#151;and the related policy of containment were working. The adoption of smart sanctions in 2002 as the method of preventing trade in arms while allowing for civilian trade was the right course in humanitarian terms. It was also the right choice in terms of effectiveness. The policy succeeded, as we know now from our knowledge of Iraqi armaments from the 1990s onwards.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>There is a view voiced by the Government that the use of force in Iraq has resulted in compliance with disarmament by Libya and the exposure of and subsequent apology by Dr AQ Khan in Pakistan. That argument obscures the fact that those countries have their own motivations for changing course. In Libya, we know that the Gaddafi regime, under weight of sanctions for some two decades, eventually moved to accept international norms and gave up its support for terrorism in the late 1990s, not after the invasion of Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>In Pakistan, the country of my origin, the tide was turning against supporting the Taliban and change came about through a military takeover and internal regime change rather than in anticipation of a war in Iraq. Those lessons will become increasingly relevant in the coming period when we seek to resolve the North Korean and Iranian proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>The other unfinished business that the war in Iraq has obscured is the instability of Afghanistan and its link to terrorism. Those of us who supported the war   in Afghanistan expected to see a long-term commitment to the future stability of that country, including a restoration of law and order and the establishment of governance such that it could take its place in the international community. That was the widely held hope of almost all Muslim states and was accepted by the international community as such.

</p>

<a name="40907-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>While the forthcoming elections are to be welcomed, it is fair to say that we have not delivered on our promises to Afghanistan. The country is still ungovernable in large <br>&nbsp;<br>

parts and is actually deteriorating in others; terrorism and violence are still rampant, poverty is endemic, and drug production on the up. As we know from the events leading up to 11 September 2001, failed states represent a failure for the whole of the international community. We need to concentrate our resources on those states if we are to forestall future threats to international peace and security in terms of chapter 7.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>What of stability in Iraq and the wider Middle East? In Iraq, while we can reserve our judgment on the legitimacy or effectiveness of the interim government, what seems clear is that our stated objectives as set out in paragraph 213 of the report are far from met. Whether the territorial integrity of Iraq is guaranteed, is an open question; that was one of the objectives. Whether we succeed in re-establishing Iraq as a stable, functioning democracy, taking its rightful place in the international community in time to avert a wider crisis in the Middle East, is also debatable.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>I seek to widen the discussion because I believe that the impact of the war, combined with our wider war on terrorism, has enormous ramifications for the Muslim world, from which I come. We have a situation in Islamic countries in which the perceived injustices against Islamic nations, from Chechnya to Palestine to Kashmir, resonates in the Muslim public mind as never before. While we expect Muslim countries to be our paid-up partners in this supposed war on terrorism, we also have to accept our share of responsibility in righting the wrongs of history.

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Many on all sides of the Iraq argument accepted the reassurances given by the US and British Governments that the Israeli-Palestinian road map would be delivered. What we have seen from the US, however&#151;and one wonders what happened to our leverage with the US Government&#151;is a retreat from, or at best a silence on, the assurances given on the lead-up to the war that the wider issues of peace in the Middle East would be addressed as a matter of urgency. We were wrong: the road to Jerusalem never lay through Baghdad; the road map has now ended in the road block of the war.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>When politicians declare an international dimension to the war on terrorism, they also have to accept an international role in finding solutions. While everyone in this House is united in offering our deepest sympathies to the people of Beslan, as candid friends we have to say to Mr Putin that he cannot declare that international terrorism is behind atrocities without seeking to allow external mediation of disputes. When there is no scope or political space for moderate political elements or external mediation, and when journalists get fired for their opinions from Moscow to Baghdad, where television stations are closed down, is it any wonder that the Islamic community sees double standards in operation? I say this in some trepidation&#151;at the risk, as the noble Lord, Lord   Owen, implied, of indulging in &quot;moral relativism&quot;. But it is important for us to put these thoughts on the table, as they are deeply felt.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Another assumption underlying our engagement in Iraq is that we are exporting good governance and democracy to the Islamic world. Good governance cannot be imposed by force in today&#039;s world. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_522"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 522</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Democracy and civil society need nurturing, political space and legitimacy. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford said, they need to be seen in an Islamic context&#151;be that of Iraq, Afghanistan or other parts of the Middle East&#151;now more than ever.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Our tool of choice should be soft diplomacy rather than hard force. Aid, trade, training, education and all the linkages that build understanding and trust are undoubtedly long-term options, but prove to be far less costly than hastily planned wars. In the battle for heart and minds both at home and abroad, the Government have squandered a fine reputation in those very areas. Our tradition of soft diplomacy, buttressed by our role as a P5 member of the Security Council, has been cast in doubt at a time when these things matter most.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>We have found ourselves in a discredited war, aspects of which we could not have foreseen. We must now fulfil our obligations to Iraqis by returning to them a country that is better than we found it. We can start that by accepting that we have some way to go in terms of our own democratic processes and mechanisms, as the failures of the past two years have shown.

<a name="40907-21_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich: </b>  My Lords, I, too, have expressed concerns about our decision to go to war in Iraq, and the Government&#039;s determination to see areas of the Middle East in the context of an axis of evil. Events have shown that liberation is not the simple concept that it appears and that occupying armies are rarely good at delivering peace.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Our association with this latest version of the American dream has done nothing for our relations with the Arab states as a whole. It will take years, as the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, implied, to rebuild the trust that I believe the Iraqis, Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians, Egyptians, the Gulf states and many others once placed in our Foreign Office, based on many decades of experience. Our lack of understanding of the region today must be the subject of another debate.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>Today I wish to concentrate on the humanitarian situation and on the oil funds which Iraqis require for reconstruction. No one appears to know what has happened to these funds. Under UNSCR 1483, the Development Fund for Iraq was supposed to receive the proceeds of oil export sales, balances from the Oil for Food programme and frozen Iraqi funds, to be disbursed under the direction of the Coalition Provisional Authority in consultation with the interim administration. These disbursements have now been taken over by the Interim Government of Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has said, serious questions have arisen not only about oil-for-food during the last years of Saddam Hussein, but about accounting procedures during the time of the coalition. KPMG has recently reported to the International Advisory and Monitoring Board that there have been inadequate controls over oil sales and other aspects of the DFI&#039;s operations. Metering <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_523"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 523</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contracts to ensure accountability of oil extraction have been delayed. Oil was bartered, smuggled or illegally exported especially in the months immediately after hostilities. Contracts were awarded on a non-competitive basis. There were inadequate records and accounting procedures.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>At the CPA itself, there was a high turnover of staff, inadequate accounting systems and lack of control over spending allocations. My noble and gallant friend Lord Inge and my noble friend Lord Skidelsky have already spoken of a serious planning failure and a crisis of legitimacy. Now that the IGI has taken over these responsibilities it would be tempting for our Government to step back from their obligations or at least to point to the difficult environment in which the CPA was working. No doubt.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>The oil-for-food operations are already the subject of an independent inquiry under Paul Volcker which will go on for some time. But we were one of the occupying powers in Iraq for 15 months and the KPMG audits were commissioned by the coalition in which we were a senior partner. The Iraqi people have a right to know what happened to those oil funds which disappeared under their noses, not only under Saddam Hussein, but under the new era of so-called democracy and good governance, presided over by the heralds of the new order in the Middle East.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>We are speaking about very large sums of money. Some NGOs have already roughly estimated the sums involved during the time of the coalition. Iraqi Revenue Watch said in June that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;$20.2 billion has been taken in by DFI, mostly through the Oil-for-Food program and proceeds from oil exports. $9 billion has been spent so far in DFI projects with an additional $4.6 billion in commitments not yet paid . . .  By April 30, 2004, the CPA had disbursed a total of $7.9 billion from the Development Fund for Iraq&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>That is taken from the IRW newsletter of June 2004.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>I should declare an interest here as a trustee of Christian Aid which also published a report fuelling suspicions, pointing to the discrepancies in the CPA&#039;s reporting of the DFI&#039;s income and expenditure, suggesting that large sums were open to corruption during the CPA&#039;s administration. Huge contracts were awarded at that time, as we have heard, to US firms and a range of subcontractors. We can only assume that while the bulk of this money went into reconstruction, large sums also went astray and/or were not properly accounted for. It is also clear that these contracts benefited the US at least as much as the Iraqi people. I share very much the concern of the noble Lord, Lord King, about balanced reporting.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>It is therefore legitimate for interested NGOs and parliamentarians to ask what the UK Government, as the junior coalition partner, propose to do now to bring to account those who failed to explain what happened to up to 20 billion US dollars of Iraq&#039;s oil money given that the CPA is a body which no longer exists. What role did the UK Government have, as part of the coalition, in managing those elements of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

finances that have been found lacking, such as the failure to meter oil extraction or keep sufficient records of oil sales?
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>I tabled a Question for Written Answer before the Recess and today I opened my reply from the Lord President, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos. I shall not read it except for one revealing sentence: that no UK personnel or secondees to the CPA served in the controller&#039;s office or were an authorised signatory over the DFI account. That says quite a lot about the influence of Her Majesty&#039;s Government in a war which was ostensibly shared with the United States.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>In my experience of the Third World there is always an excuse for missing funds. During any conflict money disappears, bandits hijack aid vehicles, officials are corrupt and so on. This is true of the poorest countries, and to some extent of every country. But Iraq is not a third-world country: it has had highly trained people, modern technology, well equipped armed forces and an efficient administration in some areas of government for many years. I am afraid that that contrasts with the picture painted by the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, just over an hour ago.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>I expect that the Iraqi end of the Oil for Food programme will come out quite well from the Volcker inquiry. But unfortunately the coalition chose from the start not to work with professional administrators from the previous Ba&#039;athist regime as a matter of principle, and its successor has not yet found enough trusted Iraqi partners to replace them.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I know that our Government value the work of NGOs which are very active at the moment in a difficult situation and I hope that they are taking note of what the NGOs are saying about the need to move beyond infrastructure projects, to address immediate problems of health and job creation more directly, to work more closely with Iraqi civil society and to find new leadership in the ministries at central and local level. Obviously, there are many regional variations and positive stories, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and others.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>However, taking health as one example, experienced NGOs like Premiere Urgence, the International Medical Corps and CARE International are saying that in spite of the benefits of large health-related projects, the health sector itself is being ignored. They point to the general lack of security&#151;as everyone does&#151;but also to the shortage of equipment and low level of hygiene and healthcare in hospitals that would otherwise be quite capable of reaching international standards. Much of this can be put down to lack of management as well as to a shortage of police and security staff to prevent looting and the targeting of hospitals by criminals.

</p>

<a name="40907-21_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The noble Baroness says that the Iraqis are now in charge. I am not so sure. Iraqi people, while grateful for the fall of Saddam and much else, are not yet seeing the   benefits of foreign occupation or even the basic standards of accountability required by foreign donors. Community-based non-governmental organisations that are trying to get development projects off the ground are   also concerned about the continuing growth of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_525"></a>

unregulated entrepreneurial NGOs which have mushroomed on lucrative foreign contracts and much else besides.
</p>

<a name="40907-21_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>So can the Minister perhaps give an undertaking that these concerns of NGOs are at least being noted and are receiving due attention?

<a name="40907-22_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, as we came to terms with the terrorist attack of 9/11, one of the commentaries on the state of the world was that Islam had now displaced communism as the major ideological threat to the West.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>In the popular mind 9/11 evidenced a &quot;new&quot; threat, with commentators widely reporting that with this event &quot;the world had changed&quot;. The popular view saw communism as the age-old enemy whose place had now been usurped by a new and powerful religious force.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>If that is so, there is something ironic here that communism, which drew so much from a man who dismissed religion as the opiate of the people, should have been replaced in its role as challenger to the capitalist West by a religion.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>The truth is that, in the context of history, communism appeared as a relatively recent and short-lived phenomenon; the major tension that has dominated the landscape of the world for more than a thousand years is the relationship between two cultures&#151;one rooted in Christianity, the other in Islam.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>What happened on 9/11 was not the eruption of a new threat but a return to and a re-emergence of an historic tension that had lain relatively dormant and in the past century been eclipsed by war with Germany and the threat of communism.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>I believe that this lack of historical perspective has added to the errors of judgment in the way that both America and Britain engage with the Arab world.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>We have failed to understand the history of the relationship between the two cultures, and how actions will be interpreted and understood by each party in the light of both history and religion&#151;as with, for example, the careless use of the word &quot;crusade&quot;. There are major theological and ideological differences between the two cultures of Christianity and Islam; there is also common ground between the two. Speaking from these Benches, and conscious of many friendships with Muslims, never in the history of the planet has it been so important to take religion so seriously. What is required by religious leaders is not just dialogue, but an urgent summit on how we shall live together.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>Christianity and Islam are both missionary religions, both given to proselytising. This makes the task of finding a way to live together peacefully one of the great challenges of our time.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>On the political front, governments must understand that all actions have an historical and a religious context. Present actions in Iraq and the Middle East will be interpreted in the light of that <br>&nbsp;<br>

thousand-year relationship. To ignore this, or to have little regard for it, is to make the world not a safer, but a more dangerous place. That is why, on these Benches, while we have shared the Government&#039;s desire to make the world more secure, we have not been persuaded that the Government have fully understood the historical and religious dimensions of their actions. As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, said, a truly safer world cannot be secured by military intervention alone. In support of much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, has said, what is needed is this soft diplomacy, and also a patient understanding of the historic and religious roots of the conflict of cultures and by the conviction that in today&#039;s world the well-being of one culture depends not on the destruction but on the well-being of the other.

<a name="40907-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Truscott: </b>   My Lords, I do not propose to repeat here the detailed history of the UK&#039;s involvement in Iraq, and I hope to avoid rehearsing the arguments made by other noble Lords in the House today. However, it is important that noble Lords do not fall into the trap of examining the issue of intelligence with the benefit of hindsight. We were, after all, dealing with a regime which had wilfully obstructed the United Nations over 12 years.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Since 1991, the UN had issued 17 resolutions on Iraq. Authority to go to war against Saddam Hussein derived from the combined effect of Security Council Resolutions 678, 687 and 1441 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which specifically allows for the use of force to restore international peace and security.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>On 7 March 2003, the UN weapons inspectors themselves detailed at least 29 instances of Iraq&#039;s failure to provide credible evidence of disarmament, as required by the UN and Resolution 1441, and outlined at least 17 occasions when evidence contradicted the official Iraqi account. This is not intelligence, but the report of the UN inspectors themselves.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>In January 2003, UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix&#151;who is in the Palace of Westminster today&#151;himself reported concerns about the possible existence of chemical and biological weapons including anthrax and VX nerve gas, and the discovery of chemical rocket warheads. Missiles were being developed beyond the permitted range of 150 kilometres. Baghdad was continuing to obstruct UN weapons inspectors&#039; interviews with Iraqi scientists.

</p>

<a name="40907-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>Saddam Hussein had no intention of complying with Resolution 1441, which called for Iraq to co-operate &quot;immediately, unconditionally and actively&quot; with UNMOVIC and IAEA. In my mind there is no doubt that Iraq was in breach of 1441, and therefore I take issue with the rhetoric of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who said that there is a question of legality of the war. Iraq was warned by the UN that failure to comply would constitute a further material breach of Iraq&#039;s obligations, with serious consequences to follow. Resolution 1441 gave Baghdad a final opportunity to comply with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_527"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 527</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disarmament obligations. Therefore, there is no doubt that Resolution 1441 was Saddam Hussein&#039;s final opportunity to comply with the will of the international community and he failed to take it.


</p>

<a name="40907-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>The incisive report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, said the Iraq dictator continued to have,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes, including, if possible, its nuclear weapons programme, when United Nations inspection regimes were relaxed and sanctions were eroded or lifted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>In going to war to uphold Resolution 1441, the UK was upholding the authority of the United Nations itself. A dangerous dictator, intent on developing weapons of mass destruction that he had shown no compunction in using against his own people in Halabja in 1988, and a leader who did not shy away from attacking his neighbours had to be stopped. The UN could allow Saddam only so many &quot;last chances&quot;. Earlier, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said that the weapons inspectors should have been given more time. But I would respectfully remind the House that the reason why the weapons inspectors were let back into Iraq in the first place was because diplomacy was backed by the real threat of force.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Tomlinson that now is the time to look to the future of Iraq rather than the past. Already we have now spent too many months navel gazing, looking at the genesis of the war and the issues surrounding it. Of course the situation in Iraq remains extremely difficult and our Armed Forces risk their lives every day to bring peace and democracy to the country. But the prize is great indeed. Instead of a dictatorship which persecuted its own people, Iraqis now have a chance to rule themselves, unite their country and serve as a beacon of stability, prosperity and freedom in the Middle East.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>That is something that Islamist extremists would hate to see. They prefer, as we saw so tragically in Beslan in North Ossetia, to sow death, hatred and division. We should show the people of Iraq that there is another way; that there is another path that they can follow to true democracy. We hope that the elections pass off peacefully and that we move further down the road to a truly democratic Iraq next year. It is a stance that the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject&#151;the stance taken by terrorists in places such as Beslan and in other countries. In Iraq we should not flinch from being on the side of those of all religions who seek a better life and a brighter future, free from the horrors of conflict.

<a name="40907-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, when we went on leave, as I would call it, I never knew that we would be recalled here until I suddenly saw it on that new Government machine called &quot;government.com&quot; or something. I decided to look at my Iraq file, which started some 30   years ago. I examined it and looked at all the debates that I downloaded. I went through all the reports that have been published. I returned to the Scott inquiry. I suddenly realised that while Genesis <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_528"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 528</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occupied only seven pages and 50 chapters, the reports on terrorism and Iraq and the debates were equivalent, effectively, to the whole of the Old Testament.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>I wondered why, when people wrote those ancient books, they began with a few words which, over time, became more and more. If I recall Isaiah correctly&#151;the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth referred to it&#151;it had 66 chapters and 669 pages. Is it a whole lot of waffle, or is it better that we return to original signals such as the Morse signals that I tried to use the other day when I could not use the Internet? One used to be asked to send a PIM. It went, &quot;dit, dah dah, dit; didi, dah dah&quot;, and then one said &quot;over&quot; with a &quot;k&quot;. A PIM was one&#039;s &quot;position and intended movements&quot;. I wonder what our position is?
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I have spoken in these debates before, and I have not necessarily agreed with the Government. However, one person for whom I have great admiration is the Minister. Like a good lacrosse player, she has defended herself against everything that could have been thrown at her with total and utter integrity, and great charm&#151;often when the ball was on another pitch. She has done it in the right way. We were all behind her, though not necessarily behind the Government. Sometimes people are called PLUs&#151;people like us&#151;meaning that they are patriotic, non-political and believe in supporting the Government. I shall support for ever and a day the right of a Prime Minister to go to war.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>When I spoke, I used to say quietly that I did not think that terrorism was the right word. It was the wrong word, as we could not have a war against an &quot;ism&quot;. It is not something that we can touch and see. We could have a war only against people or lands. I probably made the mistake of saying that the Government were terrorist-related, as the word &quot;terrorism&quot; means government by fear.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>When the September report came out, telling us all that we should be scared stiff of ancient gases, sarins and toxins, I thought, &quot;Never mind. They want a reason&quot;. I then watched a programme in central Europe and saw that the message was coming out again. The Home Office had sent another piece of paper saying that people should be frightened of a whole range of gases and that they should go to Marks & Spencer and buy tinned food and duck tape to protect themselves. An actuary told me that that would be like someone living in the north of Scotland worrying about being run over by a car when he was trying to get into a Division in Parliament. The odds are not in favour. I wonder why they have tried to create that fear and nervousness when it is not necessary. What shall we do now? The Government have made a series of mistakes and have been heavily criticised today. The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, talked about resolutions. Given the number of other UN resolutions that have been broken by many other people, would we be at war with the whole world? The question is about the morality of the action, which is down to the subjective view of the individual. It was obviously right for the British to intervene in Iraq because we have an historic relationship and <br>&nbsp;<br>

responsibility and probably a greater duty than any other nation. However, we should have played to our own agenda. But we played to someone else&#039;s.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>The right reverend Prelate talked about a cartoon in a newspaper. I saw a copy of the <i>Sunday Times</i> showing our Prime Minister standing just beside Mr   Bush, and then two chimpanzees holding hands together. We are long-standing allies of America, but we must pursue our own foreign policy. We should listen to people who know. I went through the list of speakers in the recent debates and tried to mark out who had been to Iraq. There were very few. Your Lordships may have forgotten a wonderful man, George Brown, for whom I had a lot of time. He was a disciple of Nasser, together with Saddam Hussein. When I chaired the Committee for Middle East Trade, I would occasionally ring up George and he would say, &quot;I was out there recently&quot;. We used to have the ability to talk to heads of state no matter who they were, whether they were left-wing, right-wing, or dictators. In some places in the world today it might be better to have a benevolent dictator.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>I do not think that the Government listened to the right advice. The noble Baroness will forgive me if I refer to a communication sent in the form of a letter by ex-ambassadors to the Prime Minister. I tabled a Question for Written Answer on whether there would be an answer to the letter. I was told by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House that it was answered by the Prime Minister in a statement he made with the Italian Prime Minister before he kicked his shin at football. The letter states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;The conduct of the war in Iraq has made it clear that there was no effective plan for the post-Saddam settlement. All those with experience of the area predicted that the occupation of Iraq by the coalition forces would meet serious and stubborn resistance, as has proved to be the case. To describe the resistance as led by terrorists, fanatics and foreigners is neither convincing nor helpful. Policy must take account of the nature and history of Iraq, the most complex country in the region. However much Iraqis may yearn for a democratic society, the belief that one could now be created by the coalition is naive&quot;.</p>

<a name="40907-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>I am not in charge, but I must refer to what the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said: here we have what is potentially one of the richest countries in the world whose people are highly educated and really good engineers. They could put things right if they had security. Their production capacity could be much higher than 6 million barrels a day&#151;it could be 8   million. Your Lordships have only to look at the oil prices to work out the cash flow that the country could generate if there were stability and security. With its population, it could be very significant.
</p>

<a name="40907-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>I worry that we are too bureaucratic. I have read all the reports, and I like them. To my surprise, I find that ultimately most of my CDs are used as Frisbees&#151;indeed, like others, the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, went sailing across the lawn. We have a lot of paper and a lot of wisdom. I just wish that the Government would listen more to their own people who know about Iraq.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40907-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, I shall not dwell on the sorry tale of strategic incompetence that dogged policy making before the intervention in Iraq. We have heard from many noble Lords about that and I hope that we are all able to learn the lessons from it. But as we now look at the litany of errors in the months after major combat ended on 1 May 2003, it is clear that there was equally no strategic vision for the building of the new Iraq. Much of that blame rightly attaches to the US, which was the leading nation in the coalition.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>Yet the requirement for a British grand strategy does not disappear because we are the junior members of the coalition. The need for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Iraq was more urgent after the intervention than before it, yet the British Government have accepted a submissive role in the US-led shaping of policy for Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>I draw your Lordships&#039; attention to the current edition of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. It contains an article entitled &quot;What Went Wrong in Iraq&quot;. It was written by Larry Diamond, senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority for the first four months of this year and an academic. He reveals the extent of the mismanagement. Time does not allow me to go through his great long list, but he rehearses the consequences of too few troops on the ground during the post-conflict period and the use of the wrong kind of forces. He describes the coalition handling of the growing al-Sadr problem as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;impromptu and incomprehensively chaotic&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>This seems to be the hallmark of the approaches to most of the problems we have seen over the past 14   months.

</p>

<a name="40907-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>Dr Diamond gave an interview about his article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> in which he made some interesting remarks about Britain&#039;s role in all of this. He said that the British were regarded just as warily by the Coalition Provisional Authority as was the State Department. He specifically said that the British Ambassador, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, was systematically shut out. Dr Diamond regrets that, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;I think if the British had been listened to it might have been better&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>But we are where we are and the question is: what now is the best approach for the UK Government to take?
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>Our strategic aim should still be to seek peace and stability in the Middle East, to reduce international terrorism and to ensure the security of energy supplies. We need to know now that none of these is likely to be achieved by accepting that US policy-makers know all the answers.

</p>

<a name="40907-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>There is a good starting point for forward planning for the Government. It is the recently published House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee report on foreign policy aspects of the war on terrorism. It contains a section on Iraq which I commend to your Lordships. The committee makes 27 recommendations on Iraq in order to make our policy work. I enjoin the Government to take those recommendations very seriously indeed. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_531"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 531</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The committee warns that if it does not go well, the alternative to a positive outcome in Iraq may be a failed state and regional instability.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>As the Minister said, better security is the key enabler. Just because the media loses interest in day-to-day reporting of the continuing unrest and disorder, it does not mean that things are improving. We have heard various illustrations in speeches today. We are approaching the 1,000th US military death in Iraq, and, as many noble Lords have said, we do not know how many Iraqi civilians have died but the number is certainly 10 times that. The wounded of all nations, whether they are UK, US, Iraqi or other contributors to the forces, go largely unreported, but violent events happen everywhere, every day&#151;as we saw with the tragic deaths near Fallujah yesterday. The US deaths were near Fallujah because American forces have not been able to go into Fallujah since the end of April.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>All of this means that there is a continuing requirement for UK security support for a long time to come. As the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater, and the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, said, this is not really a very good time to be thinking about reducing our defence forces when we have these sorts of tasks ahead of us. This is particularly so when we have other obligations; for example, in Afghanistan.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>Trained Iraqi police, border guards, infrastructure protection and some competent Iraqi military are needed quickly. The Minister said that there were 200,000 already, but the question is how much training have those 200,000 had. The training programmes have been unbelievably slow. The very low levels of training were reported by the CPA in its final report. The figure, for example, of Iraqi police was 88,039 but only 5,857 had been trained. Of the 18,248 border guards, only 255 had been trained. That is not good enough. As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, said, it takes time to train. A largely untrained Iraqi security force will just make problems worse, and risk return to authoritarian rule using repressive means. The police approach to journalists is a worrying sign of that. Democratic accountability is not understood by many of the Iraqi forces at the moment. It also creates increasing pressure to use private military companies instead. We need to have a clear direction on the legal regime under which such companies operate and we also need transparent contract arrangements for them.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>On the economic side, reports show that reconstruction targets in most areas are being missed. The lack of reconstruction progress just deepens discontent and that worsens the security situation, which makes it more difficult to do the reconstruction.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>We have a deep moral and legal obligation to Iraq after embarking on what was a hasty and unwise intervention. We are investing the lives of our people&#151;both civilian and military&#151;as well as a heavy financial cost. We need to be sure that the British Government have a greater influence on the overall strategy than they have been able to exert so far. It is astonishing to me as it was to the Foreign Affairs Committee that we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_532"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 532</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

still appear to have no separate status of forces agreement for our forces with the interim Iraqi Government.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Given the scale of the UK commitment to the future of Iraq, I ask the Minister to tell us what measures the Government are taking to ensure that the UK is now able to have greater influence on the strategy of the interim Iraqi Government&#151;greater I hope than it managed to have when the CPA was in charge.

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40907-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Armstrong of Ilminster: </b>   My Lords, at this late stage in a long and very interesting debate, I intend to confine myself to a few remarks about two aspects of the Butler report. I endorse the gratitude expressed by so many to the Butler committee for what is a very impressive report. I should have expected no less from the committee chaired by my noble friend and successor, the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, who has added to our debt to him by his speech here this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>The report demonstrates that there are occasions&#151;the Franks report after the Falklands war was another such occasion&#151;when an inquiry of this kind is best chaired by someone with relevant experience of the subject matter as well as unquestioned integrity and impartiality, rather than by a learned judge. A judge&#039;s integrity and impartiality will of course be beyond question, but, inevitably, a judge cannot bring to the task the sort of experience that the noble Lord, Lord   Butler, brought to his.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>My first point stems from the Butler committee&#039;s view that judgments in the Government&#039;s dossier of 24   September 2002,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;went to (though not beyond) the outer limits of the intelligence available&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>That is the end of the measured quotation. I do not suggest that there was any information in the dossier that did not have some counterpart in the intelligence reports and assessments on which it was based. But there is no doubt that some of the information in the dossier was presented in a harder and more positive way than the intelligence community&#039;s assessments of its reliability warranted. The necessary qualifications and caveats were omitted. What should have been presented with a &quot;maybe&quot; was often presented with an &quot;is&quot; or a &quot;will be&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Each of us will form his own judgment about where responsibility for that lies, based on careful reading of the Butler report. My concern this evening is that we should make sure that it does not happen again. It is understandable that the Government should have wanted to make the best case that they could for what they were doing and expecting to do. I can understand why the Government wanted to buttress the credibility and objectivity of the dossier, by attributing responsibility for it to the Joint Intelligence Committee.

</p>

<a name="40907-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>However, with the benefit of hindsight, that decision was mistaken. It put the Joint Intelligence Committee&#151;indeed, the whole intelligence community&#151;in a false position. As the Butler report explains, the collection, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_533"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 533</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assessment and interpretation of intelligence is a skilled and complicated business. It calls not only for skill and experience but for unquestioned integrity and objectivity among all those engaged in it. The process will be put at risk if members of the intelligence community are looking over their shoulders at the possibility that their reports or the material in them will be published with attribution to them but without the qualifications and caveats that, in their view, affect the judgment on their reliability.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The Butler report addresses that problem. Its preferred recommendation is that if the Government want to publish a document using intelligence-derived material, they should themselves draft the document, gain the JIC&#039;s endorsement of the intelligence material inside it and then publish it, acknowledging that it draws on intelligence material, but without ascribing it to the JIC. That seems an eminently sensible and necessary recommendation and I hope that the noble Baroness who will reply to the debate will be able to tell us without equivocation that it has been accepted by the Government.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>My second point relates to the Butler committee&#039;s observations about the machinery of government. Those observations are stated, again in measured terms, in paragraph 611 of the report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;We do not suggest that there is or should be an ideal or unchangeable system of collective Government . . .  However, we are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the Government&#039;s procedures which we saw in the context of policy-making towards Iraq risks reducing the scope for informed collective political judgement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Every one of those last four words is loaded with meaning and implications for government in this country. In the British system, every member of a Cabinet&#151;indeed, of a Government&#151;bears collective responsibility for every policy decision and action taken by the Government, so long as he or she remains a member of it. That is as it should be. It is Ministers who will take and deserve credit for good decisions; and Ministers who will take the blame and pay the political price for bad decisions.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>That principle of collective responsibility is not an outmoded, textbook concept; on the contrary, it is a practical necessity. The observance of collective responsibility is indispensable to the coherence and authority of a government. We have all seen times when the breakdown of collective responsibility has undermined that coherence and authority.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>Ministers who are required to accept collective responsibility and to answer to Parliament and the electorate for major decisions of government are entitled to expect to have opportunities for collective discussion of those decisions for which they will then be expected to bear collective responsibility. They are also entitled to expect to receive the information necessary for arriving at properly considered decisions.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>Those not in government who are affected by government decisions or who are required to carry them out, including members of the Armed Forces, are entitled to expect that the decisions will be taken on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_534"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 534</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

basis of full information and after proper consideration and discussion by Ministers who are answerable to Parliament and the electorate.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>We are told that Iraq came up at meetings of the Cabinet no fewer than 24 times. But we are also told that papers prepared for discussion on the subject were never circulated and that the subject was not discussed by the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee of the Cabinet. It really looks as if those references in Cabinet were more for information than discussion. It does not sound much like good Cabinet government.
</p>

<a name="40907-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>The Prime Minister seems to prefer what has come to be described as &quot;sofa government&quot;; that is, sitting around and taking decisions with unelected advisers in informal gatherings at 10 Downing Street. The Butler committee&#039;s conclusion reminds us that that is in the interests neither of good government nor, as I believe, of political leadership, which wishes to command and deserve the confidence of Parliament and of the electorate.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="40907-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Gilbert: </b>   My Lords, I start by commending the words of my noble friend Lady Ramsay, particularly with respect to intelligence. She, like me, winced at the introduction of intelligence matters into the public domain. I hope very much indeed that we have not seen a precedent in this case. That is one of the things that worries me most, particularly when listening to some of your Lordships&#039; remarks, which drag up issues with respect to the proceedings of the Joint Intelligence Committee that, in my view, should never have been in the public domain.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>One of the advantages of speaking late in a debate is that one has the benefit of having heard your Lordships&#039; wisdoms and occasionally, also, your Lordships&#039; follies. In that respect, I think that I have never heard anything quite so remarkable in contrast as the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who I am delighted to see in his place. Although I did not agree with him, he delivered an admirable and well argued, coherent speech. But he ruined it with one of the most infantile summings-up that I have ever heard. He said that it was remarkable that on this side of the House no one who cheered the Government on when at the start was here to make a speech. Well, I am here to say that I cheered the Government on and I still am. My noble friends Lady   Ramsay and Lord Tomlinson are in precisely the same category. I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord   Thomas of Gresford, informs himself a little better before he makes another peroration. In fact, if I were him I would stick to speeches and leave perorations out in future.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>Unfortunately, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is not in his place at the moment. I was intrigued at one or two of the things he said. He was completely wrong when he talked about &quot;new terrorism&quot; and how appalling the happenings in Iraq, the Middle East and north Caucasus were, as though they were totally unprecedented and new forms of horror.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_535"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 535</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>We should remind ourselves that what has been going on there has not been the prerogative of Arabs, people who live in the north Caucasus or Muslims. Within the memory of almost everyone in this House, such things were done by Europeans coming from a Christian background on the continent of Europe in the past 60 years. Those of us who are old enough remember what happened at Oradour-sur-Glane where the German troops put an entire village inside a church, locked the doors and burned it down. At least the Muslims have not gone around burning down each other&#039;s places of worship. We should remember what the Germans did in Lidice.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>A broadsheet article only this week reminded me of what they did in the Ukraine as well. There the Germans killed children, not by accident because they happened to be in the way or were alongside adults. They singled out children in order to massacre them because they did not want people to grow up knowing about the horrors that they had inflicted and who would want to take revenge. These were not terrorists, but members of armed forces subject to discipline and wearing the uniform of their country, acting under orders. So let us be careful before we stigmatise people in the Middle East as being outwith the law and savages unknown to the human race. I will not buy it and I hope that very few noble Lords will do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I have one tart word for the noble Baroness, Lady   Williams, whom I hold in the highest regard. I thought I heard her say that, in respect of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, we could not yet figure out who was responsible for all the terrible things that have happened in those two places. I should point out that the career of General Sanchez is for all practical purposes at an end. He will forgo any future promotion. The American brigadier in charge of Abu Ghraib has been suspended from duty. Legal proceedings have been started against many American servicemen and I would be surprised if we do not see officers of at least the rank of colonel in the dock. It will take some time to do that because the American justice system works slowly, but to suggest that the Americans do not know what is going on and are not trying to do something about it is, I think, a total misrepresentation.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I turn to Iraq itself. We have to recognise that there are two different regimes operating at the moment: a daytime regime and a nighttime regime. During the day, over large parts of the country the writ of the coalition forces still runs. At night, it does not so run. Then the militias and sometimes the bandits monopolise the streets and take complete control, despite the efforts of the extremely brave men who offer themselves up to be members of the police forces of Iraq. It is impossible for me to conceal my admiration for those who join the police forces. They do not have safe barracks to return to. They can be assassinated in their homes, in their cars or in their supermarkets; and their children can be assassinated while at school. We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude and we have to hope that they will be successful. However, I am sure that they will not be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

successful if we do not stay. As the noble Lord, Lord   Owen, and the noble Baroness, Lady Park, pointed out, we have to go the distance.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>On Iraq itself and the coalition as a whole, I think that we have made two very serious blunders. We made a great mistake in going after Najaf, and an even greater mistake in not going after Fallujah. I am quite clear in my mind about this, although of course I do not see secret papers any more. There may be things of which I am innocent, but speaking as someone who is informed by the broadsheets and by talking to officers who have returned from the front, I am clear that not going into Fallujah was a very serious mistake.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>The people of Fallujah are extremely well organised. It is the home of al-Zarqawi. Such people are trying to foment civil war. Someone, at some time, has got to deal with Fallujah. If we do not, there will never be peace in Iraq. I regret to have to tell the House that I am informed on extremely high authority that the influence of Her Majesty&#039;s Government was exercised in the direction of trying to tell the Americans not to go into Fallujah, or to come out as early as possible. I have to say that I think that that was a great error of judgment on the part of Her Majesty&#039;s Government.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The Sunnis do not have a Sistani. Fallujah does not have the religious sites that Najaf has. Fallujah is the centre of extremely well organised attacks on coalition forces and Iraqi police forces. It is a centre that is attempting nothing more nor less than the total disintegration of Iraqi society. It has to be dealt with sometime or other. In my view it can be dealt with only by coalition forces. It was a very great mistake that we did not follow through when we went in in the first place.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>I am fully aware that there will be casualties and that innocent people will suffer, but that unfortunately is one of the consequences of the situation in which we find ourselves.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>I would like to make one last point. I am still&#151;just&#151;an optimist with respect to Iraq. It is easy to construct an extremely pessimistic scenario there. But I detect improvements&#151;even along the lines of the Wolfowitz doctrine&#151;in different parts of the Middle East since we went in and liberated Iraq. I dislike the words &quot;invasion&quot; and &quot;war&quot;. There has been no declaration of war; there has been a military activity which led to the liberation of Iraq from a foul dictatorship. Our troops were engaged in an extremely noble cause and they are to be congratulated on the performance of their duties.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>We have seen signs in Kuwait, with changes in the franchise for the elected assembly there. We have seen changes in Saudi, where the glimmerings of local democracy are starting to appear. There was an extraordinary conference of business people in Riyadh a few months ago where the top entrepreneurs in Saudi assembled in one large hall. Half of them were men and half were women, with a dividing line down the middle. But the extraordinary thing was that the meeting was chaired by a woman who had no headdress on. That would have been unthinkable a year and a half ago.

<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>I was pro-war in the beginning for the following four reasons: I assumed that they had weapons of mass destruction, though this claim was probably exaggerated; I knew that they had been in disregard of mandatory United Nations sanctions; I knew that it was a foul tyranny because I had listened to Ann Clwyd and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicholson; and I was fairly certain that he had been involved in some form of nasty terrorism even though I was equally certain that he had nothing to do with Al&#039;Qaeda because he was a Ba&#039;athist Muslim running a secular nationalist regime and hated that sort of Mohammedanism.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>When it was exposed by both the Butler and Hutton reports that the weapons of mass destruction were not there, some of the numbers regarding Saddam&#039;s tyranny were open to question. The terrorism which may have been undertaken in a minor way is now being undertaken in a major way. It seems that the war should not have been fought because the situation at the moment is worse than it was before, and that is very serious.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>With regard to what both the Butler and Hutton reports say, I cannot understand how the Prime Minister could say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;We know that he [Saddam Hussein] has stockpiles of major amounts of chemical and biological weapons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>The Joint Intelligence Committee said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;intelligence on Iraq&#039;s weapons of mass destruction is sporadic and patchy . . .  from the evidence available to us, we believe that Iraq retains some production equipment, and some small stocks of chemical warfare agent precursors, and may have hidden small quantities of agents and weapons&quot;.</p>

<a name="40907-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>Either somebody has changed the meaning of what the intelligence committee said, or the Prime Minister is too stupid to understand the difference and thinks that he said the same. I do not think you become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom with that level of intelligence.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>In March last year, the Prime Minister moved the Motion that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;this House . . .  recognises that Iraq&#039;s weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles, and its continuing non-compliance with Security Council Resolutions pose a threat to international peace and security&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 18/3/03; col. 760.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>The Prime Minister also referred to a,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>The JIC assessment, however, was:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;Saddam has not succeeded in seriously threatening his neighbours . . .  Saddam has used WMD in the past and could do so again if his regime was under threat&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-24_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>There is a wealth of difference there. Somebody took the decision to change the meaning. Who was it?
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>If we had believed so much that there were weapons of mass destruction, why were some units in the Armed Forces allowed to go into Basra without chemical and biological suits? Either they knew that Iraq did not have such weapons, so they did not need the suits, or it was crass incompetence for them to be allowed to go in without having those essential tools of self-defence.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>This is a very sorry story. We are left with an Iraq that is in the most ghastly mess. Unfortunately, we do not have a great deal to be proud of. I was informed over dinner only today, and it does not surprise me, that our policy in Iraq in the 1920s changed every time the Government changed, without any consideration of the needs of Iraq itself. The Americans are worse&#151;they do not do empire, which is a great pity. When you occupy a country, you have to know what you are going to do with it. You have to know how to create a police force.
</p>

<a name="40907-24_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>Iraq at the moment is in anarchy. There are now Wahhabi terrorists, Al&#039;Qaeda terrorists and different sets of Sunni and Shia terrorists, chopping off Nepalese cooks&#039; heads, executing innocent Italian lorry drivers, kidnapping French journalists. This is worse than what was going on before, and this is the pickle we have got ourselves into. I have not the   faintest idea how we will get out of it, I have not the faintest idea how long we will be, and it depresses me beyond peradventure.

<a name="40907-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, I have listened to most of the speeches&#151;and to those of my own party, of which there were a great many&#151;and I agreed with two of them. Perhaps I may explain my position a little. I agreed with going to war with the object of removing Saddam Hussein because it was quite obvious that the man was totally irresponsible. In fact, one might describe him as bonkers. He went to war with Iran and lost 800,000 men. He thought that he could get away with taking Kuwait. Anybody who thought that the West would ever allow that was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_539"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 539</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

wholly irresponsible and a grave danger to the whole of the Middle East when in charge of a country with great potential wealth. It was quite obvious to me that it was essential to remove him to have any chance of bringing a lasting peace to the Middle East. So I backed the war.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>One criticism that should be levelled at the Government, and it has been levelled by one or two noble Lords, is that they accepted American direction far too easily although advice had been given that would have been far better than the way the Americans went about things. The American Secretary of State for Defense was entirely wrong. His chiefs of staff wanted at least twice the number of men as they had some idea of the trouble that would arise after they had won the simple battle. We now have a situation where, mainly because of the lack of any control in the American section round Baghdad, our troops, who did a remarkable job in and around Basra, are now suffering from activity that was inspired by the fact that they got away with it in Baghdad and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>We must do something positive. I hope that the Government are saying that we must stick it out. The Government also need to recognise that the history of the regiments of this country&#151;I refer particularly to the regiments of my country, the Black Watch and the Argylls, for example&#151;needs to be perpetuated. Different organisation may be needed but the spirit that led Riddel-Webster to take off his helmet, wave his bonnet and walk through the crowds&#151;a brilliant move, which owed a great deal to his pride in belonging to the Black Watch&#151;must not be destroyed. I hope the Minister will take this strongly to heart and will ensure that the traditions of the old regiments are preserved, even though a great deal of their way of working may alter.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>We face quite a long struggle to get the new government in Iraq working. They need backing and will need it for more than a year. We must be prepared to back them. We must be prepared to put more troops into Iraq in order to be able, for example, to protect the roads, which are tremendously dangerous. We have a big job to do. I think that it can be done, but it will take an enormous amount of toil. It will take money and it will take people. Lives will be lost. But we must do it, otherwise we throw away the chance of peace in the Middle East.

<a name="40907-25_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Waverley: </b>   My Lords, drawing the short straw demands an attempt at brevity and originality. The Arab world and Muslims generally, do not trust the West and particularly the United States. While assistance is not denied, including financial or other aid, the pervasive lack of trust fosters the perception that this help is to pursue exclusively the interests and hidden agendas of donors.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>The challenge is how to alter or modify such dangerous views and lay solid foundations for an equitable world of religious and ethnic co-existence, freed of poverty and corruption, with accountable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_540"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 540</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

government, freely chosen, for future generations. Iraqis will only realise and enjoy those aspirations once the lack of trust is overcome and a dilution of the US-imposed democratic model is achieved. Until then, internal security will remain elusive and illusory.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>Entrenched perceptions and obstacles are not helped by history and long memories. The latter point was made by my noble and gallant friend Lord Inge, who felt it important enough to draw attention to it. The perception throughout the Arab world and elsewhere is that the United States and Britain attacked Iraq because Israel encouraged them to do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Further, the obstacle of extremism, flourishing in the aftermath of war, will remain until western attitudes towards Arabs and Muslims undergo positive change. Extremists tend wilfully to misinterpret religious books and derive momentum and new recruits from their tribal communities that believe in and reward revenge. Only enlightened Arabs and Muslims can, and must, be the ones to convince the extremists that what they are doing is wrong, but we in the West must help them to do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>We should not forget also that today&#039;s Arab perspective can be drawn from shared history, most notably with Britain, with events and promises that led   through contrary expectations to the Balfour Declaration; revolution in Syria, Lebanon and Algeria that sealed France&#039;s exit; and matters Italian in Libya. But it is current affairs that are fertilising extremism and distrust: imbalances between Palestine and Israel; the influence of the Israeli lobby on media control and the American elections; and partisan, expedient and unfair application of international law to the affairs of the Middle East by the United States.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>US vetoes against majority votes of the UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on Israeli-Palestinian issues serve as a well-rehearsed illustration. And what of the future? Our world is in transition, evolving towards the global certainty of regionalism. Leaders and forward thinkers should be encouraged to reflect on and to work toward the certainty and essential benefits of regionalism; a shared commitment to responsibilities and resources.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>A regional solution could accrue easily to such countries as Iraq and Afghanistan that do not have a history of centralised systems and only limited experience of statehood; more realistically resolve the Palestinian/Israeli difference by Israel&#039;s contribution to regionalism&#151;recognition that its viable future depends on peaceful, constructive relations with neighbours&#151;and allow ruling regimes more easily to implement a reform agenda, and contend with a newly endorsed conservative Iran. The question that I more increasingly ponder, however, is that if a group of senior players believes that Israel was behind the decision to attack Iraq, where does that leave decision-making on Iran, with its deteriorating relations with the United States and its seemingly pending nuclear weapons capability?
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>I conclude on an optimistic note: a future based on trust and understanding is a bright one, full of promise and realisable goals.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="40907-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, this has been an impressive and interesting debate. On a rough count, there were six speeches defending the Government&#039;s position; a number that were carefully neutral and balanced; and a substantial majority that were critical. I note in passing that this is a debate in which the largest number of non-Front-Bench speakers have come from the Cross Benches, and there have been   some very powerful speeches&#151;in particular the one we heard not long ago from the noble Lord, Lord   Armstrong of Ilminster. There have been relatively few speeches from the Government Benches wishing to support the Government.

</p>

<a name="40907-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Tomlinson and Lord Truscott, suggested that it was time to move on; the question is, can we move on? I would argue strongly that we cannot yet move on, for three reasons. First, as a number of noble Lords said, the issue has told us a number of very worrying things about the structure of government and the absence of checks on executive dominance.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>Secondly, we still have the same Prime Minister, who still advances similar reasons for loyalty to American strategy, for pre-emptive intervention and for blurring the war on terror and the containment of the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I read again this morning the speech that he made in Sedgefield in March, when he did his best to justify the war and in which he seemed to start by arguing that we were not concerned with regime change and to end by justifying the war on the ground of regime change. He declared that he was indeed concerned about Islamic extremism and terrorism well before September 2001, and again he blurred the question of Islamic terrorism and extremism, weapons of mass destruction and the intervention in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>The third reason is, of course, that the game is not over in Iraq, Afghanistan or in the wider Middle East. I read the Butler report carefully, but I have also this summer read the Woodward, Kampfner and Riddell accounts, Robin Cook&#039;s memoirs, the Philip Stephens book and Anthony Seldon&#039;s book. There is now a great deal of material on what happened and how the Government put it. The references in the books by Bob   Woodward, John Kampfner and Peter Riddell are fascinating; all of them interviewed the Prime Minister and all the other major players.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>What emerges is the extent to which we now have personal rather than Cabinet government. I never thought that I would look back to Mrs Thatcher&#039;s period as Prime Minister as a great period of Cabinet government in comparison with what we have now. We have a foreign policy run from No. 10; we have a disregard for the institutionalised expertise of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and we have what has rightly been called &quot;sofa&quot; government.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>We have a Prime Minister with a passionate sense of mission, as he set out in his Chicago speech in 1998; a strong sense of the divide between good and evil; a strong commitment to close co-operation with the United States; and an optimistic belief that he could exercise more influence over President Bush than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_542"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 542</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could Vice-President Cheney or the Secretary of Defense, Mr Rumsfeld. One has to remember&#151;this was part of what influenced those of us in my party to become more sceptical about the drift towards war&#151;the extent to which there were doubts in Washington in the spring and summer of 2002 about the direction of American policy, as expressed by James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and a number of very respectable Americans.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>One of my biggest doubts about the Prime Minister is, indeed, his intelligence assessment of the United States&#151;the assumption that Britain could have major influence in Washington and that the United States was not following a very different agenda. That is part of what Peter Riddell and others have called the &quot;self-delusion&quot; that led Britain&#039;s Prime Minister to war.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>There is strong evidence that our Prime Minister understood that President Bush was determined on war as early as March 2002; that that war was intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power; and that he then committed Britain to go to war alongside the United States. But he had to persuade his party and his public and to justify British participation on different grounds from those in which President Bush and those around him believed, which is to say weapons of mass destruction and on a refusal to accept the resolutions of the UN Security Council.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>The scepticism which my party was developing in this period rested partly on our deep doubts about American motivation. As someone has said, this was a war of choice cooked up in Washington think tanks and strongly influenced by the agenda of the current right-wing government in Israel. Ideology was overriding evidence, and there was an extraordinary degree of dependence on Ahmed Chalabi, including the belief that he could explain what was happening inside Iraq and the belief that overthrowing Saddam Hussein would create democracy throughout the Middle East; that the road to Jerusalem lay through Baghdad. All of that should have rung alarm bells not only in my party but also in No.10. We were also doubtful about the quality of the evidence in particular as produced in the September dossier because the later dossiers were worse.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;What we had has been described by one American intelligence official as faith-based intelligence. It was a case of &quot;We have the conclusions, please find us the evidence&quot; or, as Robin Cook put it in his evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, &quot;There was a selection of evidence to support the conclusion rather than a conclusion that arose from a full consideration of the evidence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Cabinet committees should have questioned this. Professional expertise should not have been swept aside. As the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, rightly said, there was a need for informed, collective judgment and for collective responsibility, which sadly failed in this case.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>I say one thing in passing about John Scarlett, who has been mentioned a number of times in this debate. It is clear that, in the run-up to the war, he unwisely stepped across the invisible line that divides the professional official from the political advocate. What the consequences of that should be for his career I leave to others, but I believe that it is extremely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_543"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 543</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

important to maintain that line and that the Joint Intelligence Committee should be on the professional side of that line.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>One of my puzzles over the past two years has been over the peculiarities of British intelligence. As professionals, I and my colleagues at the London School of Economics have a lot of contacts with US intelligence operatives and have discovered just how unhappy many of them were with the sweeping aside of their professional expertise. After all, analysis matters. It places evidence in context. It seems to me that part of what happened is that the context of the broader Middle East was lost. I particularly treasure the comment of one of the American intelligence officials at one meeting which was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;Looking back, the thing we neglected most was wisdom. We did not actually think through the broader implications of where we were going&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>The Prime Minister deceived his party, his Parliament and his public. In the words of the <i>Economist</i> on its cover, he and President Bush were &quot;sincere deceivers&quot; or as Clare Short put it to the Foreign Affairs Committee, it was an &quot;honourable deception&quot;, but deception it very clearly was.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>The cost to British foreign policy has been very considerable. Our Prime Minister has rested British foreign policy on the idea of Britain as a transatlantic bridge between Europe and the United States. The   European end of that bridge collapsed in this process, and No. 10 sank to active denigration of the position of the French Government. Peter Riddell, Bob Woodward and others make it clear that the attitude to the American position within both Paris and Berlin was sharply affected by their suspicions of Vice-President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and their growing belief that there was a submerged agenda in the American approach which now turns out, indeed, to have been correct.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>What have we lost in this? We have lost the momentum in Britain&#039;s European policy. We have lost the potential of a referendum on the euro, to which our Prime Minister said he was deeply committed, and we are now putting at risk perhaps a referendum on the European constitution. It is quite astonishing to me how much of the British press accepts the submerging of British sovereignty under American foreign policy while being astonishingly suspicious about the sharing of sovereignty with our European partners.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>A number of noble Lords in this debate have made comparisons with Suez. However, the appropriate comparison seems to me to be more with China in 1949 and Vietnam in the late 1960s and with two Labour Prime Ministers loyal to the United States who recognised that the United States was caught up in irrational, emotional policies and that it was better for Britain to take some distance from it. Correctly in 1949 the British recognised communist China and correctly in the late 1960s Prime Minister Wilson held back from committing British troops to Vietnam. I regret that on this occasion the wisdom of previous Labour Prime Ministers has not been followed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_544"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 544</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-25_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>A great deal has been said also about the continuing war on terror in which clearly we are committed for the next generation. There are real dangers of sliding&#151;as I think the Prime Minister&#039;s rhetoric in his Sedgefield speech suggested&#151;into a global confrontation. Many on the American right would welcome this, as would President Putin. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord   Howell, that I do not see the war in Chechnya as part of a global war on terror. Having been 10 days ago a great deal closer to a number of soldiers in Russian uniform in South Ossetia than I felt was very comfortable amidst evidence of massive smuggling by the Russian military, I am much more prepared to believe that it is the corruption of the Russian military and the vast mishandling of the whole of the north Caucasus by the Russians that has led to the bitterness from which we are now suffering in Chechnya.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>One of the best points that the noble Lord, Lord   Gilbert, with whom I rarely agree, made was that we should not overemphasise the novelty of brutality. It is not just German brutality that we have to remember, we should look also at Stalinist brutality. Nearly a million Chechens died during the Second World War. That is part of the background to the current conflict. We should remember how the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation used to behave at the end of the previous century. If it had had more effective explosives, it would have killed a lot more people in a fairly annihilistic manner. We should remember the 19th century anarchists who did their utmost to blow up as many European heads of government and state as they could.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>Terrorism is a continuation of war by other means, just as Clausewitz said that war was a continuation of politics by other means. Terrorism is the action of those who do not have the ability to fight conventional war, of those who are the underdogs, the desperate and the despairing. Sadly, there is a lot of despair. The women terrorists of Chechnya are the widows of men who have been killed and many of whose children have been killed. The politics of despair is something that we have to tackle if we are to tackle the causes of terrorism, which means that we have to deal with the problems of the Arab world and of the Muslim world and of the Middle East as a whole. I say very strongly that it would be a disaster for Britain and for our multi-ethnic and multi-religious community in Britain to define a war in terms of Islamic terrorism.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>However, we still have a commitment to Iraq and to Afghanistan, a complex set of policies towards Iran, a huge set of neglected policies towards Saudi Arabia and a neglected Middle East peace process.
</p>

<a name="40907-25_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>Our Prime Minister said, in his Labour conference speech of 2002,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;By the year&#039;s end, we must have revived final status negotiations,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-25_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>on the Middle East peace process. In January 2003, he said to British diplomats that the Middle East peace process remained essential. I agree with him. But it has not remained central. So we have to talk about future policy and start from the past. The question we have to ask is &quot;Can we have confidence that the Prime Minister has learned?&quot;
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40907-25_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>His arguments are that the end has justified the means. We will only know that if the results in Iraq turn out better than their prospects currently appear, if we manage to contain the problems of Iran and if we are lucky enough that Saudi Arabia does not collapse in the next two years. A great deal is riding on the management of post-war reconstruction in Iraq, a process over which so far Her Majesty&#039;s Government have had and sadly continue to have too little influence.

I, too, would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, for introducing this debate on Iraq with the authority and intellectual rigour that we have come to expect from her.

</p>

<a name="40907-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>Before turning to Iraq, I should like to touch on the events in Darfur. The situation is undoubtedly horrific, with murder, hunger and destruction widespread. The scenes are heart-rending and, if the UN&#039;s response and this Government&#039;s response are half-hearted, another tragedy will be added to the catalogue of calamities afflicting Africa. I hope the Minister can reassure the House that we will have an opportunity to debate it at the length it deserves in the near future.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>At this late hour, I ask for your Lordships&#039; understanding if I do not refer to all the excellent speeches, or the big picture so ably set out by my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford and others. I shall seek to address the present situation in Iraq itself.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>First, I should like to reinforce totally what the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, so rightly said on the excellent, long-awaited maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale. We are all very much aware of the tremendous contribution he has made to our national life outside the House, and very much hope that he will continue to make that contribution within it. I hope that his forensic speech today is but the first of many, and a sign of things to come.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>This country and this Parliament, as we have heard today, have engaged in an intense debate on the rights and wrongs of military action in Iraq, as well as the use of intelligence in coming to the decision to engage in conflict and the aftermath of that conflict. Strong views have been expressed by all sides throughout. They are genuinely held views, consistently argued, and, as such, deserve to be listened to and respected, regardless of whether they might or might not accord with our own perspectives.

</p>

<a name="40907-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>In the post-Cold War world, new threats have emerged. Rather than two organised blocs of states facing each other in conventional ways, we now have WMD proliferation, international terrorist groups and even women suicide bombers, resulting in civilian casualties and tragic events as we have witnessed these last few days in North Ossetia. All these I have mentioned spill across borders to inflame whole regions and threaten regional and international stability.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>In the case of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and in tackling terrorists and rogue states, it is not always practical to wait until the threat physically manifests itself. The American Government recognised that new geo-political environment when they developed their foreign doctrine of pre-emption designed to prevent attacks occurring. But such a doctrine is dependent upon reliable intelligence and, in a democracy, upon public faith in the intelligence upon which so many foreign policy decisions must now be based.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford, I supported the decision to take military action against Iraq to address the threat to both regional and international stability, and to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions that Saddam Hussein had for so long so openly disregarded. Many noble Lords agree that war must always be the last resort, but if we had not acted against Saddam when we did, the threat he represented would still be before us. It would still have to be tackled and possibly with far greater risk.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>I, like the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Foreign Secretary, still believe that the action we took in Iraq was right. As a responsible Opposition, however, our support for the conflict was not unquestioning. The Government still owe the House and the British people an explanation for the failings in the way they presented their case or for their failure adequately to plan for the post-Saddam Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, spoke with great wisdom on the necessity of post-conflict planning, as did the noble Lord, Lord Garden. In the run-up to and during the conflict the shadow Foreign Secretary pressed the Government for a clear post-Saddam reconstruction plan. No such plan appeared and it is true that we could have achieved far more by now if an effective plan had been in place.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>Many noble Lords including the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, have discussed the Butler report and highlighted the failures of the Government in the use made of intelligence material in the lead-up to the conflict. It was most interesting to hear the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, today, especially after reading carefully his fascinating report this summer. There continues to be grave concern over the conduct of this Government and whether proper use was made of the intelligence. As my noble friend Lord Strathclyde said in his response to the Butler report,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;The tragedy is that, although the Government had a good case for war, the way in which it was argued&#151;as exposed, once again, in this outstanding report, which has found serious flaws in <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_547"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 547</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>intelligence and its uses&#151;has weakened that good case and damaged the credibility of the Prime Minister in the country&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/7/04; col. 1260.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>This could be highly damaging should he need to make a similar case in the future.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>Turning to Iraq itself, many noble Lords welcomed the impressive and often unsung progress that has been made in rebuilding the country and in the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi interim Government under the direction of Prime Minister Allawi. Positive steps have been made in sectors such as health and education but, in welcoming that, we should not forget that there is still much to be done. Our Armed Forces deserve much of the credit for helping to create the conditions in which such a handover was possible, as well as in their humanitarian work, policing civilian life in Iraq and rebuilding the country. Their professionalism and bravery in the face of considerable risks is an example to us all.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and my noble friend Lord Selsdon raised certain questions on the provision of security, which should be the first priority. Without security, the investment and NGO participation that is so vital to rebuilding Iraq will not flow. Recent reports have indicated growing unrest in parts of Iraq, including parts of the British sector, as we heard from my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to explain in her winding-up speech what steps are being taken to remedy those problems, and I look forward to her answer to my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater on the press blackout.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>In a centralised authoritarian state such as the Ba&#039;athist state of Iraq, the state, via the armed forces, is often the key employer. A point that was wisely made by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, in her lucid and informed speech, was the decision to abolish the Iraqi security forces, army and police, which instantly undermined both the means to enforce law and order, and created vast unemployment, affecting millions of Iraqi families.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>We all hope and pray that, despite setbacks, Iraq will emerge as a functioning and successful democratic state, and that investment can be generated, making Iraq a beacon for the region. The noble Lords, Lord Gilbert and Lord Owen, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, stressed that we should stay, as we were there for a long haul and could not walk away.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>Like my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater, I was encouraged to read that the BBC World Service is now operating well in Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>We cannot be complacent about the huge task ahead in Iraq in tackling other weapons of mass destruction proliferation issues and the omnipresent threat of terrorism. The sad truth is that the Government&#039;s handling of the case for conflict with Iraq may have made it far more difficult to persuade the British people in the future to support military action should a future threat emerge.

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="40907-26_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as I am sure we all anticipated, this has been a wide-ranging and animated debate. We have covered a great deal of ground, including the legal justification for war, intelligence reports, the prosecution of the conflict, security issues, the future political process, reconstruction, our Armed Forces and the impact of the conflict on the Middle East, Russia, Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan and Darfur.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>I very much appreciated the interesting&#151;indeed fascinating&#151;contribution from the noble Lord, Lord   Wolfson of Sunningdale. It was a maiden speech, despite its lengthy incubation period of 15   years. Custom in your Lordships&#039; House rightly dictates that I should not be challenging in my response&#151;perhaps not as challenging as the noble Lord was in his maiden speech. I look forward to the opportunity of making a less inhibited response in the future. I hope that I shall not have to wait for another 15 years to do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>Some of the arguments are now very familiar, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, demonstrated in relation to the role of the United States, the relationship between the United States and the UK Government, and the role of the Prime Minister in particular. There were contentions about Arab views of the conflict in relation to the role of Israel, as demonstrated by the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>Much of that contrasted sharply with the views of the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings. I agree with her that it was necessary to deal with Saddam when we did or face a far worse situation later.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>I shall do my best to answer the issues raised, but I shall concentrate on Iraq. I believe that both the noble Lords, Lord Owen and Garden, were right. Success in Iraq is far from certain, but it is hugely important. I tried very hard to be balanced in my opening presentation of the situation in Iraq and could not help feeling that some of your Lordships concentrated almost exclusively on the negative.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>There is a great deal that causes concern and anxiety and a great deal to arouse indignation and frustration. But there is, too, much on which we can congratulate those who are striving hard to achieve a better future for Iraq and its people.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>Let me deal with the issues of security raised by so many of your Lordships. I strongly agreed with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, on global terrorism. The trends towards extreme violence against huge numbers of defenceless people is sickening. We should be under no illusion; if the terrorists could kill thousands rather than hundreds they would. The points made by the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, were highly apposite in this respect.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>While I do not agree with parts of the thesis put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, I strongly agreed with his point that the international community needs better means than <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_549"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 549</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

currently available to us to deal with international conflicts, whether generated by fear of terrorism or by the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>I noted the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady   Falkner, on terrorism, but I have to ask her whether she honestly believed that this was the right time to say what she did about Beslan while so many children remain to be buried and grief is so raw. With respect, I felt that she came perilously close to allowing those responsible for the repellent events of last week to evade responsibility for what they did.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, repeated the points about the links to terrorism. However, I agreed with the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that the evidence is not there to substantiate that thesis. I know that the noble Lord felt this was a powerful argument for intervention, but it has not been an argument&#151;except in the general sense of regimes which challenge international law giving succour to terrorism&#151;substantiated by the evidence available to us at the time, as the noble Lord, Lord Butler, made clear in his powerful intervention.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>Perhaps I can turn to some of the broader issues raised by the noble Lords, Lord Howell, Lord Skidelsky, Lord Rea and Lord Mackie of Benshie, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and to the points I was specifically asked to answer by the noble Lord, Lord King. Now more than 200,000 Iraqi personnel are on duty as part of the Iraqi security forces. That includes 93,000 police officers, 40,000 Iraqi national guards, 16,000 border police, 74,000 facilities protection services and 35,000 new Iraqi army personnel. However, the latter two are still undergoing training in large numbers. Furthermore, 10 of the 27 planned army battalions are under basic training and another six are operating at full operational capacity.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, gave us a characteristically balanced and sensible contribution. He was right to remind us that although the Butler report pointed out mistakes in handling intelligence&#151;some particular and some systemic mistakes&#151;it was not&#151;emphatically not&#151;an indictment of the whole of our intelligence operation. Again, I agreed strongly with the well informed views of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, and my noble friend Lady Ramsay. The apocalyptic judgments of some of your Lordships in attempting to rewrite the conclusions of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, simply were not borne out by the report itself.

</p>

<a name="40907-26_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>Let me turn to the Butler report and the intelligence issues, matters on which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, the noble Lords, Lord Howell, Lord Holme, Lord Wolfson, Lord King, Lord Goodhart and Lord Armstrong, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and my noble friends Lord Gilbert and Lady Ramsay concentrated together with the noble and gallant Lords, Lord Craig and Lord Inge. I thought that the report was very good. It was clear and it was balanced, as the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, said. However, I did not think it was damning, not even in Civil-Service speak, as the noble Lord, Lord Holme, suggested, or, perhaps <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_550"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 550</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

even more fancifully, in Mandarin, as the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson, said. Many of your Lordships have tried to say that what the Butler report states is not what the report really means. It was described as &quot;brilliant&quot; by the   noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and as &quot;excellent&quot; by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. But then, together with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, they seemed to think that they knew better what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, really meant to say in the conclusions of his report.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>The report is clear. The JIC process is robust; the assessments that result are respected (paragraph 43). Broad conclusions of the UK intelligence community, although perhaps not all details, were widely shared by other countries (paragraph 457). The point has been put that the Government were over-enthusiastic or perhaps deliberately selective in making the intelligence fit the policy. Policy decisions were taken on the basis of Iraq flouting the will of the UN, as the noble Lord, Lord   Butler, concludes clearly in conclusion 9 of his report. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, went as far as to say that the assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was demonstrably wrong. That simply is not borne out by what the committee said at paragraph 474, where it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;Even now it would be premature to reach conclusions about Iraq&#039;s prohibited weapons . . .  it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage that evidence of Iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents, or even banned missiles, does not exist or will never be found&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-26_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>I dread to think that the noble Lord would really embrace the epithet of being rash.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Butler, stated his case over Mr   Scarlett and his post as head of the SIS. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, sadly demanded that someone should pay the price for intelligence shortcomings. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, answered her far better and certainly far more authoritatively than I can. Just because public opinion would like to see an individual take the blame, it does not mean that it is fair or right to apportion blame to an individual where it is not merited.
</p>

<a name="40907-26_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_573"></a>Several of your Lordships expressed high regard for John Scarlett. The Government share that regard, as articulated by my noble friend Lady Ramsay in her characteristically clear-sighted contribution. There were specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord   King, in relation to the ISG report. John Scarlett wrote to Mr Duelfer in March following a request from Mr Duelfer to set out items from the earlier classified ISG report which we believed could usefully be included in the ISG report then under consideration. That was Mr Duelfer&#039;s suggestion. Mr   Duelfer himself made it absolutely clear that the decision to publish a shorter interim report was entirely his and not the result of pressure from the British Government or any other government. The noble Lord&#151;

</p>

<a name="40907-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_574"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, asked for assurances that the Government accepted the report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that we do. He has laid out four ways in which we are moving forward on the report. The one which involves Mr   Ehrman as chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee has attracted some criticism today. I stress that this is a temporary appointment. The Cabinet Office will make a permanent appointment to take effect during 2005 and that will be done fully in accordance with the criteria of the noble Lord, Lord Butler.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_575"></a>The other points raised by the noble Lord in relation to the operation of important committees discussing such matters as Iraq operating as ad hoc committees of the Cabinet in future, the points about the SIS appointing a senior officer to work through the findings and recommendations of the Butler review, focusing on resourcing and organisation of SIS validation process and the relationship of the intelligence services and the future presentation of the intelligence reports have all been accepted. But I point out to the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in response to her thoughtful contribution, and to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, in his spirited contribution, that in respect of machinery of government the noble Lord, Lord Butler, says at paragraph 611:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;We do not suggest that there is or should be an ideal or unchangeable system of collective Government, still less&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="40907-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_576"></a>&quot;Still less&quot;&#151;my emphasis&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>&quot;that procedures are in aggregate any less effective now than in earlier times&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_577"></a>I turn to the contributions of the right reverend Prelates. I join the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford in his praise of the work of Canon Andrew White and the Iraqi Institute of Peace. Canon White is safe. We have raised the incident with the Interior Ministry in Iraq. I agree with the right reverend Prelate that the work of the institute is a force for unity and healing. I note his point, powerfully expressed, that the future Government of Iraq has to be seen through an Islamic prism, and not solely in western secular terms.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_578"></a>I agree very strongly with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, that democracy is not a western luxury. Ask any Iraqi; ask Iraqi women: they want representative and inclusive government. I agreed very strongly with the very strong points made by my noble friend Lord Gilbert in that respect. The right reverend Prelates the Bishops of Portsmouth and of Liverpool were right to remind us in their thoughtful contributions about the overarching nature of Abrahamic faith and the importance of dialogue between faith groups.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_579"></a>I was grateful for the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in relation to the Kurds. I am struck that the Kurdish leaders often express support for our efforts to promote a political process that will ensure free and fair elections for a representative government. I doubt that the noble Lord was able to share all his views on what has <br>&nbsp;<br>

happened in Iraq with his Kurdish interlocutors. But I point out to him that Kurdish members of the Iraqi Cabinet include six individuals, including the deputy Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and, of course, a vice-president.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_580"></a>Many of your Lordships raised questions on reconstruction, including the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley. In relation to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, which was echoed by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, KPMG is currently auditing the development fund for Iraq for the period from 30 January to 28 June 2004. The International Advisory and Monitoring Board is carrying out a special audit of the development fund for Iraq on sole-sourced contracts. The results of those audits will be available shortly, which I hope will answer some of the very important points raised by the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_581"></a>The main use of the development fund for Iraq money has been to meet recurrent costs under the Iraqi budget, including the running of health and education programmes and paying public sector employees. The noble Lords, Lord Selsdon and Lord Garden, thought that post-war planning had been a failure. The noble Lord, Lord King, asked about achievement in terms of Iraq&#039;s future. My noble friend Lord Tomlinson also concentrated his helpful remarks on economic issues.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>As regards the economy, sanctions have been lifted and the foundations of a market economy have been laid. There has been a successful country-wide currency exchange from the two currencies under Saddam Hussein to the new Iraqi dinar, which has been a remarkable success. The Central Bank has become independent of government with the task of controlling inflation. The tax system is simplified. The IMF expects growth of 33 per cent this year.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, was concerned about oil. Crude oil production remains at more than 2 million barrels per day and, security permitting, is on track for reaching 3 million barrels per day by early 2005. Revenues total more than 7.5 billion dollars so far this year, which are primarily used to finance ministry operating budgets. Unemployment is still high but there is a great effort to put money in to create some 500,000 jobs. DfID is providing a further &#163;50   million for a UN job creation programme currently under way in southern Iraq.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>Long-term rehabilitation of the energy sector continues. Power generation now exceeds pre-war levels of 4,400 megawatts. Water and sanitation have been improved&#151;I am sure that my noble friend Lord   Rea will be pleased to hear that. My noble friend also raised the issue of healthcare. All 240 hospitals are now functioning and the Iraqi Ministry of Health has established 24-hour operation centres to co-ordinate health issues.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>Turning to schools, there are 6 million students and 300,000 teachers in more than 20,000 schools. There are 70 million new text books. Transport is improving; the media is flourishing; and, of course, there has been a great deal of work on justice. I have extensive details <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_553"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 553</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on all those points. I propose to write to all your Lordships who have taken part in today&#039;s debate to give further details on those points.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>My noble friend Lord Bach, who is in his place beside me, has noted the points made by the noble Lord, Lord King, on pay and tax of the Armed Forces and the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady   Park, on service cuts. He will write to them in respect of those issues.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>The noble Lord, Lord King, referred to the news blackout. In fact, there was widespread media coverage of the difficulties to which he referred. I regret that the Iraqi Government decided that they wanted to close down Al-Jazeera&#039;s Baghdad office for 30 days, which they are reopening tomorrow. We have made clear to the interim government that we think it is very important that there is an open and free press operating in Iraq.

<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd raised points in relation to casualties. It is only fair to say to my noble friend that I hope he was not ascribing to the Government any lack of compassion on those issues. We seek at all times to minimise the impact of military action on civilians and of course to avoid civilian casualties, but there are no reliable figures for Iraqi civilian casualties not because we do not care, but because so far it has proved impossible to collect them. I shall be frank and say that I regret that enormously. I believe that it is a shortcoming that needs urgently to be remedied.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, raised a number of points about the FCO&#039;s United Nations department. I shall write to him on those, but I do assure him that things are not quite as dreadful as perhaps he has been led to believe.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and, I am pleased to say, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, all spoke about the legal basis for war. The noble Lords, Lord   Thomas of Gresford and Lord Goodhart, know that we have discussed these issues over and over again. I was grateful to my noble friend Lord Truscott for his lucid and accurate account of this issue. However, let us be clear. Nothing I found in the Butler report calls into question the legality of the war. The view of the Attorney-General that the military action taken in Iraq was lawful remains his view, as it was then. The Government have acted in accordance with his advice at all times.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>On the question of the publication of legal advice raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I hope that he will agree that the Government have put more into the public domain than has ever been done before on an issue of this nature. Equally as unprecedented is our openness over publishing intelligence, much as my noble friend Lord Gilbert may regret that, and as unprecedented as the vote in the Commons before we committed our troops.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, was concerned that the conflict in Iraq diverts attention from the Middle East. I recognise that concern, but I can assure him that it has not diverted my attention, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_554"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column 554</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

although I suspect that that is not quite enough to satisfy the noble Lord. I look forward to his tabling a debate on these issues so that I can bring the House up to date on the Middle East peace process. I look forward also to pursuing the points made by the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, and the noble Lord, Lord   Selsdon.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>To be frank with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, there are many in the Middle East who are really delighted to see the back of Saddam Hussein. They believe that the coalition was right to ensure his demise. It is the Middle East conflict that remains the principal source of anger and frustration in the region&#151;or at least that is what I have found during my recent very extensive travels in the area.
</p>

<a name="40907-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>What I find remarkable about many of the contributions to the debate has been the way in which so few noble Lords have mentioned the atrocities of Saddam Hussein. In asking us to consider the alternatives to military action, some noble Lords have asked us to believe that more time would have made a difference. However, do noble Lords really believe that? We know already about 259 mass graves, and the 300,000 bodies in those graves.

<a name="40907-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Watson of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. She has raised a very important point. When on 18 March 2003 the Prime Minister rose in another place to move the Motion in favour of the commitment of British troops, he did so very clearly to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;support the decision of Her Majesty&#039;s Government that the United Kingdom should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq&#039;s weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>That was the core of the case made by the Prime Minister and that is what this debate is about.
</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="40907-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, this debate is not solely about weapons of mass destruction. The Opposition parties asked for a debate about matters relating to Iraq. That is why it has been a broad-based debate. If the noble Lord wants to have a debate about specific issues, he knows that he is at liberty to table such a debate.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>Again, we have gone back to blaming the Government for the decision and have moved away from the issues surrounding the atrocities of Saddam Hussein. I ask noble Lords this: do they really believe that waiting another year would have made a difference? Would Saddam have backed down from developing weapons of mass destruction? Such a supposition is not just fanciful; at worst, it is irresponsible.

</p>

<a name="40907-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>As always, the debate has been stimulating and interesting but at times, I am bound to say, in the enthusiasm to express a clear view about the genesis of this conflict, the evidence of four reports examining what happened has been reinterpreted. The plain and simple findings of those reports have been set on one side, which is worrying.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>But what is more worrying is the refusal to acknowledge any improvements for the Iraqi people in facing a future without Saddam Hussein and his vicious regime.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>I acknowledge today&#151;as I have consistently acknowledged in the past&#151;the shortcomings in the way in which the coalition governments have operated in relation to Iraq. But it strikes me that no such desire for a balanced approach afflicts some commentators, including some in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>We knew before today that we would not agree on the legal basis for war. Now it seems that, although we all agree that the report of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, <br>&nbsp;<br>

was &quot;brilliant&quot;, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said, or &quot;excellent&quot; as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said, or just plain balanced and sensible, we still do not agree with his conclusions.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>But surely we can agree on some points. Iraq&#039;s future without Saddam Hussein is a better prospect than Iraq&#039;s future with Saddam Hussein. Surely we can agree with my noble friend Lord Tomlinson that we want the best possible future for Iraq&#151;a peaceful and prosperous future.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>I cannot, nor would I wish to, spin away the military action of last year. But I look forward to a time when we can discuss a way forward for Iraq, as well as understanding why we continue to disagree about the past.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_603"></a>I hope that at some stage soon your Lordships&#039; passion about the past will be equalled with a passion about the future, for what has been achieved and what can be achieved. Iraqi people deserve no less.

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 126 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40907-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I was going to begin by saying, &quot;Here we are again&quot;. Unfortunately, that is not true, strictly speaking. Instead of being in the rather congenial atmosphere upstairs, with fresh air and so on, we find ourselves back in the Moses Room. I find the arrangement for sitting in the middle of the Recess signally inconvenient. It is one thing if World War III is about to break out or something&#151;we would come back and understand the problems&#151;but it is another to come back on a planned basis when the Library is cut off from many sections. The Government really ought to decide whether, in the summer, this place is a building site or a legislative chamber. It is not helpful at all.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>A number of current developments are not without interest. There is, of course, a very large rumour going around that the Bill is to be dropped in favour of a Bill on fox hunting. It should be clear that we are not wasting our time. I hope that the Minister can give us a clear assurance that there is absolutely no question whatever of that happening.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>A large number of government amendments have also been tabled. As often in the past, I pay tribute to the Minister for the very helpful way in which she has provided notes on the different amendments. There are hundreds and hundreds on which debate could have taken place in the Commons. We are also short of a Secretary of State. As all the legislative process seems to be moving to this end of the building rather than taking place in the other, perhaps the sensible thing to do is to make the noble Baroness Secretary of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC130</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

State. She knows infinitely more about the subject than any other possible candidate and that would enable us to proceed smoothly in scrutinising the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I ought to mention a couple of other developments. I suggested to the noble Baroness during the Recess that it would be helpful if we had some sort of matrix showing which groups of pensioners whose company schemes are in difficulty are likely to qualify for no help at all, help under the financial assistance scheme or help under the PPF. As always, she courteously replied. The difficulty is that many of us are receiving letters from companies that ask, &quot;What&#039;s happening so far as we are concerned?&quot;. I find it difficult to give any authoritative answer lest I have misunderstood the situation. In addition to the very helpful note sent by the noble Baroness, it would be of great value to the public outside&#151;who obviously have considerable expectations about the Bill&#151;if she could give a more specific answer on that.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Worryingly, the noble Baroness&#039;s note referred to the financial assistance scheme. We are still in a situation where only one clause in the Bill effectively says that everything will be done by statutory instrument. We have no idea what the content is. It is clear from her note that the Government do not seem to have very much idea at the moment either. The idea was introduced in something of a panic in the other place at a late stage of the Bill, but we really need to know the Government&#039;s intentions so far as that is concerned. When we come to the clause, I hope that we have amendments so that, instead of leaving the whole thing to unamendable regulations, we know exactly what the Government have in mind. It would be unacceptable for the clause to go on the statute book in its present form.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The noble Baroness&#151;this is a rather retrospective comment&#151;has sent many of us a note on the progress of consultation on the moral hazard problems that we raised earlier. We are very grateful to her for that. We must hope that more progress on those crucial issues can be made. All of us are concerned with improving the Bill as it stands, particularly in regard to the dangers that the earlier clauses present on a wide range of issues.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>I turn briefly to Clause 126. I am a little puzzled by it in that it enables directions to be given during an assessment period in relation to an &quot;eligible&quot; scheme. I am slightly puzzled by that expression because I am not clear in my own mind when a scheme becomes an &quot;eligible&quot; scheme. I should have thought it would not become an eligible scheme during a period of assessment because, presumably, the assessment may be such that it is decided that it is not an eligible scheme. Perhaps the noble Baroness will clarify that point.
</p>

<a name="40907-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I am not clear why the assessment period should take place when the assets appear to exceed the scheme&#039;s protected liabilities. I should have thought that only if it was increasingly apparent that that was not the case would it become an assessment period. But the whole issue of assessment periods and what happens in them is something to which we shall come a little later and I shall raise it then.

<a name="40907-28_para20"></a>

But clearly the clock is ticking very fast&#151;even faster than the clock which, people will notice, is slow by five minutes. We have all had many letters and communications from people whose pensions are at risk and we are very keen to have further details of the financial assistance scheme. Frankly, it is long overdue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40907-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   Before the noble Baroness responds to these opening remarks, I join in the tributes for the way in which she has approached this legislation, with particular reference to consultation on the so-called &quot;moral hazard&quot; clauses. I recall that the Minister said that she was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;genuinely open-minded as to whether this is the right way forward&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;perfectly willing to be persuaded&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8/7/04; col. GC213.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I believe that all Members of the Committee went into the Recess with the sense that while we had undoubtedly discussed the problems of moral hazard at some length, we had certainly not resolved them.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Since then, the Minister has worked exceedingly hard with her officials, issuing a discussion paper on the topic which went to a number of interested parties. Yesterday we received a fascinating letter from the noble Baroness to colleagues setting out an immensely helpful summary of what the key players in the worlds of business, venture capital, accountancy and pensions have been saying in response to the consultation paper.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>At some stage, I hope to make the Minister aware of the consultations that I have been able to have with the professionals in this area. I mentioned to her the need to consult with the Society of Turnaround Professionals, which I instanced before we rose. It is not mentioned in the Minister&#039;s letter but its voice is both authoritative and indispensable. Right across the board the message is the same, particularly as a consequence of what the Minister refers to in one word&#151;namely, &quot;retrospection&quot;. Because of the approach to retrospection, everyone to whom I have talked has been able to give instances of companies that have been saved but which would not have been saved had the new regime proposed in the Bill been in force.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I do not want to take up the Committee&#039;s time now, but I ask the Minister to respond to the letter I have put on the board for her, which sets out the concerns of this sector.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40907-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Finally, the appointment of a new Secretary of State provides the Government with a timely opportunity dispassionately to reassess this Pensions Bill from top to bottom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40907-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Like other noble Lords, I am delighted to be back and to see everyone&#151;I was going to say &quot;fighting fit&quot;, but I am not sure I want &quot;fighting fit&quot;&#151;fit and happy, bronzed, sun-tanned and rearing to go.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I also should like to express my appreciation&#151;already expressed by your Lordships&#151;for the work done by the officials over the summer while many of us were able to take a vacation. I know that many of them have postponed holiday breaks until the Bill has achieved&#151;we hope&#151;consent in both Houses. They have been working both on this and on the regulations. I endorse the remarks made by your Lordships this afternoon about the work that has gone on during the summer.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the officials have tried, with the support of Ministers, to enter into those discussions with as constructive an attitude as possible. It is obviously true that not all expertise resides within the department. It is unusual for the DWP to work with experts outside the department because&#151;unlike, say, education and health&#151;it tends to work mostly with lobbies such as the poverty or children&#039;s lobbies and so on. So it is valuable for all sides concerned.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I shall address a couple of the more specific points before turning very quickly to Clause 126. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, invited me to say where we are and whether we could do a matrix on PPF and the financial assistance scheme. When we can, we will. The trouble is that we are not there yet. I think that Members of the Committee are aware of the situation with the Pension Protection Fund. It will cover schemes required to pay the levy from April 2005 which begin winding up from April 2005 and where the sponsoring employer experiences a qualifying insolvency event from April 2005 onwards. Those three conditions have to be in place for a scheme to enter the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The noble Lord was particularly concerned about the financial assistance scheme. I have to say that the detail of who will qualify has yet to be finalised. We are still having extensive consultations with the bodies involved. I would be delighted to be able to bring more information to the Committee than I currently can. However, it is difficult and complex. The act of trying to collect robust data of those affected is a much more extensive and elongated process than certainly I had expected when we went into this. Even the apportionment of deferred members and active members to existing pensioners on some of the schemes that may be at risk is not always available.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>One issue we need to consider is whether we have an initial cut-off date for support and the financial assistance scheme. We are likely to need a cut-off point, both to make it administratively feasible and to have some certainty about the funding arrangements. One option we are considering, which obviously is the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

front-runner at the moment but which is not necessarily going to be the last word, is April 1997, since that was the starting point for the Pensions Act 1995 coming into force. However, we shall take into account the position of schemes which started to wind up shortly before April 1997 before reaching a final conclusion.
<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="40907-29_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40907-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Schemes that start to wind up after 10 April 2004, when the Secretary of State made his announcement in the other place, benefit from the change in priority order. That change means that non-pensioned members will be less likely to suffer the scale of losses to their pensions as were experienced under the old priority order. We hope that that may reduce the problem for them and for deferred members.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>However, I repeat that we do not yet have details of the financial assistance scheme that I can bring before the Committee. We have not yet ruled out help in respect of schemes that start to wind up between May 2004 and the introduction of the PPF&#151;what I call the sandwich year. We are still making final decisions on requirements for the financial assistance scheme once further research and consultation have been concluded. We need better data; we need to make a decision on the start date; we need to make a decision on the transitional, interim year between May 2004 and, we hope, the effective running of the PPF from April 2005; and we need further decisions relating to the sponsoring employer not being insolvent. I understand that all those schemes will be eligible for assistance. Solvent employers should support their schemes and provide the benefits that members expect. Nevertheless, issues of employer solvency remain under consideration.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>There are obvious issues about patterns of payment and to whom, about the degree of concentration that there may be and so on. We still have to resolve many issues through consultation. More data need to be collected on this matter. I hope that, by the end of the year, I shall have conveyed adequate information to the House, with appropriate regulations and so on in the spring, so that this can take effect shortly thereafter. I can assure the Committee that as soon as I have more precise information I shall certainly put it before the House. At the moment I regret that I cannot go beyond that.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>On another point mentioned by the noble Lord, a number of government amendments will come through in Committee stage and in all cases I shall do my best to ensure that Members have adequate information in good time so that they can seek external advice if they wish. To the best of my knowledge, only one substantive bundle of amendments, or possibly one amendment&#151;I do not know how many there will be&#151;will come forward <i>de novo</i> on Report. We had hoped to do that at Committee stage. That concerns the survivors&#039; benefit or the widows&#039; benefit and what the rate would be in the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The reason for withdrawing it for reconsideration is because of the read across to the Civil Partnership Bill. Civil partners must be treated in the same way as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

spouses. When we started work on this Bill, we did not consider that. That is one item that I shall have to bring forward on Report and which I am sure will be good news to everyone. Apart from that, my best advice is that all the substantive items will have been explored in Committee with your Lordships&#039; help.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has been pressing me about the state of the regulations associated with this matter. Again, I am not able, as I had hoped to be, to bring any or a few to your Lordships&#039; House before the Bill completes its passage through the House. My latest information is that there are likely to be at least 100 sets of statutory instruments on which officials have been working over the summer. As and when I can bring your Lordships information about that, I shall be happy to do so.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Finally, on the moral hazard point, I shall check on the position of the turnaround professionals. If they have been overlooked I shall ensure that discussions include them. I shall seek to bring details to the Committee, certainly on issues such as whether the current scheme is a constructed one, as opposed to an informal telephone call. I think we are making very good headway on that and it seems to be moving in the right direction. I thank your Lordships for your contributions on that. I believe that we have made more progress on that issue. All parties, including the officials, are to be congratulated on that.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Those were the broad remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. He then turned to Clause 126 and asked why we needed directions during the assessment period. Perhaps I can explain. Clause 126 enables the Bill to issue directions to scheme trustees or managers or other relevant persons during the assessment period. The assessment period is designed precisely to find out and to obtain the valuation of the balance between protected liabilities and assets, and so on, on matters relating to the investment of the scheme&#039;s assets, the incurring of expenditure, the instigation or conduct of legal proceedings and any other matters prescribed in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>It is important that the board is able to monitor the activities of scheme trustees and managers at that critical stage and to ensure that they are consistent with the overall aim of achieving the best possible outcome for scheme members.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Moreover, in order to protect the funding position of the PPF, and thus the burden on levy payers, the board must aim to ensure that, where a scheme&#039;s assets exceed its liabilities, that position is maintained&#151;in other words, that manipulation, whether in good faith or in less than good faith, does not occur&#151;or if the liabilities exceed the assets, that any excess is kept to a minimum.
</p>

<a name="40907-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Therefore, Clause 126 gives the board the power to revoke or vary any decision made by any relevant person&#151;for example, the trustees or managers or the sponsoring employer&#151;if the need should arise. That is the purpose of the clause and I hope your Lordships will agree that it should stand part of the Bill.

<a name="40907-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. Perhaps I may respond briefly. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I say again that there is a very strong rumour that the Bill is, or may be, dropped in favour of a hunting Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness can make it absolutely clear that that is not the case.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Her remarks about amendments at the Report stage are certainly very welcome. But I find her remarks on the financial assistance scheme extremely worrying. She is saying, &quot;Well, perhaps we may know where we are by Christmas or November or whatever&quot;. That means that we shall let the clause go through in its present state with the whole process being carried out effectively by statutory instrument. The noble Baroness outlined many things about which the Government have still not made up their mind and that means that this House will not be able to amend any of the decisions which the Government take. In those circumstances, we can return to the matter when we reach Clause 274. However, I begin to wonder seriously whether it should be in a separate Bill which can be properly debated; otherwise, the whole matter will be a total blank cheque and that is very worrying.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I shall not pursue the matter further now. But I think that the situation that the noble Baroness outlined with regard to the lack of decisions being taken and the present inability to provide any information within the timescale envisaged in the Bill raises very serious questions and we shall need to return to that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   On the subject of the financial assistance scheme, which I also raised, were the noble Baroness back in her role as a student rather than a university lecturer, I should award her an alpha for her prescription of the problem and a delta for progress or action in dealing with it. I share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins: we really must have more facts and more information before the Bill goes through.

<a name="40907-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Clause 126, as amended, agreed to.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Clause 127 [<i>Restrictions on winding up, discharge of liabilities etc</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale </b>   moved Amendment No. 195:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>Page 87, line 24, leave out from &quot;up&quot; to end of line 25. </p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>The noble Lord said: The last words that the Minister uttered were that the two are connected. In this case, the three are connected because one has to look forward in order to understand Clauses 127 to 210, the last subsection of which states firmly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;This section is to be read subject to section 127 (which restricts the winding up of an eligible scheme during an assessment period)&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>which, indeed, it does.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>But there is great confusion in my mind because this whole section of the Bill&#151;not the later clauses to which I have just referred but this whole part of the Bill&#151;refers to the activities of the board. As I view the Bill, the winding up of an eligible scheme is normally the prerogative of the board. However, subsection (3) states that that prerogative can be overridden by the regulator in certain circumstances&#151;not least under Section 11(3A) of the Pensions Act 1995. It seems to me that if my interpretation is correct, that is a recipe <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for endless rows and possibly ultimate disasters. Why should these two distinct bodies operate what is basically the same scheme? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I may be able to help the noble Lord by setting what we are trying to do in context.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would remove a reference to Clause 210&#151;the backdating of winding-up&#151;from Clause 127(3). That would remove some essential clarity from an otherwise complicated section of the Bill. Clause 127 restricts the winding-up of pension schemes and the discharging of liabilities during the assessment period because, for example, otherwise trustees could make decisions that might not necessarily be in the best interests of all members. Subsection (3) states that this restriction does not apply when a winding-up order is made by the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Regulator under section 11(3A) of the Pensions Act 1995&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>when an order is made by the regulator to the trustees to wind up the scheme even though the scheme is in the assessment period, and at that point the trustees must comply.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>At the end of the subsection, reference is made to Clause 210. Clause 210 provides that when such a winding-up order is given by the regulator, the winding-up must be backdated to the time immediately before the start of the assessment period. That means that the winding-up must be implemented as if the order had been given immediately before the assessment period. The winding-up order is backdated to ensure that the level of benefits that members receive after wind-up are in line with the winding-up provisions on scheme rules and not the PPF level of benefits, which ensures a higher level of benefits for members than would otherwise be the case.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>In summary, the reference to Clause 210 in Clause 127(3) helps to clarify that when an order to wind up a scheme is made during the assessment period, the winding-up must be implemented as if the order had been made prior to the start of the assessment period&#151;as if it were outside the assessment period. I hope that that explains why the provision is needed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   Not quite. I should have thought that it would be quite obvious to the Minister that the wording of the amendment was a hook on which to hang my question. The Minister has not answered my question, which is, &quot;What is the logic of having two bodies independently operating&#151;one able to over-ride the actions of another&#151;these windings up, or whatever the plural is?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   First, I am confident that things would not happen in that way. Such a situation would occur only when the Pensions Regulator and the PPF are in complete accord. As it stands, no winding-up notice can take place during the assessment period, but occasionally it may be in the interests of scheme members for that winding-up to occur. For example, when there is some issue of crystallising debt, a winding-up scheme may enable the debt owed from the employer to be recovered earlier <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC137</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by the PPF. When it is in the interests of members, the Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund can agree that there should be an intervention that should not wait until the end of the assessment period but should occur during the 12 months or so that the assessment period is running.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>For the most part, it would be best for the winding-up to await the determination of the assessment period, but there may be an occasion when, for example, there may be concerns that, given the issues of debt, creditors and so forth, it is sensible to have an earlier rather than a later winding-up. The provision allows that to take place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I am sorry, but that still does not help. Since the board started this process, why cannot the board re-determine it, if it feels it is necessary? Why does the regulator have to come into the equation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40907-30_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The PPF does not have the power to give winding-up orders until the assessment period is completed. In other words, the winding-up powers of the PPF kick in after the assessment period, which will run for up to a year. The Pensions Regulator&#039;s powers run up to the point at which the powers of the PPF take over. It is simply a question of timing and which body has the power. However, the power will be exercised only after close consultation and I suspect that there will be no dispute. One could, I suppose, reconstruct the Bill so that the powers of the Pension Protection Fund were brought back to the beginning of the assessment period, but one would then have to rewrite what we mean by the assessment period. It is simply a perfectly sensible division of labour, given the way that the clock ticks over the assessment period. I do not envisage any problem at all.

<a name="40907-30_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   The noble Baroness, not unusually, gives the impression that I am making a bit of a mountain out of a molehill.

<p><a name="st_22"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 195A I shall speak also to the amendments grouped with it. This group of government amendments provides specific compensation for members who have been a scheme member for only a very short period; who have rights that have accrued under the scheme but would not be entitled to full benefits. These benefits will be payable to a member who stays in the scheme until normal pension age and are known as long service benefits.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>A new paragraph 19A, which will be introduced later in Committee, has been inserted into Schedule 7. It applies to members whose pensionable service terminates on commencement of the assessment period and who do not have a right under Chapter 5 of Part 4 of the Pension Schemes Act (protection for early leavers) or rights under the scheme which give them the same level of benefits as those who stay until the scheme&#039;s normal pension age. In these cases, if a member has a right under the admissible rules to either, or a choice of, a transfer payment or refund of their contributions, then compensation will be payable at a level of 90 per cent of the transfer payment sum or refund of contributions, whichever is the greater. In other words, we are protecting those who may not have been in the scheme for two years or more.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>New paragraph 30A of Schedule 7 provides that where a member&#039;s pensionable service is terminated on the commencement of the assessment period and, as a result, the member has a right to elect a cash transfer sum or contribution refund under Chapter 5 of Part 4 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, then the member will receive compensation in the same way as other active members of the scheme as if they had rights to long service benefit. Regulations will enable modifications to Schedule 7 to ensure that the member is not entitled to double compensation in respect of the same rights under the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Amendment No. 234AJA will be formally introduced later in Committee and provides regulations under subsection (2C) of Clause 157 to provide which liabilities of the trustees the board are to discharge; that is, the liabilities that would have existed but for the discharge under Clause 152. The regulations will include provision for the trustees to discharge their liability in relation to a refund of contributions or transfer payment sum in respect of a member, where the right arose before commencement of the assessment period.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Amendment No. 199D provides that where a scheme is being wound up then the benefits payable during the assessment period should not be the reduced level payable on winding up but the full scheme benefits capped at the PPF level of compensation.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Amendment No. 195A amends Clause 12, which is headed &quot;Restrictions on winding up, discharge of liabilities etc&quot;, to provide that discharges of liabilities can occur during the assessment period in prescribed circumstances and subject to prescribed conditions; for example, payment of a contribution refund where the right arose before commencement of the assessment period.
</p>

<a name="40907-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Amendment No. 199E provides a recognition that it may not be practicable to expect trustees to be able to reduce benefits paid to PPF levels immediately and that there will, therefore, be some risk of overpayment. In these circumstances we are concerned that scheme rules may not always provide trustees with the power to recover overpayments and this amendment ensures the trustees will have this power.

<a name="40907-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   It is difficult to work out precisely what this group of amendments is doing, except for the Minister&#039;s very clear statement that it is to prevent anyone being treated unfairly. We can all agree to that and we must hope that the amendments achieve the objective. However, this group of amendments, if I have understood it correctly, seems to deal with a very small percentage of people. Am I right in thinking that it is only those who either join or leave in the assessment period?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40907-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I realise that this is very technical. It is perhaps my fault that I did not circulate the briefing on it in advance, as that may have been helpful to noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Perhaps I can give an example of where rights arose before the assessment period. The member has worked for six months but leaves employment two weeks before the assessment period begins. The member will eventually have a Chapter 5 right to either a contribution refund or a cash transfer sum. In other words, if he has worked there for only six months, only a modest sum will be involved. It does not usually make sense to try to turn such people into a full-scale deferred pensioner.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Although the member has elected his right to a cash transfer sum, the trustees have not completed the work before the assessment period began. The trustees will be able to discharge their liability during the assessment period in respect of the member&#039;s right to a cash transfer sum through regulations to be made under Clause 127 allowing that to be protected. If the trustees are unable to complete this discharge before the board of the PPF assumes responsibility for the scheme, then regulations made under Clause 157(2C) will allow the board to pay the cash transfer sum instead.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>That is the sort of situation we are talking about. I could give the Committee other examples and would be happy to do so if noble Lords wished to press me on Report. I realise that the subject is semi-technical and I am speaking to many amendments at once. I shall try to ensure in future that such information is circulated in advance. However, that is the intent of the provision. Where people do not have vested rights but the assessment period cuts across the trustees&#039; ability to address non-vested rights, the board will have that ability. That is why the provision is entirely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

benevolent. Otherwise, those with modest sums who effectively became deferred pensioners would not gain deferred rights but lose out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40907-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Generally speaking, the noble Baroness has been very kind in letting us see in advance the arguments that the Government may address in particular groups of government amendments. Therefore, we need discovery of the points she has covered this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>What worries me more and more about all of this is the position of the poor trustees in moving from their normal role and responsibilities to a situation where all their responsibilities are eventually taken from them. They will have to understand in the mean time the types of points that the noble Baroness made about an individual who happens to join on one side or another of a deadline. Having long been the chairman of trustees of a pension fund, I must say that the idea that they will be aware of all that, or that steps will be taken adequately to inform them during the assessment period, is worrying.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>If we are going to go through all of this, it has to be very clear that the board will have to tell the trustees what their responsibilities are. It is going to be a nightmare. Some boards of trustees are extremely confident and expert, but very often there are boards of trustees where some members are not the least bit clear about what their liabilities would be if they got it wrong. I hope that that can be taken into account when the provision comes into effect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40907-31_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I think that that is entirely right. This is only one of several instances where an almost parallel authority will run simultaneously between trustees and the board during the assessment period. The noble Lord is right that that will inevitably be complex. Guidance will be given to trustees when a scheme enters the assessment period. So we will be taking belt-and-braces action to ensure that trustees know where their responsibilities begin and end and what the PPF&#039;s proper purview is.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>On the substance of the noble Lord&#039;s point, we are talking about those who usually have less than two years&#039; service and are therefore not vested. He is absolutely right to suggest that it will be a small number. We are just anxious to ensure that, by going into the assessment period, there is no risk that those people will lose their money due to an ambiguity or a gap between the trustees&#039; responsibility ending and the PPF taking over. As I said, the provision is entirely benevolent. Basically, we are protecting small savers.

<p><a name="st_29"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 195C, I shall speak also to the other amendments grouped with it. I believe that I have circulated to the Committee, in advance, an extended speaking note of what each amendment does so that your Lordships are not in the same position as regards the previous set of amendments. I shall make a shortened introduction and any Member of the Committee will be free to raise points on any of the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>These amendments effectively do two things. They enable some additional liabilities to transfer to the board when it assumes responsibility for a scheme and they provide a regulation-making power to modify contracts of insurance in certain circumstances. Let me explain those in turn.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>First, Clause 152 provides for all the property, rights and liabilities of the scheme to transfer to the board once the board issues a transfer notice and assumes responsibility for a scheme. The trustees or managers of the scheme are then discharged from their pension obligations and the board is required to pay compensation on an ongoing basis.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>As the Bill currently stands, subsection (3) of this clause provides that the liabilities transferred to the board do not include any liability to, or in respect of, any member of the scheme, other than liabilities in respect of money purchase benefits. These amendments change the subsection to enable the liabilities in respect of a member, which can transfer to the board, to include other liabilities as may be prescribed. It is intended to use this power to ensure that those liabilities in respect of members, such as a contract of insurance (to which we shall come later) or a contributions equivalent premium&#151;as your Lordships know, that is the repayment of NI rebates&#151;can and will transfer to the board.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Let me now explain the second part of these amendments&#151;the power to modify certain insurance contracts. Trustees may take out insurance contracts to discharge their liabilities in respect of a particular scheme member&#039;s entitlements to a pension or other benefit. In some cases, trustees may have done that without discharging their liabilities. For example, the insurance company pays them a set sum and they then pass that on to the member, as opposed to the sum coming directly from the insurance company to the member. The amendments ensure that such contracts will transfer to the board.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>However, there could be an additional problem if the contracts contain provisions which impose a duty on the trustee&#151;now the board&#151;to pay a particular amount to a particular member. Although in most cases we expect that the specified amount will be less than the amount the member will receive under PPF compensation, that may not always be the case. We are concerned that the board may be required to pay an individual more than his or her compensation entitlement. To prevent that occurring, the <br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments provide for regulations to modify such contracts of insurance. However, that will be only in very limited circumstances where the contracts cannot be surrendered or where the surrender value is lower than the liabilities protected and the &quot;specified amount&quot; is greater than the PPF level of compensation to which the member may be entitled. That is to ensure equity within the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I believe it is extremely important that we enable the transfer of liabilities to occur as smoothly as possible when the board assumes responsibility for a scheme. For that reason, I urge the Committee to accept these government amendments.

<a name="40907-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Is the noble Baroness saying that the clause, once amended by these amendments, may create a situation where a particular individual receives less than he would if the insurance company had paid in the normal way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   There could be a situation in which the individual could receive either less or more outside the PPF than he would receive if he went into the PPF. We are trying to ensure that he will receive the same level of PPF compensation.

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   That would mean that an individual would have an arrangement whereby an insurance policy was taken out and he would receive certain benefits, but if it so happened that the scheme became an eligible scheme in the assessment period, he might receive less. This amendment achieves that. In that case, I believe it is somewhat objectionable.

</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As I understand it, there are relatively few insurance contracts: most people come within the ordinary scheme. Some employees may have an insurance contract because the benefits are extremely expensive and an insurance contract has been taken out to protect them. If the scheme as a whole came into the PPF, existing pensioners would have 100 per cent of their benefits protected through compensation. Others would have 90 per cent protected. It would be unreasonable for some people, because they had a special arrangement through an insurance contract, to be able to come into the PPF and for the PPF to be expected to honour compensation. Had those people been within the ordinary range of members, they would be receiving 90 per cent, but they would now get 100 per cent or even more. That is why we are ensuring that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compensation scheme treats all people in the same way. There is therefore a power to override the insurance contract in such situations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   The compensation scheme overrides the existing arrangement, which has nothing to do with the fact that it has gone into the control of the PPF. I understand what the Minister is saying&#151;I think&#151;and no doubt other Committee Members also do, but it is slightly worrying. To restate the case, as I understand it, there is a scheme that insures a particular individual&#039;s rights. That is a direct arrangement through the scheme for paying out benefits for which an insurance premium has been paid. The Minister is saying that once one is into the clutches of the board everyone must be treated equally, even though some have made that particular arrangement. In such circumstances, I am not sure who gains, although I am clear who loses. The insurance benefit goes into the general pool. That is an extraordinarily odd arrangement and we shall need to think about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The arrangement is with the scheme and not the individual. We are seeking to ensure that everyone is treated in the same way, regardless of how the trustees have arranged for them to be paid. In a DB scheme, the trustees may have decided that the majority of members of that scheme can expect to receive their pension through the normal pattern of payment. However, they may have decided that some members should lay off the liability through an insurance contract, which would still come out of the scheme assets that the trustees are handling. If the scheme then goes over into the PPF, it would be unreasonable in all fairness artificially to continue to protect what may well be rates of payment well above the compensation rate to other members of the same scheme for which the trustees are responsible.
</p>

<a name="40907-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>In practice, we expect that the opposite will be the case. In most insurance cases it will not be possible to reach the PPF level of funding. We are trying to ensure that, once the scheme goes into the PPF, however the pension promise was to have been delivered&#151;whether through an insurance contract or not&#151;all the members of the PPF are treated in a similar and equitable way in terms of compensation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Even though they were not party to this particular insurance? Only some of the employees would be insured under the scheme and not the great mass. Therefore, surely it is not worth their while to be insured.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That may or may not be the case. However, we are seeking to ensure that the individuals within a scheme whose pension promise by the scheme has been met in a different way are none the less treated in the same way when they come into the PPF. Otherwise, it would be unfair and the extra cost would have to be picked up either by the pension levy or in some other way.

<a name="40907-32_spnew10"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I believe that the noble Baroness is confusing fairness. In this case, I find her definition of fairness quite hard. I understand well that the aim of the Pension Protection Fund is to protect people whose schemes have fallen into difficulty. However, to treat them fairly means that they should all be treated in the same way. That seems to me to be wrong when not everyone who is in any scheme that goes into the PPF has the same level of pension benefits. In addition, some people in one scheme may have their benefits insured and others may not. On the assumption that those differentials were considered to be fair prior to the scheme falling into difficulty, to eliminate those differentials is not fair, as the noble Baroness suggests, but is patently unfair.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I really disagree with the noble Lord on this matter. I shall give an example. Mr Y has an entitlement&#151;a contract of insurance for &#163;30,000&#151;and Mr Z is also entitled to &#163;30,000 through the normal DB scheme. Under the PPF rules, without this clause Mr Z would come into the PPF and receive only 90 per cent compensation. If we did not have the right to override the contract of insurance, Mr Y would continue to receive the &#163;30,000 protected by the insurance contract. In my view, that would be unfair.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I have a factual question. Is the effect of this overriding of the insurance contract to reduce the amount of money that insurance companies would pay?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not believe so. The trustees have taken out the insurance contract to protect the assets of the scheme. Essentially the contract is an asset of the scheme which should transfer to the board. Once within the board, the payments to individuals are made at the same compensation rate for everyone in that same category.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Effectively there will be no loss of payment by the insurance company into the pension fund. The important point is that we do not want to let the insurance companies off the hook, do we?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40907-32_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Absolutely not. We are trying to ensure that two people, who expect the same outcome, come into the scheme where both are exposed to a 90 per cent compensation rate. We do not want one of them to be protected artificially at 100 per cent when the other is protected at 90 per cent simply by virtue of the way the matter is laid off.

<a name="40907-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>We already know that because it is there in black and white in Clause 22, which we discussed a couple of months ago and to which we may return in a month&#039;s time. Why on earth is it necessary to repeat it? After all, if one is on the staff of the regulator or one is the regulator himself, one would expect to find one&#039;s powers and duties encapsulated in the provisions relating to the regulator rather than in those relating to the board. Indeed, to be perfectly fair to the draftsman, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<a name="40907-33_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I have felt in the last short while that we have been discussing a range of amendments in this part that there is a certain difficulty about the assessment period. When the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked questions about it earlier, I wondered precisely what the assessment period was and how long it lasted. I raise this point in order to obtain further clarity from the Minister.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>My understanding is that, during the period and before a transfer notice is given under Clause 151 transferring responsibility for the scheme to the Pension Protection Fund board, both the regulator and the board&#151;somewhat inconveniently perhaps&#151;have certain roles. There is an overlap of roles. For example, as we know from Clause 127(3), the regulator may make a winding-up order during the assessment period. However, I am not surprised at Clause 127(7), which we are debating now, because during the assessment period one has a similar impact as a freezing order by virtue of Clause 125(5), which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;No benefits may accrue under the scheme to, or in respect of, members of the scheme during the assessment period&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>That is more or less exactly what is said in relation to a freezing order under Clause 20 and there are various other similarities.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, quite correctly said that the point is made in Clause 20 that no freezing order may be made in relation to a scheme during an assessment period. If we have that in Clause 20, why also have it here? Normally, I would agree with that type of point because the Bill is long enough as it is without mentioning things twice. However, on the other hand, given that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and myself are unlikely to be the only people to be confused about who does what and who has what role during the assessment period, I am not worried if something is mentioned in subsection (7) that repeats something mentioned earlier if it adds to the clarity of what is and is not allowable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="40907-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. The short answer is that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is correct. In a sense, this provision repeats what has already been established. In the past, your Lordships have often urged me to extend clarity to the Bill by adding other words. If Committee Members think that this provision is redundant, I shall re-examine the matter. However, it makes clear the differing functions of the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund board.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I shall take my response from Committee Members, but it may be worth describing the difference between a freezing order under the regulator and an assessment period under the board. The effect of a freezing order during this time is like pressing the pause button on the video recorder. During this time, a scheme will not be able to wind up unless the regulator itself makes a winding-up order and no further benefits will accrue in respect of members. That is the crucial element of a freezing order.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>In addition, and when the regulator deems it appropriate in the particular case, a freezing order may also determine that no transfers are allowed in or out of the scheme; no more contributions can be paid in; no other payments in may be made; no members can be admitted to the scheme; benefits are reduced to no less than the level payable if the scheme had commenced winding up; and/or the trustees or managers are compelled to obtain an actuarial valuation which will include an assessment of the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>My noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, are exactly right that the assessment period has almost the same effect on the scheme as the freezing period. The freezing period allows the regulator to ensure that any situation does not worsen and to see whether a scheme needs to go through to the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>During the assessment period, a scheme will not be able to be wound up unless, as we saw in relation to the previous amendment, the regulator itself makes a winding-up order and no further benefits will accrue in respect of members. No transfers are allowed in or out of the scheme, no contributions can be paid in, no other payments can be made and no members can be admitted. Benefits are reduced to the level payable as if the PPF board had assumed responsibility for the scheme, and the auditor is compelled to obtain an actuarial valuation, which will include an assessment of the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>In essence, the assessment period is a freezing period but it is imposed by the involvement of the board with an eligible scheme on the occurrence of a qualifying insolvency event in relation to the sponsoring employer of the scheme and not by the regulator. For that reason, I do not believe it could add any benefit for the regulator to be able to issue a freezing order during an assessment period or, indeed, as the noble Lord made clear, to remove these words. I think that it is helpful to keep them in. I do not feel very strongly about the matter but it seems to me that it is probably wiser to keep the words and to make it clear that the two schemes, although parallel in their powers, will probably be distinct in terms of the times at which they are introduced and implemented&#151;one by the regulator; the next by the board. With that, I hope that the noble Lord will not wish to press the amendment.

<a name="40907-33_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am grateful for that introduction because I was mystified by the amendment. As the Bill currently stands, Clause 127 restricts trustees from winding up a scheme during the assessment period. That is why it is a matter for the PPF and not the regulator. Clause 128&#151;the clause addressed by the amendment&#151;provides for the PPF board to validate any actions of trustees in contravention of Clause 127 only in circumstances where it is satisfied that to allow the winding up of the scheme during the assessment period would be consistent with the objective of ensuring that the scheme&#039;s protected liabilities do not exceed its assets and so on.
</p>

<a name="40907-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Therefore, Clause 127 restricts the trustees. Under Clause 128, if the trustees none the less contravene Clause 127, that can be validated by the board if the board judges that it is in the best interests of the members. It is the board in this case because it is in the assessment period as opposed to a freezing period or pre-assessment period. I hope that that clarifies the situation.

is very clear. Once something enters into an assessment period, it is the responsibility of the board, not the regulator. Clause 128 gives a power to the board to validate an action that, without the power, would be illegal given Clause 127. It may be in the best interests of the scheme that the trustees be supported in that action. That is what the provision is about; I am a little puzzled that the noble Lord thinks that it could apply back to the regulator, but I will have a re-read on that and see whether his apprehensions are well founded.

<a name="40907-34_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I beg the Committee&#039;s indulgence to make some comment on the amendment. Like my noble friend Lord Higgins, I find that the Bill is becoming increasingly complicated and difficult to read. Has the noble Baroness wondered whether it might not be easier to exclude references to money purchase benefits by making it clear that such benefits do not apply in many parts of the Bill, rather than repeatedly excluding them time and again, which makes the Bill terribly difficult to read? So much of what one comes to is simply repetition.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I ask the Committee&#039;s forgiveness for my being pedantic but, in that connection, I notice that an attempt has been made to change benefits &quot;under the scheme&quot; to &quot;under the scheme rules&quot; throughout the Bill. I have thought about that, and think that benefits derive from the scheme itself rather than from its rules, which are simply a method whereby it operates. If we are to have &quot;under the scheme rules&quot; throughout, perhaps we should be consistent; &quot;rules&quot; is clearly missing from the fourth line of Amendment No. 195G, which we have already debated.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40907-34_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   We had a debate during a previous Committee sitting&#151;I shudder to think which one it was&#151;on the difference between rules of a scheme and scheme rules. The rules of the scheme are the rules of the particular scheme, but scheme rules are the rules of the particular scheme as modified by the overriding social security legislation&#151;the WRP Act and all the rest of it. I shall check to see whether the noble Viscount is correct in his assertion, but it is quite appropriate that on some occasions the Bill refers to rules of a scheme and on other occasions to scheme rules. I too wish that we had sharper descriptive language so that the ambiguity could be resolved, but that is the reason for it.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para2"></a>

I suspect&#151;I shall have to take advice on it&#151;that we would have to refer to the matter being understood in the content of Clause x(y)(z). I doubt whether it is clearer to have two items and four cross-references, as opposed to six items, but my hunch is that if we were to follow the noble Viscount&#039;s suggestion we would multiply the cross-references and reduce the shopping list.

<a name="40907-34_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 199:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>Page 89, line 4, leave out paragraph (b).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>The noble Lord said: We move on to Clause 129. I have become aware that many leading players in the world of accountancy are concerned about a lack of a clear procedure in the Bill for binding the board of the Pension Protection Fund clearly and explicitly into a collective creditor procedure. On that basis, I feel strongly that the clause needs to be strengthened and clarified.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The fact that the PPF board is not bound into   company voluntary arrangements&#151;CVAs&#151;or Section 425 schemes of arrangement was referred to in a previous debate, as the Minister may recall. The concern on the point is that it in effect gives the PPF board a form of super-priority over other creditors. That would mean that it would be able to negotiate its own terms&#151;terms that might be very much better than those available to other, unsecured creditors. In fact, it would be able to hold other creditors and the insolvency practitioner involved to ransom.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>In turn, that detracts from the established principle in insolvency of equal treatment of creditors in the same class, and is likely to influence exit routes towards liquidation, in which the PPF board of course does not have a priority. I am troubled that that again appears to be an instance of where the Bill is in direct conflict with the Government&#039;s stated aim of encouraging enterprise and the rescue of viable businesses in trouble.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The noble Baroness may remember, although it was the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, who took the then Bill through, that to that end the Enterprise Act, among other things, abolished the Crown preference in insolvencies. That was a balancing exercise, but it was seen as a step in the right direction. It improved returns to unsecured creditors. However, an apparent super-priority of the PPF board would establish the Crown preference in another form, which would ultimately be to the detriment of unsecured creditors.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The amendment would delete, on page 89, subsection (6)(b), which concentrates on arrangements that have effect under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985. I am sure that the Committee will recall Section 425, which gives a company power to compromise with creditors and members. It provides for a company to enter into an arrangement with its creditors or any class of creditors. The compromise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

has to be agreed by creditors representing three-quarters in value of the debt, and is then sanctioned by the court. We are not dealing with some <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, but with a scheme of arrangement that has to be approved and sanctioned by the court. The company does not have to be insolvent to enter into a Section 425 scheme of arrangement, of course.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>If the board is unhappy with a proposed arrangement, which may well be in the minds of those who drafted the clause, it would have the opportunity to oppose it and have its views heard in court. The amendment should maintain the viability of Section 425 schemes and give the PPF board a full opportunity to have its views considered. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40907-34_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The issue is difficult; a lot of the issues that we are discussing are, but there is a genuine and honourable dilemma on this matter. I shall set the background. Amendment No. 199 seeks to remove the provision for the board not to be bound by any terms of a scheme of arrangement as defined, as the noble Lord said, by Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 previously entered into by the trustees or managers of a scheme where that scheme compromises a claim for the contingent debt owed to the pension scheme&#151;in other words, to which the PPF is not a party. That is why I say that we have a genuine and honourable dilemma.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>This area of the Bill is designed to protect the PPF from being duty bound to take on increasing liabilities with a reduced claim against the assets of the employer. If the employer enters into a scheme of arrangement&#151;commonly called a compromise agreement&#151;during the assessment period which results in the rescue of the employer, that would end the assessment period and the PPF involvement with the scheme, as there is now a solvent sponsoring employer and a scheme rescue has occurred. If there is a subsequent insolvency event in relation to the sponsoring employer, another assessment period would begin.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>If the scheme compromised the contingent debt to the scheme, the PPF should not be bound by that compromise unless it has consented to it because, first, the compromise agreement may considerably reduce the money which is recoverable from the sponsoring employer, therefore reducing the payment to the PPF if the PPF were to assume responsibility for the scheme. Secondly, if the board were to be bound by any agreement entered into by the trustees of a pension scheme to compromise the contingent debt to the pension scheme before the assessment period begins, that could raise moral hazard issues. For example, the trustees could enter into a scheme of arrangement with the sponsoring employer which would absolve the employer from ever having to pay the full Section 75 debt. The trustees could essentially take any steps necessary to try to keep the sponsoring employer in operation, in the knowledge that the scheme was ultimately protected by the PPF. The Committee can see what depth of issue lies behind that situation.

</p>

<a name="40907-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The dilemma is genuinely honourable, and I am not persuaded that to say that the PPF can revisit the issue by going to the courts, given the cost, the length of time and so on, is a satisfactory way of allowing it to destabilise a compromise arrangement that has been made without it being party to it, and which appears to be at the expense of the assets that come into the PPF or increases the liabilities that come into it. That said, we are aware that&#151;thanks to the efforts of the noble Lord, I think&#151;the Institute of Accountants in England and Wales has raised concerns about the approach; he echoed them today. We are involved in discussions with it, the DTI and the Insolvency Service.
</p>

<a name="40907-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Further, we would like to complete our consultations after our initial discussions, because we may well need to return on Report with an amendment. I do not yet know whether that would be one along the lines suggested by the noble Lord or some alternative. I agree that this is not the last word on the issue. In the light of our consultations, it is clear that we need to go further. I suspect that we will come back with an amendment, and I shall try to make sure that the noble Lord and others are given plenty of notice about what that might look like, to see whether it meets his concerns. I hope that he will recognise where we are coming from as a department, which is to ensure that&#151;if I can put it crudely&#151;the PPF does not end up being stitched up. We do not wish to see that happen. I hope that the way I have suggested that we go forward in seeking to balance perfectly honourable but possible conflicting responsibilities and obligations may be a way to progress the issue.

In the context of the Bill and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

public interest purposes of the Bill and the Pension Protection Fund, why should the fund be treated as if it were just one other creditor?
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="40907-35_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right that the provision allows the board completely to scrap the scheme of arrangement. So the answer is yes, it would have more power than the trustees. One of the problems may have been that the trustees were dominated by the employers&#039; representatives and so on and they produced a compromise that perhaps secured other company debts at the expense of the fund. However, we believe that they would and could do that only very rarely.

</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="40907-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I have listened very carefully to the points that have been made. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that he could make an even better case for Crown preference, the point about public money and why should the public be deprived and other creditors given an advantage. But his feet are firmly rooted in the pre-Enterprise Act environment, in relation to which, as a result of a government move that found support on all sides of the House, it was decided to abolish Crown preference. As the noble Lord knows exceedingly well in view of all the public offices he has held, particularly Director-General of Fair Trading, Crown preference has always been right at the bedrock of insolvency.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The Government, however, took what I thought was a very courageous step. As a result of Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, having been impressed by the American system, it was said that Crown and public money should not step in to reduce the rights of unsecured creditors and thereby perhaps jeopardise the survival of a potentially viable business. It has been implicit in a number of our debates that we have to find a way through this Pensions Bill that does not destroy jobs. I know that the trade union movement is very concerned that jobs are at risk if the Bill&#039;s retrospective elements mean that potentially viable businesses do not survive.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>So it is not just a case of looking at Crown preference in its justification and it is not just a case of looking at the rights of the PPF. There is a case for looking at the whole realm of businesses in trouble and finding a way through that is consistent with the Enterprise Act.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, mentioned a shade of grey. I thought that the Minister&#039;s shade of grey could only have been from a speaking note that was not cleared with her colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry. I have heard her colleagues in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that department argue forcibly for removing this sort of preference. I therefore hope that she will give the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, the time of day, sit down with him and hear from him why he embarked on the route that he did. That Act is now on the statute book. It is being imperilled by this and other clauses.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>It really is time for the Government to have a new look at how the Bill jeopardises jobs and to sit down with a number of interest groups which are very concerned about this issue. This is all part of what I hope will be a continuing dialogue within the Government that will result in a joined-up policy, so that at least we know where we are, particularly in relation to enterprise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="40907-35_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   There are two points. First, the noble Lord refers to the provision somehow being Crown preference. The PPF is funded by either members&#039; assets or a levy on industry. The money is not Crown money but industry money. I am not persuaded of an argument that basically says that other businesses, through their levy, should pick up the bill for employers to be able to forego some of their responsibility to their pension fund in order to meet other debts. I am not saying that there is right or wrong in this&#151;there is an honourable dilemma between the jobs, the viability of the company, the rescue efforts and sustaining the pension funds&#151;but there is no free money.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Let us take an example. The trustees may know that the scheme is sufficiently underfunded to go into the PPF. There is therefore no incentive to keep it afloat. They might just as well run it down and send the money across&#151;particularly if the employees were represented by the trustees&#151;deal with other debts and instead of allowing the PPF to pick up a deficit or shortfall of 25 per cent to pick up one of 75 per cent. Who is that 75 per cent to be made good by? It is not by the Crown or the by taxpayer but by levy payers and others in the industry.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The worry that has been expressed to me by some of the major financial players in the industry is that, if we are not careful, good companies will be cross-subsidising bad. At the end of the line, that seems to be where the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, would take us.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>My second point is that the noble Lord talked about preference. Although it is clear that the PPF would have more powers than a trustee, it will not have a higher priority; the assets would still be shared equally between all creditors. We are trying to prevent the PPF being excluded from the compromise because it has come late into the game. It would have equal status with other creditors and a compromise would have to be satisfactorily reached. The option of subsequently unstitching matters through court procedures is, of course, available, but it would be lengthy.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>As I say, we have not come to the last word on the matter. However, I do not want it thought that we are somehow reneging on a commitment to overcome Crown guarantees, preference, liability or immunity from prosecution in all areas. We are not. A shortfall has to be made good by someone and it is not always clear that the noble Lord&#039;s position is the equitable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one. I hope that we will come back to the matter on Report as we may be able to find a better way of squaring this rather complicated and wobbly circle.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="40907-35_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I hear what the Minister says. I did not evoke a direct comparison with Crown preference; I merely said that she and the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, could make a stronger case for Crown preference, as Ministers have successively done over a range of Bills. We have a real prospect that viable businesses in trouble will lose their fight for survival. That means jobs being destroyed. I take the point that we have to talk the matter through to get the balance right and that good businesses may support bad businesses.
</p>

<a name="40907-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Perhaps the issue reflects on our court system; perhaps we need a super-highway for such applications. Where an arrangement has already been entered into, surely recourse to the court is all that is necessary in the kind of case referred to by the noble Baroness. That is why I hope that she will spend a little time looking at the policy words of the DTI and try to reconcile the difficult balance. I accept that there are shades of grey and of right and wrong, but we could be destroying jobs. That is why I am particularly concerned about the clause.

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>On Question, amendments agreed to.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 130, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?


<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Clause 130 concerns the payment of benefits in the assessment period. There are one or two points about which I am not quite clear. Subsection (2) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;The benefits payable to or in respect of any member under the scheme during the assessment period must be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that they do not exceed the compensation which would be payable to or in respect of the member in accordance with this Chapter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I am not quite clear who will be paying these benefits at that stage in the assessment period. Will it be the trustees or the board? If it is the trustees, how are they to know what compensation will be payable in respect of the member in the circumstances set out?
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I am somewhat concerned about subsection (3), which relates to civil penalties under Section 10 of the Pensions Act 1995 and applies to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;a trustee or manager who fails to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with subsection (2)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I do not understand how the trustee is to know. In fact, I am not clear why it should be &quot;a trustee or manager&quot;. Perhaps the noble Baroness will also clarify that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   Perhaps I may ask a question in addition to those posed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. It relates to subsection (4) and to those people on benefits who carry on working after retirement age. The Bill refers to the payment of pensions, lump sums and other benefits being postponed but, unlike the equivalent situation under state pension legislation, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there seems to be no provision for those payments to be put somewhere&#151;into a deferred pot, for example&#151;and to be paid at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>As the Bill stands at the moment, a person who continues to work derives no benefit at all. My concern is that this will cut across the steps the Government are trying to take to enable people to continue to work after pension age. I realise that it refers to the assessment period, but it is silent on the matter of benefits being accrued in any way. I should like the noble Baroness to clarify that matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The trustees will pay benefits during the assessment period to pensioners. The payments that the pensioners receive will be exactly the same under the PPF as in the scheme&#151;that is, 100 per cent. There is no particular complexity about that.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>However, if people become deferred members&#151; because, for example, the scheme is in the process of being wound up and so on&#151;the situation will become complex and the PPF will provide technical support to the trustees to deal with those difficult issues. I fully accept that.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>As to those who are due to work after retirement age, the benefits of deferment will be set out in regulations. We hope that they will match those in scheme rules. There should be no deleterious effect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I may have misunderstood an important point. Is the assessment period always followed by the board taking the matter over? If not, what happens if the assessment takes place and it is decided that the scheme is not eligible? Have people been out of pocket in the mean time because they have not received the full amount?
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I still do not understand how the trustees will know what would be payable under the PPF. I am not clear why they should be subject to penalties if they do not know.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The penalties are associated with not taking reasonable steps&#151;in other words, if there has been some inappropriate or bad-faith behaviour, which is not unheard of in the pension world. However, the noble Lord is right about the technical difficulties for trustees. That is why we will be producing technical support to deal with such issues.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Basically, our expectation&#151;if that is the right word&#151;is that, of the schemes that go into the assessment period, some 75 per cent or 85 per cent may end up in the PPF. That is a working assumption. I hope that we are wrong&#151;I hope that more will stay outside the PPF&#151;but that is the assumption we make.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>At the point at which schemes go into the PPF, obviously the level of benefits determined by the priority order will apply. That is 100 per cent for existing pensioners&#151;exactly the same as they currently receive&#151;and 90 per cent for deferred pensioners who are not yet drawing their pensions. If, however, a scheme is among the 10, 15 or 20 per cent that do not go into the PPF, the benefits that have accrued to the working member, but which have not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been paid to him because he is not yet a pensioner, will be wound back to the point before the assessment period. So any theoretical or notional shortfall will be made good and the individual will continue as though the assessment period had never happened in terms of his level of benefits.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40907-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am still not clear about the penalties. What we are saying is that there will be trustees who, instead of paying out the amount of payment to beneficiaries which should have been, might have been or would have been payable under the PPF, pay out the wrong amount&#151;probably more than the PPF would like them to. However, if it is a genuine mistake, to clobber them with civil penalties would be rather worrying.
</p>

<a name="40907-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I am concerned that fewer and fewer people will take on the job of trustee as a result of the Bill. I am seriously concerned about the situation. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, I am not in favour of professional trustees; we need as many volunteers as possible. But they are incurring bigger and bigger risks. They may inadvertently pay out too much in an assessment period&#151;even when they may not end up with the PPF at all&#151;and suddenly find themselves clobbered.

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am not saying that the role of trustees will not be made more complex as a result of these provisions. Part of the problem is that in some cases trustees have not been sufficiently trained and supported in exercising their role. However, in terms of civil penalties, we go back to the debate opened up by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about &quot;knowingly&quot; and &quot;recklessly&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I am not talking about a situation where trustees, in good faith, accidentally make an overpayment which may or may not be recoverable. I am talking about a situation where trustees knowingly and deliberately arrange payment in such a way as to increase the deficit falling on the PPF. We do not believe that that should be allowed to happen, and that is why the civil penalties are attached, otherwise it would be an offence without a punishment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   As my noble friend knows, I am very keen on employee trustees. In fact, I have tabled an amendment&#151;to be debated later&#151;to increase the number of employee trustees. This would mean that people would have to be adequately trained to cope with the situation, which is much more complex. Organisations exist which are concerned with the training of trustees and I know that unions are involved in the process.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>However, a number of us have a real fear that quite well motivated people, and people who would be quite qualified in a general way, may feel reluctant to put themselves forward as trustees because of the complexities of this legislation. One has to be careful about that because it is very important that people who well know their own schemes become trustees. Employee trustees get to know the workings of their own companies and their own schemes and often <br>&nbsp;<br>

become experts in that context. However, they will be very concerned if they feel they could be in difficulty with the complexities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In a way, we are touching on some of the issues on the security difficulties that arose on earlier amendments in regard to the role of trustees and the board during the assessment period. If it will help the Committee, I shall be pleased to circulate a descriptive note of what will happen and the steps to be taken during the assessment period, the degree of trustees&#039; responsibilities and how they taper out, and the overriding powers of the pension protection board. I am very happy to ask officials to circulate a descriptive note of how we expect the assessment period to work and the parallel and ultimate responsibilities of the trustees and the board. I am in the Committee&#039;s hands.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I would welcome that. Could it be written in a simple form outlining the instructions that will be given to trustees of what they should do?
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   Perhaps I may add that it is not only the responsibilities but the flow of information that is important. I work with trustees on a daily basis in a slightly different context. We can support and train trustees as much as we like, but they cannot possibly deal with liabilities which they cannot estimate. The key part of what the noble Baroness has said is not who has responsibility at a particular time but who is in possession of the material information. If that can be included, it would go a long way towards solving some the problems that have been quite rightly raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.

</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   The clause is concerned with reviewable ill-health provisions, as indeed are Clauses 133 and 134. I am somewhat surprised at the complexity of the three pages of the Bill which deal with ill-health provisions during the assessment period. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and several others have been worried about the whole idea of an assessment period. Can the Minister give some indication of how long she envisages these assessment periods will last? A whole chunk of the Bill is concerned with them and the fact that the board needs to review ill-health provisions in the course of the assessment period seems to be legislating in immense detail for something which is of a temporary nature and is never likely to be material so far as the assets of a scheme are concerned. Do we really need this clause and the following two clauses?
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Clause 134 interprets Clauses 132 and 133. The assessment period, it is to be hoped, will not be for very long, and having an ill-health provision which can be dealt with immediately after the assessment period&#151;even taking into account the fact that a decision may be delayed&#151;would seem to be rather sensible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="40907-37_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Clause 132 sets out the provisions relating to reviewable ill-health pensions. My understanding is that between 10 and 20 per cent of early retirements are through ill health. Clearly, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC161"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

given that ill-health pensioners in the PPF receive 100 per cent compensation rather than the 90 per cent compensation for deferred members, we are anxious to ensure that, in the three years or so preceding the scheme coming into the assessment period, ill-health pensions have not been used as a way to appropriate and protect some pensions for some people at the expense of the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>That means that the board has a right to review such pensions to ensure that they are well founded. On the presumption that they are, people will continue to receive their pensions. If the board feels that ill health has been used as a device&#151;and there have been cases of people recovering from Alzheimer&#039;s disease, for which they have been given a pension, and so on&#151;it will consider what to do.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The purpose of the clause is to protect the PPF from potential abuse and inappropriate awards of health pensions, which is the only way in which a scheme member under normal pension age could receive a 100 per cent level of uncapped compensation from the PPF. As I say, a member without an ill-health award would have his 90 per cent compensation capped at &#163;25,000. We think the numbers will be very small. However, we have seen in today&#039;s press the generosity of some of the current pension settlements.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Where there is evidence to suggest that an ill-health pension awarded in the couple of years preceding the scheme going into the assessment period&#151;which allows a person to retire with not only a 100 per cent pension but an uncapped pension&#151;is ill-founded, we believe that the board, having reviewed the situation, should have the power to revoke and reconsider the matter.
</p>

<a name="40907-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>As the Committee knows, the three-year rule is designed to prevent any manipulation of a scheme, either between DB and DC schemes or ill-health pensions, in the years preceding the insolvency event, where the directors and trustees are likely to know that a company scheme is at risk and may seek to take protective action by going for an ill-health pension under pensionable age to attract its more favourable terms. The board needs the right to review such pensions to ensure that they have been appropriately awarded. That is the purpose of the clauses.

<a name="40907-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Can the Minister help on the question of how long assessment periods are likely to last?
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="40907-38_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I apologise. This will be a part of the circulating note but, basically, we expect the assessment period to last at least 12 months. Let me run through what we expect to happen in the briefest of terms. The assessment period begins with the occurrence of a qualifying insolvency event. During the assessment period, the board must determine whether a scheme rescue is possible and obtain a valuation in order to determine whether a scheme has sufficient assets to buy out the PPF level of liabilities. Of course, these things can happen in parallel.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The length of time it may take to determine whether a scheme rescue is possible will depend entirely on the circumstances surrounding the solvency of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC162"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

employer. However, the Insolvency Service has advised us that in almost all cases it will take 12 months for the fate of the employer to be known.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Then, before work can continue on valuation, there has to be a data cleansing exercise, data reconciliation with the national insurance scheme and so on, all leading to determining and valuing assets and liabilities. Once the board has approved the valuation and issued it to the regulator and the trustees or managers of the scheme and the employer, we expect and intend that the trustees will forward to individual members a summary of the valuation, in particular where the assets exceed the liabilities and vice versa; whether or not the scheme is likely to be taken into the PPF; and the relevant data about individual members&#039; PPF compensation rate.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The valuation can be challenged not only by the trustees but also by the members. For example, if the valuation indicates that a member has 20 years&#039; rights in the scheme but he believes that he has 25, he can request a review to correct that. So the approved valuation is reviewable. We do not yet know the time period in which a review could be raised&#151;it will be set out in regulations&#151;but we have to allow time for that.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>So given that the Insolvency Service believes that it will take 12 months to establish the insolvency event and scheme rescue, and given that&#151;although it may happen in parallel&#151;there will be quite an elaborate valuation of both assets and liabilities in which we have to establish a right of appeal for individual members, it seems to us that 12 months is the minimum time&#151;it may well be longer&#151;for the assessment period to run for any particular scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I am very happy to include this in the piece of paper I offered to circulate earlier. I am able to do so because I have already seen in my own briefing a version of it. I do not know whether that answers the noble Lord&#039;s question but, when I raised the same question, it persuaded me that 12 months was probably a minimum rather than a maximum time in these circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I have listened carefully to my noble friend the Minister and I am grateful for the assurances that she gave towards the end of her statement. However, I am unhappy about the possibility of reductions in ill-health pensions. In my experience, ill-health pensions are usually awarded after a fairly rigorous medical examination. A fairly rigorous report emerges to the effect that the person concerned has to be awarded a pension because he or she is no longer able to work properly.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para5"></a>

through the PPF review process but can go to the PPF ombudsman. His determination could then be referred to the High Court or the Court of Session in Scotland on a point of law. I do not expect it to happen very often, but it is one of the reasons for the elongated period of assessment. The two-stage appeal process is required by the ECHR.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I shall be surprised if there is more than a tiny number of revocations of ill-health pensions. However, given that what will really bite on some people going into the PPF is not so much the 90 per cent level of compensation but the cap on compensation&#151;particularly for senior, more highly-paid individuals&#151;I can see how attractive it would be for those individuals to arrange an ill-health pension on the grounds of stress and so on.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I believe that the schemes and the PPF need protection. My noble friend is right about people who have left work for what Members of the Committee would call a genuine reason, and there should be no problem for them. But, looking at the situation from a disability benefits point of view, I am well aware that, unfortunately, on occasions, there can be some manipulation. I am not suggesting that this applies to people receiving disability benefits in particular, but the situation can be manipulated and we have to have some protection. Where directors and highly-paid individuals know that a scheme may come into PPF and know that they can organise a more advantageous pension outside it, they might seek to follow that route. All we are doing is providing insurance&#151;a check, if you like&#151;for the PPF to ensure that a pension is valid and appropriate. However, as I have said, for the vast majority there should be no problem whatever.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40907-38_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I share the disquiet of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, about all this. We are not only talking about an assessment period of 12 months&#151;and we are now getting a clearer picture of what that will involve&#151;but apparently it can be retrospective for three years. So a particular pension scheme can decide that various members should retire on ill-health grounds and then, three years later, after they have retired, the scheme runs into trouble and the board states that it will review the situation and that if they do not like it they can go to the High Court or the ombudsman or whatever.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I wonder whether the noble Baroness&#039;s view as to the extent of this is valid. Directors and so on are frequently not in the main scheme anyway. My own experience is that when most pension trustees consider ill-health problems, they set up a committee, which goes into the matter in considerable depth and carries out appropriate examinations and so on. Trustees are as concerned to protect the assets of their funds as the board will be. That is normally carried out, and obviously it depends on one scheme as against another. However, I do not think that there is any great incentive for the trustees to pay out, unless, as the noble Baroness says, they are directors or so on, which I do not think is relevant. I am concerned that people who retired three years ago will suddenly find that <br>&nbsp;<br>

their ill-health pension is reviewed and eventually, presumably, reduced as a result of the Bill, whereas otherwise payment would continue in the normal way and at the rate originally agreed.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I do not like the feel of this provision at all. It feels very odd. I am not at all sure that the provisions in these three clauses are justified.

</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40907-38_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The provision is in the Bill because of the issue of manipulation in the years preceding the scheme possibly going into the assessment period, which was raised by the Conservatives in the other House. Therefore, these clauses are in the Bill partly in response to concerns raised, as I understand it, by the Official Opposition in the other place, that there could be manipulation of the scheme and changes of the rules at the point that insiders knew that the scheme was in trouble, in order to maximise the advantage to individuals. These proposals are therefore in response to the concern raised by the Official Opposition in the other place.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I want to give an assurance that this is not about trying to take pensions away from people who have legitimately retired. We are trying to protect the scheme, the PPF and the levy payers from artificial manipulation of the rules of the scheme in the preceding three years of the scheme&#039;s introduction.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I think the same is true in the States. If changes are made to alter the benefits, increase the liabilities and reduce the assets that come into the PPF and which appear to the board, the Ombudsman, the courts and so on as an artificial manipulation of the situation, the PPF must have some power to protect itself. If it did not have such a power outside organisations paying the levy could rightly be worried that there was a potential for exploitation at their expense.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>However, I have no reason to think that this provision will ever be exercised in any circumstances where the PPF board believes that manipulation has occurred. More to the point, once the knowledge of these arrangements is more widespread&#151;and clearly this is going to occur over the next two to three years&#151;it will actually act as a discouragement to such artificial arrangements being established. I hope that as a result the number of such cases will be reduced.
</p>

<a name="40907-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The reason for using three years is that we think that this is a period when trustees or directors could be aware that the employer may be going bust. Therefore, in the rare cases when they possibly could think about manipulating funds and even abusing the PPF, we seek to protect the levy payers and the PPF on their behalf against such manipulation. It is not so very different in some ways from the issue of the balance on compromising debt. Where ill health is genuine, there should be no problem. If it is not and it is manipulation, then, in response to the concern of the Official Opposition at the other end of the building, <br>&nbsp;<br>

Apparently, we shall now have the PPF board employing people, who are no doubt expert in medical matters, to review the pensions of everyone who took out an ill-health pension in the previous three years whenever a scheme enters into the assessment period. I find the matter very odd. I know not what views my colleagues in another place may have had&#151;although I obviously should. None the less, the whole procedure seems extraordinarily odd.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="40907-39_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord a question. If the PPF was up and running, such powers did not exist and it became clear years down the line&#151;in 2007 or 2008&#151;that an artificial manipulation was going on, and if there was an expos&#233; in the press, the noble Lord might well ask, &quot;Why did we not put a backstop into the Bill?&quot; But that is what we are doing.

The Minister clearly said what the minimum period for assessment will be. It sounded to me as though it might be years and years. I worry that so many companies and pension schemes are going to be in a position of uncertainty and indeed how the PPF will work. Practically, the timescale fills me with foreboding.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="40907-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I have only one or two brief questions on the clause. It refers to cases within subsection (1) of Section 119 and 120, so I am not clear why it appears at this point in the Bill. At all events, the procedure seems to be rather strange. Pension trustees in the normal course of their duties ask for valuations, usually triennially and sometimes more frequently. But they leave that valuation to the actuaries. I am therefore rather puzzled why Clause 135(4) states that the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;regulations may prescribe how&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>(a) the assets and the protected liabilities of eligible schemes, and (b) their amount or value,</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>are to be determined, calculated and verified&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I should have thought that the valuation would take place on the normal basis employed by an actuary. Why will the regulations prescribe the way that it has to be done as regards the board&#039;s obligation? The board is surely in the same position as normal trustees.
</p>

<a name="40907-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I am also a little puzzled by subsection (6). It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;In calculating the amount of any liabilities . . .  a provision of the scheme which limits the amount of its liabilities by reference to the value of its assets is to be disregarded&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40907-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I do not understand what that subsection means. There are further subsections regarding ill-health provisions. I think we have probably gone over that sufficiently to express doubts about it. But it seems to me that if the board wants a valuation, it would simply ask for the actuary to do it in exactly the same way as a normal trustee board would. I am not clear why it does not.

</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40907-40_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Regulations will set out the methodology and key principles relating to the valuation. The detailed assumptions and actual discount rates to be applied were set out in guidance issued by the board. The obvious point is that the valuation will be done by actuaries, but it will be specifically for the purpose of deciding whether a scheme requires PPF assistance. It will compare the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC169</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

assets of the scheme with liabilities assessed on the basis of the PPF level of compensation for the defined benefit members of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>A scheme, for example, might not be sufficient to meet 100 per cent of all its promises, but it might still be able to offer a level of benefit higher than that which an individual would enjoy within the PPF. That would be the kind of consideration that the PPF would wish to know. I am not sure whether we are making unnecessarily heavy weather on this. Obviously, any such guidance will be given as appropriate in consultation with the bodies concerned. But the PPF valuation has a specific function, which is to see how the protected liabilities and assets correlate with the compensation that would be offered by the PPF. I am not really sure why the noble Lord thinks there may be a problem here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40907-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Clearly, the board will need to make assumptions. Any board of trustees, or presumably the PPF board, will have to make certain assumptions. That is normally crucial. I simply do not understand why regulations have to specify how the actuary will take on the job. That is not so as regards ordinary trustees. The board is a trustee to all intents and purposes. In the sense that a valuation is required, one asks an actuary for a valuation on specific assumptions for which the board is responsible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="40907-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am thinking back to the Pension Act 1995. The Bill was introduced by Lord Mackay. I am fairly sure he introduced a similar methodology for the minimum funding requirement, which is in regulations, and for carrying out those valuations. I do not see that this provision is any different from that. I do not really understand what the noble Lord is concerned about.
</p>

<a name="40907-40_para8"></a>

To the best of my memory similar procedures were followed when we dealt with the 1995 Act to establish the MFR, in which the methodology was in regulations. When Lord Mackay proposed this no one said that actuaries did not want, need or welcome that description in regulations. So I do not understand where the noble Lord is coming from on this.

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="40907-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Perhaps the Minister can give us a brief explanation of what is envisaged with regard to the board&#039;s attitude to new schemes that are created to replace existing schemes. Is there simply a provision that is designed to prevent employers avoiding their responsibilities in changing from one scheme to another? The Nikko Bank case may be an example of when that has happened.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40907-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I should like to take the opportunity of this stand part debate to ask a question that applies to Clause 139 as well as to many of the other clauses that relate to the board, which relates to our earlier discussion about time limits. I happened to spend my summer break learning about insolvency in a direct fashion&#151;not personally, but on behalf of another organisation. I have had a crash course in the importance of time in insolvency matters. There appears to be no time limit to suggest when the board has to do things in almost all of these clauses. Crucially, neither is there any indication of when the board must notify other players, whether it assumes liability for a scheme or not.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>For example, in Clause 139(2) there is a duty on the board to issue a withdrawal notice. There is no duty for it to do so within even the vaguest of terms such as &quot;at the earliest opportunity&quot;. Given that the importance of when the board acts can be crucial to people trying to resolve the affairs of a pension fund, that is an oversight. The Minister rightly explained to us the importance of getting the wording right when we debated the difference between the rules of a scheme and scheme rules. Having no time limits or sense of urgency on the part of the board is an omission. Therefore, when the board is obliged to take certain action, an indication that it is under a duty to do so at the earliest opportunity is crucial. I hope that the Minister will take that into consideration in this clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40907-41_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It may make sense to spend a second stating the purpose of Clause 139. It enables the PPF to refuse to assume responsibility for new schemes that have been created to replace existing schemes for the purpose of enabling the members to become entitled to PPF compensation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>For example, rather than manipulating a current scheme&#151;we were talking about the three-year backdating rule earlier&#151;a new scheme may be set up to replace an existing scheme in order to obtain PPF compensation. That may occur, for instance, when a current scheme has one member and is therefore not an eligible scheme, so the PPF board cannot assume responsibility for it. A new scheme could be created which is an eligible scheme, and the existing member of that old scheme transferred to it with additional members&#151;perhaps the son-in-law of the garage owner or whoever. As a result, that scheme would then be eligible to PPF compensation should the board assume responsibility for it.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>So, in a sense, this is a further version of seeking to avoid the manipulation of the rules, in order for the scheme that could be funded but which could arrange to be underfunded to come within the PPF. It is one such device by which we seek to ensure that that will not happen.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>One of the conditions for the board refusing to assume responsibility for a scheme under this clause is that the new scheme must have been established during a certain period, which will be set out in regulations. Again, we expect the period to be three years in order to be consistent with the other moral hazard&#151;a trip line, if you like&#151;within the Bill. We just think that that is a reasonable point to follow.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Perhaps the noble Baroness could help me further on precisely what she wants some steer on in terms of the time line. It is clear that we are producing the three-year rule to try to block manipulation of any form or other. The States has a version of that which ensures that there is no artificial manipulation to take the assets somewhere else and dump the liabilities on the PPF, which is always the risk. We must have powers to thwart that, even if there are only five cases as opposed to 50 or 500. One of the problems is often that the number of words&#151;whether they relate to ill health or whatever&#151;may not reflect the number of people who come in. Perhaps the noble Baroness can help me on her particular query about the time period, in that the provision applies for three years and seeks to stop the creation of an artificial new scheme out of the bones of an old one to bring it within the eligibility of a PPF fund.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40907-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I shall try to help the noble Baroness. My point is that, throughout this clause, duties are placed on the board to take certain actions. Most of those actions are based on the board having arrived at a conclusion, having made a judgment about the eligibility of the scheme or about whether an action has occurred from an intention to avoid or ameliorate liability.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The point I seek to make is that, given that most of the board&#039;s actions will be based on judgments at which it has arrived, the board should be under a general and explicit duty to explain and take its action at the earliest opportunity. Most of those actions are to inform other bodies&#151;the regulator, the trustees and so on. There should be an urgency about its doing so. Any delay on the part of the board in communicating <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that can have a material effect on the actions of all the other players in the process of determining the viability or otherwise of a scheme. That is so important that it merits being explicit and repeated throughout the legislation. That is the point that I am seeking to get across.

</p>

<a name="40907-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The noble Baroness has picked up two issues. One is the length of time of the assessment period and how that may be elongated with the uncertainty involved for the members. Equally, we have to accept that it is a very complicated process to try to see whether there has been any manipulation of the scheme. The second issue is the amount of information available to all the players in the scenario to ensure that they are in a position to expedite proceedings, so that we can reduce the timetable to as brief a period as possible. I take it that that is one of the concerns of the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="40907-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>At this point, all I shall say is that we shall be discussing the position of information that goes out&#151;I hope this latest point is addressed&#151;under Clause 194, which will give us the chance to go into the detail. In this case, notice will be issued as soon as reasonably practicable, as referred to in Amendment No. 204D. Perhaps I can invite the noble Baroness to re-address the issue under Clause 194. If she feels that the quest for disseminating information and the need to expedite the time scale can be achieved coherently together, and not in ways that subvert each other, perhaps we can re-enter that debate when we come to Clause 194, which may be a more appropriate time. If I can give the noble Baroness any information before we come to that clause, perhaps she will write to me so that she has a better sense of where the regulations may go on this, and I will be happy to respond.

As actuarial valuations will have to be made under the Bill at regular intervals, I would have thought that the regular interval should be the right time for the   withdrawal of the assessment period rather than the six   months which is dictated under this clause. I would be grateful for an answer to that.

<a name="40907-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This concerns not whether the insolvency practitioner has determined that the scheme has been rescued or that it cannot be rescued; it is whether he is in a position not to make that order. In other words, we expect it to be fairly rare. It concerns the situation where an insolvency practitioner has issued a notice confirming that it is not possible to determine whether or not a scheme rescue has occurred; and where no further insolvency event has occurred within six months, that is to be considered a withdrawal event.

</p>

<a name="40907-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>We would expect that it is not possible to determine situations in which that applies. They happen very rarely and only in instances where the insolvency practitioner has been appointed to resolve one insolvency issue for <br>&nbsp;<br>

one creditor and has no overall view of the solvency of the company as a whole. This could occur, for example, under an administrative receivership. With such an insolvency procedure, which triggers an assessment period, the administrative receiver who represents an individual lender, for example, with a security for a loan, has the power to deal only with a claim of the relevant security creditors. If the company continues in whole or in part once the administrative receiver has recovered a specific debt, the administrative receiver will not necessarily be aware of the outcome of the pension scheme or indeed the business and would issue a notice saying that he was unable to issue either a &quot;scheme rescue&quot; or a &quot;scheme rescue not possible&quot; notice.
</p>

<a name="40907-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>In practice, it is likely that the position of the company and the scheme will be reasonably clear, but not within the remit of the specific administrative receiver; and, of course, the PPF will be closely involved in understanding the wider picture. In many cases, it is likely that the company will continue to exist&#151;perhaps in a rationalised form&#151;or a separate insolvency trigger may occur with a separate liquidator appointed to deal with the rights of all the other non-secured creditors. In either case, we understand that a period of six months should be adequate both to clarify the insolvency position and to complete any further steps in the scheme valuation process. We do not want to continue that indefinitely as members&#039; benefits are reduced.
</p>

<a name="40907-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I have checked to see whether any concern was raised by insolvency practitioners about the timetable, as that would be the key. I understand that none was raised. Should any doubt be raised I would reconsider the matter. Currently, I have no reason to think that going from six to eight months would have any particular benefit to insolvency practitioners, but it could have some detriment to members of a scheme.

<p><a name="st_160"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is another set of government amendments on which we circulated background information in advance specifying the details of the regulations. Otherwise it would have taken 20 minutes to spell them out in Committee.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>This group of amendments provides for the replacement of the current statutory priority order on wind-up with a new one when the pension protection fund starts up for business. It also contains consequential amendments to PPF provisions within the Bill, which is why they are being debated at Clause   141 as consequential amendments to other legislation.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>These amendments will ensure that, broadly speaking, individual scheme members will be no worse off if their scheme winds up than they would be if their scheme entered the PPF. That underlines the Government&#039;s commitment to the package of measures being introduced through the Bill to ensure that members of all defined benefit schemes receive meaningful levels of compensation on pension. In other words, the priority order for solvent employers with wind-ups, the priority order for insolvent employers with sufficient assets&#151;which I suspect may not be a frequent occurrence&#151;the priority for the large scheme closures, which we still have to address in future sessions of the Committee, and the priority for the PPF should all broadly be aligned. This is the first of the amendments that seeks to do that.
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="40907-43_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40907-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>That is the proposal. This is for the winding up. These amendments introduce a new priority order to take effect when the PPF opens its doors. It is set out as follows. I shall go through this to get it into Hansard.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The first category of the priority order is liabilities for pensions or benefits paid by certain insurance contracts purchased before 6 April 1997 that cannot be surrendered or where the surrender value is less than the liability secured by the contract. They will have been bought in the name of the trustees to pay a specific pension.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The terms of these contracts mean that they either cannot be surrendered or can be, but only at a disproportionate cost to the scheme. The priority order does not treat insurance contracts bought in this way after 6 April 1997 separately as the trustees should have brought them in the light of the current legislation so that they could be surrendered at a reasonable cost.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The main purpose of the revised priority order is to ensure that members of schemes which have been assessed by the PPF board, but the board has not assumed responsibility for the scheme, receive broadly what they would have done if the board had assumed responsibility for the scheme. We are trying to ensure that different categories of potential or actual benefit recipients would not be disadvantaged if the scheme wound up outside the PPF as opposed to coming within the PPF. There is a similar alignment of the priority order, whether it is the wind up of a solvent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC180</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company or the wind up of an insolvent one and whether it should be bought out, closed, or put into the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The second and substantial category of the priority order is, therefore, the liability for benefits which does not exceed the corresponding PPF liability. That is 100   per cent of the original pension promise for people who have reached the scheme pension age and 90 per cent for people below that age, subject to an overall benefit cap which is calculated using a mixture of the scheme&#039;s individual rates and standardised rules linked to earnings. That includes 90 per cent of voluntary contributions up to the level of the cap for non-pensioners and 100 per cent of voluntary contributions for pensioners.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The second category does not include liabilities for benefits which fall in the first category. Regulations will provide that, when determining the corresponding PPF liability, the pension compensation provisions apply with certain modifications.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The third category is voluntary contributions&#151;that is AVCs. Currently, those are a separate category in the priority order. That ensures that individuals who take out voluntary contributions which they fully fund themselves are treated as fairly as possible. However, with the introduction of the PPF, which bases compensation on all contributions paid including voluntary ones, and in the light of the moral hazard problems that schemes could be manipulated to make it appear that benefits were derived from voluntary contributions, the amendments provide for a separate third category to cover the liabilities for voluntary contributions to the extent that these are not included in the first two paragraphs of the priority order; in other words, where the voluntary contributions have not been turned into added years.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The fourth and final category covers any remaining liabilities for benefits not already met under the preceding categories.
</p>

<a name="40907-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>This bundle of amendments does that. The amendments set out a priority order. We are trying to ensure that the priority order under winding up, under the PPF and under closed schemes is broadly similar so that the individual categories of members do not find themselves disadvantaged whether a scheme remains outside the PPF or within it. Without going into the detail of the amendments, I hope that the Committee will support them.

<a name="40907-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Two things are taking place. First, existing pensioners will receive 100 per cent under the PPF compensation fund and others will receive 90 per cent, but the crucial difference is the issue of indexation. Under the old system the indexation for pensioners took precedence over the payment of benefit for active and deferred members. That will no longer be the case. Indexation follows the meeting of the obligation to pensioners and to active and deferred members.

My basic concern, as my noble friend has said, is that auditors do not carry out valuations. If one requires them to do a valuation they will resign rather than do it. It is not part of being an auditor. There is a misconception as to what an auditor does, is capable of doing and can do within the remit of an audit. I understand what is required, but it is not asking for the right thing.

<a name="40907-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I think that the spirit of the noble Lord&#039;s comments is already embedded in the Government&#039;s position. Although it is useful and helpful to clarify it, my understanding is the same as that of the noble Lord. The UK insurance market presently does not appear to have sufficient capacity to absorb large-scale pension liabilities of, say, &#163;500 million-plus on a buy-out basis that would be sufficiently competitive. The test is that such a buy-out would be competitive. If it were not, the proposition is that it would be run as a closed scheme, on the value-for-money grounds that, as the noble Lord suggested, the costs would be disproportionate.

If he wishes to press me on any further issues, I would be happy to try to respond to them. We are not seeking to tie trustees into accepting a buy-out that is not competitive given the state of the market. That is why closure is the realistic alternative in this situation.

<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="40907-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I must admit that I do not see where in the wording we have any recognition of the fact that a quote might be uncompetitive. It says, &quot;If you cannot obtain a quote&quot;. If I offer to buy your car for a pound, that is a quote, but it is probably not a competitive quote. I think that there has to be some recognition of the fact that if there are many false sellers in this market, people will offer quotes at silly prices.

<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="40907-45_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to take legal advice on this. There is no intention in the Bill to tie the trustees into taking any quote, however uncompetitive, just because it does not say that it has to be competitive. I should have thought that the fiduciary duty of trustees would not allow them to accept an uncompetitive quote where the alternative is a closed scheme. However, if that is not the case and we need further clarification, I am very happy to come back to it.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="40907-45_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   It may be technically competitive in the sense that there are two quotes and that is the best one. As my son has reached the age of 25 and I promised him that I would include him in the insurance on his mother&#039;s sports car, I am very well aware of the range of quotations that one can get from insurance companies. I am happy to accept what the Minister said as a principle, but I still think that adding wording like mine&#151;not necessarily these exact words&#151;would help to make the position clearer.

One such situation would be where the quote, for example, was so expensive that the benefits to members would fall below the PPF level of compensation. That would be an obvious case. If I may, I shall take the draftsman&#039;s advice to see whether we need additional words to ensure that trustees do not feel themselves bound to accept an inappropriate course for their scheme members.

</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40907-45_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I wish to make one or two points. I am not absolutely clear that I understand the terminology correctly so far as concerns closed schemes. Of course, in the context of pensions one frequently talks of a final salary scheme which is closed to new members. Is that the definition that we are using in the present context of Clause 144?
</p>

<a name="40907-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Secondly, the clause constantly refers to &quot;trustees or managers of the scheme&quot;. I am not at all clear what the managers have to do with this. I should have thought that only the trustees would be involved. But are we to assume that they must try to obtain a buy-out before they apply for the scheme to be closed or, within the context of this clause, can they say straight away, &quot;We would like to become a closed scheme&quot;? Perhaps the noble Baroness would clarify that point.
</p>

<a name="40907-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I want to make only one other point. Clauses 146 and 147 are concerned with the treatment of closed schemes. I am not sure why Clause 145 comes where it does. I should have thought that it would come after Clause 150 but perhaps we can consider that point later.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40907-45_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   In response to the noble Lord&#039;s direct question, the trustees and managers of a scheme may apply to the board for the authority to continue as a closed scheme only if they have been unable to obtain a full buy-out quotation. If the board is satisfied that the trustees or managers have taken all reasonable steps&#151;and taking into account all that the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Oakeshott, said about duopolies&#151;but have been unsuccessful, the board must authorise the scheme to continue as a closed scheme.
</p>

<a name="40907-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Any application to the board to continue as a closed scheme must be accompanied by evidence that the trustees or managers have taken all reasonable steps to obtain a full buy-out quotation. The form of the evidence will be prescribed in regulations. If the PPF board is satisfied with that evidence, it must issue a determination notice to the trustees and managers and to the regulator. The determination notice will set out the decision of the board as to whether a scheme may continue as a closed scheme. That is the procedural point that the noble Lord raised. Does he have any other concerns?

<p><a name="st_190"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

buy-out? The clause specifically refers to a full buy-out&#151;the implication being that they could possibly go for a partial buy-out. But I am not clear whether they could secure a partial buy-out and a closed scheme for the rest, so to speak.
</p>

<a name="40907-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>My other question is whether this is wholly outside the PPF; that is, is it simply the case that the board is saying, &quot;You must try for a full or partial buy-out and, if you cannot, it becomes a closed scheme&quot;? But does the matter come outside the PPF at that point? Most of the Bill is concerned with the PPF or the financial assistance scheme or whatever. But here the board suddenly seems to be setting up a quite different animal which does not come under the PPF. It becomes a closed scheme but the trustees and so on remain in operation for the members who are already in it. It is really at that point nothing to do with the board. Does the board wash its hands of the scheme at that point? Does it then have no further influence on it at all?
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The situation is that the scheme is being wound up but the assets are greater than the protected liabilities that will come under the PPF. Therefore, in principle, it should be able to buy out its liabilities through an insurance contract. It cannot do so because of the size of the fund, so it becomes appropriate for it to be a closed scheme. It is not closed in the sense of a conventional DB or DC scheme closing to new members, but it effectively becomes frozen. It is a scheme in wind-up that cannot actually wind up.
</p>

<a name="40907-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>If, for whatever reason, the scheme could not pay its members or dependants the level of protection offered by the PPF, the PPF would gain. That scheme would come into the PPF. The size of the default is not an obstacle to coming into the PPF but the scheme would normally stay outside the PPF because its assets meet its protected liabilities. It can offer pension benefits to members greater than would be obtained by those members within the PPF, but it cannot meet that obligation by buying annuities because of the size of the scheme. Should it not be able to offer levels of benefit of at least as good quality as the PPF and the PPF has certainly not washed its hands of it, the PPF is in play.
</p>

<a name="40907-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>We are talking about large schemes with sufficient assets such that it is in the members&#039; interests to stay outside the PPF, but that cannot discharge those obligations by buying insurance contracts. Therefore, they continue as closed schemes&#151;effectively frozen schemes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   That is very helpful. I now understand the matter rather more clearly, but it means that we are using &quot;closed scheme&quot; in two different contexts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is certainly true.
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   That seems highly undesirable, and we should have thought of some other terminology. I was certainly confused originally by what was meant by a closed scheme. I am also not entirely clear why the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

PPF is involved. If I understand correctly, there cannot be a full buy-out. A scheme becomes a closed scheme in the sense that we now understand to be intended, but the PPF then has no more to do with it. That is the end of the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   No, not quite. The scheme stays outside the PPF but the PPF still has a role in terms of issuing or ensuring financial directions of the scheme in order to protect the assets so that the scheme does not later enter the PPF. There is that continued responsibility on the PPF. For whatever reason&#151;through the stock market or whatever&#151;one could conceive of such a closed scheme in due course coming into the PPF if it could not meet its obligations, but the PPF will continue to make sure that the scheme is not accidentally or artificially manipulated in such a way that the assets are not run down, given the health of the sponsoring company and employer, which will of course be extremely dubious. That is why it would be in such a situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   This is a rather important point, and it is really rather confusing. I regret to say that it is very common nowadays for firms to take a policy decision that they will not provide a final salary scheme to new staff. Therefore, so far as concerns the existing scheme, we may use the terminology &quot;closed&quot;, but in fact the scheme is still there; it is quite viable. New staff are usually given&#151;if anything at all&#151;a scheme based on a money purchase arrangement. That is very common, so we need to be absolutely clear about the differences. I am very glad that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has raised the matter as it is important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The confusion arises because&#151;my noble friend is entirely right, as is the noble Lord, Lord Higgins&#151;&quot;closed&quot; is used in two different senses. Some ongoing companies close a DB scheme and open a DC scheme or they create a hybrid between the two. That is one use of &quot;closure&quot;, but we are talking about an entirely different sense of it in which a scheme that is being wound up and would have gone into wind-up by buying out the liabilities or responsibilities through insurance contracts cannot do so, given the size of the scheme and the state of the market. Therefore, it is continuing as, so to speak, a frozen scheme. The PPF continues to have a responsibility to ensure that the assets which by definition surpass the liabilities&#151;that is why the scheme remains outside the PPF in the first place&#151;continue so that the scheme does not subsequently fall into the PPF. Should it have to do so in due course, it will do so.

<a name="40907-46_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My noble friend Lady Turner of Camden and the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, have commonly said, several times, that what people outside talk about as &quot;closed schemes&quot; is quite different.

closed one minute and opened again the next. They can be looked at from time to time by the Pension Protection Fund board. Under later clauses&#151;they are only a few clauses later&#151;schemes can be reconsidered and brought into the fund if circumstances change. From the point of view of wording and understanding, there really could be improvements but, having thought about the matter only as others were speaking, I certainly do not have any positive way of putting things.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I entirely accept that, within pensions terminology, &quot;closure&quot; and &quot;closed schemes&quot; are used in two different senses. Let me see whether there is any way of differently describing what is happening. What we are dealing with in the clause is very clear&#151;large schemes that should be winding up because they have assets that out-price their liabilities. In the normal course of events, if they were modest-sized schemes with liabilities of &#163;50 million or whatever, they should be able to buy those out by securing annuities from members that they would draw down then or in future. They cannot do so given the state of the market, which, as has been explained, is a duopoly. Therefore, they need some different form of outcome. It is not appropriate for it to go into the PPF; nor should it, because the assets surpass the liabilities, which would mean that members would as a result have artificially depressed benefits that they do not need to have. That is what would happen if they went into the PPF, given the cap and the 90 per cent funding.
</p>

<a name="40907-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>All that said, it is clear that if the wording adds not exactly to the confusion but to a certain degree of difficulty for Members of the Committee, we should look at it. I can make no promises but I am open to suggestions. I do not promise half a bottle of champagne for the best redefinition, but perhaps we should come up with a clearer or different label so that &quot;closed scheme&quot; does not apply to two different beasts, which is what it does at the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   Perhaps I might seize the opportunity of this spirit of clarification to ask one question. The noble Baroness explained that she was talking about a scheme that did not come within the terms of the PPF because it had the assets to meet its protected liabilities. Why should the scheme then be dealt with by the PPF rather than the regulator? I understood from previous discussions&#151;I am going back a few months before the Recess&#151;that a vast swathe of the regulator&#039;s activities was to look at schemes in danger of coming within the remit and the clutches of the PPF. Why should the schemes be different, whatever their terms? They appear to be &quot;frozen at a moment in time&quot; schemes. Why should they be treated by a different body?
</p>




<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="40907-46_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Basically, if the scheme had been sufficiently modestly sized, there would have been bought-out insurance contracts and that would have been the end of the matter. Those pensions would have been secured <i>ad infinitum</i>. Because of the size of a scheme, it is not in that position. It therefore depends, <br>&nbsp;<br>

based on its regular valuations, on ensuring that there is an adequate match between its assets and liabilities. The PPF is concerned to ensure that that adequate match is not reduced in any way and it seeks to ensure that the scheme does not come within the PPF. That is why the PPF has the responsibility.
</p>

<a name="40907-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>In a way, we are talking about a method of continuing to keep a shadow of an assessment period, as opposed to a regulator. With a regulator, one is dealing with a solvent company and pension scheme over the solvency of which there is a question mark. On this matter, we have an insolvent employer but an apparently solvent pension scheme which would normally have met its obligations through insurance contracts, in which case all would have been secure, but which cannot do so. Therefore, the PPF must continue to have a watchdog role in order to ensure that there is no artificial or inappropriate adjustment of the ratio between assets and liabilities such that that   scheme, which would be substantial, would subsequently come into the PPF. If it did so, it would be to the disadvantage of not only possibly the PPF but of members, who would then receive a lower rate of benefit.

I am not clear on the second definition of the word &quot;closed&quot;&#151;perhaps it is the primary definition&#151;and whether the scheme cannot in any way take on new members. The other matter on which I am now doubtful is whether a frozen scheme&#151;

<a name="40907-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Is a frozen scheme bound to be closed in the traditional sense? I am unclear about whether it can become unfrozen or thawed. What happens if the stock market goes up? Does the scheme then float itself happily away from all concern with the PPF?

definition, the employer has become insolvent. Therefore, the company is not trading. That is very clear and it was my original answer on why it cannot take on new members. The company is not solvent.
</p>

<a name="40907-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I do not see what the problem is if the stock market goes up. If it does, the issue is not whether the scheme comes into the PPF but whether the trustees can discharge their responsibilities by buying insurance contracts. If the stock market has gone up, it is not clear to me that they can necessarily thereby discharge their responsibilities by buying insurance contracts. If they cannot, they will still therefore need to operate as closed schemes; there will simply be more assets to cover liabilities than might otherwise have been the case.

<a name="40907-47_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I suggest, from my personal experience, that what is probably needed is for the stock market to go up so that there is more money to buy the annuities and for the gilt market to go down so that annuities are cheaper.

&quot;( )   Regulations may require the trustees or managers of a closed scheme in relation to which the provisions mentioned in subsection (3) apply to comply with such requirements as may be prescribed when providing for the discharge of any liability to, or in respect of, a member of the scheme for pensions or other benefits.&quot;

<p><a name="st_218"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 211A amends Clause 146, which sets out the rules for the operation of closed schemes. The amendment provides a regulation-making power that will be used to place restrictions on the ability of closed schemes partially to discharge their liabilities. To some degree, we are returning to the debate that we had earlier. If the schemes were allowed to do so without restriction, they could, for example, use their assets to buy out all their liabilities to members in excess of the PPF compensation cap. Doing so might reduce their assets to such a level that either immediately or at a later stage they would have to be taken into the PPF.
</p>

<a name="40907-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>However, it would not be appropriate to put on the face of the Bill a blanket ban on all discharges as there are a number of instances in which it may be necessary or acceptable for discharges of liabilities to be made. Those will, for example, include regular payments of pension to scheme members and situations in which the trustees completely discharge all their liabilities in respect of an individual. Such discharges will have to be in accordance with the winding-up requirements. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a minimum of 12 months, one is bound to ask a different question from the one I originally intended when I tabled the amendment&#151;without having the information so nobly imparted by the Minister. Is 12   months long enough in this case? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="40907-48_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   As a direct response to the noble Lord, we think that we have got it right based on the experience of the Pensions Compensation Board. The board has followed through three cases of fraud; two took eight months and the third took 11   months, so it seems to be about the right time. We do not want to artificially elongate the time if there is no fraud and thereby leave things in an insecure state. From our experience the time period seems appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40907-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I was expecting the noble Lord to argue the opposite and I was going to explain to him why six months would not be enough given the experience of the Pensions Compensation Board. The three cases that we have seem to fit this time scale, but who knows.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="40907-48_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   There is a problem because the subsection talks not only about the fraud compensation application, but also about the assessment period. Are we again using &quot;assessment period&quot; in two entirely different senses? We have spent much time this afternoon talking about the length of assessment periods. In this case are we talking about the assessment period for fraud or the general assessment period that we have been discussing all afternoon?
</p>




<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="40907-48_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is just the same. Given what I have described, we expect the assessment period to last for a minimum of 12 months. One thing that we expect to be checked in that period is fraud. That is why I was going to argue that reducing the period to six months would be inappropriate. Obviously that forms part and parcel of the assessment period, along with looking at the manipulation of schemes, changing the scheme rules in the preceding three years, cleansing the data, and so on. Therefore, I do not think that there is any problem here.
</p>

<a name="40907-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Whether a more substantive issue arises&#151;that is, that 12 months will not be long enough&#151;then, as I said, all we can do is to work on the evidence thus far that such cases of fraud are fairly rare. Cases of serious fraud, in particular, end up in court procedures involving the recovery of assets and so on, and that may take it out of the PPF&#039;s realm altogether.
</p>




<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="40907-48_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I am afraid that I have been a little naughty because the advantage of having a hook on which to hang a question&#151;a hook in terms of an amendment&#151;is that the barb can go both ways. In this case, it has gone the least obvious way according to the words in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40907-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>That said, I think that I am pleased with the answer but I am still slightly confused about the reference to the assessment period as well as to the fraud compensation application pending. Clause 163 is entirely about fraud and therefore perhaps it would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC196"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sensible to use another word instead of &quot;assessment period&quot; if it is an assessment period covering a fraud rather than an assessment period by the board, which is very different.

If it makes sense to change the words and if the concerns expressed today by the Committee have any reverberations outside&#151;that is, that we have introduced ambiguity with the use of these words&#151;we shall be happy to help. But basically we are keeping the scheme in the assessment period until the fraud is investigated. That is why we went for a 12-month period.

<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="40907-49_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Perhaps I could say a word or two about this as it relates to the moment of transfer of a scheme from the existing trustees to the PPF. In the light of the discussion that we had earlier about the length of the assessment period, I am worried about the position of the scheme&#039;s trustees whose responsibilities finally terminate with the transfer notice. It seems that there may be some considerable danger that, given that an assessment is being carried out, there will be very little incentive for the trustees to remain in post. They may as well say, &quot;Well, this is the situation. It could stagger on. We may manage to do a buy-out and so on, but otherwise we see no future and therefore we shall all resign <i>en masse</i>&quot;. I am not clear how one prevents that happening.
</p>

<a name="40907-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I am trying to be realistic about this. A transfer notice is made at the end of the assessment period if the assessment is found to be unfavourable, but I am not clear how one keeps the thing going meanwhile and I suspect that some practical danger may arise here. I do not know whether one has any thoughts on that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_242"></a>
<a name="40907-49_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I think that the noble Lord is pressing me on whether there may be a risk of the trustees taking their bat and walking away when the transfer notice is issued&#151;which is what the clause is about. However, is that so very different from a wind-up of the scheme? What is happening here is that the scheme is going across to the PPF. However, if it were being wound up and if the annuities or whatever were bought&#151;the trustees role would the taper out in that situation&#151;would there theoretically be any difference? In both cases the trustees would be presiding over the endgame of a particular scheme.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I do not see why the trustees would be more likely to walk away, precisely because the scheme is coming into the PPF. Members&#039; benefits would therefore be lower than they would if the wind-up was taking place outside the scheme, where by definition there are more assets. I should have thought that the trustees would expect to continue their role to the end.
</p>

<a name="40907-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>It is a technical point, but there should still be provision in the scheme rules in terms of the resignation or replacement of the trustees, so that if they were to go they could be replaced. If they ultimately wished to walk away from their duties, there is no doubt but that it might have to be tested in court. However, I am not sure that that situation is different from any other wind-up, where as I say the trustees are watching the scheme taper out.
</p>

<a name="40907-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Perhaps I can invite the noble Lord to come back to the responsibilities of trustees when we reach the chunk of provisions relating to trustees. I think there is a real set of issues about the education, support, training and long-term commitment of trustees in this situation. It may be better to look at it in that context rather than in this clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_243"></a>
<a name="40907-49_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   By all means, let us do that. However, I think that there is a distinction. If the thing is being wound up, the trustees will feel that they are winding it up and that it is their responsibility; they are not handing it over to someone else. I think that there is a slight difference of approach here&#151;that if the PPF is going to take it anyway, let it get on with it. However, let us come back to that later.

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="40907-50_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following statement:
</p>

<a name="40907-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>Last week I published a strategy paper, <i>Reducing Maternal Deaths</i>, setting out the evidence on what is needed to reduce maternal deaths in developing countries. The paper complements our recent position paper on <i>Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</i>, and DfID&#039;s target strategy papers on <i>Better Health for Poor People</i> and <i>Realising Human Rights for Poor People</i>.
</p>

<a name="40907-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>There is an urgent need to make faster progress towards the fifth Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health. Every year worldwide, more than 529,000 women die from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, all but 2,500 of them in developing countries. The UK is firmly committed to the target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (the number of deaths per 100,000 live births) by three-quarters by 2015, from a 1990 baseline. The health of the mother is inextricably linked to the health of her newborn child.
</p>

<a name="40907-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The paper sets out four priorities for DfID: increasing awareness and commitment to action, supporting partner countries to improve access to services, addressing wider barriers to maternal health, especially improving the status and rights of women, and generating and using new knowledge.
</p>

<a name="40907-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>DfID is already supporting work in all these areas but will increase those efforts and encourage partners to do likewise. The strategy includes a commitment to increase year-on-year investment in maternal health.
</p>

<a name="40907-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>I am placing a copy of the paper in the Library of the House. It is also available on DfID&#039;s website at www.dfid.gov.uk.

and financial assistance to include crisis management operations of the African Union. This allows EU member states to offer full practical and financial support to the deployment of the African Union&#039;s Ceasefire Commission to Darfur. With the support of her Majesty&#039;s Government, the United Nations Security Council on 30 July unanimously adopted Resolution 1556 (2004), which, inter alia imposes an arms embargo against non-governmental entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed, operating in the states of North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur in Sudan.

This renewed the arms embargo imposed by UNSCR 1493 (2003) for one year and extended the mandate of the UN Expert Group established by UNSCR 1533 (2004) to monitor the embargo for a further six months.

Among other measures, the resolution leaves the arms embargo in place, with new exemptions for arms and related materiel required by the Government of Iraq or the multinational force to serve the purposes of the resolution. The resolution passes all outstanding rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to the Oil for Food Programme to the Government of Iraq, including ensuring independently authenticated confirmation that goods have been delivered, and it leaves in place the financial sanctions upon former Government of Iraq funds and any funds belonging to Saddam Hussein, senior members of his regime and their immediate family members.

These renewed the restrictive measures imposed by Common Position 2003/297/CFSP from 30 April 2004 for a further 12   months, in view of the current political situation in Burma, notably the failure of the regime to pursue the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy. The restrictive measures comprise an assets freeze and travel ban against members of the regime and others, an arms embargo, a prohibition on the attachment and hosting of military personnel to diplomatic missions, restrictions on development programmes and a suspension of high-level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.

<a name="40907-51_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) will today lay before Parliament the latest White Paper on Prospects for the EU (Cm 6310).

</p>

<a name="40907-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>This White Paper is a supplement to the one published in April on <i>Prospects for the EU in 2004</i> (Cm 6174). As well as setting out the issues we expect the Union to address in the rest of the year, it updates readers on developments since April and provides a short breakdown of the achievements of Ireland&#039;s EU Presidency, which ran from January to June. It covers the full gamut of EU business, from enlargement&#151;and whether we should start negotiations with Turkey on membership of the Union&#151;to the Lisbon Agenda for economic and social reform&#151;which includes developing the single market, simplifying new and outdated regulation, and increasing employment.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The purpose of this White Paper, and April&#039;s, is to keep Parliament and the public informed about developments in the EU, the Government&#039;s approach to them and the benefits they will bring to the UK and its citizens.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The next White Paper on prospects for the EU will be published in January 2005, to be followed by a shorter update&#151;along the lines of the one published today&#151;in July 2005.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>These White Papers are part of the Government&#039;s commitment to make EU business more accessible and interesting for Parliament, the media and members of the public alike by providing an appropriate amount of detail and depth on significant progress that might have an impact on our daily lives. I hope they will play a vital role in involving Parliament more closely in EU affairs, and trust that Members of both Houses will read them. I commend this White Paper to the House.

<a name="40907-51_head4"></a><h3 align=center>WTO Framework Agreement</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="40907-51_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>On 1 August the General Council of the World Trade Organisation agreed a framework text for further negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. Commissioners Lamy and Fischler negotiated on behalf of the European Union. I warmly welcome this Framework Agreement, which is a crucial step on the road to delivering a trade round that will benefit developed and developing countries alike.

</p>

<a name="40907-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>On 17 September last year I made an oral Statement to the House (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, cols. 861&#150;63), about the WTO ministerial conference in Cancun, where WTO members had been unable to reach an agreement. In that Statement I said that in order to get the Doha Development Agenda back on track, the WTO community would need to lift its sights to the prize on offer. I believe that WTO Members have done just that. The period since Cancun has been marked by a much more positive and business-like atmosphere and the Framework Agreement has now cemented the progress made.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>For the most part the purpose of the Framework Agreement is to set out guiding principles for future negotiations rather than to provide specific proposals. However, it contains sufficient detail to allow technical discussions to continue during the rest of this year, when the US presidential elections and the appointment of a new College of Commissioners are likely to limit political engagement in the round.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>The Framework Agreement gives greater detail on the direction of the negotiations on agriculture, industrial tariffs, commits WTO members to negotiate on a trade facilitation agreement and sets a revised target date for more requests in the ongoing services negotiations. Agriculture is generally acknowledged to be the key to progress in the round and the agriculture section contains a welcome level of detail. The agreement provides for extensive special and differential treatment for developing countries across all the sectors covered. Three of the four so-called Singapore Issues (competition, investment and transparency in government procurement), divergent views on which did much to derail talks at Cancun, have been dropped from the Doha Development Agenda. The fourth&#151;trade facilitation&#151;will now be the subject of negotiations.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The text of the agreement reflects the increasing influence of developing countries within the WTO. This is a development that I have previously welcomed. India and Brazil in particular played an influential role in the lead up to the agreement. Both the G20 group (larger developing country agricultural exporters) and G90 (some 62 smaller developing countries) engaged in the negotiations in a flexible and constructive manner. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development, my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS75"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

right honourable friend the secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my honourable friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs and I were in regular contact with a number of influential members of both of these groupings, as well as our EU colleagues, to underline the importance of reaching an agreement. My honourable friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs and I between us attended the two General Affairs and External Relations Council meetings held in the last week of July to agree the EU&#039;s position for this stage of the negotiations.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The Government have been strongly supportive of the Commission&#039;s approach to negotiations in the   period since Cancun. We consider that the Commission has shown leadership and flexibility to move talks forward, capitalising on the stronger negotiating position that the EU enjoys after the CAP reforms of June 2003 and March 2004, which will cut significantly the level both of trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies. In particular, the conditional offer to eliminate of export subsidies in the letter of 9 May from Commissioners Lamy and Fischler to WTO trade Ministers helped to breathe new life into the talks and encouraged other developed countries to match the EU&#039;s level of ambition. My honourable friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs and I attended meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in the week leading up to the Framework Agreement where we strongly supported the European Commission.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>There is much still to be done. The challenge now for the whole WTO membership of 148 countries is to build on this success and to ensure that the momentum that has been built up is maintained in the detailed negotiations that will now follow. Success in the Round has the potential to deliver huge benefits, including for developing countries as their opportunities for trade increase, so adding to their prosperity, aiding development and contributing towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Gaols.
</p>

<a name="40907-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>The Government will continue do all we can, both inside the EU and within the broader WTO community, to help to deliver an ambitious development-focused Round. In particular, we will press hard for substantial progress before the sixth WTO Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong scheduled for December 2005.

<a name="40907-52_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Director and Auditor Liability</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="40907-52_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The House will be aware that, between December 2003 and March 2004, the Government consulted widely on the case for reform of the law on director and auditor liability. Over 120 responses to the consultation were received from investors; companies, both large and small; auditors; legal advisers; industry bodies; academia; and the general public. I am grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to contribute.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS76"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>In the light of the consultation responses the Office of Fair Trading was asked to undertake a study of the potential impact on competition in the audit market of a cap on auditor liability. I am grateful to it for completing and publishing this so quickly.
</p>




<p><a name="wms_st_12"></a><i>Directors</i>


</p>

<a name="40907-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>It is essential for British competitiveness that we have a diverse pool of high-quality individuals willing to become directors, and that directors are willing to take informed and rational risks. But it is also important that directors act in accordance with their duties, and that negligent directors can be held to account by their companies. The courts have in recent years imposed a much more demanding standard of care, skill and diligence on directors. This has been a very welcome development.

</p>

<a name="40907-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>The consultation built on the recommendations both of the Company Law Review and of Sir Derek Higgs&#039;s study on non-executive directors. It identified two particular concerns:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>exposure to liabilities arising from legal action against directors by third parties. The sharp rise in the number of class actions by groups of shareholders in the US has made this a particular concern for directors of British companies with a US listing;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>the cost of lengthy court proceedings. Companies are currently permitted to indemnify a director against the cost of defending legal proceedings, but only when judgment has been given in the director&#039;s favour or he has been acquitted. For many directors, such indemnification comes too late and the prospect provides cold comfort.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40907-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>The consultation indicated these issues are affecting the recruitment and behaviour of directors. I therefore intend to introduce a balanced and proportionate package of reforms, by tabling amendments to the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill at its Commons Committee stage. The proposals will in particular introduce two important relaxations of the current prohibition on companies exempting their directors from, or indemnifying them against, liability:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>they will permit, but not require, companies to indemnify directors in respect of proceedings brought by third parties (covering both legal costs and the financial costs of any adverse judgment, except for the legal costs of unsuccessful defence of criminal proceedings, fines imposed in criminal proceedings and penalties imposed by regulatory bodies such as the Financial Services Authority);

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>they will permit, but not require, companies to pay directors&#039; defence costs as they are incurred, even if the action is brought by the company itself. The director would still be liable to pay any damages awarded to the company and to repay his defence costs to the company if his defence were unsuccessful (except where the company chooses to indemnify the director in respect of his legal costs in civil proceedings brought by third parties).
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS77"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>
</p>
</ul>
<a name="40907-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>The government amendments will also remove an arguable loophole under which a company in the same group may currently provide an indemnity to a director that would be unlawful if it was provided directly by the company of which the individual was a director.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>The amendments will also require disclosure in the directors&#039; report by companies that indemnify directors. Shareholders will also have the right to inspect any indemnification agreement. Companies that do not indemnify directors will not have to make any disclosure.
</p>




<p><a name="wms_st_13"></a><i>Auditors</i>




</p>

<a name="40907-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The consultation also covered the position of auditors.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>The Government wish to see a competitive and high-quality market for audit services, shareholders using high quality and reliable information, and an adequate system of redress for when things go wrong. There must also be an appropriate degree of transparency and accountability for the audit process.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The Government are actively pursuing this agenda. The Bill already extends the powers of auditors to obtain information, and contains new provisions for each director to confirm that there is no relevant audit information of which he is aware but the company&#039;s auditors are unaware.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>There are also a number of initiatives to improve the quality of the audit and other information provided to shareholders. For example:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>the recommendations of the review chaired by Sir Robert Smith mean that in listed companies there will shortly be enhanced audit committee reporting to shareholders, including better information on key audit judgements;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_11"></a>the Auditing Practices Board, a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council, has published for comment draft new ethical standards relating to the independence of auditors which are expected to be finalised this autumn;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>the Financial Reporting Council has established an Audit Inspection Unit which has begun independent reviews of the effectiveness of the audit procedures of the four largest audit firms;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>the audit regulatory activities of the professional accountancy bodies are now subject to independent oversight by the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy, a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>a new Accountancy Investigation and Discipline Board has been established, as a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council, in order to investigate public interest cases of alleged breaches of professional standards by auditors and it has commenced its first investigation;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_15"></a>the Financial Reporting Council has recently set up a group under Douglas Flint to review the current guidance on internal risk control;
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS78"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>
</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_16"></a>we are also considering carefully the responses to our recent consultation on the Operating and Financial Review.

</p>
</ul>
<a name="40907-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>In line with the Company Law Review&#039;s recommendations, and as supported in the consultation, I have decided not to bring forward amendments to the current Bill to extend an auditor&#039;s duty of care.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>The consultation showed a wide variety of views both as to whether reform of the law on liability of auditors was needed, and if so what form it should take. Some investors also had concerns about whether the audit process was serving them sufficiently well. It was also a matter of concern that the leaders of some of our largest companies were worried their choice of auditor was limited.

</p>

<a name="40907-52_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>I have considered carefully whether there is a case for a change in the law on auditor liability. I am grateful to the Office of Fair Trading for looking at the competition implications of enabling shareholders to agree in advance a maximum amount for which the auditor would be liable. In the light of the consultation responses, and the OFT&#039;s advice that introducing a cap would not significantly enhance competition, I have concluded against proposing changes to the law on this.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>The Government remain committed to improving the operation of the audit market and will continue to consider any proposals, including the possibility of limiting liability on a proportionate basis by contract, which can be demonstrated significantly to enhance competition, and to improve quality, in the audit market. The Government intends to look closely at this option and actively calls upon auditors, business, and investors to work together to examine whether proposals for a system of proportionate liability via contract are practical and/or desirable.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>However no change to the law on financial liability could protect one of an auditor&#039;s greatest assets&#151;its reputation. That responsibility rests with the professionalism of auditors themselves.

<a name="40907-52_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Retail Pharmacy Services: OFT Report</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_14"></a>
<a name="40907-52_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>On 17 January 2003, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published its report <i>The control of entry regulations and retail pharmacy services in the UK. </i>It recommended abolition of the current restrictions on National Health Service pharmacy applications known as &quot;control of entry&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>On 17 July 2003 the Government published their response to the report for England, in which we announced our intention to move cautiously in the direction recommended by the OFT.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>In summary, the package of measures proposed first the introduction of new criteria of &quot;competition and choice&quot; to the current regulatory test. Secondly, they would exempt completely four types of pharmacy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS79"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

applications from that test. These four exemptions would apply to applications in respect of large shopping developments over 15,000 square metres (though we will not now include town centre developments); to pharmacies intending to open more than 100 hours per week; to pharmacies which are part of consortia developing new one-stop primary care centres; and to pharmacies which would be wholly Internet or mail-order based. Finally, we would further reform and modernise the current regulatory system.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>We issued a consultation document on 29 August 2003, <i>Proposals to reform and modernise the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992, </i>which explained these proposals in more detail and sought views on how best to implement the package of measures. 270 responses were received. A summary of those responses is available on the department&#039;s website at www.dh.gov.uk/mpi.

</p>

<a name="40907-52_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>We also set up an expert advisory group (the advisory group on the reform of the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992) under the chairmanship of Mrs Anne Galbraith, Chair of the Prescription Pricing Authority. Its role was to advise how best to implement the proposals, taking account of the OFT report and responses subsequently received, and to offer further advice. We received the group&#039;s report in January this year. We published the executive summary of the report in March. This is available on the department&#039;s website   at http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/pharmacyrequlationconsultation/Execum.htm. We will publish the group&#039;s full report later this year when we bring forward the necessary regulatory changes.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>We took careful account of the advisory group&#039;s report and recommendations and the responses to the   consultation in drawing up our plans for implementation. Stakeholders from a wide range of key interests were represented on the group. These included patients and consumers, the NHS, pharmacists and health professions as well as those with experience of competition and regulatory reform. The group provided constructive and valuable advice. In order to end any uncertainty for patients, for the NHS and for community pharmacies, I announced on 18 August that the Government had accepted the great majority of their recommendations in relation to the proposals set out in the consultation document and would now proceed to implement them, but with some amendments.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>We will work to introduce the new criteria of competition and choice to the current regulatory test through secondary rather than primary legislation. We also intend to develop criteria for primary care trusts (PCTs) to reject administratively any application which does not undertake to provide the required &quot;essential&quot; pharmaceutical services under the proposed new contractual framework for community pharmacy. Similar arrangements will be made for appliance contractors. We intend these criteria to be rolled out to all PCTs later this year subject to our ongoing discussions with the Pharmaceutical Services <br>&nbsp;<br>

Negotiating Committee (PSNC) and NHS Confederation to finalise the details of that framework.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>We will proceed with our plans to exempt four types of pharmacy application from the &quot;control of entry&quot; test.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>However, we will not exempt pharmacy applications for town centre shopping developments over 15,000 square metres. The exemption would still apply to out-of-centre and out-of-town developments as we originally proposed. Such exempted developments will be included in a published list and a provisional list is now available on the department&#039;s website at www.dh.gov.uk/mpi. We are considering further how the list is to be updated and will provide more information when we bring forward the draft changes to the regulations. Pharmacies, which have hitherto found difficulty in gaining an NHS pharmacy contract in shopping developments in town centres, will none the less be able to apply to their local PCT for admission to the pharmaceutical list under the reformed regulatory test, when it is introduced, or to make use of the exemption to open more than 100 hours per week.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>For pharmacies which intend to open for more than 100 hours per week, we will include a requirement for PCTs to remove from their pharmaceutical list any pharmacy that consistently fails to meet the terms of the exemption unless there is good cause&#151;for example, a fire causing temporary closure.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>Applications from members of a consortium establishing a new one-stop primary care centre will also be exempted, provided the centre provides a regular, comprehensive range of services and serves a substantial population of 18,000 to 20,000 patients. The exemption will apply only to centres which are part of the local PCT&#039;s strategic service development plan or equivalent written service development strategy. Such centres will, in addition to usual general practitioner services, offer a wide range of primary and community-based services, such as dentistry, optometry, podiatry, or other social or community services. The regulations will define a &quot;consortium&quot; and specify governance arrangements. Guidance for PCTs will cover situations where a service provider withdraws from a centre so that this does not require the closure of the exempted pharmacy.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>Applications for wholly mail order or Internet-based pharmacy services will similarly be exempted and we will apply a number of measures to ensure such pharmacies provide a fully professional service within the provisions of the new contractual framework. Internet pharmacies, as with all retail pharmacies in England, Wales and Scotland, must be registered with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB). All pharmacies, whether or not they provide online services, are subject to the same statutory requirements and to the RPSGB&#039;s requirements, including standards, inspection arrangements and code of professional ethics.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>We will also introduce regulatory safeguards to protect against manipulation or abuse of the new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS81"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

freedoms. For example, the four exemptions will require applicants to provide a full and prescribed range of services. These would be for local determination by the PCT in relation to the first three exemptions, or nationally determined by the department in discussion with the NHS in relation to the exemption for wholly Internet or mail order-based pharmacies. Apart from dispensing prescriptions, such services might include managing a patient&#039;s repeat medication, helping patients to get the best from the medicines they are taking and promoting healthier lifestyles. For example, pharmacies are well placed to provide support for people at risk of coronary heart disease, giving advice on stopping smoking, or how to improve nutrition or physical activity.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>Key elements of our proposals, including the four exemptions, are either implicitly or explicitly linked to the delivery of pharmaceutical services under the new contractual framework. Our plan is to implement these reforms in tandem with that framework. The department has held tripartite negotiations on the framework with the PSNC and the NHS Confederation for the past 18 months. On 24 August, the PSNC accepted our offer of funding subject to final agreement on a number of detailed issues which we are discussing with it and the NHS Confederation. We aim to conclude these as soon as possible. We will prepare and consult on the necessary regulatory changes and aim to implement the reformed regime as soon as is practicable thereafter.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>Guidance for the NHS on how to implement the regulations was last drawn up in 1992. An overhaul is long overdue. So we will amend this information to bring it fully up to date to assist PCTs in implementation. This would include developing supplementary questions to inform PCT assessments of pharmacy applications. We will also propose enhanced data collection from PCTs, subject to approval by the body overseeing NHS data requirements, to inform assessment of progress on our package of reforms and evaluate the impact of these exemptions in 2006.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>We will also take additional steps as proposed to further modernise and reform the current system through a combination of regulatory and administrative changes.

</p>

<a name="40907-52_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>PCTs will be able to invite applications from contractors. We will revise the application forms to reflect the criteria that PCTs use in assessing applications. We will require PCTs to reach a decision on an application within four months of the due date for receipt, unless there is good cause. We will also require them to consult widely with patient, consumer and local community groups that have a direct interest in local pharmaceutical provision, and set an administrative minimum consultation period of 45 days.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>We will introduce an automatic exemption for all minor relocations under 500 metres, but retain the discretion for PCTs, to override this where there is good cause. An example of this would be where geographical obstacles or transport difficulties would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS82"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS82</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

affect continued access to pharmaceutical services. Similarly there will be a minimum 12-month trading period requirement before a further application for a minor relocation can be accepted, unless, again, the applicant shows there is good cause.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>We will remove the current restriction, which prevents cross-PCT boundary minor relocations, but ensure there are means to remove the contractor from the list of the PCT he is leaving and the receiving PCT agrees to the relocation.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a>We will retain the concept of preliminary consent for a pharmacy application, but will limit the maximum period for grant of such consent to six months.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a>Similarly, we will provide for a maximum period of grant of full consent of nine months. We will also enable PCTs to have the discretion to require an applicant to commence pharmaceutical services within a given period not exceeding three months unless there is good cause.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>In addition, we will introduce two measures proposed to us by the advisory group. We will allow PCTs to set a fixed date every month for the receipt of applications. And we will require PCTs to deal with applications that do not require local consultation within a maximum of 30 days. However, we will retain in guidance the long-stop discretion which enables PCTs to decide competing applications of equal merit on the basis of &quot;the first past the post&quot;. We will also reform the appeals system. We will allow appeals for change of ownership to be combined with appeals concerning minor relocations.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a>Certain of our proposals would require primary legislation. When parliamentary time permits, we will consider introducing new legislation to enable reasonable charges, but not full cost recovery, for pharmacy applications to be introduced. We will also consider enabling PCTs to take into account, when assessing applications, the improvements they would bring to the provision of, or access to, over the counter medicines and other healthcare products. We do not intend, however, to introduce legislation to enable charges to be levied for appeals. We would consult further on such legislation.

</p>

<a name="40907-52_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a>We also plan to introduce, subject to further discussions, measures developed by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association and the Dispensing Doctors&#039; Association to reform the rules governing NHS rural dispensing. These bodies reviewed their proposals in the light of the government response to the OFT report and presented their findings to the advisory group, which in turn recommended that they should proceed. Officials from the department have met these organisations recently to hold further discussions on how best the reforms should be introduced to the current legislation. We aim to implement these in tandem with the other reforms I am announcing today.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>The measures I have announced represent an important step forward for community pharmacy services and our ambition to deliver a balanced <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS83"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

package of reform measures. They will raise standards for patients and encourage innovation and excellence in service provision while at the same time supporting community pharmacies, many of which are small businesses. Community pharmacies provide a highly valued service and we are committed to their ongoing development and integration in the NHS. We also want to ensure that our reforms do not mean that services to more vulnerable groups of patients or those in deprived or rural areas suffer.
</p>

<a name="40907-52_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>We are determined to improve access to, and the choice of, pharmacy services so that community pharmacy is recognised as a key player in the provision of NHS services. These reforms will provide an environment in which community pharmacy services can thrive.

</p>

<a name="40907-53_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a>I would like to report on this summer&#039;s results for key stages 1, 2 and 3, GCSE and A-level, which show that we are making steady progress in raising standards at every level.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS85"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>At age 7, key stage 1, 85 per cent of pupils achieved the expected level in reading (an increase of 1   percentage point over 2003) and 90 per cent of pupils did so in maths (unchanged from 2003).1
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a>At age 11, key stage 2, a record 77 per cent of pupils achieved the expected level in English, an increase of 2   percentage points from last year (up 12 percentage points compared to 1998), and 74 per cent of pupils achieved the expected level in Maths, a 1 percentage point increase from last year (up 15 percentage points from six years ago). These are good results and show that standards achieved by pupils in our primary schools are continuing to improve. Pupils and parents can be confident that their primary schools are still getting better and better.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a>Standards at key stage 2 are improving in all areas but some of the biggest strides are in some of the poorest areas, such as Hackney, where English improved by 7 percentage points and maths by 6   percentage points compared to 2003, and Sunderland, where there was a 5 percentage point improvement in English and a 4 percentage point improvement in maths. Among other LEAs Hartlepool and Southampton recorded the highest improvements in both English and maths results. It shows that poverty is not a barrier to success. It is a tribute to the hard work of teachers who have made this possible. We will continue to offer them targeted help and support.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a>At 14, I am pleased to see progress made in maths. At key stage 3, there has been a 2 percentage point increase in the number of pupils achieving level 5 in maths and over 50 per cent of 14 year-olds are now reaching level 6 in maths, which is a tremendous achievement. There has been a 2 percentage point fall in the number of pupils achieving level 5 in science compared to last year, although there has been a 10   percentage point increase since 1998.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a>Publication of key stage 3 English results has been deferred until the outcome, in terms of scale and nature, of the extended marking process for schools is known. Under the national statistics code of practice, it is the statistics head of profession in the department who decides on the content and timing of the release of national statistics, and provides advice to Ministers.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>At GCSE, I welcome the rise in the number of entries achieving top grades for all candidates in England and Wales&#151;the biggest rise in A* to C grades since 1999. The provisional results show that:

</p>

<a name="40907-53_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>Grades at A*&#150;C for all candidates in England and Wales have increased by 1.1 percentage points to 59.2 per cent (compared to a 0.2 percentage point rise last summer);

</p>

<a name="40907-53_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>97.6 per cent of GCSE entrants achieved a grade A*&#150;G&#151;the same rate as last year;
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>Grades A*&#150;C at maths have increased by 1.6   percentage points to 51.7 per cent. English is up by 0.2 percentage point to 59.9 per cent;
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS86"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-53_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>An increase of entries in chemistry of 5 per cent, in physics of 5.1 per cent and in biology of 4.4 per cent;
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a>Boys&#039; improvement at grades A*&#150;C has increased by 1.3 percentage points compared to 0.9 for girls.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a>These results are excellent and reflect the hard work of pupils and teachers. I am encouraged that more pupils are taking maths and gaining good grades, mirroring the rise for 14 year-olds. It is also good to see more pupils taking science.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a>As with the primary schools, some of the biggest improvements this year have been in schools in some of our poorer and lowest attaining areas. In North Tyneside early indications are that the GCSE results have increased from 48 per cent of pupils gaining five or more good GCSEs to 54 per cent this year. At school level the International School in Birmingham increased from 9 per cent of its pupils gaining five A* to C grades last year to 32 per cent this year&#151;still a long way to go but huge improvement and a tribute to the leadership of these schools.

</p>

<a name="40907-53_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a>A further example of this improvement can be seen in London. For the first time all London boroughs are now achieving above 40 per cent of pupils gaining five A* to C grades at GCSE. The provisional results also indicate that some of the fastest-improving areas are among the most deprived boroughs: Islington is up by 7 percentage points; Tower Hamlets is up 5.3 percentage points; Haringey is up by 5.6 percentage points; Hackney is up   by 5.8 percentage points; Lewisham is up by 6.3   percentage points and Newham is up by 3.9   percentage points.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a>These results build on very fast improvement from last year&#039;s results when Hackney was up by 8   percentage points and Islington up by 5 points. So the trend is clearly upwards.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a>At A-level, the overall pass rate rose to 96 per cent from 95.4 per cent last year. A grades at A-level increased by 0.8 percentage points to 22.4 per cent and the overall AS pass rate has increased by 0.2   percentage points to 86.9 per cent. Excluding general studies, English and mathematics attracted the highest number of entries at A-level and are two of the three most popular subjects at AS.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a>These results are built on the hard work of students, schools and colleges and will open up more opportunities for our young people to achieve success. I congratulate the students and thank our teachers for their commitment.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a>At a time when Ofsted says the standard of teaching has never been higher, we should expect to have rising levels of achievement in our schools and colleges. We are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them and applaud their teachers, schools and colleges.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a>I am determined that we should move forward to improve performance further. We will continue to progress with some important developments from the start of the new school term.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a>506 specialist schools will begin operating as specialist for the first time this September. This means that 2.1 million pupils will be educated in one of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS87"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

1,954 specialist schools&#151;62 per cent of all English secondary schools, up from just 257 in 1997. The evidence shows that specialist schools help pupils to gain better grades.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a>Five new academies open in Barnet, Hackney, Hillingdon, Lambeth and Northampton. They will build on the success of the existing 12, where I was pleased to see some excellent GCSE results this summer&#151;for example The King&#039;s Academy in Middlesbrough where 34 per cent of pupils achieved five or more A*&#150;C GCSEs, an increase of around 12   percentage points on the joint results of the predecessor schools in 2003.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a>Workforce Reform is in the next phase and the radical enhancement of the role of teachers continues. There are not just more teachers than at any time since the early 1980s, but teachers are being given professional support in class with more assistants. Teachers will increasingly have more time to prepare better lessons.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a>Education maintenance allowance will be available nationally to help young people to stay on in education, at school or college.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS88"></a>

<b>7 Sept 2004 : Column WS88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40907-53_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a>On ICT, current activity focuses on supporting the personalised learning and transforming school workforce agendas. Over 99 per cent of schools in England are now connected to the Internet, of which, at June 2004, 61 per cent of primary and 98 per cent of secondary had a connection at broadband speeds appropriate to their needs.
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a>Schools continue to invest in the new technologies that support enhanced teaching and learning. By March 2004, 63 per cent of primary schools had an electronic interactive whiteboard (average 1.9 a school) and 92 per cent of secondary schools (average 7.5 a school).
</p>

<a name="40907-53_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a>In the longer term I am looking forward to receiving later in the autumn the final report from Mike Tomlinson&#039;s working group on 14&#150;19 reform. He will be coming forward with proposals looking at how we stretch the most able, boost participation, improve the vocational offer and reduce the burden of assessment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_41"></a>1 Figures for 2004 and 2003 are not strictly comparable because of the trial involving 34 LEAs and a quarter of seven year-olds which reported only teacher assessment.

<p><a name="wa_st_37"></a>
<a name="40907w05_spnew0"></a><b> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>   Improving adults&#039; access to training, whether to develop their existing career or to move into an entirely new area, is one of the aims of the skills strategy.
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>Our skills strategy set out further opportunities and reforms to enable individuals to retrain. It committed us to develop apprenticeships for adults to meet skills needs in response to employer demand. We and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) are working with sector skills councils (SSCs) that are either already licensed or expected to be so in the near future, to trial appropriate provision in a small number of sectors in England starting later this year.
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a>SSCs are influential employer bodies, licensed by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, in consultation with Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to tackle the skills and productivity needs of their sector throughout the UK. There are SSCs covering both plumbing (SummitSkills) and carpentry (ConstructionSkills).
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>SummitSkills aims to support employers and employees to achieve appropriate recognition of their plumbing skills. Mature apprenticeships will be introduced in some parts of the UK during 2004. The local plumbing training centre will be able to advise on the provision in each area. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland there are differences in provision and the local centre will provide specific guidance.
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>ConstructionSkills has identified addressing the issue of retraining adults as a priority but the work is still at a very early stage.

</p>

<a name="40907w05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>The Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) programme was announced in 2001. These centres, which are based within colleges and other training providers, receive extra funding to enable them to develop high quality skills training to meet employers&#039; current and future skills needs.
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>There are now 260 centres offering adult learners a wide and diverse range of skills training for careers in many industries including construction (including plumbing and carpentry skills), which is currently served by 40 centres (15 per cent of the network). More centres will follow as the LSC is committed to creating a network of 400 centres by March 2006.
</p>

<a name="40907w05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a>From 2006, when the full network is in place, it will provide 40,000 qualifications and awards each year at levels 2 and 3, and 800 foundation degrees. It will have increased levels of employer engagement, with 20,000 employees benefiting from tailored provision paid for by their employers.

The statutory guidance <i>Inclusive Schooling</i> published in 2001 followed the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act and provided further explanation of, and guidance on, the operation of the statutory framework, setting out the reasonable steps that could be taken to ensure a child&#039;s inclusion in mainstream schools and providing examples of instances where inclusion may not be appropriate.

<a name="40907w05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The Ministry of Defence does not maintain a rolling 12-month forecast of procurement announcements.

</p>

<a name="40907w06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_47"></a>The Government are aware of two studies in the United States suggesting that US veterans who had deployed to the Gulf in 1990&#150;91 were nearly twice as likely as their non-deployed counterparts to develop MND. The findings were published in the peer review literature last year. The small number of cases identified and the methodological constraints mean that the findings must be considered only as preliminary. Moreover, the increased risk identified was not uniform across all deployed personnel. The research does not link MND with any specific environmental factors associated with Gulf service.

<a name="40907w09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville </b>  : Offshore wind farms had received only around &#163;0.5 million in support from the renewables obligation and climate change levy by May of this year because of the limited amount of offshore capacity actually in place at this point.

The work that the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) do to reduce poverty, human rights abuse and conflict in poor or badly governed countries helps to remove the conditions which produce asylum-seeking. The Government have also put in place a range of measures designed to tackle abuse of the system which have already contributed to a reduction of more than 50 per cent in the number of new applications when compared to the peak of October 2002.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_15"></a>Deployment of new detection technology at key continental ports for the effective searching of vehicles before embarking on ships to the UK.


</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_16"></a>An informed visa strategy (including direct airside transit visas) designed to establish qualification for entry before arrival, and which is kept under regular review with requirements, imposed or lifted in response to immigration pressures and wider considerations.

</ul>
<a name="40907w10_para7"></a>

<p><a name="wa_st_89"></a>
<a name="40907w11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </b>  The Government have no plans to cap the use of imprisonment by the courts. It is for the courts to decide when custody is the appropriate sentence. The Government have, however, consistently made clear their belief that prison should be reserved for the most serious, dangerous and seriously persistent offenders. We will ensure that there are sufficient prison places for that group. New sentencing provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will enable dangerous violent and sexual criminals to be kept in prison until they can be managed in the community, indefinitely if necessary.
</p>

<a name="40907w11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_73"></a>For other offenders, we wish to see a reduction in the use of short ineffective sentences for lower-level offenders, where tough community penalties would be more effective in preventing reoffending and ensuring offenders pay back to the community.

<a name="40907w11_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The first refugees to be resettled in Britain under the Gateway Protection Programme arrived from Africa in March 2004. So far a total of 69 have arrived and settled in Sheffield. Further groups will be received and located in a number of towns and cities in the course of the coming months, but it is not yet possible to give the precise numbers involved. Earlier delays to the programme arose as a result of administrative problems both in Britain and in Africa; these have now been settled for the most part.

<p><a name="wa_st_96"></a>
<a name="40907w11_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  According to the latest figures we have from the United Nations (UN), by mid-July some 10,000 militia officers and soldiers had passed through the UN-led programme of demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration. Around 2 per cent chose to enlist in the Afghan national army (ANA) or police force as their reintegration option. A further 10 per cent will assist with de-mining. The overwhelming majority of demobilised personnel have elected to enter civilian society through vocational training, small business training or agriculture. The ANA has now expanded to four battalions consisting of around 12,000 personnel in total. ANA units regularly operate effectively alongside coalition forces on arms collection and counter-insurgency missions throughout Afghanistan.

<p><a name="wa_st_97"></a>
<a name="40907w11_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  It is standard NATO practice for member states to fund their own deployments.

Other troop contingents or civilian representatives from partner nations are funded by the country that provides them.

<a name="40907w11_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </b>  NATO&#039;s agreed plan for expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is based on phased expansion of the network of provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) across Afghanistan. One of the aims of the PRTs is to support the Afghan central government in extending their authority in the regions. The communiqu&#233; from NATO&#039;s summit in Istanbul on 28 June states that NATO will provide appropriate support, within ISAF&#039;s mandate, to the Afghan authorities in taking resolute action against the production and trafficking of narcotics.

<a name="40907w12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_77"></a>In the longer term, sustainable improvement in security can only come through developing the capabilities of Afghanistan&#039;s own security and law enforcement institutions. The international community has made a long-term commitment to Security Sector Reform (SSR). The UK has been very active in this. We have committed &#163;70 million over three years from 2003&#150;04 to assist the Afghan authorities in their efforts to combat the production and trafficking of illegal narcotics. The UK is also active in police reconstruction; reform of the Afghan National Army; the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process; and the justice sector. As the paper points out, provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) provide both short and long-term support, helping the Afghan authorities create a more secure and stable environment and thereby facilitating SSR. We fully support the PRT &quot;stabilisation&quot; model promoted in the paper, and the UK PRTs in northern Afghanistan have demonstrated what it can achieve.

For the subjects in the study, there were small differences in indices of bioavailability between the trials of the various types of water, but the results were compatible with the conclusion that the source of fluoride and the hardness of the water had no important influence on the bioavailability of fluoride. This conclusion agrees with the findings of the earlier study quoted in the report, <i>Chemistry and bioavailability aspects of fluoride in drinking water</i>, which concluded &quot;In terms of chemistry and bioavailability there is absolutely no difference between added and natural fluoride&quot;. Much of the evidence bearing on the safety of fluoridation of drinking water consists of epidemiological studies in populations exposed to fluoride occurring naturally in water supplies.

Notes:<br>

<br>

1 In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in these years is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in subsequent years.<br>

<p><a name="wa_st_142"></a>
<a name="40907w17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  We have recently received a report from the Review of Marine Nature Conservation Working Group which makes recommendations to government on possible measures to improve the protection afforded to important marine features and ecosystems, including what use could be made of marine protected areas. The Prime Minister&#039;s Strategy Unit recent report on fisheries, <i>Net Benefits, </i>also recommends that an experimental programme of marine protected areas should be developed. The Government will be developing their response to these recommendations in the coming months. The issue of marine protected areas is also being considered through the UK&#039;s involvement in the OSPAR Convention.

<a name="40907w17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_106"></a>In addition, we are currently preparing regulations to extend the application of the Habitats and Birds Directives to the offshore marine area which will allow the designation of sites for species of European importance. We have already identified the Darwin Mounds as a candidate site and through the Common Fisheries Policy the EU have introduced measures to protect the site from damaging fishing activities. To date there are 71 special protection areas for birds and 62 candidate special areas of conservation which contain an inshore marine element.
