Transfer should take place before 31 December. The Iraqi authorities have given assurances that residents will be treated humanely. The Iraqi human rights ministry plays a key role in the transition. The US and the ICRC continue to follow developments at the camp closely and are content with Iraqi assurances so far received. The US and Iraqis have discussed the transfer with UNHCR and UNAMI.</p>

Does he realise that expulsion in those circumstances would almost certainly mean execution? This is an extremely serious situation. Can he assure the House that he will keep a very close eye on developments and secure what guarantees he can from the Iraqi Government to avoid what would otherwise become a humanitarian catastrophe?</p>

The US has sought clear understandings from the Iraqi authorities that there will be no such expulsions and that the group will be properly protected. The ICRC is content so far with the understandings received.</p>

However, it has been the intention of the Americans in the understandings that they have sought from the Iraqis that Camp Ashraf remains open, and therefore that those individuals in it will not be expelled.</p>

Surely that must be the legal position.</p>

<a name="81126-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08112640000024"></a>I return to the point made by my noble friend Lord Eden. In the light of the directive issued by the Iraqi Government on 17 June, it is surely very odd to take at face value present assurances by the Iraqi Government that these people will not be expelled, because the directive to which I referred calls for their expulsion.</p>

I think that they are satisfied that that is the case. As to the UK&#146;s legal responsibility, it is our view that the MEK/PMOI specifically chose American forces to surrender to. Secondly, the proclamation from the multinational commander at the time in 2004 that confirmed camp resident status as being &#147;treated as protected persons&#148; was clearly made on behalf of the United States alone.</p>

That is why I assure my noble friend that the United States has worked hard to make sure that the camp remains open and people are not at risk of return.</p>

This is being done in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="st_21"></a>

Furthermore, is it not strange that there is a complete lack of sensitivity on behalf of the Foreign Office in locating this in Chennai, which is the one part of India where the Tamil Tigers have considerable influence and, as the noble Lord will know, where Prime Minister Gandhi was blown up by the Tigers. Secondly, is it not strange that, even at this stage, it is not possible for processing to return to a sovereign nation of 18 million people&#151;one of the handful who supported us at the time of the Falklands crisis.</p>

All of the detail is then passed to Chennai. That is done because we get an improved quality and consistency of decision-making about visas. We know that because we have assessed it with external sources. For example, we know that Sri Lankan nationals holding visas have been subsequently detained for less time when trying to get into the UK. The number detected as having incorrect visas has dropped as well. Not only that, by adopting this hub and spoke method around the world, we have saved in the region of &#163;7 million this year. As I said, we have actually improved quality and consistency. It is more productive and cost-effective and people do not have to travel to Chennai.</p>

On 29 October, we announced that we are spending more than &#163;700 million, which will cover a whole range of vehicles, some of which are upgraded. Many of the vehicles that we need cannot be bought off the shelf and require a great deal of development. Even when the basic vehicle is available, we often have to spend an awful lot of money to get them up to theatre-entry standard, given all the extra protection that we now know is necessary.</p>

Preliminary analysis of the company's numbers by our financial advisers suggested that Granite moving into pass-through would not be detrimental to the interests of the taxpayer.</p>

Does he agree that throughout the passage of the Northern Rock legislation we were consistently told by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, that there would be no exposure to Granite as a result of the nationalisation of Northern Rock? Will the Minister confirm that the non-asset trigger, and indeed the arrears trigger which also happened last week, means that Northern Rock will now receive nothing from Granite until all the other bondholders are repaid and that, if there is any shortfall, Northern Rock remains exposed for the &#163;3.3 billion or so seller share, which, one way or another, will end up being borne by the taxpayer?</p>

The seller&#146;s interest share fell below that because Northern Rock concluded that it wished neither to put high-quality assets into Granite&#151;it had not done that since September 2007, which is totally in accordance with its agreement under state aid not to grow its book of business&#151;nor to take assets out of Granite. Accordingly, under rapid amortisation, its position moves from pari passu to subordination, but it has not changed in terms of the quality of the underlying assets in place to meet its obligations. I confirm that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is correct that the taxpayer has no specific responsibility related to Granite. Granite is not guaranteed by Northern Rock or the taxpayer.</p>

These are long-term commitments. As a former employee of a major American bank, he well knows that one cannot factor in a specific analysis to explain a market development. The stock market has continued to fall since we took action to support the British banking system.

However, I gather that Granite was not part of the Northern Rock nationalisation. Is the press report correct that we have some exposure to Granite? If that is the case, what kind of totally unsecured bond did we take in Granite, if we took one at all, which I hope we did not?</p>

That was not the case; there was not a legal obligation either to feed Granite with new mortgages or to remove bad mortgages from it. As the vehicle declines in size, the quality of mortgages in these types of vehicles&#151;all these types of vehicles, not just Granite&#151;will decline, because the good mortgages are paid off earlier. That is a phenomenon which is common to structured investment vehicles of this sort, which is why there is a facility to go into pass-through, and a switch from pari passu to subordination in the structure. What is happening here is what was envisaged in these structures. This structure was simply too big for Northern Rock, and has become enormous, standing beside a contracting Northern Rock. Therefore, it is entirely proper that the structure should be wound down as a prelude to returning Northern Rock to public ownership.</p>

<a name="81126-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08112640000096"></a>As noble Lords will know, an upper-capacity cap for the feed-in tariff scheme has been defined in the Bill to give clarity and certainty to investors in large-scale projects under the renewables obligation. Our original amendment set an upper cap in the Bill of 3 megawatts. As I said when I first introduced the feed-in tariff clause, we want the upper cap to be high enough to give us sufficient flexibility to ensure that we are able to direct support to small-scale projects at the right capacity.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81126-0003.htm"/>


<a name="81126-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08112640000097"></a>Since the debate we have reflected more on the arguments put forward by noble Lords and other interested parties that the upper limit on this power gives enough flexibility for us to ensure that appropriately sized smaller-scale projects are effectively incentivised to come forward. We still believe that setting this limit as high as 10 megawatts, which was the subject of an amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, would be too disruptive to larger-scale renewable investments under the renewables obligation. Having listened to the debate in your Lordships&#146; House and to other considerations in which we have taken part, we think that it would now be prudent to set the upper limit at 5 megawatts. If further analysis and evidence gathers support, this higher upper limit would give us the flexibility to implement a feed-in tariff to support smaller-scale projects up to a possible maximum capacity of 5 megawatts.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08112640000098"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that we have a power in the Bill to set the upper cap below this maximum level. As part of the process for consulting on the details of this scheme we will undertake further analysis to determine the limit at which the feed-in tariff should be set below the 5 megawatt cap. Our guiding principle in following the capacity cap has been to preserve the investment being successfully delivered by the renewables obligation. This is very important since the renewables obligation will remain the key mechanism for supporting large-scale renewable projects. I reassure noble Lords that 90 per cent of onshore wind capacity to date is delivered by projects above the 5 megawatt limit that is now proposed on the feed-in tariff.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08112640000099"></a>I should also say that as part of the Pre-Budget Report this week, we announced our intention to strengthen the renewables obligation by extending the scheme by 10 years beyond its previous end date of 2027. This is to ensure that investors can plan with confidence for the future, making renewable electricity investment more viable and helping us to achieve our renewable energy targets.</p>

I believe that it gets the balance right between the renewables obligation and feed-in tariffs.

I am glad to see the Minister nodding at that. Noble Lords will remember that on Third Reading I tabled an amendment to reduce the figure to 1 megawatt. I was therefore somewhat surprised to find myself being demonised, if I may put it that way, by one or two speakers in the other place who accused me of trying to sabotage the feed-in tariff scheme. One honourable gentleman quoted what I said, which I am surprised to find is in order in that House. Under our rules, I am not at liberty to quote what he said. But I can say that I made my intention very clear when moving the amendment when I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08112640000245"></a>&#147;I am seeking by the amendment to give the Minister the opportunity to explain to the House what lies behind the Government&#146;s thinking for the 3 megawatt cap&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>5/11/08; col. 239.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112640000230"></a>That is still my position and I hope that those at the other end who bother to read the <I>Official Report</I><I></I>of this place will recognise that demonising me was perhaps not wholly appropriate.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08112640000103"></a>However, I still have a question, which is the same question that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked at Third Reading. How do the Government intend to use their power to fix different caps for different circumstances? The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, got a rather dusty answer when he asked that question, but I cannot help feeling that now that the Government are raising the maximum cap to 5 megawatts they must now have some idea of the circumstances in which a lower cap would be appropriate. The House will remember that I quoted observations from the very small company that was pressing for a very low cap because it felt that if it were too high it would lose out. It does very small renewable energy projects, at the domestic level and just above it. There must be some way in which the Government are going to differentiate and use their powers to fix different caps for different circumstances in the feed-in tariff. I do not wish to go on at length because there is an important debate to come and other noble Lords may wish to say a word. I hope that in his reply the Minister will be able to enlighten the House about how that is going to be done.</p>

However, I get the impression that if it were not for Prorogation, we might be back next week and the cap would be 10 megawatts and we would keep on going backwards and forwards. At least we now know that the figure is 5 megawatts. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the industry and the sectors involved need to know what the cap and the timescales will be for which bits of those sectors. Given the urgency of the renewable energy programme,  


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1451"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we are all concerned that there should be that certainty and that there should not be a pause in investment, which would damage those long-term aims, because no one knows which rules apply under 5 megawatts. I would love to hear exactly how the Minister foresees that happening and in what timescale, but I think he will be less than exact. As the Government have made these important decisions, I press them to get on with designing the scheme to let everybody know the rules of the game so that investment can take place.</p>

I also welcome, in a lukewarm manner, the 5 megawatt limit. Like others, I argued that there is no need for a limit, not because we wanted to undermine the ROC scheme&#151;we believe in it&#151;but because there are different sorts of users who are likely to use the feed-in tariff mechanism and therefore the two could coexist. The majority of such users will benefit from a 5 megawatt limit. For example, community schemes, farmers, single site operators and so forth will greatly benefit from the Government&#146;s move. While I understand that the Government need a bit of flexibility in case special cases arise, I hope that they will not make it too complicated by setting different limits for different sorts of application. Subject to that, I welcome the move upwards, and I believe that we will see schemes in this range that we would not have seen if we had not argued and convinced the Government of the need to include feed-in tariffs in the Bill. I congratulate the Government and, in particular, the Minister&#146;s new department for seeing the light on this issue.</p>

The scheme was proposed very late, so the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has not had a chance to consider them. The powers include powers in subsection (6) to amend primary legislation in subsection (5), so I would expect the affirmative resolution procedure to be used to approve such an order. I am not clear whether that will be the case. Can the Minister say how the powers will be exercised?</p>

As the Bill has progressed, we have had several debates on the level of the cap and it is clear that there is no level that will please everyone. However, I am pleased to see that the Government have ensured that the cap is high enough to make community schemes possible. I look forward to hearing more from the Minister as further details emerge about the implementation of the feed-in tariff.</p>

In particular, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for her remarks. Since I have taken part in our debates on the Bill from Report onwards, I have been struck by the constructive way in which they have taken place. Bringing this amendment to noble Lords today reflects that. I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that even if we were bouncing back and forth, 5 megawatts would have been the settled view of the Government on the matter.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08112640000110"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that we are not debating the insertion of the new clause as that went through at the previous stage; we are debating whether 3 megawatts or 5 megawatts should be the limit. I thank him and his committee for their comments. I well understand the difficulty for the committee because many amendments to the Bill were laid at a late stage. I understand that that has not always enabled the committee to report to your Lordships' House in the time that it would wish, but that has been because the Government have listened to the debates in this House and the other place. I am grateful to him and can confirm that the orders will be in the affirmative.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08112640000111"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty has always preferred for there to be no limit at all, but he will know that we have always thought that there ought to be a limit if we were to introduce feed-in tariffs, because it is essential that investors have certainty. Defining an upper limit at this stage gives investors the certainty required.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08112640000112"></a>I know that noble Lords now wish me to fill in the details of how the tariff will operate, where the cap will be set in relation to different technologies and whether there will be specific differentiation. I hope that I am not going to give to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and others what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, described as a dusty answer. I will try to give as much detail as possible. However, a lot of work needs to be undertaken before I can give definitive answers. Very simply, the Government decided only a few weeks ago to accept the principle of feed-in tariffs. That is why we need to undertake considerable work on this matter. I very much understand the need for action to be taken as quickly as possible and investors&#146; need for certainty. I recognise that we need as quickly as possible to help projects that might be regarded as transitional and to tell them whether they are likely to come under the renewables obligation or the feed-in tariffs and what the transitional arrangements should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08112640000113"></a>In the first half of 2009, we are launching our renewable energy strategy. We will then submit our more detailed proposals on feed-in tariffs for small-scale low-carbon electricity and on incentives for renewable heat, which we have also introduced in the Bill. In the light of those decisions, we will be in a position to set out in detail the expected contribution of on-site generation alongside other kinds of electricity and heat generation. I well understand the need for us to give certainty in these matters as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08112640000114"></a>It is then our intention to consult next summer on the detail of the regime, including proposals for tariff levels. In recognition of the need to make rapid progress towards the 2020 EU renewable targets, we aim to have the feed-in tariff system in place in 2010. Our ideal target is for the scheme to go live in April 2010 so that it can be aligned with the financial year of the renewables obligation. We well understand that investors and all those with an interest need speed and certainty, but delivering a fully operational scheme in a little over 16 months is a considerable challenge. We will do everything that we can to meet the target, but it is clearly important that we get the details right as well.</p>

I visited Kinshasa, North Kivu and Kigali. In Kinshasa, I called on President Kabila and pressed him on the need to find a political solution under the so-called Goma agreement to the problem of General Nkunda and the CNDP rather than trying to find a military option to resolve the problem. I also urged him publicly to denounce the FDLR&#151;the militia that is made up of Hutus who were involved in the Rwandan genocide and which is still the root of many of the problems in the eastern DRC. In Goma, I visited General Gaye, the acting commander of MONUC, the UN peacekeeping force, and discussed with him the situation on the ground and MONUC&#146;s needs. I also saw the governor of North Kivu and visited an internally displaced persons&#146; camp where I saw at first-hand the suffering that this conflict is causing. In Kigali, I called on President Kagame and urged him to continue to engage in the regional peace initiative and to maintain an ongoing dialogue with President Kabila, building on their recent meeting in Nairobi as part of a regional gathering. I also asked him publicly to denounce General Nkunda and the CNDP as part of a reciprocal renunciation of the FDLR by President Kabila.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08112640000120"></a>As I saw for myself in North Kivu, the situation in the region remains fragile. Despite the recent ceasefire agreements, there has been renewed fighting over the past week and the situation remains volatile. Since the

While the humanitarian consequences of the fighting are dire, it is the violence, insecurity and general lawlessness that is affecting the civilian population and hampering the delivery of assistance. Last week&#146;s fighting has resulted in fresh displacement in areas difficult for the humanitarian agencies to reach, although we are still not clear on the numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08112640000121"></a>I take this opportunity to thank all those people working in such difficult circumstances on this humanitarian crisis. I met many devoted NGOs and individuals working there. I also commend the lead role that the Department for International Development is playing in the response.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08112640000122"></a>Most humanitarian assistance is still getting through to camps around Goma, Rutshuru and Kiwanja. The World Food Programme is managing to distribute food aid sufficient for 200,000 people, and shelter materials have been supplied to displaced people around Goma and Rutshuru. Nevertheless, the situation remains precarious and access for humanitarian assistance can quickly be blocked if the fighting and lawlessness continue to spread.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08112640000123"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Government had already committed &#163;37 million of humanitarian assistance to the DRC for 2008. This included funding to ensure that supplies were in place to respond quickly to emergencies such as this. Much of our resource has been targeted on North Kivu. We announced an additional &#163;5 million on 31 October. Six DfID humanitarian flights arrived in Goma between 9 and 11 November carrying water purification materials, plastic sheeting, blankets and water containers, and &#163;2 million is to be used to assist the World Food Programme to source and distribute food in North Kivu. The rest will be channeled to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee and Oxfam for provision of water and sanitation, health assistance and other essential supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08112640000124"></a>Like all noble Lords, I am deeply disturbed by unconfirmed reports of FARDC soldiers&#151;the national Congolese army&#151;raping and killing civilians and of atrocities of equal severity committed by the CNDP forces. We also have reports from Human Rights Watch and other NGOs that there has been large-scale forced recruitment, including of children, not just by CNDP but by PARECO and the Mai-Mai militias.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08112640000125"></a>The deliberate targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, humanitarian aid workers and supplies is evidently in direct contravention of international humanitarian law and we hope that it will cease immediately. The targeting by the FARDC, the national army, of a therapeutic nutritional feeding centre on 19 November is a disgraceful example of this. MONUC has sent a team to investigate the alleged massacres at Kiwanja and the forced recruitment around Rutshuru. We await its report and encourage it to work with the Government of the DRC to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08112640000126"></a>The All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes will meet on 27 November to look specifically at sexual and gender-based violence in the DRC and will launch a report from the noble Lord, Lord Mance, on the subject. This is an important issue.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08112640000127"></a>This crisis has again underlined the fact that the Congolese state, for all the support that we and the international community have given it, is still a long way off track in reforming its national army. We need to review our support in this area. We are certainly willing to provide more support to help to reform the security sector, but for that to happen there needs to be a step change in the DRC Government&#146;s own approach. We would like to see a stronger commitment to tackling corruption within the army, which remains one of several key obstacles to the ongoing reform efforts.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08112640000128"></a>The UK&#146;s immediate goal is to ensure that the ceasefire agreed in October in North Kivu between the CNDP and the DRC Government remains in place and to try to bring an end to the fighting and allow humanitarian assistance to reach the displaced people around Goma and other affected towns in North Kivu. The cause of the immediate crisis is General Nkunda&#146;s CNDP and for that purpose we need to resume meaningful negotiations with the Congolese Government and the CNDP to end the current fighting. However, we must also tackle the longer-term underlying cause of instability in the Great Lakes: the continuing presence of the FDLR and the Hutu genocidaires within it in eastern Congo. Dismantling and repatriating the FDLR is an essential element in any long-term solution.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08112640000129"></a>Neither this nor a restitution of the status quo ante before the fighting began in October is enough. A long-term solution that finally brings stability, economic growth and development in eastern Congo and the broader Great Lakes region is needed and we are active in trying to achieve that goal. The Prime Minister has worked the phones, including calling President Kagame and discussing the crisis with both President Sarkozy, with whom he introduced a Security Council resolution, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. As I said, the Foreign Secretary also visited the region with his French counterpart at the beginning of November. We have strongly supported the appointment of former Nigerian President Obasanjo as UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes and we hope to work closely with him on his mediation efforts. Indeed, I have already been in touch with him a number of times.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08112640000130"></a>I attended the Nairobi summit on 7 November. The summit saw the first steps taken by the region and the United Nations towards a resolution of the conflict and injected fresh momentum into achieving full implementation of the Nairobi communiqu&#233; and the Goma accord. It also agreed on the establishment of a follow-up mechanism to drive implementation of these agreements and it saw regional leaders back Mr Obasanjo in his role as UN Special Envoy.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08112640000131"></a>I turn to the issues surrounding MONUC. The UN&#146;s peacekeeping mission in the DRC has a key role both in ensuring the implementation of the diplomatic   


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1456"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agreements&#151;the Nairobi communiqu&#233; and the Goma accord&#151;and in stabilising the current situation in order to allow full access for humanitarian assistance and protect civilians. With over 17,000 troops and 1,000 international civilian staff, MONUC is the biggest peacekeeping force that the UN has ever deployed. It also enjoys a broad mandate that allows it to tackle a wide range of challenges that need to be overcome if stability is to be brought to the DRC.</p>

<a name="81126-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08112640000132"></a>Nevertheless, the current crisis has highlighted the limitations that MONUC faces both in current force levels and in rapid response ability. Having followed MONUC from the beginning of its life, I have seen its responsibilities and mandate expanded, but all too frequently without the reinforcement of its logistical capability or its fighting forces that is required in order for it to carry out the ambitious Chapter 7 tasks that it has now been given. The Prime Minister announced on 13 November that the UK would support the request put to the UN Security Council by the UN Secretary-General to approve additional troops for the UN&#146;s peacekeeping force in DRC. Following on from this, the UK co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1843 on 20 November mandating the deployment of 2,785 additional troops and 300 police for MONUC. We are now working with the UN&#146;s Department for Peacekeeping Operations to identify contributors and to ensure that these troops are deployed to the DRC as soon as possible. Indeed, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced in another place today that he has written to those countries deemed most likely to provide additional troops to encourage them to do so and to say that we would offer whatever support we could to facilitate their urgent arrival in eastern Congo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08112640000133"></a>In the mean time, we continue to work closely with our Security Council partners to ensure that MONUC&#146;s existing resources are utilised as efficiently as possible and targeted where they are most needed. We commend MONUC&#146;s efforts to reinforce its presence in and around Goma by moving troops from other parts of the DRC. Now, 95 per cent of MONUC&#146;s troops are deployed in the eastern Congo.</p>

Unless we can apply political will, from this House and elsewhere, on the leaders of the region and the leaders of the militia to find a political solution to this problem, the likelihood that this situation will once more revert to a descending cycle of violence and civilian loss of life remains high.

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08112640000137"></a>Although the Security Council had the DRC on its agenda at the end of October for the first time since the end of March, until just now its response to a rapidly escalating emergency was a statement by the president and the secretary-general&#146;s assurances that it was indeed his number one preoccupation. One had a sense of d&#233;j  vu thinking back to the former secretary-general&#146;s commitment following the genocide in Rwanda to the UN,</p>
<ul><a name="08112640000248"></a>&#147;never again to fail in protecting a civilian population from ... mass slaughter&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112640000138"></a>and the independent inquiry&#146;s recommendations, for example, that member states be prepared to provide the necessary troops and logistical resources at short notice in support of peacekeeping operations. Yet it is only now, at this 11th hour, that the Security Council has authorised, as the Minister described, the deployment of an additional 2,700 troops and 300 police to the eastern DRC with already a quarter of a million people displaced from their homes over the past few weeks and lacking access to food, shelter and medical attention.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08112640000139"></a>President Kabila has demanded a stronger mandate for MONUC whereas all that SCR 1843 does is to underscore the present mandate, including what it describes as the robust rules of engagement. Can the Minister say whether the rules of engagement are being updated and whether they will be published so that civilians who are at risk will know what protection they can expect from the UN? On Monday, the Minister said at Question Time that there were caveats by some troop contributors which affected the competence of peacekeeping operations. Can he say something about the further steps being taken to persuade the relevant states to lift these restrictions?</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08112640000140"></a>Laurent Nkunda, whose spokesman last Friday said that the UN decision was,</p>
<ul><a name="08112640000249"></a>&#147;proof of the engagement of the international community to the Congolese people&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112640000231"></a>a couple of days later did a U-turn and said that the CNDP would not accept outsiders coming to Goma to provide security. He wants the UN&#146;s special envoy, former President Obusanda of Nigeria, to promote negotiations between the Government and the CNDP to deal with what he sees as key issues, such as the failure to disarm and demobilise the remnants of the Rwandan Hutu genocidalists in South Kivu, a point mentioned by the Minister in his speech. The point is that there was a plan to do that but not the political will to execute it, even before the disintegration of the national army deprived Kinshasa of the means.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08112640000141"></a>Is there now some hope of rehabilitating some of the units of the national army, with the UN calling for, among other resources, 200 additional military training instructors? Even where the remnants of the FARDC have managed to fend off CNDP attacks at Kanyabayonga, 175 kilometres north of Goma, a week ago, it is a mixed blessing for the inhabitants; as the Minister has said, there are reports of atrocities by   


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1458"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the national army, with the UN force commander saying that government troops, in this case, were looting the town. It would be good to know if the military instructors who are part of this UN resource will be given an active role in promoting better discipline within the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08112640000142"></a>Oxfam was supplying water to the 20,000 inhabitants of Kanyabayonga as of a couple of weeks ago, and it would be useful if the Minister could give us an update on access to the town and to other conflict-threatened centres of population for the humanitarian agencies. I join him in the tribute he has paid to the many agencies that are still operating in the region, even under considerable threat to their own security. UNICEF says that 85 per cent of the schools in the territory controlled by the CNDP remain closed to around 150,000 students in spite of promises that they would be allowed to reopen, and we join them in calling for all children to be able to resume their studies and to be protected from abuse, exploitation and violence, particularly from recruitment into the militias, as the Minister mentioned.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08112640000143"></a>Olusegun Obasanjo has been successful in negotiating humanitarian access to the area controlled by General Nkunda, but does his mandate allow him to report back on the goals of the rebels so that the UN can gauge the possibility of a negotiated solution to end the fighting and allow the CNDP to pursue its aims by political means? With the increase in the size of MONUC, Nkunda must realise that he is not going to be able to drive the UN out and so become the de facto ruler of the eastern DRC as a whole&#151;if that indeed were his ultimate objective.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08112640000144"></a>On the other hand, President Kabila&#146;s options are limited too. He has no control over the territory of North Kivu beyond Goma and the area surrounding it, from which Nkunda&#146;s forces withdrew voluntarily, and he has no military capacity anywhere in the eastern DRC that would allow that territory to be reoccupied. His spokesman reiterated yesterday that he is prepared to talk to Nkunda only within the framework of the January peace agreements, which have already collapsed. Is that not unrealistic? If so, do the Government not think that all parties to the agreements should come together again under UN auspices to see whether it could be amended or replaced by a new, more robust settlement? Does Mr Obasanjo need to be given a more precise remit to arrange such a meeting? Can we get the EU to persuade President Kabila that he has to be more flexible and not to insist on the letter of the Goma and Nairobi peace agreements? As the Minister has implied, the dialogue has to involve Kigali because, as everyone knows, Nkunda gets his marching orders and his military support from there.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08112640000145"></a>At the time, most observers warned that the Goma accord was a truce rather than a permanent deal, yet in the months that elapsed between the end of January and the resumption of fighting the international community made no collective effort to address its deficiencies that had been identified at the time. There is a lesson here for the UN too: it must actively address the underlying causes of a conflict that has led to a peacekeeping mission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08112640000146"></a>In the debate in another place a couple of weeks ago, there was general agreement with the proposition that violence in eastern DRC would not end until the root causes were addressed. In addition to the legacy of the Rwandan genocide, my honourable friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton raised the competition for mineral resources. Previously he had been given the brush-off with a reference to the EITI, a useful initiative, but not fully effective in the context of the DRC because of the premature disbandment of the UN Expert Panel, which had been gathering the evidence. It had produced a list of companies operating or trading in minerals from the region, but no action has been taken to halt these activities, which help to fund the conflicts. Have we checked on A&amp;M minerals, listed by the UN Expert Panel? What action has been taken by the NCP following her statement in July on DAS Air, and why was no mention made of the other three UK-based companies cited by the Expert Panel&#151;De Beers, Oryx Natural Resources and Avient? Are we making any further inquiries about Alfred Knight, the assayer who told the International Development Committee in 2007 that he was not doing work on a mine in North Kivu? What has happened following the DRC&#146;s Interministerial Commission, set up in April 2007 to re-examine mining contracts signed before 2003?</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08112640000147"></a>There were several mentions in another place of the appalling epidemic of violence against women in eastern DRC, referred to by the Minister, and on which the UN Rapporteur, Yakin Ert1/4rk, reported following a visit in July last year. She found that more than half of the acts of sexual violence were committed by state security forces, but in South Kivu the FDLR and its offshoots were the major culprits. Since then, matters have got even worse. The noble Lord referred to the report this week from Human Rights Watch. That allegation goes for the numbers of offences as well as the scale of the atrocities.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08112640000148"></a>The UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, says that the Hutu militias are the most vicious of the lot. Sexual violence has reached levels that exceed even the experience of the Rwandan genocide. What is MONUC doing specifically to protect women or to organise community self-defence against the rape gangs.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08112640000149"></a>I have exceeded my time but should like to ask two final questions. Have there been any offers to meet the specific needs itemised by the UN, particularly the 18 utility helicopters, with the personnel to operate them? Can the Minister say anything more about the timetable for getting these assets into the field?</p>

Surely no country in the world epitomises more accurately the old Irish adage &#147;Well, I wouldn&#146;t start from here&#148; than does the Congo. A brutal and rapacious colonial regime was rapidly followed after independence by a civil war in which the

That war was followed by a long period of autocratic kleptocracy, and then another civil war, in which many of the country&#146;s neighbours joined.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08112640000151"></a>Two years ago, democratic elections under UN auspices held out some prospect of a better future, but now the country is again teetering on the brink of an all-out civil war in which its neighbours get involved. This truly appalling sequence has brought massive suffering and loss of life to the population, and while some responsibility for this miserable state of affairs can be laid at the door of the Congolese themselves, the greater part of their troubles has invariably come from outside the country, fuelled by a desire to get control of its valuable mineral resources.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08112640000152"></a>In speaking in this debate, I should declare a non-pecuniary interest as chair of the board of the United Nations Association of the UK. The UN has had a long, and by no means entirely happy, involvement in the Congo. Embroiled in the civil war that followed independence, in what turned out to be a military enforcement capacity for which it was ill suited, it extricated itself, having preserved the unity of the country, but at the cost of the life of arguably its greatest Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjld. In recent times, it has been at the heart of international efforts to remedy the state failure which followed the departure of President Mobutu. As the Minister said, with 17,000 peacekeepers on the ground and a major civilian contingent, this is the UN&#146;s largest peacekeeping operation. As recent events around Goma have shown, it is not going well. We need to ask why, and not just to throw brickbats at the UN. We need also to ask what Britain, a major player at the UN, can do to help remedy the situation, not just give a weary shrug of our shoulders and turn away.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08112640000153"></a>So far as the military aspects of the peacekeeping operation are concerned, it surely cannot make sense to have spread the 70,000 peacekeepers all over that vast country and to have made no provision for a rapid-reaction capability within the force to cope with any emergency such as that which has occurred in the north-east of the country. The decision by the Security Council just before last weekend to increase the force by 3,000 is obviously a step in the right direction, but will the additional troops be forthcoming in a reasonably short space of time? Perhaps the Minister will say a little more about what we are doing to help with force generation. He said a few sentences on it but not much in detail; it sounded more like exhortation than logistical support and other things. Is thought now being given to constituting a rapid reaction capability, perhaps, as was done in Bosnia in 1995 when the peacekeeping operation there was on the point of collapse, and to it being better equipped&#151;indeed, perhaps not in blue helmets at all&#151;so that it can deal with the threat to the mission in a reasonably robust way? Does there need to be some adjustment to the UN&#146;s mandate and rules of engagement, where I echo the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury?</p>

It is obvious that the main focus now needs to be on the mediation efforts of the UN special envoy, former President Obasanjo, who appears to be making some initial headway. However, no UN envoy can ever hope to succeed without the concerted and sustained support of the main international players. What are we doing to use our undoubted influence with the Government of Rwanda to shift them from being part of the problem to become a key part of its solution? Is it not surely the case that Rwanda&#146;s security will never be achieved unless there is stability across its western border? That requires not a fellow Tutsi warlord but a political accommodation with the Government in Kinshasa, including action to deal with the Hutu genocidaire militias, which are still active in the region. Are we working closely with the French Government, who probably have more influence than us in Kinshasa?</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08112640000155"></a>It is deeply unfortunate and deplorable that, just when the main requirement is for both external and regional players in the Great Lakes region to work more closely together, the air is being filled with accusations and counteraccusations about responsibility for the event that triggered off the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. With an international tribunal determining responsibilities for that terrible episode, it should surely be possible for all other jurisdictions to leave the lead to that court and not to seek to exercise competing jurisdiction themselves. Is that the view of the Government, and, if so, what are we doing to persuade other actors that that is the best way to proceed?</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08112640000156"></a>Looking beyond the immediate crisis, are we giving any thought as to how to avoid the Congo&#146;s rich mineral resources continuing to be the focus of greedy incursions and destabilising activity? Does the success of the Kimberley process in dealing with illegally mined and traded diamonds, which did so much to fund the wars in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, offer some kind of pattern or template for similar action; for example, with respect to the coltan deposits in the eastern Congo? Are we learning a lesson from other peacekeeping operations that an excessive focus on the holding of elections may prove a distraction from the much more laborious, resource-intensive work of rebuilding state institutions, courts, public services and the rule of law more generally? Both in the Congo itself as well as in Bosnia, and perhaps Afghanistan next year, elections are not a kind of silver bullet or a cure-all and should not be presented as such. It is what happens when the elections are over that really matters, and that means planning ahead and situating the elections in a wider, longer framework of sustained international commitment. In this context, I suggest that it is a pity that the UN is still not making greater use of the UN Peacebuilding Commission or the UN Peacebuilding Support Office which were established following the 2005 UN reform summit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08112640000157"></a>As is often the case when crises occur in major UN peace-keeping operations, the organisation comes in for a good deal of criticism. Some of it is well deserved, but we need to remember that when we criticise the UN we criticise ourselves. The UN is not some kind of disembodied entity operating outside our control and area of responsibility; it represents the collective efforts of a world body, in which we still have considerable influence. I hope that the Minister, who has more

Its bishop wrote movingly to us as recently as last week, describing the plight of people in his diocese fleeing in terror from their homes, their men killed and their women and young girls most terribly abused. Had it been possible for my friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester to be in his place today, he would no doubt have spoken of the links that his diocese has with almost the whole Anglican province of Congo and of his own visits to that wonderful but presently tragic country. From these Benches, we join in tribute to the Minister both for this debate and for the way in which, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, indicated, he has clearly sensed from his own personal contacts and recent visit both the complexity of the situation in the DRC and the urgent need to find a solution that will bring some hope into a context of utter despair.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08112640000159"></a>This is an extended and messy conflict across a vast area from which accurate information is difficult to obtain. It is a conflict that has paid the dreadful price over 10 years of 5.4 million deaths in or as a direct result of combat, which is arguably the biggest loss of life as a result of conflict since World War II. By what means, through whose intervention and how soon can perhaps the 1 million all told who have fled from their homes return in safety, free from the insecurity and fear of wondering which militias may rape or kill them? How realistic is it to put much hope in a political process with Nkunda and Kabila, given the track record, and how realistic is it to believe that a political solution on its own, however desirable, which of course it is, can be put in place in time? Can the Minister tell us what results have emerged from pressing for a proposal for the appointment of a special adviser on human rights for eastern DRC as the Armani process resumes to monitor commitments made under Article 3 of the Goma agreement?</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08112640000160"></a>If a political solution on its own without appropriate extra forces as back-up does not work, the ensuing disaster not least in humanitarian terms will be very great. That brings me back to last week&#146;s plea from Goma and to the backing of EurAC, the network of European NGOs, for the immediate establishment and deployment of an effective disciplined European force to stabilise North Kivu. Our church contacts support the evidence that neither the DRC armed forces nor MONUC have sufficient ability adequately to support the Goma accord and Nairobi communiqu&#233;. I am somewhat concerned about the stress laid by Ministers in another place and by the Minister this afternoon on MONUC being the largest UN force deployed, with what seems to be the implication that its resources are adequate. Will the Minister acknowledge  


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1463"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that MONUC is facing conflict on at least four different fronts over a large area with a force that is only the size of that deployed to Sierra Leone&#151;a country one-twenty-fourth the size? The Minister will recall that for Kosovo, which is smaller than even North Kivu, we found 60,000 troops.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08112640000161"></a>I suspect that the UN reinforcements announced are likely to take three to four months to arrive in theatre. Or is the Minister suggesting that MONUC reinforcements can reach the DRC in weeks rather than months? If so, does he have any evidence for that, because it would be contrary to standard practice? I fear that there may be a danger of wishful thinking among all of us if that is the conclusion that we are hoping for.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08112640000162"></a>If there is, as I suspect, a delay of a few months, what will fill that gap? I understand that the Government have no problem about providing practical help in the humanitarian terms that the Minister described this afternoon, or in terms of command, logistics and expertise, but the Government are clearly drawing the line at active service units at this stage. Will the Minister recognise that an EU force can be deployed quickly, be of high quality and fill that dangerous gap before UN reinforcements arrive? Or is he saying that the Government completely rule out the mobilising and deployment in the very short term of an EU/UK military stabilisation force? I hope not, because the desirable political solution is unlikely to be achieved without the backing that such a force would provide, if the UN reinforcements cannot get there quickly enough.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08112640000163"></a>In his written reply to the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, the Minister agreed that transforming the military, police and justice sectors is a key priority and not least, as he said in this debate, the disbanding as soon as possible of FDLR and the CNDP. However, does he agree that the integration into the national army without human rights screening of people, some of whom have an appalling human rights record, has added to the incompetency and the population&#146;s fear of the army? Will he say that proper attention should indeed be given to the effective screening of such people, including Nkunda himself if, as we hope and pray, we get as far as that.</p>

<a name="81126-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08112640000164"></a>There has already been reference in this debate to minerals and I welcome the Government&#146;s support for the Government of the DRC becoming a full member of the extractive industries transparency initiative. But what else is the international community, especially the EU and this country within it, doing urgently to stiffen the regulatory framework for the extraction and tracing of minerals? The voluntary OECD guidelines mechanism is the only one at present that can deal with identified abuses. The United Kingdom has recently improved the functioning of the mechanism here, although I think that it is still far short of its potential. Will the Minister confirm the Government's resolve to strengthen further their own commitment to the OECD?</p>

I refer in particular to the report very recently presented to the United Nations by a panel of experts relating to the funding of armed groups through the exploitation of minerals. I gather that this report is not in the public arena. Can the Minister say when that will happen and, indeed, if he is pressing for that publication? Does he agree that it is time for a more serious attempt to target sources of funding for armed groups in the DRC, both within the Congo itself and from the DRC&#146;s immediate neighbours and from further abroad?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08112640000166"></a>Of course the Government are right to be weighing up resources, priorities and implications in considering the Congo. How could they not do so? But from these Benches I join in emphasising that this conflict has already caused the most horrendous suffering, to a level that overtakes other conflicts in recent history; and that the Government ought to be intervening even more strongly than they already are. In his message to the Manchester diocese last week, the Bishop of North Kivu wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08112640000246"></a>&#147;We have experienced suffering that we have never known before. When our women and girls have been raped we fail to know what to say or what to do. We are overwhelmed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08112640000169"></a>The position in the east of Congo was aptly described in the brief that all of us as speakers today have received from Amnesty International. It states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08112640000232"></a>I have always said in your Lordships' House that there should be African solutions to African problems. I have been wrong in this, certainly no more so than on the DRC. As other noble Lords have mentioned, with more than 250,000 displaced people who have fled their homes since August and with estimates of a total number in excess of 1.2 million internally displaced people in the province, the situation in eastern Congo is already a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08112640000170"></a>I welcome the fact that the United Nations has authorised the reinforcement of MONUC with an additional 3,000 additional troops, but unless those troops are properly empowered to tackle the crisis, there remains the threat that if the rebel forces were to attack Goma, MONUC would be unable to protect the hundreds of thousands of refugees there. Does the Minister agree with the analysis of the shadow International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, who in a recent visit to the DRC said that Britain should help the United Nations with,</p>

Can the Minister elaborate on MONUC&#146;s level of success in establishing safe corridors of humanitarian aid through North Kivu?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08112640000171"></a>We all have very vivid memories of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when Hutu militias murdered well in excess of 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis. While General Nkunda claims that his main aim is to disarm the Hutu militias, he clearly has greater ambitions of controlling power in the region. Human Rights Watch recently said that his troops and the Congolese Government troops have been implicated in numerous killings, torture and rapes. If recent reports are to be believed, it appears that Rwanda is allowing its territory to be used as a recruiting ground for the CNDP. An article in last Friday&#146;s <I>Daily Telegraph</I> suggested that President Kagame was treading a thin line between actively helping the rebels and turning a blind eye to their use of Rwandan territory. Can the Minister elaborate on those claims?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08112640000172"></a>I agree with the assertion of Amnesty International that much of the failure can be laid at the door of the DRC Government, who have failed to deliver meaningful reform of their mining, justice and security sectors. But responsibility must also be taken by international donors who have failed to insist on such reforms. I had intended to speak about the horrendous violence against women, but the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, eloquently covered that point.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08112640000173"></a>The tragedy of the DRC is that the country has the potential to be one of Africa&#146;s most prosperous countries with its boundless natural resources, fertile soil and good rains, but sadly the ongoing conflicts and lack of infrastructure, as well as high levels of corruption and lack of accountability and transparency, have made it one of the riskiest countries for international inward investment. I was involved in the launch of the Global Peace Index, set up by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Its report considered some 30 variables and 140 countries around the world and judged those countries on the dividends of peace. Sadly, the DRC came 131st out of 140 countries. Under the circumstances, it is highly unlikely that international investment will flow back into the DRC until it can show signs of taking stronger control of the current crisis.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08112640000174"></a>Apart from military issues, I want to touch on a few of the infrastructure issues. Access to electricity across the DRC is less than 6 per cent, and in rural areas, where nearly 75 per cent of the people live, it is only 1 per cent. Can the Minister give an update on the Grand Inga dam project, which I understand will be the world&#146;s largest hydro power scheme, providing a power grid across Africa which will, one hopes, spur the continent&#146;s industrial and economic development? Apart from satisfying the need for extra electricity of countries such as South Africa, to what extent will this scheme satisfy the electricity needs of the people of the DRC?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08112640000175"></a>I should like to make brief mention of a conservation concern. As a long-standing trustee of the African wildlife conservation charity, Tusk Trust, I am particularly concerned about the Virunga national park, home to more than a third of the world&#146;s remaining mountain gorillas, where the illegal trade in charcoal is threatening not just the survival of these gorillas but a wide variety

Can the Minister give any encouragement as regards what measures can be taken to protect these endangered animals? As my noble friend Lord Hannay of Chiswick said, there is no doubt that the battle for control of the region&#146;s natural resources is fanning the flames of the civil war.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08112640000176"></a>I welcomed the appointment of President Kabila, whom I have met on several occasions, but sadly he has been long on promise and, so far, low on delivery. Just as every sound business needs good management, every successful Government need sound management. For there to be any chance of a longer-term solution in the DRC, effective measures have to be taken to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate, or even repatriate, armed group fighters and end the arms proliferation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08112640000177"></a>It will be an uphill struggle to reconcile divided communities, but it can be done. For me, as an African, the political miracle in our great continent was the success of President Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu in implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. There will also need to be root-and-branch reforms of the army and the police and the suspected perpetrators of human rights violations will need to be excluded from the army.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08112640000180"></a>Like others, I am glad that the Minister has been able to use his vast UN experience in conjunction with his position as a UK Minister to play the part that he has done in this crisis. We have heard about the loss of life, destruction and terrible fear caused by this latest crisis, as the right reverend Prelate so movingly conveyed. We have heard that some 1 million people have been displaced, although that number may have slightly reduced. The situation remains volatile, as the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others have emphasised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08112640000181"></a>We also know that some of the longer-term effects of such conflicts go on for many decades. This conflict links to the Rwandan genocide.

How quickly can these troops be forthcoming, how quickly can they be deployed and what will be done to ensure that they are used as effectively as possible? What of an EU force? What of a rapid reaction force, which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, mentioned? Should further troops be requested, what would Britain&#146;s answer be?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08112640000183"></a>We may not be able to play much of a part in terms of military contribution, as we are desperately overstretched by our involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. Surely that shows yet again the folly of what happened in Iraq. We and others have had resources directed away by that conflict, with consequences for what we and others can do when problems come up in countries such as Sudan and the DRC. We also know that the quality and equipment of troops are key issues. However, as other speakers have said, given the size of the country and the scale of the task, even increasing the troop numbers by 3,000 to 20,000 may not achieve what is required.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08112640000184"></a>Clearly, training up the Congolese army is a priority. What sort of timescale does the noble Lord think that that would involve? However, given the human rights abuses that we have just heard about and the history of conflict in the area, increasing the abilities of the Congolese army also has its risks. How might these be tempered?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08112640000185"></a>We have heard how a political solution is necessary. That is self-evidently so, but what a relief it is after the past few years to hear such a view voiced. The noble Lord&#146;s UN days have no doubt helped to shape his view of the world. The current military presence could help to encourage a political solution and perhaps bring pressure to bear on the signatories to abide by the peace agreements. Was it complacency and a lack of interest from the international community that contributed to the non-implementation of those accords? As my noble friend Lord Avebury asked: what can we do now to ensure that this does not happen again? What is the EU doing here? The International Crisis Group notes the apparent inability of the EU to speak with one voice and that at the October monthly meeting of EU Foreign Ministers the DRC was not even on the agenda. What can the noble Lord now tell us of the EU response?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08112640000186"></a>If we are to tackle this problem, surely, as others have said, we need to look at its economic roots. For Paul Collier, as he argues in his book <I>The Bottom Billion</I>, the DRC&#146;s mineral wealth is a two-edged sword. That wealth, which might have helped development, as the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, explained, has helped to fund the conflict instead. As Collier relates, Kabila, marching across Zaire with his troops to seize the state, told a journalist that in Zaire rebellion was easy: all you needed was $10,000 and a satellite phone. Everyone was so poor that with $10,000 you could hire yourself a small army and with the phone you could strike deals with mining companies. By the time Kabila reached Kinshasa, he had reportedly arranged $500 million-worth of deals. There is small-scale mining right across the area of this conflict. As the <I>New York Times</I> put it, its,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08112640000187"></a>It is reported that often western companies are not even allowed near the mines that they own, as these are controlled by warlords. Soldiers violently enforce a system of extortion from every worker, merchant and trader who comes to the mine. The UN Panel of Experts, to which others referred, listed how business activities had prolonged the conflict. It identified 85 companies that it considered to be in breach of OECD guidelines; 18 of these were British or British-based.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08112640000188"></a>Companies that were named subsequently fought back and the panel seemed to be forced to backtrack. In its final report, the vast majority of company cases were listed as resolved, but there are still unanswered questions as to how this verdict was reached. The countries where these companies were based were asked to take action against them. My noble friend Lord Avebury has battled away in Parliament pretty much single-handedly on this issue. He found that at one point only one junior person in the Department of Trade and Industry was tasked with taking matters forward against these major companies. That does not speak of governmental commitment. I gather&#151;it has been mentioned this afternoon&#151;that there has been another similar investigation, which is welcome, and that the report of it was given to the UN on Friday. I should like the Minister to assure us that this time the issue will be taken extremely seriously. I should also like assurance that any UK companies listed will be properly investigated and that, if appropriate, cases will be brought against them.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08112640000189"></a>Supply chains were an issue that came up when the Companies Bill went through your Lordships&#146; House. We fought hard and strengthened the Bill so that what companies do overseas and through their supply chains can more easily be brought within directors&#146; responsibilities. Does the noble Lord think that that might be relevant here? What might happen now in relation to DAS Air and Afrimex? Does he agree that Vodafone, for example, might be challenged on its supply chain in relation to coltan, used in mobile phones and mined in the DRC?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08112640000190"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, mentioned the Kimberley process. The German Government have supported work to develop a fingerprinting system that could lead to a mineral certification scheme for central Africa. What are the prospects for this scheme being adopted internationally?</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08112640000191"></a>The Minister and others spoke about the roots of this conflict in the Rwandan genocide. We welcome the actions that are being taken to try to strengthen the UN presence and protection in the DRC. However, this protection is clearly limited and all efforts must be made to support the current peace negotiations. To step back further, it is surely now vital that the economic factors in this conflict are firmly tackled. We have to act internationally to ensure that the reasons for this conflict are not fuelled by the free-for-all that so obviously exists, especially in the extractive industries in the DRC. I look forward to the Government taking this forward, not only through support for military action and peace negotiations but in tackling the economic causes of this conflict with a great sense of determination.</p>

He is right to warn that we are bound to approach all this with a heavy heart. The Congo has been the graveyard of UN and world ambitions and hopes for many years. One remembers the death of Dag Hammarskjld, the Katanga secession, Patrice Lumumba, and a whole series of tragedies down the years.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08112640000193"></a>One of my first assignments as a young journalist on the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> was to cover the return of the king of the Belgians from the independence celebrations, as they were called, in L&#233;opoldville almost 50 years ago. From that day, which was sunny in Brussels with crowds cheering&#151;I remember thinking that perhaps they would not go on cheering&#151;it has been a continuous downward path of tragedy, bloodshed, rivalry, greed and marauding tribes, groups and rebel organisations and the killing, killing, killing mostly of innocent people.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08112640000194"></a>The point that has emerged in the debate, which is worth repeating, is that this is a country of the most colossal size. It is the size of India, but without the communications that can link different parts of it together. One obvious conclusion is that any agreements made in Kinshasa or other provinces tend to be virtually unenforceable. Battles and wars can go on locally without any control, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester rightly reminded us. This is an enormous area and very difficult to pacify. The right reverend Prelate also reminded us of the devoted work of his colleague, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, who has given immense time and concern to the appalling poverty and conditions prevailing in many parts of the Congo, particularly in the area with which we are concerned.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08112640000195"></a>I rather miss the presence of my colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, who in her younger days, played a major role in intelligence matters in the Congo and other regions. I know that she would have given us a great deal of her wisdom on how things really work in this part of Africa. I hope that she will be back in a few weeks from her present indisposition to do that.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08112640000196"></a>As we have heard, the situation in and around Goma is immensely difficult. It is grim. The town is virtually cut off. Those of us sitting here in London have to ask why 17,000 UN troops&#151;and 3,000 more to come, we hope&#151;cannot at least contain the rebels, keep at bay the different marauding groups and, above all, protect the children, whose plight is horrific and sickening, if the reports are right. Children are not only being recruited into the various armies, but are being raped and hideously abused as well. This is a horror of almost medieval proportions, and it is hard to assimilate the terror and misery of it.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08112640000197"></a>To that question, I offer two answers, which have been touched on in this debate. First, the UN troops are obviously insufficiently trained and they have been criticised for being of low quality. There is even anecdotal evidence that they have been selling their equipment to  


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1470"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the rebels and are prepared to succour them in their activities. The UN troops were spread across the Congo, so I was glad to hear the Minister say that 95 per cent of them are now located in Kivu province. That is an improvement.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08112640000198"></a>The much bigger answer to the question of why there is not better control through the large UN force is the mandate, which was rightly mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Avebury. In theory, the mandate is under Chapter VII, but in practice, as my colleague in the House of Commons, Andrew Mitchell, observed, the carrying out of the mandate is being performed as if it were an exercise in Europe rather than a struggle in the darkest heart of Africa. I understand that there are total limitations on what collateral damage can be inflicted by UN actions. No helicopters are allowed to fly at night. All kinds of conditions are laid down about the accommodation conditions for the soldiery, which may be perfectly proper in a European theatre, but make no sense at all when applied in Africa. These limitations vastly limit the flexibility, mobility and manoeuvrability of the UN forces. The trouble seems to be that the forces of General Laurent Nkunda and other groups know that and regard the UN operation as not to be feared but to be more or less disregarded. It may have just about held the situation around Goma for the moment, but no more than that.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08112640000199"></a>One has to ask what is required to make some impact on this situation where very little is being made at the moment. The first thing would be to ask about reviewing and considering a new mandate under Chapter VII for the UN force already there and for the 3,000 troops to come. This point was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Hannay. Is it possible to think about reconstituting the UN force as a serious expeditionary force? There have been parallel suggestions that somehow an EU force could be inserted along the way. I feel uneasy about that. The pattern of bringing the AU, the EU and the UN together in a force operation has not had a glorious record in Darfur. In fact, it has achieved nothing there at all.</p>

<a name="81126-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08112640000200"></a>When I hear people advocating that we should pour money, men and concerted efforts into the Congo, I am not impressed or dazzled. We must be more precise about which groups we suggest should do that. The French and the Belgians seem quite ready to provide additional forces, and if they wish to do so under some kind of EU label, I would have no objection, but I could not countenance the idea of British troops going there as well, which one or two of your Lordships hinted at. It is worrying that our forces are so incredibly overstretched. That is worrying enough anyway, but when one hears the Foreign Secretary talking about possibly more troops for Afghanistan, or not ruling that out, and when one thinks of the seven-year campaign that has been going on in Afghanistan, with some progress in some areas but a miserable lack of progress in others, it makes one pause before thinking about trying to scrape together&#151;and it would be scraping together&#151;additional troop forces to add any new operation or additional reinforcement in Kivu province in the Congo.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08112640000201"></a>What can the Minister tell us about the new mandate and its possibilities? What can he tell us about talks with the French and the Belgians, who have indicated clearly that they would like to make some move in that direction? Rwanda was raised. The American Government seem to be rather supportive of Rwanda. We have to get to the bottom of the question of whether Rwanda is countenancing, either passively or actively, support for General Nkunda, which my noble friend Lord St John of Bletso rightly raised.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08112640000202"></a>Then there is the matter of economics, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. Are we in contact with multinational corporations and warning them about financing support for the conflicts, whether indirectly or directly? There is absolutely no doubt that illicit mineral sales are part of the causes of the conflict and are attracting the involvement of different tribal groups&#151;an incredible number of them. We have talked about General Nkunda and his mob; we have talked about the Hutu extremists who are exiled in the Kivu region; but I gather that even such exotic tribes as the Mai Mai, who believe that sprinkling themselves with magic water will stop the bullets, are involved. It is considered a free-for-all as people greedily look for mineral exploitation, as has been the pattern and the problem all along for the past half-century.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08112640000203"></a>In particular, we have heard a lot about columbite-tantalite, or coltan for short, which is used in pinhead capacitors in almost every computer and every mobile phone, including those that no doubt we are all carrying at the moment. In fact, the coltan production from the Congo area is a small part of world production, so it would not be a disaster for the world if it all came instead from Australia and Canada, which are the other main sources. As always, there is a disaster at the producing end. It may be produced under appalling conditions by manual workers who are virtually enslaved, but it is work, it is income, and if it is closed down in the name of impropriety or reluctance to use conflict materials, losses, starvation, misery and probably death follow for some of the already penalised and penurious families in the area.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08112640000204"></a>That is a sad pattern that, as I said, has gone on for half a century or more. I make no apology if my comments sound negative. We know that idealistic dabbling in the horrors of this regime, which seems so far from our daily worries, will result, as they have again and again in the past, in more slaughter and more misery, and will do so as long as greedy tyrants and dictators are allowed to stay in place.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08112640000205"></a>One day, there will be a better Africa, and it will need not only western help but the full force of global co-operation, including the rising Asian powers, which now have the resources and the money that the West lacks. However, that day is not with us yet, and until then we must mobilise all that we can on the humanitarian side. I believe that Her Majesty&#146;s Government are doing a great deal&#151;indeed, almost as much as is humanly possible&#151;on the humanitarian side, and that we should never hesitate to do those things or draw back from doing them anywhere in the world, despite those who say that perhaps we should not be involved. We should always seek to be involved on a humanitarian basis, but, when it comes to diplomacy and particularly

In my time in this House, rarely if ever have I heard such a well informed and thoughtful set of contributions, from a group of Peers who follow this issue very closely. I should say immediately that this kind of attention is critical. I can think of few conflicts whose fate rises and falls so much in sequence and in lock-step with political attention and political will. We must keep an international focus on this situation, and I commend all noble Lords who have spoken today for that reason.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08112640000207"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has spoken before about the Security Council&#146;s lack of attention. I take his point that there may have been an absence of resolutions over the months, although, as I have argued to him before, there has not necessarily been an absence of attention. As I have said, a resolution has now been introduced by France, co-sponsored by the United Kingdom, on the specific intervention of the Prime Minister, and there is no doubt in New York about the concern that we and others have to see a rapid deployment of a strengthened MONUC and a forceful political process, led by Mr Obasanjo. There will be a further resolution before the year is over to re-approve MONUC&#146;s mission for the coming year.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08112640000208"></a>Several noble Lords and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester asked whether the mandate should be stronger, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and others suggested. I put this question to General Gaye, the force commander, who argued that the question of the rules of engagement and the mandate is a red herring. This is a very robust mandate. It is a so-called Chapter 7 mandate, which spells out the obligation of the MONUC forces to protect civilians. His argument, and my view, is that it is not in the language of the mandate or the rules of engagement but rather in the capacities and the leadership of MONUC forces, and in the role of MONUC&#146;s partner, the FARDC&#151;the national army&#151;extraordinary though that might be, which is viewed in the mandate as the partner on whose behalf MONUC acts, to reinforce its own actions.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08112640000209"></a>I shall respond to each of the points that have been made. On capacities, MONUC, as I said in my opening remarks, has grown from what was originally intended as a light monitoring force to monitor a series of ceasefires to a situation in which, as the right reverend Prelate observed, it is active on four fronts. It seeks to contain the LRA, the Ugandan Lord&#146;s Resistance Army. It is active in several other parts of the eastern Congo and, not long ago, was active in Kinshasa after the elections to make sure that violence did not break out between the losing side and the Government. I should clarify for the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that when I said that 95 per cent of MONUC&#146;s forces are now in the east, that does not refer solely to North  


<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1473"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Kivu. It is in all the provinces of the east because it is engaged in very delicate, difficult stabilisation efforts in the whole of the eastern Congo, which is a vast area.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08112640000210"></a>As has been pointed out, North Kivu is a very big area. At the moment, it has 3,500 troops, which is a huge enhancement of what it had before. With the intended enlargement, that will go up to 6,500. However, there is a real reluctance to pull troops out of southern Kivu, Katanga or other areas of the eastern Congo where they are deployed, precisely because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, suggested, there is a risk that those areas might again destabilise and conflict might flare up.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08112640000211"></a>As General Gaye put it to me, the issue is not just troop numbers, it is that there still is a nine to five, Monday to Friday, civilian logistics backbone, which was designed when MONUC was a monitoring mission. Very typically, as MONUC&#146;s role has become that of a Chapter 7 mission intended to undertake peace enforcement functions, it has not been given the kind of logistics, mobility or hardened military capabilities to undertake that role sufficiently robustly.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08112640000212"></a>If that is General Gaye&#146;s point, the second point is one that I would not associate with him. He is a forceful Senegalese general, surrounded by a number of very good national force commanders or contingent commanders. I met with a very able Indian brigadier-general, and the Indian forces are well regarded for the role that they are playing. However, other forces are performing in an entirely pathetic and desultory way. They barely leave their bases and do not engage to protect civilians with anything like the vigour that we would wish to see. Clearly, that needs to change. We need to make sure that all the deployed forces understand their mission and live up to their responsibilities of a Chapter 7 mandate.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08112640000213"></a>For me, the third issue is the most difficult in terms of the effectiveness of MONUC; namely, its partnership with a national army which has been defeated by a militia and which itself is a source of at least 50 per cent of the incidents in North Kivu. Let me confirm what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said. The FARDC is, frankly, more than alleged&#151;because there is compelling evidence&#151;to be selling weapons to the FDLR and, through the weakness of its military behaviour, to be having weapons captured from it by the CNDP. Essentially, it is the armoury to the militias of the region. It is, at least in North Kivu, a defeated, failed force, but, worse than that, it shows all the ill discipline and spontaneous military actions of a militia.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08112640000214"></a>I was briefed by MONUC on how many of the incidents it has faced in recent weeks, which began with the FARDC lobbing shells at the CNDP across civilians who lay between them, thus provoking a CNDP response and, usually, its occupation of land as it drove the FARDC back.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08112640000215"></a>Complicated though this is, it is hard to imagine that even a European force going in would be willing to say that it would treat the national army of the host country as just another combatant to be directly confronted and, if necessary, fought. That is a very hard proposition because it is then not peace enforcement but becomes invasion by almost any other name. There is this real problem of the weak partner we have in the Congo in the form of the national army.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1474"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column 1474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08112640000216"></a>A major DfID and MoD-supported investment worth &#163;80 million over five years is being made into security sector reform. While I was in the country I opened a rehabilitated officer training school, where Sandhurst officers were busy training soldiers in issues of discipline and response to civilian emergencies, with a bias towards training in combating sexually based violence and other key issues that an army in this kind of country faces. But we have to work with other donors to achieve a much more effective and co-ordinated effort, to reconstitute a smaller, better paid national army able to undertake properly its responsibilities to protect its own civilians. We will never reach a final solution unless that is achieved.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08112640000217"></a>I turn to the issue of the political process. Most noble Lords pointed out that there is an absence of trust between the different sides. Only yesterday, President Kabila again declared that he would not talk to General Nkunda, and the question was raised that if he was limiting himself to talking within the Goma Accord, surely it meant that he was not serious. There is a very important point here. President Kabila asserts that he is the democratically elected president of the country&#151;that is absolutely correct, and is the result of an election that Her Majesty&#146;s Government strongly supported&#151;and that he will therefore limit himself to giving General Nkunda a role within the existing democratic Government, either reintegrated into the armed forces or in some other institutional role in the country, and will provide security to those who do reintegrate. But President Kabila is not willing to negotiate away political power that he has won at the ballot box against force of arms by General Nkunda and his militia. General Nkunda confirmed to President Obasanjo that his demands were of a reintegration character and he was not demanding suzerainty over eastern Congo or some other grandiose political objective. This is a perfectly reasonable position for the two sides to be in, but the issue is to move quickly to secure that kind of reintegration and demobilisation.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08112640000218"></a>It is clear that the FDLR must be quickly demobilised and either voluntarily repatriated to Rwanda or relocated to other parts of the Congo. If, as is thought likely, a group of them refuses to move, they must be dismantled by military means. That will be another tough and difficult military challenge, one probably beyond even an enhanced MONUC&#146;s capacity and perhaps requiring military action concerted either by Governments of the region or of SADC, but we will not be able to leave the issue unresolved.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08112640000219"></a>Almost every noble Lord who spoke also referred to the economic sources of this conflict. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, pointed out, the violence and chaos in the DRC mean that the country is no longer an economic source of coltan, the mysterious metal to be found in our cell phones. Indeed the coltan in our cell phones, particularly the newer models, is unlikely to have been sourced in the DRC. But what remains very active is trading in tin and other semi-precious and precious metals. It is important to understand the nature of the mining sector in eastern Congo, which is not so much one of large and powerful mining multinationals, but of extortion rackets run by the FDLR and the other militias. They tax individual miners who dig the stuff out of the ground and go to

That trade is now being disrupted and the miners are forced to sell at a 50 per cent discount to these Mafia-like militias. We need to break that.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08112640000220"></a>Something else that we need to break&#151;an issue which has not been adequately raised today&#151;is the practice of the FDLR, the Hutu genocide militia, still raising money in Europe and its leadership still living in Europe. There are long legal explanations for it that I do not have time to go into, but we need to address that issue. To Rwandans, the sheer unfairness of a prominent Rwandan individual being arrested at an airport in Germany and turned over to France for trial when, two weeks earlier, a convicted genocidaire, the secretary-general of the FDLR, was not deported to serve a prison sentence in Rwanda because of concerns about the condition of Rwandan gaols, is an unacceptable double standard that has highly complicated our handling of this issue with the Rwandan Government.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08112640000221"></a>It is not only the American Government who deeply admire Rwanda; both sides of the House admire Rwanda as well. It has become a favourite Tory summer vacation spot, of which I strongly approve. It was remarkable to see many Tory MPs and party workers go there last summer and I hope the same thing happens this summer. I utterly support the education of the party opposite in international development and welcome its strong support, as a consequence, for the UK Government&#146;s policies on development. We do not come second to that side of the House in our support for its Government as an effective development partner.</p>

<a name="81126-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08112640000222"></a>On the question of Rwandan complicity, or not, with the CNDP, I had this issue out with President Kagame in very frank terms. It is enormously important that we are satisfied that there is not active support of the CNDP and General Nkunda. President Kagame assured me that he has never met General Nkunda. He acknowledges that there are strong kith and kin connections and that he has appointed a senior member of his Administration to liaise with General Nkunda, but he insists that it is for the purpose of persuading Nkunda not to attack civilian targets such as Goma. He committed to me that he will continue to use that influence to stay Nkunda from further military operations. He said that he was committed to the CNDP negotiating with the Government of Congo through the good offices of Mr Obasanjo and that, in that sense, he intended to play a positive role. I believe that President Kagame is a good partner of ours and I feel obliged to take his word that that is the role he is playing and intends to continue to play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08112640000223"></a>Noble Lords have been very patient; they have raised many issues and I regret that I have not been able to respond to all of them. There will be an opportunity to return to this subject next week in the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, as has been mentioned. However, through the APPG and other vehicles I will do my best to keep noble Lords informed of developments around an issue of common concern that unites us all on each side of the House.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08112645000019"></a><a name="81126-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81126-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08112645000589"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting (Lord Carter of Barnes):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08112645000020"></a>In June 2007, my right honourable friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell) announced that the Government proposed to ask the BBC to make up to &#163;14 million of licence fee funding available to assist Channel 4 with the capital costs of digital switchover. The announcement made it clear that the assistance was subject to state aid approval from the European Commission and a formal notification seeking that approval was submitted to the Commission in October 2007.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08112645000021"></a>In March this year, the Commission opened a formal investigation procedure in respect of the notification. The Government submitted a response to the Commission, as did two interested third parties.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08112645000022"></a>In the period since the notification was made, the debate on the future of public service broadcasting in the UK has moved on significantly. Furthermore, the structural challenges that traditional commercially funded public service broadcasters face have been exacerbated by current cyclical conditions.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08112645000023"></a>The Government have therefore brought forward its timeline for decisions and are now committed to take a more comprehensive view on the future institutional and financial framework of public service broadcasting, including the future of Channel 4, early in 2009 within the framework of the Digital Britain project. The Digital Britain project was launched in October to look at innovation, investment and quality in the digital and communications sectors. The Digital Britain report will be a comprehensive analysis of the United Kingdom&#146;s digital economy and will bring forward proposals to support the development of these sectors.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08112645000024"></a>The emerging proposals are likely to be more wide-ranging than a proposition relating specifically to Channel 4&#146;s switchover costs. The Government will of course ensure that any new proposals for potential state aid arising from this wider consideration process are properly notified to the Commission in advance of implementation.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08112645000025"></a>Against this background, the Government have decided against proceeding with the notified proposals to provide assistance for Channel 4 in respect of its switchover costs. The Government has accordingly informed the Commission that it wishes to withdraw the current state aid notification.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS152"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column WS152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08112645000027"></a>Sir Joseph Pilling&#146;s report of his independent strategic review of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was published by the then Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Member for Bolton West, on  17 July. My right honourable friend accepted Sir Joseph&#146;s recommendations in relation to the CAA&#146;s corporate governance and promised a further Statement in the autumn. I should like to add my thanks to Sir Joseph for his important contribution to ensuring that the CAA will be as effective a regulator in the future as it has been in the past.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08112645000028"></a>I accept that the CAA&#146;s current status as a  public corporation should be retained. As Sir Joseph recommended, the department will work with the CAA to develop amendments to bring the legislative framework up to date, addressing specific issues identified in the report. As Sir Joseph noted, some of his recommendations were relevant to the separate review of airport economic regulation that my predecessor announced in April and to improving the passenger experience, such as his recommendation for a statutory air transport users council (AUC). He was also right to ask us to consider whether the UK&#146;s aviation regulator should have a general environmental duty and in what context. We are looking sympathetically at these connected issues, which would require legislation and prior consultation, and will make a further announcement in the early part of next year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08112645000029"></a>Otherwise, I am pleased to be able to announce that I have accepted in broad principle Sir Joseph&#146;s recommendations, as has the CAA board. Implementation of the report&#146;s many recommendations, and corresponding revisions to the sponsorship statement that defines our relationship, are in hand with two exceptions. We are deferring a decision on changing the route of appeal for fitness-of-character decisions until the general regulatory chamber and the supporting first-tier tribunals are fully established. Also, in the financial downturn that has developed since Sir Joseph Pilling reported, I have agreed with the CAA that it is not a priority to recruit additional international staff or rent separate premises for the AUC, although the CAA will endeavour to meet the principle of these recommendations in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08112645000030"></a>I am also pleased to say that the process of governance change has begun. We are currently seeking a new part-time non-executive chair for the CAA and this will be followed by the recruitment of a chief executive for the CAA, on the basis envisaged by Sir Joseph Pilling.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08112645000035"></a>On 3 March, the Government published the five-year cross-government independent living strategy. The strategy sets out a series of government commitments aimed at ensuring that disabled people have choice and control over the support that they need to live their everyday lives.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08112645000036"></a>The strategy was produced in partnership with disabled people and we need to ensure that disabled people are actively involved in making the strategy a reality and checking that good progress is being made. Consequently, the launch of the strategy saw the start of a consultation to seek views on how best to do this.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08112645000037"></a>The consultation closed on 20 June and I am pleased to announce that I am today placing copies of the Government&#146;s response to this consultation in both House Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08112645000038"></a>Following the consultation and the further involvement of disabled people in the development of the Government&#146;s response, the Government have decided to implement the following steps to make sure that disabled people are actively involved in the implementation and monitoring of the strategy:</p>
establish an independent living scrutiny group to review progress on implementing the strategy;develop a web-based and print resource to support disabled people&#146;s involvement in local strategic partnership boards;work with Equality 2025 to look at how best to use and develop existing networks to form a &#147;network of networks&#148;, creating a two-way channel for communication between government and disabled people;examine some of the options&#151;for example, specific courses&#151;suggested by respondents for building leadership capacity; andwork to help disabled people&#146;s organisations to benefit more from new opportunities to build capacity in the third sector.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08112645000041"></a>I have today published a consultation paper seeking views on a proposal to introduce a new practical motorcycling test and associated fees. It is proposed to split the practical motorcycling test into two modules&#151;</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08112645000044"></a>I should like to update the House on the figures that have previously been quoted in regard to the delivery of education maintenance allowances (EMA).</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08112645000045"></a>In my Statement of 19 November about delivery of learner support schemes, I indicated that, as of the day before, there were 12,016 applications for EMA in the process of being finalised. This information was drawn from statistics provided to the LSC by Liberata.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08112645000046"></a>Since then, in response to emerging concerns about the methodology being used by Liberata to calculate the work-in-progress statistics and to ensure that the figures were accurate in advance of the transfer of the contract to Capita, the LSC commissioned a full count of the outstanding applications. This analysis was made possible by the relatively small number of applications still remaining.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08112645000047"></a>Liberata&#146;s physical count on 21 November recorded that there were around 26,000 applications in the process of being finalised. The LSC advises me that the new figure represents a more accurate reflection of the outstanding number of applications. However, once the contract has transferred, Capita will review these figures in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08112645000048"></a>Clearly this is unsatisfactory.

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08112645000051"></a>The Government are today publishing a consultation paper which seeks views on whether candidates&#146; addresses should continue to be disclosed automatically during UK parliamentary elections.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08112645000052"></a>The proposal has been made following the removal of MPs and Peers from certain provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. It is argued that such public figures and their families face more than ordinary risks to their safety, security and peace of mind, and that special considerations therefore apply to them.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08112645000053"></a>Others argue that the electoral process should be open and transparent, and that those putting themselves forward for public office in this way should be prepared to face those risks in the interests of accountability and the free expression of democracy.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08112645000054"></a>This paper seeks to examine those arguments in more depth, as well as the practical issues which may arise from any proposed change and the implications for the electorate, for the electoral process, for candidates, and for administrators.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08112645000064"></a>I wish to inform the House about the progress of the FiReControl project, which will establish a linked network of highly resilient fire control rooms across England to replace the current stand-alone facilities.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08112645000065"></a>Major emergencies in recent years have shown us the very real challenges we face in today&#146;s world. The fire and rescue service is central to our ability to be able to respond to these and the Government are determined to support it by investing around &#163;1 billion to ensure that it has the necessary capabilities and resilience. The FiReControl project is an important part of this investment.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08112645000066"></a>FiReControl will give all fire and rescue services access to systems and technology that only a few currently benefit from. It will result in greater resilience and collaboration, better information and incident support for firefighters, and a better service to the public&#151;both day to day and during major incidents.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08112645000067"></a>The Government are investing &#163;380 million in FiReControl and remain strongly committed to it. Good progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the completion of eight new highly resilient regional control centre buildings, the establishment of eight local authority-controlled companies, which bring together all relevant local partners, and the development of a strong network of regional project teams working to ensure that the project is a success in their areas.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08112645000068"></a>However, FiReControl is a complex and demanding project and as such is subject to rigorous ongoing review. Since I took up my post as Fire Minister, a thorough review of all aspects of the FiReControl project has been completed and a number of difficulties with the ICT and other dimensions of the project were identified. These issues will result in some delay and the FRS rightly expects us to address these in full.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08112645000070"></a>Our updated plans are being delivered in close partnership with the fire and rescue service, fire and rescue authorities and our suppliers, EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. Shorter-term milestones will be monitored very carefully and progress shared with our partners. Longer-term milestones will be reviewed as the project progresses. Members of the fire and rescue service are being given more opportunities to contribute to the development of the project so that they can have full confidence in the new systems being developed, with staff embedded in national and local project teams and playing a full part in joint working groups.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08112645000071"></a>I am also committed to ensuring transparency around the project wherever practical.

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08112645000077"></a>Earlier this year, Parliament debated and approved structural change orders to create from 1 April 2009 nine new unitary councils: Bedford Borough Council, Cheshire East Council, Cheshire West and Chester Council, Central Bedfordshire Council, Cornwall Council, County Durham Council, Northumberland Council, Shropshire Council and Wiltshire Council.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08112645000078"></a>We are working closely with those responsible locally for implementing these new unitary councils to complete the legislative framework needed to support the transition to these new councils. We have already made and laid before Parliament staffing regulations (June 2008), transfer of functions regulations (August 2008) and two sets of transitional regulations (August and November 2008).</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="08112645000079"></a>Today, I have laid before the House the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Finance) Regulations 2008, which represent a further significant milestone towards the completion of the legislative framework.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="08112645000080"></a>These regulations, made under Part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, make transitional, supplementary and consequential provision in relation to finance, including in particular the following matters:</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS159"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column WS159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the setting and approval of budgets and the process of billing for council tax and non-domestic rates for each unitary council&#146;s first financial year;enabling the equalisation of council tax in restructuring areas to occur over a period of more than one year but at the latest in the financial year after the fifth anniversary of the reorganisation to provide where necessary for a more equitable process of equalisation. If these transitional provisions are not used, council tax equalisation will occur in the first financial year;providing that existing local rating lists and valuation lists for a reorganising area will be the lists of the new councils on and after the reorganisation date, and providing for the amalgamation of these lists into a single document at any time after the reorganisation date; andensuring that after a reorganisation, the new unitary council has continuity and responsibility for finance functions relating to earlier financial years. 
<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="08112645000081"></a>I am confident that these regulations will ensure that the new unitary councils will have the powers that they need to set their budget and council tax for 2009-10 and to bill and collect both their council tax and non-domestic rates for that year. They will also ensure that the new councils are able to fulfil their responsibilities, including enforcement activity, relating to earlier financial years.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="08112645000082"></a>No one underestimates the scale of the task that those leading the changes in these areas face over the coming months. A key measure of success for the new unitary councils will be that, from the outset, their council tax is affordable and that they adopt a budget that both reflects the savings proposed in their original unitary bid and delivers efficient and quality local services. The framework that the regulations put in place will enable them to do this.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="08112645000084"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that taxpayers receive the best possible value for money from the record investment made in probation in recent years.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="08112645000085"></a>I announced on 9 April 2008 the consultation on a best-value regime for probation services and I am pleased to announce to the House the outcome of that consultation. I propose, following the consultation, to introduce a new best-value framework as signalled during the passage of the Offender Management Bill last year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="08112645000086"></a>The National Offender Management Service Agency will require local probation boards and trusts to undertake a rolling programme of best-value reviews.

It will enable boards and trusts to demonstrate, in a transparent way, the value for money of their services and to drive

Having considered the options, I have decided that best value will proceed on the basis of benchmarking of selected areas of work, assessment of probation performance against that benchmark and greater competition for all sectors for those who do not meet the required standard through improvements to existing services.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="08112645000087"></a>I intend to announce shortly the first areas of work for which best value will apply.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="08112645000088"></a>The Government are currently developing a regulatory framework to ensure that competition is conducted in a fair and transparent way, allowing all sectors to compete. Discussions are currently ongoing with interested parties and will be published in due course.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_12"></a>
<a name="08112645000092"></a><a name="81126-wms0002.htm_spmin6"></a><b><a name="81126-wms0002.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="08112645000601"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> During the passage of the Pensions Bill through both Houses, there has been much debate on the Government&#146;s view on responsible investment and disinvestment by pension schemes. This is clearly an issue of some importance, particularly to trustees, and is one that is continually developing as the body of case law on responsible investment evolves.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="08112645000093"></a>It would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on the future development of the existing principles contained in case law, as the interpretation of case law is of course a matter for the courts and not for Ministers.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="08112645000094"></a>However, I would like to put on record the Government&#146;s view of the law. There is no reason in law why, in making investment decisions, trustees cannot consider social, ethical and environmental considerations, including sustainability, in addition to their usual criteria of financial returns, security and diversification.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="08112645000095"></a>It follows from this that it may be appropriate for trustees to engage in these considerations with companies in which they invest. This may include disinvesting from such companies if, acting in accordance with their fiduciary duties and the objects of their trust, they consider that this is right and in the best interests of their members.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS161"></a><b>26 Nov 2008 : Column WS161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="08112645000097"></a>I have today placed in the Library our proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales for 2009-10, with indicative allocations for 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="08112645000098"></a>The Government announced last year provisional funding totals for the three-year period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Three-year settlements were widely welcomed by police authorities, enabling them to develop medium-term financial strategies and to control their spending. The recent multiyear pay deal for the police will help to improve further still their medium-term planning. We intend to implement the settlement for 2009-10 broadly unchanged from last year&#146;s announcement.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="08112645000099"></a>The funding settlement for next year is built on considerable investment in the police service since 1997-98. On a like-for-like basis, government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent or over &#163;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11. This has helped to expand local policing considerably. Police officer numbers at the end of March this year remain historically high at 140,230 (14,405 more than in 1997). The police workforce overall, including officers, support staff and community support officers, has increased by 27.5 per cent (50,246) since 1997 to 233,263 in March 2008, a record number. The workforce increased by 3,166 (1.4 per cent) between March 2007 and March 2008.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="08112645000100"></a>The police reform programme continues. The policing Green Paper <I>From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together</I> was published on 17 July. It set out the Government&#146;s vision for the future of policing and put forward proposals to empower citizens, professionalise and free the police from unnecessary bureaucracy and sharpen the strategic role of government. Over 300 formal responses to consultation were received. Home Office Ministers and officials have met over 1,000 people to share views and prompt debate. We are considering the many views that were put forward and will produce a public response to the consultation shortlysetting out the Government&#146;s position and plans for implementation.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="08112645000101"></a>We have made good progress to date in implementing Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s recommendations on reducing bureaucracy. We are also developing the new, single national target on confidence. This target is to increase public confidence that agencies are tackling local crime and anti-social behaviour priorities.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="08112645000102"></a>Neighbourhood policing is continuing to transform police forces&#146; relationships with their communities through closer engagement with local people, joint problem solving and working together to make changes for the longer term to make communities safer. Every community in England and Wales now has a dedicated neighbourhood policing team aiming to identify and tackle the key policing priorities identified by local people. The next phase of neighbourhood policing will concentrate on integrating with other local authority services at a neighbourhood level. Neighbourhood crime and justice co-ordinators will help to ensure that this is delivered faster and further. This next phase will also build on good practice to deliver a national pledge that guarantees the public key service standards.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="08112645000141"></a>Within the general grant provision of 2.7 per cent, the funding floor was set at 2.5 per cent for each of the CSR years. Each police authority in England and Wales is guaranteed an increase of at least this level. The grant floor provides for stability but at the same time a degree of grant scaling has enabled us to target resources to areas with greater relative need. Our promised review of the funding formula before the next CSR is already under way with active collaboration from the police community.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="08112645000142"></a>The Government are clear that there is no excuse for excessive increases in precepts on council tax next year. We will not hesitate to use capping powers to deal with excessive council tax increases in 2009-10, including requiring authorities to rebill if necessary. We took capping action against seven police authorities in 2008-09. This included designating Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire police authorities for capping in advance for 2009-10. My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government is announcing today that action is being taken forward to limit these authorities&#146; precept increases to around 3 per cent in 2009-10. The three authorities have 21 days in which to challenge our decision. Any challenges will be carefully considered before final decisions are taken.</p>

I have provided additional support of &#163;15.5 million in 2009-10 to ensure that Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales police authorities receive at least a minimum grant increase of 2.5 per cent. Floor funding is also partly funded by reducing police grant to South Wales Police Authority, so that it too will receive the level of grant that it would if it were in England.<I></I></p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_545"></a><a name="08112645000579"></a>The Government warmly welcome Professor King&#146;s wide-ranging and comprehensive report, published in two parts in October 2007 and March 2008, which set out the technology options likely to contribute to decarbonising road transport. Professor King made a number of policy recommendations ensuring that government, industry and research communities all contribute to reducing carbon emissions from cars. The response document describes how the Government are taking forward Professor King&#146;s recommendations as part of our wider mission to tackle the climate change impacts of the transport sector. Professor King&#146;s report provides grounds for optimism that major reductions in road transport emissions can be achieved in ways that are technologically feasible, affordable and publicly acceptable.</p>

We are working on all these areas with a view to seeing a new car fleet average of 100 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020&#151;a target that will require deployment of a range of technologies such as all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars that hold the promise of ultra-low-carbon private transport.</p>

<a name="08112645000582"></a><a name="81126-wms0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81126-wms0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08112645000604"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_548"></a><a name="08112645000583"></a>The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is rapidly deteriorating, with an escalating cholera outbreak making an already serious situation much worse. Today I am making available a &#163;10 million package of support to provide life-saving assistance and respond to the escalation of the disease. This support will:</p>
provide essential drugs and medical supplies; support the provision of basic health services; and help UNICEF treat cholera cases and prevent further outbreaks.
<p><a name="08112645000588"></a>This package includes &#163;3 million new funding, and brings our total support to the people of Zimbabwe to &#163;47 million this financial year.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_549"></a><a name="08112645000584"></a>With a collapsing health system and a population badly weakened by a prolonged food crisis and HIV and AIDS, the threat from cholera is all the more severe. More than 8,000 cases have already been reported, with over 300 deaths, the vast majority of them preventable under normal conditions. Our contribution will be used to provide vital medical supplies and equipment to treat patients, provide clean water supplies, and ensure that front-line health workers are available to treat patients.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_550"></a><a name="08112645000585"></a>The food crisis in Zimbabwe also remains a serious challenge. The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of food aid as we move into the New Year. To date, the UK has provided &#163;9 million to the World Food Programme&#146;s appeal. With the results of nutritional surveys in the coming weeks we will, alongside the UN and other donors, monitor closely the need for further contributions.</p>

<a name="81126-wms0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_551"></a><a name="08112645000586"></a>As the group of elders noted during their recent visit to southern Africa, the need to arrest the humanitarian crisis is now urgent. There is no doubt that this has been caused by a systemic and prolonged failure of policy and leadership in Zimbabwe. Only a political solution and a major change of policy direction by the Government of Zimbabwe can provide what is needed to Zimbabwe&#146;s people. The international community will continue to support the immediate needs of the Zimbabwean people. With international partners, we stand ready to play our part in Zimbabwe&#146;s economic and social recovery when the time comes.</p>

Well-being is defined in the 2004 Act in a way that reflects the five Every Child Matters outcomes including physical and mental health, emotional well-being and protection from harm and neglect.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a><a name="08112647000166"></a>The UK decided to use a two-stage approach to allocate allowances to EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) participants. First, the total number of allowances was allocated to sectors. The sector-level allocations are then further distributed to individual installations within those sectors.</p>

<a name="81126w0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a><a name="08112647000167"></a>The UK decided that the allocation of allowances to the sectors covered by the EU ETS should be determined as follows:</p>
all sectors other than large electricity producers were allocated allowances equivalent to their projected business-as-usual emissions, taking into account the potential, including technological potential of sectors to reduce their emissions, a deduction for estimated new entry and a contribution to the combined heat and power ring-fence of the new entrant reserve; andthe LEP sector was allocated the remainder of the total of the overall UK cap, taking into account a deduction for the amount of allowances to be auctioned and a contribution to the NER. Thus, the LEP sector will receive a reduced allocation to account for the carbon savings the UK expects the trading sector to deliver.
<a name="81126w0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a><a name="08112647000168"></a>LEP are relatively insulated from international competition and are able to pass the costs of carbon to consumers in the form of higher electricity prices. The sector is therefore able to face a reduction in its allocation without a substantial impact on its competitive position. For this reason, the UK decided that the LEP sector should receive a lower level of free allocation. All others sectors were treated equally in terms of the allocation methodology.</p>

These additional resources were requested by the UN Secretary-General to reinforce MONUC's presence in North Kivu allowing the mission, inter alia, to bolster its capacity to protect civilians; to maintain zones of separation between rebel groups and to increase the mission's mobility. We are pressing to ensure that deployment is as quick as possible. We are working with the UN and international partners to ensure that these additional resources are found and deployed in theatre as soon as possible. Although the UK is not in a position to contribute troops to MONUC given our existing military commitments, we are considering what staff, logistics or other help we can provide to MONUC and to potential troop contributors. We understand that the UN has received expressions of interest from several countries. It is a matter for the UN and the countries in question to announce publicly if they will contribute troops. Clearly it is vital that any troops are capable, correctly equipped and able to deploy quickly.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_64"></a><a name="08112647000215"></a>MONUC now has 95 per cent of its troop strength deployed in the east of the DRC following internal reorganisation of the mission, reinforcing its capacity to protect Goma and other areas of North Kivu until new resources arrive. An EU force is not currently under consideration, although we will keep this under review. We believe that any countries, including individual European countries, willing to contribute troops should deploy to MONUC, which has an existing command structure and logistical support in place.</p>

Section l(10) of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 provides that &#147;the person designated as a CORE keeper must be a public authority&#148;. The Electoral Commission is the preferred choice to fulfil this role. If the commission is the CORE keeper then funding would be made available through Speaker&#146;s Committee. The CORE project has been allocated a total of &#163;11.7 million to implement the CORE service. The annual running costs of the CORE keeper have been estimated at &#163;1.3 million per year, although it will be impossible to provide actual running costs until user requirements have been finalised and costed in detail. Throughout 2008 we have been meeting with our stakeholders, gathering requirements, with a view to publish a high-level statement of requirements by the end of March 2009, with a detailed analysis of costs versus benefits by the summer of 2009.</p>

However farmers in the UK can claim grant under the EU's energy aid payment scheme for energy crops grown on non-set-aside land with a contract for energy end use. The scheme was oversubscribed at a European level in the 2007 claim year, resulting in a 30 per cent cutback in grant aid. UK farmers received &#163;4.06 million grant aid on around 244,000 ha. The area planted in the UK for the 2008 claim year is just over 56,000 ha: claims when paid will be at &#8364;45 per ha, less modulation. The scheme does not differentiate between crops grown for biofuels or the generation of heat and power. As crops grown for biofuels constitute a small proportion of total crop production in the UK, the impact on the poorest consumers and farmers is likely to be negligible.</p>

The figure for the public administration sector, of which local authorities make up a significant part, is over 12 per cent. This demonstrates that the public administration sector as a whole would do well in the league table and as such it is reasonable to assume a neutral to high case scenario. However, in the worst case scenario of a local authority being at the bottom of the league table in year 1, the maximum cost to the local authority is expected to be no more than 1.5 per cent of its energy bill.</p>

Essentially, this is about adopting a new way of thinking and working by:</p>
shifting the focus of our policy-making and delivery away from looking at natural environment policies in separate &#147;silos&#148; (e.g. water, air, biodiversity, etc.) towards a more integrated, holistic approach based on whole ecosystems; andseeking to ensure that the value of ecosystem services is fully reflected in policy and decision-making.

Initial findings from the project suggest that under Defra's climate change guidance the Thames Barrier, with some modification, could continue to provide protection to London for most of the century. On the basis of managing flood risk, it is therefore unlikely that a new barrier would be required in the short to medium term. However, we are aware of a business consortium, Metrotidal Ltd, which has announced proposals for a tunnel crossing between Medway and Canvey Island, which would include a surge-tide barrier, tidal power plant, and orbital rail and road links.</p>

It is expected that the SEA will be completed in early 2009. 25 GW of installed offshore wind capacity would generate electricity equivalent to that used by 19 million UK households. This assumes an average load factor of 40 per cent for future commercial scale offshore wind farms and is based on the average UK household electricity consumption of 4,600 kWh in 2007. However, it should be noted that the characteristics of tidal and offshore wind technologies and their role in the energy supply are very different and so cannot be easily compared.</p>

Since 2000, the Government have spent &#163;20 billion on fuel poverty benefits and programmes and we continue to have a range of measures in place to tackle it. Rising energy prices have made the challenge more difficult, but the package that the Prime Minister announced on 11 September underlines the Government's commitment in this area. Specifically, the package included:</p>
an increase in cold weather payments from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25 per week for winter 2008-09; andan extra &#163;74 million over the next two years to the Government's Warm Front scheme. This will enable around 40,000 additional households to see their fuel bills reduced by an average of &#163;180 through the provision of energy efficiency measures.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_96"></a><a name="08112647000295"></a>As part of the 11 September package the Prime Minister also announced the intention to increase the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) obligation on energy suppliers by 20 per cent and to introduce a new obligation on suppliers and energy generating companies to invest in making homes more energy efficient. A significant proportion of this energy efficiency work will be targeted on the homes of those in fuel poverty.</p>

Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_146"></a><a name="08112647000413"></a>In the case of the Community of Andean Nations there have been some difficulties with the regional approach. These have arisen because the members of the CAN have struggled to reach a common position on the trade pillar with the European Union. Colombia and Peru have expressed a desire for those CAN countries that are ready to undertake negotiations to embark on a bilateral, fast-track approach. The European Commission has so far indicated that while it regrets the inability of CAN to find a common position, it is open-minded to this suggestion. The European Commission has stressed that next steps will be dependent on the will of EU member states.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_147"></a><a name="08112647000414"></a>The UK&#146;s response to the suggestion of fast-track negotiations with Colombia and Peru is that this request should be considered seriously. Although there are benefits to the overall regional approach, it is also important that countries that are ready to proceed with a free trade agreement are not unduly penalised because the CAN as a whole is not ready to proceed. However, if a fast-track approach is followed, it is important for the UK that it is open to all members of CAN, either now or in the future, and that any solution is the result of mutually agreed arrangement.</p>

This reduces the cost of imprisonment and has an element of restitution while producing real work opportunities. Employment in prison also acts as an aid to good order and control and aids resettlement through skills and qualifications.</p>
