I say that because there has been, as it were, a cold shouldering of boxing over the years, and not just in education. However, it has proved to be quite useful in leading young people from relatively deprived backgrounds into an activity that is disciplined, encourages fitness and can take them away from a path leading towards criminal activities or drug taking, sad instances of which we see almost daily in our newspapers. Will the noble Lord encourage others in the Government to support boxing as an option?</p>

We hope that schools would consult closely the Amateur Boxing Association, for example, before they introduced the sport. So far as its benefits are concerned, in preparing for this Question last night, I read Ricky Hatton&#146;s memoirs, entitled <I>The Hitman</I>.

</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000753">The moral I draw from that is that it is another great contribution from my noble friend Lord Hattersley to the youth of this nation. I am sorry to say that the school itself has since closed, but Ricky Hatton makes a great contribution in the Manchester area to sporting opportunities for young people and, indeed, by encouraging them in education.</p>

On safety, my department supports the safe practice guidance developed by the Association for Physical Education as well as the Schools Amateur Boxing Association&#146;s standards scheme, which provides national guidance on the safe delivery of boxing activities.

Work experience is our single biggest partnership between employers and schools, with an estimated 300,000 businesses already involved. This will provide a strong foundation for work experience in diplomas. Our gateway process for selecting schools and colleges to deliver diplomas ensures strong employer engagement. Colleges also have well-established employer links which will be valuable in providing opportunities for diploma students.</p>

Given that research has shown how important work experience is to student motivation, is it not somewhat worrying that of the 241 consortia so far established to deliver the diploma, fewer than half have associated business partners, and two-thirds report difficulties in finding the statutory 10 days&#146; work placements for their students? Is that not particularly worrying given that these consortia are currently aiming to deal with only 39,000 students, whereas it is hoped ultimately to roll out the diploma to 800,000 students?</p>

We are finding strong support from employers for developing more work placements. For example, recently the CBI produced a report called <I>Time Well Spent</I> on embedding employability in work experience and strongly encouraging member companies and organisations to offer work experience placements. There is a whole set of excellent case studies in that document. We are confident that we will get the work experience opportunities needed to launch the diplomas.</p>

The White Paper on the school-leaving age gives a hypothetical example of a girl who is studying towards a level 2 diploma in engineering doing her work experience in a Jaguar dealership learning about sales. Can the Minister guarantee that work experience will be of sufficient length and relevance to be of value to the student?</p>

We think that it offers sufficient opportunities for young people to engage in the workplace. As more stay on beyond the age of 16 and we significantly expand apprenticeships, that will be only the beginning of a process of engagement with the workplace that we would like to see all of our young people undertake.</p>

My own step-granddaughter did it here in your Lordships&#146; House and found it tremendously motivating.

Can the Minister reassure us on the important area of whether it will be available for military purposes as well, although it was originally agreed with the Americans that it would be only civilian? Will those military purposes allow full access to bodies such as the Chinese police force in Tibet, or to the Chinese military?

At Leaside Regeneration, we do not just write strategy documents but build practical projects that create employment, stimulate the growth of new community-based businesses and put in place towpaths, bridges, road crossings and stations that knit together this fragmented and desolate river valley.

Not all were convinced, but we persisted with our thoughts, and I went to see the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Riverside, to check that we were not in cloud-cuckoo-land. We thought that if the Olympics were to come to east London, they could act as a catalyst to turn round the fortunes of the Lower Lea Valley and build what we called the Water City&#151;a practical vision that would use many miles of waterways in the Lower Lea Valley to lift land values and once again drive the economy of east London.</p>

Our own epiphany came through the death from cancer of a woman in Bromley-by-Bow named Jean Vialls in 1992. Her story has been well documented elsewhere.

The problem is that the regeneration structures in east London are a mess. Those of us who try to make them work in practical ways know how serious that mess is and how much energy and time are being wasted. The present structures are confusing potential private sector investors precisely at a time when we want them to commit to the area.

It is surely not beyond our wit to create a simple, focused, business-like structure for east London regeneration that, first, recognises with honesty and humility that each of these key players has both strengths and weaknesses; secondly, recognises the legitimate rights, responsibilities and roles of each of these key players; and, thirdly, enables them to work together rather than against each other or in isolation. </p>

This approach can be applied to the bigger picture of regeneration in east London and deepened to include business and social entrepreneurs. I humbly suggest that at this critical hour in the life of east London, we now all focus on the needs and interests of the people who live there, that we stop playing games, stop jockeying for position and work together in a way that understands that faith in democracy itself depends on government&#146;s ability to deliver real change on the ground in communities where people live and work.</p>

None the less, I am one of those who is committed to the idea of bringing the Olympics to London. Indeed, I can claim even earlier dreams about bringing the Olympics to London in that I recall a dinner held at Elena&#146;s L&#146;Etoile in Charlotte Street in the mid-1990s when the British Olympic Association was first beginning to think about the possibility of seeking to bid for the Olympics in London. This was before we had a Mayor of London and we wondered whether the local authorities of London would be able to unite sufficiently to work towards that end.

Even in that context, where it is largely an immediate operational requirement, there will be a real legacy of benefit to the country. For example, there should be a new control centre which will enable the police to manage national policing operations in a way that has not been possible before. There will also be an enormous requirement for the training of officers all over the country for specialist duties which will be required as part of the Olympics and, again, that will have a lasting legacy benefit.</p>

We have a tripartite arrangement on some of the decision-making, and that is before the Government is included&#151;quadripartite, if that is a word, if the Government are included. There is also local governance, which has responsibility for ensuring that we deliver the greatest sporting festival the world has ever seen. I am confident that we will. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, will tell us exactly why that will be the case. We have the ODA, which is responsible for delivering the physical buildings that are needed to make that happen. Separately, the LDA is required to sort out the legacy. The ODA is required to &#147;have regard to&#148; the importance of legacy. I am concerned that as the going gets tough&#151;there will be times during the next four years when the going gets extremely tough&#151;the legacy will be squeezed.</p>

<a name="80117-0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08011776000144">There is also the potential for shifting costs. I shall give an example although I do not believe that this will necessarily happen. It is possible that the ODA will shift costs on to LOCOG. For example, by investing less in physical and technical security, LOCOG could be required to engage more people during the event itself on day-to-day security. There is the potential for all sorts of problems. I really do wish that we had a more robust governance structure.</p>

The Olympic board all signed up to the sustainability plan at the end of last year. We defined the term broadly and it set out the challenges and commitments for us to meet at all stages of the project in the five key themes of climate change, waste, biodiversity, inclusion and healthy living. Let me be quite clear in case there is the remotest impression in this House that the approach currently adopted by the organising committee is the norm in the delivery of an Olympic Games; it simply is not. No previous host city has ever developed such detailed work from the very outset of its planning.</p>

The park itself will leave the largest urban space created in Europe in the past 150 years: 120 hectares of ecologically managed land, decontaminated, and a huge asset to people living in east London and, more profoundly, the Lower Lea Valley; the Olympic village, built to the highest specification for energy efficiency and accessibility, will leave 9,000 new homes for Londoners and key workers; our venues are designed and built with future community use in mind; and transport infrastructure improvements will benefit commuters and business alike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="08011776000167">As everyone who takes part in these debates now knows, the modern Olympic movement was created by Pierre de Coubertin, an amateur boxer, but also a poet. The cornerstone to his vision in reviving the Olympics was to bring sport and culture together in one great festival. He did not simply desire to glory in great physical feats but, as the ancient Greeks had done, to celebrate mind as well as body. That was precisely the line taken in London's bid for the 2012 Games, and one of the reasons it won. It promised to leave a lasting cultural legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="08011776000168">In a speech last May, the then Secretary of State, Tessa Jowell, expanded on the Government&#146;s concept of the cultural element. She said:</p>

Because this time, there will be so much more to the Cultural Olympiad than the ceremonies ... More than the live concerts ... It will be the beginning of something much, much more ambitious. The matching of physical excellence with cultural excellence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000756">Those words are wholeheartedly to be welcomed: the ambition to place culture as a central part of the legacy of the London Olympics stated absolutely clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="08011776000170">When London won the Olympics, there was general rejoicing, but right from the start there were concerns among the cultural and arts sectors that money would be siphoned off to pay for what was essentially a sporting extravaganza&#151;correct concerns, I am afraid.

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="08011776000172">There are three tiers to the Cultural Olympiad. Tier 1 is the mandatory ceremonies, for which there is a budget, although we do not have a figure. Tier 2 is 10 major cultural events involving key partners such as the BBC, the British Museum and the Royal Shakespeare Company. Tier 3 is a UK-wide cultural festival. The last tier is unique to the London bid and is designed to encompass thousands of local and regional events as part of our nationwide celebration. </p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="08011776000173">However, there is no allocated funding for tier 3. This money has to be found locally and by the voluntary arts and heritage groups rooted in our communities. The last diversion of lottery funds hit them particularly hard. At the end of last year, the Minister replied to a Question for Written Answer on lack of funding, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"><a name="08011776000804">&#147;The Legacy Trust, which has &#163;40 million of funding, will be launched in November 2007.

</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000758">This trust seems very keen on being launched, but less keen on actually leaving port. It has been launched no fewer than three times, most recently in May. This is not clear or structured behaviour and the consequence is that it is only now that the process of tendering for the money involved has begun. Of that money, &#163;6 million has already been ring-fenced for the UK School Games; &#163;24 million is going to the nations and regions; and a paltry &#163;10 million for everything else. Compare that with the &#163;750 million being diverted from the arts via special Olympic lottery games. Can the Minister assure the House that the money will not be taken from this &#163;10 million allocated for those unspecified costs for the mandatory ceremonies?</p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="08011776000174">The Government argue that the arts should contribute to the Olympic bill because the Cultural Olympiad that runs alongside the sporting one will be a huge success. It will not be a huge success if it does not happen, and it will not happen if there are not enough funds. At the moment, there is not nearly enough to achieve what the Government envisage. We on these Benches have suggestions about where extra money can be found for lottery good causes and consequently for the cultural organisations. One is a gross profits tax for the lottery and the other a crackdown on lottery-style games&#151;so-called grey games&#151;which, through imitation, dupe people into spending their money elsewhere than the National Lottery. We believe that these proposals could raise significant amounts. In Tuesday&#146;s Olympic lottery debate in another place, the Secretary of State indicated his support for our proposals and I hope that the Minister will confirm today that the Government intend to set up a review into them.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, will certainly leave a very visible and very important legacy in east London. Like other noble Lords, I am most grateful to him for having introduced this subject. I would like to associate myself with many of things that he has said.</p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="08011776000177">I obviously have to declare an interest, because I am responsible for 500 communities of social entrepreneurs. As faith is such a dodgy question, I had better describe them as such. That is what churches, temples and gurdwaras, actually are&#151;communities of social entrepreneurs. I am also responsible in the Diocese of London alone for 150 schools. The noble Lord, Lord Coe, talked about diversity. He is absolutely right. In one of our schools in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium in Haringey, 70 languages are spoken. For homiletic reasons, it is convenient that they run from Albanian to Zulu. We have an astonishing diversity. Nowhere in the world has anyone ever before tried to build a community on the basis of that kind of diversity.</p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="08011776000178">The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, talked about the soil. When my mother worked for George Lansbury in Bow in the 1920s and 1930s, the real social glue that held the community together was membership of a political party or a union. That is no longer the case. The unignorable communities of social entrepreneurs, and the bodies that regularly assemble citizens in considerable numbers, for a good and constructive purpose, are mosques, temples, gurdwaras and churches. We need more adequate ways of relating to these communities of social entrepreneurs and to the faith communities in the immediate vicinity of the Olympic developments. We should review how that is being done at the moment and look at ways in which it can be done more adequately.</p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="08011776000179">We are trying to help. Christians in London have set up a new organisation called More Than Gold, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney. On Tuesday we will license our chaplain for the Olympics, Canon Duncan Green. That is only a Church of England contribution to a general Christian effort&#151;a fully ecumenical effort&#151;that recognises that we have been building good relations with other faith communities for years. We want to work in an inter-faith way. For instance, immediately after the recent regrettable comments about no-go areas in our city were made, we were able, with Muslim colleagues in Tower Hamlets, in the immediate vicinity of the new Olympic developments, to issue a joint statement denying that that description was true in our vicinity. </p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="08011776000180">So there is a very hopeful community here. I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, that if we are thinking about delicate issues of security for the Olympics, part of making them secure will be to involve local faith communities and use them as a conduit of communication with the larger constituency.</p>

We are contemplating a new town of perhaps 40,000 people eventually. That will be one of the great legacies of these Olympics&#151;40,000 people in one of the most deprived areas of the UK. It will have an enormous impact on existing communities and on the whole of east London. I am aware of local frustration at the latest planning applications, which seem to have revised downwards the scale of the original legacy provision.

This morning, I will focus on the once-in-a-lifetime catalyst that the Olympic legacy represents for the revitalisation of the East End of London. It is easy to say that the East End needs changing. It is more difficult to define what it should change to. This week, at the O2 in Greenwich, a certain reformed girl band is singing:</p>

Perhaps new and old east Londoners want allotments, pubs, wind turbines, mosques or churches. We need to uncover what enables people to relate to their east London village, to make each a place where people want to live and work&#151;a new-generation London.</p>

It has superb access to markets, with the world&#146;s most important financial centres on its doorstep, together with European links via City Airport and the Channel Tunnel station at Stratford, and of course Crossrail will add further links. East London could aspire to be a quartier for French headquarters in Britain; East 15 could become the 15th arrondissement. After all, it takes the same time to get from Stratford to Paris as it does from London to Manchester. Whatever the right answer, the opportunity is there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="08011776000187">The Lower Lea Valley is next door to the Olympic park. It is a forlorn, ex-industrial area where planners have identified the potential to build 35,000 homes in the next decade. It has eight miles of canal and river frontage&#151;the distance along the South Bank from Greenwich to County Hall. Because of the challenges, the Government designated it a priority area for regeneration&#151;before we won the Olympic Games&#151;and appointed an urban development corporation. However, government investment in the Lower Lea Valley languishes. The so-called Legacy Masterplan Framework for 2012 looks almost only at the park. Regeneration infrastructure for the Olympic park needs &#163;2.7 billion of Olympic money, yet only &#163;120 million has been committed to the Lower Lea Valley, an area over twice its size. One thing is for sure&#151;that will not be enough to underpin the targeted 35,000 homes, let alone a broader vision.</p>

<a name="80117-0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="08011776000188">The area needs government commitment to providing bridges, roads, schools, health centres and utilities. Perhaps the mayor or the new Housing and Communities Agency could underwrite that investment. It would be naive to hope that developers will cough it all up; the public sector needs to woo them to the area, not deaden potential by taxing first and delivering&#151;maybe&#151;later. Developers have to tackle a plethora of policy and bureaucracy emanating from a veritable multitude of public bodies. There are more bodies responsible for the Thames Gateway than emerged in the aftermath of rail privatisation. Development is subject to regulation from three London boroughs, Lea Valley Regional Park Authority, English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation, the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, the mayor and his agencies, the DCLG&#146;s Thames Gateway Executive and a partridge in a pear tree. What is the Thames Gateway? Where is it? The 1980s marriage of convenience by the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, between parts of Kent, Essex and London initially helped to secure attention and funding, but nobody living in Stratford, Greenwich or Ebbsfleet would call themselves a Thames Gatewayer. London now has a mayor and a measure of devolved government so, for Londoners, the Thames Gateway may have passed its use-by date. I could argue that the Thames Gateway was as relevant as Clwyd or Yugoslavia.</p>

My only qualification for speaking is that I lived for more than 20 years in the Lower Lea Valley in Old Ford. I may be one of the very few Members of your Lordships&#146; House who has lived for such an extensive period of time in the area in question. Not only did I live at Old Ford for more than 20 years, I was married at Bromley-by-Bow registry office. When I participated in part, which is rather a long time ago, I used to play squash regularly on a Monday morning at Eton Manor, a facility that the Lea Valley Park Authority provided in those days. So I know the area fairly well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="08011776000192">Some 15 years before living there, in the very early 1970s, my first connection with what is now very much in the centre of the Olympic park was as part of a working party of the governors of North-East London Polytechnic when I was the student representative. We were anxiously searching for a site to build housing on for students and young persons because there was an acute accommodation shortage for students at North-East London Poly and other educational institutions in the early 1970s. I vividly remember identifying a football field at Clays Lane as a suitable place to build relatively inexpensive social housing, which was to be organised on a co-operative basis for students from the polytechnic and other young local authority workers and the like. The problem with that site was that the overhead power cables, which are shortly to be removed from the Olympic site, meant that we could not build our flats higher than two stories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="08011776000193">Those flats were built in the late 1970s and I discovered subsequently, rather to my embarrassment, that one of the blocks of flats had been named after me. &#147;Howarth Court&#148; came into being and, to my chagrin, I discovered that they had spelt my name wrong. It is not only the annunciators in your Lordships&#146; House which occasionally make that error. It has been a source of embarrassment for many years that I had a block of flats named after me with the spelling wrong. After 30 years, they have recently been knocked down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="08011776000194">This brings me to a point that I want to emphasise&#151;the importance of social housing. If housing was a serious problem for young people in the early 1970s, it still is now. All the units of accommodation that we were successful in getting built have now been knocked down to make way for the stadium, so I am glad that in the legacy plan that the mayor has published, a copy of which came in this morning&#146;s post in time for this debate, there is a serious emphasis on housing and a commitment that the Games will have an immediate legacy of 9,000 high-quality homes&#151;a great deal more than the ones that were knocked down at Clays Lane&#151;of which at least 30 per cent will be affordable to Londoners on low incomes. There is an aspiration for considerably greater housing development after the Games are concluded in the peripheral areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="08011776000195">I shall not say very much about jobs, although they are crucial in the area. I merely emphasise, as did the noble Lord, Lord Harris, that east London has more people of employment age who are out of work than almost anywhere else in the United Kingdom. I was going to say something of the importance of the transport link but the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has covered that fairly comprehensively.</p>

I went back to the site yesterday and walked down the Greenway, newly tarmacked, signposted and better lit public footpath that takes one over a bridge on Marshgate Lane in the centre of the site. The vision of the activity is phenomenal; I have seen nothing like it anywhere in the world, except in China. There must have been a dozen huge earth-moving machines and a dozen large trucks; a fantastic degree of activity was taking place on that site yesterday. It staggered me and the friends of mine who came with me to look at the work that was going on on that site.</p>

On the fringes of the park, at Hackney Wick station, new housing developments are taking place. Street lighting is being improved and the station has already been improved. This is a place where I was mugged a few months before moving away from the area, not long after I came into your Lordships&#146; House. It happened on a dark night. The area was an extremely lonely place to go and many people have asked, &#147;Why does anyone want to use Hackney Wick station late at night?&#148;. Already that environment is being transformed. The housing being built there and the street lighting make it safer. The legacy is already with us; I am very optimistic about that.</p>

In Great Britain and Northern Ireland the BOA is responsible for the development and protection of the Olympic movement, whose vision is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport. However, as the host nation, our role goes further to reflect the International Olympic Committee charter. We believe that as important as our success in the 2012 Games is the sports legacy and inspiration which the Games has the ability to deliver to everyone, able bodied and disabled, the length and breadth of our nation.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="08011776000200">To date, the focus, as noble Lords have mentioned, has been on the regeneration of the East End of London and the construction of the Olympic park. Now I believe the attention of the nation, the Government, the national governing bodies of sport, Parliament, the Central Council of Physical Recreation and local communities needs to turn to the Olympics sport legacy, which needs to be costed, with clearly defined time lines on policy objectives, accountable, transparent, openly discussed and deliverable. For us in the British Olympic Association the starting point was Gordon Brown&#146;s Olympic manifesto as the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. On 24 October 2006, he wrote an article in the <I>Daily Mail</I> entitled,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000848">&#147;My vision for increasing young people&#146;s participation in sport by 2012&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000760">Among others, the article made the following commitments: to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000849">&#147;make the build-up to the 2012 Olympics the centrepiece of a national campaign on sport and fitness&#148;;</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000761">to,</p>

<p><a name="08011776000762">that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000851">&#147;every school should offer four hours of school sport per week by 2010&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000763">and, in addition to those four hours spent within the curriculum time, that every school should,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000852">&#147;offer after-school sport and links with a range of local sports clubs&#148;;</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000764">that,</p>

<ul><a name="08011776000855">&#147;up to 1 million men and women and young people attracted to volunteer in our schools and communities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000767">He concluded by saying that this was,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000856">&#147;a great ambition for 2012&#151;a nation fitter in health and stronger in civic spirit&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08011776000768">In November of last year&#151;by now of course as Prime Minister&#151;he went even further by announcing that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000857">&#147;the Government has issued a challenge to sport. We want two million more active people by 2012&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000769">The time has now arrived for all of us, from Ministers and the Olympic Board, down to local sports clubs, to rise to that challenge. We at the BOA, who also raise money from the private sector&#151;as my noble friend has just mentioned, we have been totally independent for more than 100 years&#151;have been fully and publicly supportive of every single one of the now Prime Minister&#146;s commitments.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="08011776000201">In our role as a host nation of the NOC we take seriously our duty to ensure that the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games leave a fitting sports legacy in this country. We recognise that the Games provide an opportunity to change the culture of health and fitness in the United Kingdom and a real chance to meet the targets set by the Prime Minister. We also recognise that the proposed Olympic sporting legacy was fundamental to London&#146;s successful bid to the International Olympic Committee to host the Games. No doubt everyone in this House joins me in hoping that every promise made in 2005 is delivered upon by 2012 and that we all have regular opportunities to monitor those commitments.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="08011776000202">I am confident that with an outstanding sports Minister in Gerry Sutcliffe, who is totally committed to a lasting legacy for sport, these objectives can be achieved, but they will neither come cheap nor be attainable without fundamental reforms to the sports policy the Prime Minister has inherited, which has struggled to deliver the commitments for an Olympic sports legacy of the type he has outlined. To that end, a number of reviews are currently ongoing regarding the legacy of London 2012. The Government&#146;s legacy action plan is nearing completion. Additionally, Sport England will soon be publishing its own Olympic sports legacy report, and the mayor&#146;s plans for London in that context are due to be outlined presently. In the Olympic Board&#146;s London 2012 sustainability plan, to which my noble friend has referred, it has been mandated that the British Olympic Association will be consulting with sport and the general public for their views on whether the desired legacy outcomes are being addressed. It is our anticipation that that work will begin later this year.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="08011776000203">Aside from all those reviews, the news in late November last year that the first concrete financial commitment on the subject of sporting legacy had been issued by the Government was very welcome in the context of the programme to deliver cultural and sporting activities across the UK. However, key to the Olympic sports legacy, which must touch Olympic and non-Olympic sports alike, is the need to improve sports facilities across the country. A comprehensive Olympic sports legacy needs to address all sports facilities and to address participation, the development of excellence and new systems that ensure that every child in this country has their talent identified and developed to the full.</p>

I still think these aims can be achieved and that the Prime Minister&#146;s Olympic manifesto commitments can be honoured, but only if action is taken now&#151;decisive action on an all-party basis. The Games and the Olympic movement give us an opportunity to deliver real benefit to all young people, practical value in terms of sport and recreation about which one day I hope our children will reflect, &#147;Our parents never had the chances we have today&#148;. That must be our goal for London&#146;s Olympic sports legacy.</p>

From the other end of the country, I associate myself with many of his remarks. We are all excited about the prospect of the Games coming to London, and it is widely recognised that the legacy of the 2012 Games has to be a worthwhile one for London, the nation and the regions. Just as there is a big smile on the faces of the people of Newcastle this morning for the first time in a long while following yesterday&#146;s events at St James&#146; Park, I fervently hope that the same will be true for us all as the Games get under way and for the legacy thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="08011776000206">This speech will be different from many of the others we have heard today because I want to speak from the regional perspective of the north-east. It is hard at the moment, four years away, to feel anything other than that the Games belong to London. I do not sense any kind of ownership of the Games yet in other parts of the country. Yet the construction of the Olympic site and the organising and running of the Games are already having an effect on communities not just in east London but many miles from the capital.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="08011776000207">I want to raise two or three points from the perspective of the north-east. First, there is obviously the question of funding. In the north-east there is great concern about the voluntary and community sector; concern that, as resources are targeted towards the Olympics, the essential funding for projects working with some of the most disadvantaged people and communities will suffer. There is a particular concern about the continuing availability of lottery funding. Add to that the significantly reduced ability of the Northern Rock Foundation to fund key local voluntary projects, and the north-east is facing a double whammy. Funding from all sources into the voluntary and community sector has been crucial in enabling the north-east to find its way following the collapse of all the traditional industries in the 1970s and 1980s. If the Olympics cause a further decrease in funding availability in our region, we will not be able to claim that the London Olympics have contributed to sustainable communities across the country.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="08011776000208">Secondly, our own experience of regeneration through the creation of large-scale central venues for the arts and culture has been pretty mixed. Although there are  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1443"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some wonderful new buildings on the Tyne, the quayside is unrecognisable from 20 years ago, energy and vibrancy have been brought to the life of the city and we are proud of what has been done, it has been good only for those who are able to access our wonderful new facilities. I meet a kind of dislocation between the cultural opportunities presented by the quayside and the lives of the people who live in adjacent communities, some of whom experience very high levels of social deprivation. There is a dislocation between the wonderful concert halls, art galleries and the like and the people who feel distant from them and do not participate in the activities of the arts, culture and heritage agenda. There is no evidence at all of any trickle-down theory here.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="08011776000209">I suggest that there are some lessons to be learnt and it is important that those preparing for the Olympics learn from other situations where large-scale cultural projects have successfully overcome social divisions rather than exacerbated them, so that the legacy for the communities in east London is greater sustainability and more cohesiveness rather than less. For my money, the prime ingredients for building sustainability in local communities are local participation and local ownership. Things imposed on people by central bodies or external agencies do not work, nor do the more cosmetic kinds of regeneration initiatives that we sometimes find. Local participation and ownership, the right kind of infrastructure, a good quality built environment, the best kind of public space; all of these help to build sustainable communities.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="08011776000210">In the end, the test is whether people feel included, whether they want to live in a place and, indeed, whether they can afford to do so. Securing a worthwhile legacy for the Games is not just a London issue, the effects will stretch far into the English regions. So let us ensure that there is indeed a worthwhile legacy, not only in London and in the nation but in the regions as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="08011776000212">I shall focus on those small sporting clubs that provide a centre of community and involvement for those in them. Anyone who knows anything about amateur sports clubs knows that they become the hubs of people&#146;s lives for periods of time.

The challenge here, which

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="08011776000214">We have already heard much about the almost certain improvements to the physical environment into which we are pumping money. The noble Lord, Lord Coe, said that they would not have to clean up the environment in order to run a successful Games and it is absolutely true: you do not need to do that for a major sporting event. As anyone who went to the old Wembley stadium would know, you can attend a wonderful sporting event even though you have to go through a pretty grim area. But in this case we have taken on the challenge of doing something more. We are trying to get in on an idea or a concept and trying to make it accessible. That is quite a big challenge to the culture and nature of what is going on around us.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="08011776000215">Thus we have a goal. However, there is also a built-in fear for some smaller groups. My noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter&#151;who has apologised for not being in her place, but her contact lens has come loose&#151;mentioned that many of these groups are frightened that their funding will be cut and diverted towards the elite end. We can play our own games by saying that the Olympic Games should create knock-on effects and inspiration. However, if the funding to pump-prime these smaller groups is affected then there is a danger we will lose one of the major benefits: to inspire small communities around the country. If we want to facilitate people in the regions outside London and inspire them to get involved in their own clubs, perhaps in non-Olympic sports, then they will need the extra funding. The noble Lord, Lord Coe, gave a wonderful example of what happened at his athletics club following his own success, when they simply could not handle the numbers wanting to get involved. We cannot achieve a similar result now unless funding is guaranteed. The CCPR has a wonderful way of putting it: the major events have a long sunrise but short sunset.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="08011776000216">Concentration on this aspect of the Olympic movement should have started a while ago. As the activity intensifies, where are the structures to encourage local participation and to tie it in with overall Olympic success? Are we guiding smaller groups on how to get in on the benefits? Are we telling them that they should be involved? Are the Government convinced that they are doing enough?</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="08011776000217">The idea of the Treasury driving sports policy is new to me but it may work because the Treasury, which tends to have more attention-grabbing things going on around it, has the money and the power. I have always felt that if sport is to deliver on its huge potential, it must attract both money and power either directly or indirectly. I believe that the Department of Health should have far greater responsibility for sport. If the idea took off, some lovely accounting procedures and number-crunching could show how greater participation in sport created savings in the NHS. I do not know whether the Treasury will be quite so amenable to the idea.</p>

How are they encouraging people to back the Olympic idea? That would improve the position not only of the Olympics but, directly, of those people themselves. What if people do not feel that they are competing? That is the real question. If this group of small and, one hopes, self-sustaining communities does not feel that it is part of the Games then it cannot get the benefits of the Games. If we ignore that, we may be ignoring a central driver for social good and the most obviously available benefit of the whole process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="08011776000220">I am prepared to say something quite different in this debate for two reasons: first, the limitation of speaking for only six minutes; and, secondly, my receipt of a letter from a prisoner in Pentonville which connects me back to why I am here. This person is seeking to use his own can-do philosophy to do something about the avoidance of guns and gangs and he is asking for help from within the prison environment. Although that may seem removed from this debate, I would like to talk about how we can connect real-life issues, not only for Londoners but for people right across the UK, with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. I am keen to keep stressing that there are Olympic and Paralympic Games because we are almost forgetting that the can-do culture extends to people with disabilities who will inspire us with what they can do by participating and succeeding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="08011776000221">Sustainable communities are about people, as the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, spoke about earlier; they concern their vulnerability, their strengths, their interdependency and their quality of life. It is not just about the quantifiable investment, the infrastructure and development, the environment or the economy, although all of those are hugely important. The London Paralympic Games in 2012 have the potential to be inspirational not only for Londoners but for all those who are ready to have their potential unlocked, appreciated, engaged, nurtured and developed for both self and public benefit. They have the potential to challenge the public cynicism that exists both in the north-east of England&#151;although I am sure that Kevin Keegan will put that to rights&#151;and in places such as Peckham which are not that far from east London.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="08011776000222">We have to recognise that everything connects to the issues in people&#146;s lives. The cynicism extends because people&#146;s experience is that they have been promised so many benefits from a whole range of regeneration programmes and investments that have not been realised. This is an opportunity to create and apply a can-do philosophy that inspires young and old, men and women, people with disabilities, the unemployed, the homeless, the poor and the deprived by seeing each person as a special individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="08011776000223">The Olympic and Paralympic Games have already shown how they can inspire enthusiasm, as witnessed in the euphoric celebration that we had on the streets of London in July 2005 when London was awarded the host status. The commendable leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, and his multicultural team showed that can-do spirit. They won the Games for us to host, against all odds. I was certainly one of those celebrating a victory that he did not expect, and a lot of other people felt the same. We must now push on to spread the philosophy that&#151;whoever, whatever and wherever you are&#151;you can do it in pursuit of your dreams.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="08011776000224">No one can deny the sustainable attributes and qualities of the people of London, or indeed of the entire UK population. London is able to regenerate itself, as the noble Lord, Lord Coe, said, and we do not need the Games to create the improvements that are happening. London&#146;s diversity is a huge strength in attracting inward investment. Record numbers of tourists visit each year from all parts of the world. London is also home for the many migrants who settle here, filling gaps in the economy left by the outward migration of others to leafy suburban areas and less congested parts of the country. We also observe a growing aged population and more people experiencing disabilities and mental health illnesses. There are increasing levels of dependency.</p>

<a name="80117-0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="08011776000225">Three public policy strands are therefore sufficiently important to be explicitly stated within the legacy goals of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Community cohesion, social inclusion and anti-poverty programmes must be intensified and connected more comprehensively with all other policy areas. We will not overcome cynicism or the failure to engage with ordinary people who feel excluded from all these initiatives if we do not connect with a diverse range of programmes which all purport to bring social benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="08011776000226">Last week the former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, published a pamphlet from which I shall quote one sentence that epitomises the issue we have to deal with. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"><a name="08011776000806">&#147;Entrenched inequality, which sees people living increasingly separate lives according to their wealth, means there is a danger of a small but significant underclass developing in Britain&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000770">His research found that poor and wealthy households are living ever further apart. While the Government have lifted large numbers of children out of poverty since 1997, 1.4 million children are still poor, despite having at least one parent in work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08011776000227">The legacy of the Olympic and Paralympic Games must have a gearing effect that recognises, as it will do, the needs of elite sports men and women, wider participation, and those who are not part of the can-do culture in affluent London. The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be costly but they have the potential to be inspirational. There is no doubt that those associated with developing and delivering the Olympic and Paralympic Games are taking steps to address the social inclusion, community cohesion and diversity agendas. We in Parliament have an obligation to help to get it right for the benefit of all the people. They can do; we can do; we must do. To

The Olympic Delivery Authority aims, to quote from its website, at,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000858">&#147;reintegrating communities on either side of the Lower Lea Valley ... enabling social cohesion and social, economic and environmental regeneration in one of the most deprived parts of the UK&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000771">It adds that Olympic development,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000859">&#147;will also celebrate cultures, people, languages ... We have taken a deliberately broad and inclusive definition of culture&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000772">The London Development Agency, its delivery arm, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"><a name="08011776000807">&#147;We strive to tackle discrimination and promote equality and positive community relations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000773">It is,</p>

<p><a name="08011776000774">Work is certainly going on with tremendous commitment&#151;I have been around the building sites, too.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="08011776000229">However, what happened on one site in Newham was not like these fine modern management words. The Travellers at Clays Lane had lived peacefully with the settled community for 36 years. They were offered and accepted a new site, which then, for complex, oddly unforeseen planning reasons, was withdrawn. The substitute site was a recreation area. It is felt that, in their urgency to vacate the land for Olympic development, the LDA and Newham Council have disregarded the needs and wishes of both the Travellers and other local residents, causing, I am told, much resentment in the local community. Far from gaining any benefits from the Olympics, they believe they have lost some of their scarce green space and community facilities. The good relationships between the Traveller community and the other local residents which had been built up over such a long time have been undermined. Rather than an increased sense of community cohesion, Travellers now feel more segregated and vulnerable.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="08011776000230">After this, as I have said earlier in your Lordships&#146; House, the Travellers were given 12 different dates for being moved, and they spent many weeks, with their children, with demolition, noise, heavy traffic and dust all around them, post stopped, phones cut off, and street lights gone. An allegation was made by the ODA that the Travellers had themselves caused health problems by burning toxic waste in a furnace, which turned out not to exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="08011776000231">The All-Party Group on Gypsy and Traveller Law Reform, of which I am a vice-chair, discussed these matters with representatives from the ODA and the LDA who were kind enough to come in. They agreed that a senior official would deliver an apology about the wrongful allegation in person. Yet again, that is not what happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="08011776000232">Some of your Lordships may have had experience of developers making life uncomfortable for residents. They will know that developers can be persuaded to negotiate compensation, lessen noise and disruption, and restrict hours of noisy work, often&#151;if they are sensible&#151;through a consultative process where all local people have the chance to be involved. That is not what it was like at Clays Lane. Could it be because the residents were not accustomed to forceful discussions with powerful developers and did not number lawyers and other professionally articulate citizens among them that they were treated with so little respect? What price the ODA&#146;s social cohesion policy here? Where was the listening LDA?</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="08011776000233">We hoped that lessons had been learned after our discussion in Parliament&#151;indeed, the people from the ODA and the LDA assured us that they had. But the episode of the letter to residents is not reassuring. The next test of the reality of the ODA&#146;s fine policies about sustainable communities with regard to the Travellers is the nearby site of Waterden Crescent, where the ODA and the LDA assured us that the promised, but so far non-existent, written plan for building works will now be issued every month.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="08011776000234">Nobody in these sad episodes is asking for development to stop, and nobody wants the games not to succeed. Indeed, everyone was delighted when the Government pulled off the tremendous coup of hosting the games. But unless all those in the path of the great machine of the Olympic Delivery Authority are treated with as much respect as if they were powerful and influential people, they will end up with a legacy of mistrust, alienation and an impoverished quality of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="08011776000235">Nearly &#163;9 billion is to be spent in the area to be redeveloped. We shall have the largest new urban green space in Europe. Can we not ensure that this kind of money is spent at all levels with the right values for truly sustainable communities? The Newham Travellers have their own thoughts about a more positive legacy. They would like the opportunity to return to a part of the Olympic park area after 2012, on their own site, where they will be away from heavy traffic. They have some support from the mayors of London and Newham, and the LDA. If this can be written into the Olympic legacy, it would show that the Travellers had finally been heard. I hope that my noble friend, too, can support it.</p>

I hope that appropriate places of worship

The Government will mess it up, even though they will do so with the very best of intentions. It happens to be one of the difficulties of government that has plagued every Government in every country throughout the world. However, what I have enjoyed about today&#146;s debate is the enthusiasm and passion that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, brought, and his real feel for the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="08011776000240">I have an equal passion for the north of Scotland. A lot of what is happening there depends on arts and heritage funding, because that produces tourism. Tourism is key in the north of Scotland. We do not have much flexibility with regard to farming; there are not alternative things that one can do down in the south-east; industry, particularly the fishing industry, has been decimated; and Dounreay is being decommissioned. We need jobs in that area, and tourism is perhaps the most important sector for us, because it provides employment and keeps the communities together.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="08011776000241">However, the real difficulty with the Olympics is the raiding of more than &#163;1 billion from the National Lottery fund budget. That is having enormous consequences. There is plenty of scope for debate as to how and why the Government force the lottery fund to spend its money in certain ways and whether the heritage is relevant so far as the Heritage Lottery Fund is concerned, in view of some of the recent achievements. Those are questions for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="08011776000242">I am delighted to be able to say a big thank you to the Government about what the Secretary of State said two days ago in another place; namely, confirmation that there would be no more raids on the National Lottery fund&#151;&#163;1.1 billion is quite enough and way in excess of what there should have been&#151;regardless of whether the costs of the Olympics will increase, which I am sure they will. They will go well above the current budget.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="08011776000243">However, there are two consequences. The first is that, a big foot having been put on the main artery that has stopped the flow of funds going to some worthwhile local projects, there is a loss of momentum&#151;a large one built up over the past years. It is all very well to say that we are going to do something in the future&#151;which I will come back to&#151;but when you lose that momentum, people do not put in applications, they lose enthusiasm and regenerating that is going to be difficult.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="08011776000244">My second point is on how one is going to compensate the Heritage Lottery Fund for what is being forced on it at the moment. In our last debate

It appears that there might be quite a discrepancy in what comes back to the lottery. Therefore, I ask the Minister two questions. First, will any repayment to the lottery come back with interest attached? Secondly, would the Government consider allowing the National Lottery fund to have an overdraft account guaranteed by the Government up to &#163;1.1 billion? If it did, the flow of good local projects could be kept going so that we did not have what really worries me&#151;a big stall period for four years in which people lose interest, with consequences for employment and jobs locally.</p>

However, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, for giving us the opportunity to have this debate and for an inspirational contribution. I took note of his focus on people, places and sustainable communities. People have paid tribute to his track record. If I had a quibble, it was when he seemed to say that it was not the macro that was important, but the micro. Surely the macro is important. We have to deliver the Games.

We will have the largest urban park in Europe for 150 years; 4,000 new homes, many affordable&#151;I would like the Minister, when he replies, to give us some assurances that the amount of affordable housing will not be reduced because of this problem with land values&#151;20 kilometres of roads, 32 bridges, new utilities and 12

I agree with the point made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London&#151;I am not sure whether he is in his place&#151;about the role of faith organisations.

We have a golden opportunity to improve sports facilities and encourage participation. Looking at the disincentive created by the cost of participating in sport, particularly when you come from the disadvantaged areas of your community, I sometimes think that we ought to treat sport in the way that we treat the health service&#151;free at the point of use, certainly for young people.

I hope we are going to see it as half full, because we have a wonderful tendency in this country to denigrate ourselves and undermine the possibility for achievement.

I know, because as chairman, until last year, of the local North East London Strategic Health Authority, I was on the receiving end of the noble Lord&#146;s occasional diatribes&#151;which were all the more irritating for being right.</p>

I make no apology for coming back to the people who are living there now and will be living there in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="08011776000257">I shall talk particularly about the health legacy of the Olympics. We have heard these figures quoted before in this House, but, according to the statistics, a child born in Newham is likely to live seven years less than a child born in Westminster or Kensington and 10 years less if he or she smokes or develops early vascular disease as a result of secondary diabetes, largely as a result of obesity and lack of exercise. The sad fact is that growing up in Newham is bad for your health. One of the youngest, fastest-growing population groups is simply not improving as fast as the population groups of other places in the UK. That is not for want of local initiatives by the NHS and a rather good local authority.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="08011776000258">Routine physical exercise is the key, not participation in sport. I remind noble Lords that the Office of Science and Technology Foresight report on obesity published last year outlined the complex issues&#151;the social, technological and cultural drivers&#151;involved. Nevertheless, it cannot be said better than it was said by Tessa Jowell:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"><a name="08011776000808">&#147;The problem is not the number of calories kids are taking in, but the fact they are doing less to burn them off&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000775">While adult energy expenditure is thought to have decreased by as much as 30 per cent in the past decade, calorie intake appears to be the same or even a little below that of 1980. It is a matter of promoting exercise as a whole.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="08011776000259">The key thing that we know about creating urban environments in which physical exercise is encouraged is that you need to make it a part of the central regeneration plan. Even using up 200 or 300 extra calories a day is all that is needed to prevent obesity in most people. The design layouts in the built environment, such as streets, the location of recreation facilities, parks, public buildings and transport systems, can either encourage or discourage. A lovely study in Atlanta by Frank and Engelke showed that when neighbourhoods are divided into four quartiles based on an approach of building healthy physical environments, each quartile increase in mixed land use, making people more likely to walk to shops, schools, workplaces and other destinations such as churches close to their dwellings, facilitates better active living and is associated

Each additional kilometre walked each day is associated with an almost 5 per cent reduction. That is why so much of the design of the Olympic park legacy is so vital.</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="08011776000260">I shall not say much about the sports facility legacy. We feel that it must be important but we know, sadly, that increased enthusiasm for specific sports after a great event tends to be short-lived&#151;rather like the appearance of tennis rackets every Wimbledon fortnight, which disappear a month later. But we know that those facilities are much more likely to be used by local schools and adults if we provide them as part of a naturally increased physically active environment. We must get the physical activity right as a general rule, before we can improve sports. 2012 provides a unique opportunity to address some of the health issues that the UK faces. We can test what really works. Are the Government intending to use the regeneration area as a test bed for some of the ideas expressed in the Foresight obesity action plan, for example?</p>

<a name="80117-0006.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="08011776000261">I end by expressing some concern about the politics of all this. To date, after the euphoria of the bid, the Department of Health has not demonstrated a keen commitment to the Olympics health legacy. There has been a recent reshuffling of public health responsibilities yet again, but no clarity about who is responsible for what in this area and who will interface with other departments involved. Public health specialists in NHS London and its constituent PCTs have some really good work going on. Sport England used to be interested and involved in improving physical exercise, but its input, although greatly appreciated, has now transferred to the Department of Health. There is a worrying vacuum in the department about who is taking forward this particular responsibility. Will the Minister explore in some depth with his colleagues who is in charge of making the Olympics health legacy really work to improve physical activity and the take-up of the sports legacy? I fear that at present no one is.</p>

Many noble Lords have emphasised that one reason for our bid being successful was the legacy aspect. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee&#146;s report last year on Olympic funding and legacy made the point that the success of the London bid was to a great extent not just due to the plans for the Games themselves but to,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="08011776000264">Securing the legacy of the 2012 Olympics is a massive task with myriad objectives, as we have heard during this excellent debate. Many organisations are involved&#151;LOCOG, the ODA, the LDA, the mayor, the Assembly, DCMS, VisitBritain, Visit London, the BOA, Sport England, UK Sport, the Legacy Trust, the national, local and sporting organisations, culture and arts organisations, the five host boroughs and even the devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as other bodies more local to the area, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson. Ensuring that all those bodies link together effectively under common strategies is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="08011776000265">There are great expectations of what the legacy of the London Games should be.

Its verdict is that in the light of that experience, with Barcelona having done particularly well, all the London objectives are challenging or very challenging, particularly as regards skills, sports participation, disability awareness, tourism and employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="08011776000268">Physical activity targets are also part of the legacy. We heard from the Minister yesterday&#151;and this is a somewhat surprising development&#151;that the Treasury is now responsible for the achievement of some of those legacy objectives. I have never thought of the Treasury as a place that engenders a great deal of enthusiasm in local communities, but there is hope yet. As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and my noble friend Lord Addington urged, we need to connect with the Olympics at grass-roots level.</p>

Tier 3, as my noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter explained, is all about trying to activate those local community organisations to take part in the Cultural Olympiad, but there are also cuts in lottery funding for those selfsame organisations. We have the Legacy Trust with a very small amount of money dedicated to this task; &#163;10 million will not go very far. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, spoke about lottery funding being used for the Olympics. We will return to that later this month when we discuss the regulation.

The noble Lord&#146;s concern, shared by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, was that the whole governance structure needs to be looked at, or we will be trying to co-ordinate a huge number of agencies in a very haphazard way. Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, reminded us that there should also be a legacy for disadvantaged communities, such as Gypsies and Travellers. We also have to demonstrate legacy outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="08011776000271">In the few minutes left to me, I want to highlight the opportunities and threats surrounding the tourism legacy of the 2012 Olympics. VisitBritain says that 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the net economic benefit over a seven-to-10-year period will accrue through tourism and give a &#163;2.1 billion boost to Britain&#146;s international visitor economy. Almost two-thirds of this growth will occur in the four years after the Games. Sydney and Barcelona were particularly successful with their tourism legacy. There is no doubt, as the recently launched <I>Winning: a tourism </I><I>s</I><I>trategy for 2012 and beyond</I> sets out, that through private-sector sponsorship and inter-agency partnerships, we could have a successful strategy and campaign to deliver that legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="08011776000272">That document sets out an ambitious legacy, but it is a chance to reduce Britain&#146;s tourism deficit, which now stands at some &#163;18 billion per annum. This accounts for some 40 per cent of the UK&#146;s balance of payments deficit. There are currently declining numbers of foreign visitors staying overnight at UK destinations. Despite the very upbeat launch of the tourism strategy for the 2012 Games last September, and the warm words of Margaret Hodge, the reality is

The chairman of the Tourism Alliance, representing 200,000 travel, tourism, hospitality and leisure businesses and the leaders of a number of major businesses had to write an open letter to the Prime Minister only a few weeks afterwards in the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"><a name="08011776000809">&#147;The DCMS announcement of an 18% cut in funding for the national tourist board, VisitBritain, in the lead-up to the Olympic Games comes as just the most recent in an ongoing series of Government decisions that demonstrate the downgrading of tourism&#146;s importance to national policy... The industry does not understand the logic of cutting funding for tourism marketing in the lead up to the 2012 Olympics. The Government has stated that tourism and regeneration will be the two main beneficiaries of Britain staging the 2012 Olympics ... If the planned cuts to VisitBritain&#146;s funding are followed and the need for coherent national tourism policy ignored, Britain will almost certainly miss the opportunity to maximize the economic and social benefits that the tourism industry has on offer&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="08011776000273">This is a powerful letter. On the one hand, one of the largest industries in Britain, accounting for some 9.4 per cent of UK GDP, writes that it believes that there are great opportunities; on the other hand, the Government have continually failed to give VisitBritain the resources it needs. In fact, it has cut its funding by &#163;9 million, equivalent to 18 per cent of its budget. Do the Government understand the importance of the tourism sector? Do the Government not perceive the need for a strong marketing campaign?</p>

On these Benches there is enormous enthusiasm for the Games. We believe that the glass is more than half-full, but the Minister needs to answer these questions constructively and take seriously all the points that have been made in this debate.</p>

That has to be good. We have to believe that planners can make the best of that beautiful area, and that a concrete mess will not be left at the end of it. Frankly, I do not believe that will be the case. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, will be able to encourage the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, to continue to work in the south-east.

One of my criticisms to the powers that be so far has been that 2012 is too London orientated. At the start of today&#146;s debate, it was too south-east London orientated. When we had the opening discussions and debates in your Lordships&#146; House and we passed the Olympics Bill, now the Olympics Act, this side of the House and the Government said openly and strongly that 2012 should be a national happening, a UK-wide happening, and that there would be benefits across the United Kingdom.</p>

Therefore, &#147;we&#148; have not yet got a grip on selling the benefits of 2012 to the country north of&#151;I do not know&#151;perhaps Aylesbury or the M25. We must move that way and get up to Newcastle. I listened carefully to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle. I was in Newcastle with my millennium hat on and we did them quite well.

We lose a huge amount of talent when people leave school and do not make the step into clubs. Yesterday at lunch, I was talking to the chief executive of UK Sport. He agreed that that gap is still there. In the sporting world, the talent we lose in the step between school and club is huge.

Of the 100 per cent of funds that goes to UK Sport&#151;I am not knocking UK Sport&#151;probably only 50 per cent gets to the front line. It is too cumbersome and there is too much bureaucracy. There is not enough clarity. At my national governing body, the British Bobsleigh Association, we have a guy having to work almost full time filling in forms and doing everything necessary to keep the corporate governance right, the audit preparations right, to keep applications right, et cetera.

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="08011776000288">The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is in an excellent position for bringing high-flown concepts down to the gritty reality of what happens on the ground. I take very sincerely his representations on the necessity for a great deal of work to be done on co-ordination. I think that he suggested that the structures in east London are a bit of a mess. My noble friend Lord Haworth lives in that part of the world and bore testimony to some constructive work going on, and the response of local government. I think that that is the perspective also of those concerned&#151;for example, the noble Lords, Lord Coe and Lord Moynihan&#151;with the development of the plans for the Games. Co-operation is going on with local authorities, but it needs to be improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="08011776000289">The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, is emphasising more than the local authorities: he is referring to engagement with local communities so that they have ownership of many of these plans, which is exactly in line with the Government&#146;s thinking and all those who are concerned with making the Games a success. Certainly, unless we achieve these legacy objectives, we will fall short of that which we expect from the Games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="08011776000290">The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, probably prompted the question of the regions in the most critical form and, in a rather more constructive way, the right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle also emphasised the regions and the north-east. It is important that we ensure that the legacy is for the whole country. It is certainly the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, indicated, that we will need to exploit the great tourist potential of the Games. In fact, many factors explain why the bids should win. London&#151; and the United Kingdom as a whole&#151;is a great tourist attraction for people from all over the world, and we need to improve the facilities and to guarantee that the attractions are up to the mark for 2012 in a way that also enhances them in terms of sustainable heritage after the Games are over.</p>

Most noble Lords have stressed the opportunities that are there and need to be seized rather than excessive worries about where we are now. There should not be excessive worries about where we are now. As the International Olympic Committee has made it clear,

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08011776000292">We should not do ourselves down in this context. A great deal of thought has taken place; much of that has centred on the great structural activity involved and on cleaning up of that extensive site&#151;the challenge that the location of the Olympic Games raises. Transforming that part of the Lower Lea Valley into the Olympic Park&#151;into one of the great parks of Europe&#151;and which will be comparable to the Royal Parks, which were given to the nation two centuries or so ago, will be a truly historic achievement. A great deal of work is inevitably being concentrated on that. My noble friend Lord Haworth bore testimony to the degree of activity on the site.</p>

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="08011776000293">Many of the objectives that noble Lords sought with the Games will be realised later. Let me make this obvious point: it is inevitably the case that apart from those directly involved in the Games&#151;those planning for the Games and those responsible for the development of the Olympic Park&#151;there is a feeling that there has not been great activity and that the nation has not been greatly enthusiastic thus far.</p>

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="08011776000294">I remind the House that we are talking not about the next Olympic Games but about the Olympic Games after that. We have the Beijing Olympics this year. I maintain that there will be a transformation in the public&#146;s response. Once the Olympic Games have taken place in Beijing and the torch has been handed over to London, the Games will excite the enthusiasm of many in the nation; the Olympic Games always have that stimulating effect. But London is going to be up in lights at the end of the Games as the next provider of the Olympiad. That is bound to change the nation&#146;s perspective and bring about a realisation of the imminence of the Games and the benefits that they can bring.</p>

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="08011776000295">The focus in the early days will inevitably be on the sporting possibilities. After all, the nation will have to acquit itself in these Games to extremely high standards. The nation would think us remiss if there were not advanced plans for the development of the skills and abilities of our athletes and sports men and women; the training of a great athlete takes many years and our potential victors in 2012 are not necessarily making all the headlines for their achievements at the moment. One or two people who make the headlines in sport today could go on to win medals in the London Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="08011776000297">Having said that, we should shift our perspective to the question of the legacy, because that is of the greatest import. There is the sporting legacy in terms of the stimulus to our young people to engage in exercise and participating sport. I emphasise to the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, that the challenge of co-ordinating the necessary onslaught against the problem of obesity in our nation, which is particularly marked among young people, will be carried out by the Department for Health, but I have not the slightest doubt that the Olympic Games can play their part with regard to encouraging young people to recognise

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="08011776000298">I heard the lament of the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about the diversion of lottery funds towards the Olympic Games. Let me make it clear again&#151;I believe my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made this clear earlier this week&#151;that the budget for the Games is fixed at &#163;9.3 billion. That is what we will expect to see the Games deliver against those resources. Built into that figure is a significant contingency fund as well so the figures are realistic.</p>

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="08011776000299">However, resources from the Lottery cause pain elsewhere where they might have been directed. While the noble Lord and the noble Baroness omitted the point from their contributions, I know that they are extremely knowledgeable in this area. I hope that they will give due regard to the fact that the Government substantially increased their grant-in-aid funding for the Arts Council England, so it should rise to &#163;467 million by 2010-11&#151;an increase well above inflation over the three years. I therefore hope it will be appreciated that of course the arts will play an important part of the inheritance that derives from the Games and the cultural legacy.</p>

<a name="80117-0007.htm_para33">
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="08011776000300">We do not intend to sell the arts short. It is also the case, as a number of noble Lords have emphasised&#151;the right reverend Prelates the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Newcastle certainly did so&#151;that it is important that communities become engaged constructively. A great deal of what will be achieved across the nation and presented both to the tourist and to the British visitor moving around the country will be the product not of central government stimulus&#151;not all of it will come from central allocations from Lottery funds and the Arts Council&#151;but because people are stimulated to play their part in a great opportunity for the nation in the cultural field as well as the sporting one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="08011776000301">I bear out the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. She is right that co-ordination between local authorities and boroughs is important and that a masterplan in place. She will recognise that we intend to launch the masterplan fully shortly; it will be a product of the co-ordinating activity that undoubtedly is necessary when so many significant actors are on the scene.</p>

I know the strength of her conviction on justice for Travellers and I know the work that she does. I regret that some mistakes have been made&#151;there is no doubt about that&#151;and apologies have been made to the Travellers for one group&#146;s allocation to an unsatisfactory site. That was unacceptable. We will certainly be offering the Travellers the opportunity to return to the Olympic Park when the Games are over, if they so choose. We have pretty clear indications that the successful development of other sites in east London at present are proving satisfactory and, therefore, they may choose to stay where they are, rather than return to the Olympic site.</p>

Everyone recognises that without the work done at that level, we would not have made such rapid progress thus far. I know that they have been through trials and tribulations; after all, as the noble Lord, Lord Coe, emphasised, it is quite the biggest project that can be conceived of in the area of sport and athletics for many years, if at all. He is to be congratulated in the leadership that he has offered. The priorities are being responded to and they are clearly to the fore.</p>

I think the noble Lord, Lord Ouseley, made reference to the Sydney experience and the inheritance of the Games being of limited value to much of the city&#146;s population, which is certainly true. We are concerned that the legacy will be of benefit to the whole nation. The nation will be stimulated by the Olympic Games, which will be held in London in 2012. We hope we have an excellent performance in the sport and athletics arenas and in the sports that are carried out throughout the country.

The opportunity is so great in comparison with 1948. The Olympic movement was grateful to the United Kingdom and to London for its efforts in 1948, so shortly after the war and for picking up the Olympic Games at very short notice. Those Games operated under some pretty dire privations with limited ambitions but these Games have the greatest ambitions. It is the intention of the Government that those ambitions should be fulfilled.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
 &#147;The House will recall that, in October 2007, the Russian Government threatened to close down the British Council's operations outside Moscow from 1 January 2008.  This was confirmed on 12 December and then again last week with the threat of a series of administrative measures against the British Council, including tax measures in St Petersburg and visa restrictions against British Council staff in St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg.  The Russians also threatened to take measures against the British Council in Moscow, up to and including the removal of accreditation of British Council staff working in Russia. &#147;On Tuesday, the Prime Minister's foreign policy adviser held what we believed were productive talks in Moscow about a range of international and bilateral issues, including the British Council.  Yet on the same day the Russian Government exerted further pressure on the British Council.  The Russian security services summoned over 20 locally engaged members of British Council staff in St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg one by one for interviews. Ten members of staff were interviewed late at night in their homes after calls by the Russian tax police.  Questioning ranged from the institutional status of the British Council to personal questions about the health and welfare of family pets.  These Russian citizens have chosen to offer their skills and hard work to promote cultural contact between the people  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1464"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Russia and the UK.  As a result, they have been the subject of blatant intimidation from their own Government. &#147;I think the whole House will agree that such actions are reprehensible, not worthy of a great country, and contrary to the letter and spirit of the legal framework under which the British Council operates, notably international law, including the Vienna conventions, and the UK/Russia 1994 bilateral agreement on cultural co-operation which Russia has ratified. Russia has failed to show any legal reasons under Russian or international law why the British Council should not continue to operate. Russia has also failed to substantiate its claims that the British Council is avoiding paying tax. The British Council is in fact registered for tax in Russia and has complied with all requests of the tax authorities in respect of its activities. Therefore, instead of taking legal action against the council, they have resorted to intimidation of the council's staff. I am confident that the whole House will share the Government's anger and dismay at the actions of the Russian Government. We saw similar actions during the Cold War but thought they had been put behind us. &#147;The British Council's first priority is, rightly, the safety of its staff. Yet the actions of the Russian Government have made it impossible for staff to go about their business in a normal way.  British Council offices in Ekaterinburg and St Petersburg have been prevented from operating, and therefore the British Council has taken the decision to suspend their operations in those two cities.  The council is making an announcement to this effect as I speak.  The staff concerned will continue to be supported while the Council considers its next steps. &#147;There has already been strong international condemnation of Russian actions.  Following my conversation last night with the Slovenian Foreign Minister in his capacity as presidency of the EU, he agreed to issue a statement today on behalf of all European governments. The US Government have issued a statement of support calling for the British Council to be able to continue its good work in Russia. The Canadian Government are expressing their concerns in Moscow about developments.  I am grateful also for the many expressions of support the British Council has received from Russians who have benefited from working with the British Council. &#147;Mr Speaker, the Russian Foreign Minister stated publicly on 12 December what the Russian Government had been saying to us in private; namely, that attacks on the British Council were linked to the Litvinenko issue.  I announced on 16 July to this House a list of measures the Government had decided to adopt in response to Russia's failure to co-operate with our efforts to secure justice for Alexander Litvinenko.  These included introducing visa restrictions for Russian officials travelling to the UK and suspending our visa consultations.  The House can rest assured, Mr Speaker, that these measures will continue to be administered rigorously.  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1465"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;But we regard as entirely separate issues Mr Litvinenko's murder and the activities of the British Council to build up links between British and Russian schools and universities, to support English language teaching in Russia and Russian studies in the UK, and to promote the best of British drama, writing, music, and art. Nor do we believe that cultural activities should become a political football; in fact, educational and cultural activities are important ways of bringing people together.  That is why I have decided not to take similar action against Russia's cultural activities in the UK, for example by sending back Russian masterpieces scheduled for show at the Royal Academy, or by taking measures against the two Russian diplomats at the Russian Embassy dedicated to cultural work.  We have nothing to fear from these contacts; we welcome and encourage them. The immediate cost to the Russian people of the Russian Government's actions is their access to the benefits of British Council activity. The longer term cost is their country's standing in the world as a responsible international player. The British Council will continue its work in Moscow, meeting the demand from as many as possible of the 1.25 million Russian citizens who used the council's services nationwide last year. &#147;Mr Speaker, the council's experience in Russia is not repeated in any of the more than 100 British Council operations elsewhere in the world. Russia's actions therefore raise serious questions about her observance of international law, as well as about the standards of behaviour she is prepared to adopt towards her own citizens.  This can only make the international community more cautious in its dealings with Russia in international negotiations and more doubtful about its existing international commitments. &#147;Russia remains an important international player in addressing key global issues and challenges, including climate change and energy security, as well as others, such as Iran and Kosovo.   But I hope the whole House will agree with me that Russia's actions against the British Council are a stain on Russia's reputation and standing that will have been noted by countries all around the world.  I will continue to keep the House informed of developments&#148;.

They ought to latch on to these ideas now because it seems that their own agencies have highly separate agendas. As the Minister has described, that is the only way one can make sense of the fact that, while the Moscow Foreign Ministry is having supposedly helpful and reassuring talks with UK officials, the Russian security bosses are harassing British Council workers and clients, visiting them in their homes in the night and generally acting like Soviet heavies from central casting.</p>

Russian officials have also been quoted as saying that the British Council&#146;s Moscow offices could be targeted next if no agreement on the status of cultural organisations and the availability of British visas for Russian diplomats were reached.

My wife and I also informally visited the British Council in St Petersburg last April&#151;Stephen Kinnock is a former student of my wife&#151;and learnt something about the petty harassments which were already under way there. Therefore, we appreciate that this situation has not come out of the blue at all; it is a ratcheting up of pressures. We on these Benches approve strongly of the Government&#146;s moderate response and their attempt to ensure that it is co-ordinated, first, with those of our partners in the European Union and then more widely with those of other members of the civilised community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="08011776000323">One of my strongest impressions following our week in Moscow last February was that the Russian interpretation of &#147;sovereign democracy&#148; is that, now that Russia has re-established itself after the humiliations of the 1990s, it be allowed to behave like a great power. There is an unfortunate interpretation of the way in which the Bush Administration behave as a great power, which is to say, &#147;Great superpowers are above international law. We don&#146;t have to obey the same rules as everyone else&#148;. That is very much the way in which the current Russian Government interpret their position. Therefore, we have to insist that international law operates and that, if Russia wants to be considered a civilised and responsible member of the international community, it must also apply the rule of law domestically.</p>

That is absurd, and we clearly have to take this as a general problem for the international community and respond in that way. This seems to be a situation in which a co-ordinated European response is particularly appropriate, because the Russian Government are attempting to pick off European Governments one by one&#151;Poland on some issues; Germany on others, and so on&#151;in order to reassert their superiority in a number of areas.

What is the appropriate response to both individual students and Russian institutions which want closer links with British educational institutions to be maintained when the British Council, which has done much to help in that regard, appears to be prevented from doing what we all want it to do&#151;build closer links and pull Russian society and Russian intellectual life closer to our own?</p>

However, interestingly, for the past nine years, the UK has been keen to conclude a further cultural centres agreement with Russia. The Russians have not seen fit to co-operate on that yet, but I stress that the council does not need a new agreement, and the 1994 agreement does not stipulate that it does.

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="08011776000369">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am pleased to have secured this debate today and I welcome those noble Lords who have come to speak about the issues raised in the Work Foundation report, <I>Fit for Work? Musculoskeletal Disorders and Labour Market Participation</I>. This report, published last September with the support of a grant from Abbott Laboratories, highlights a topic of great importance and one of serious concern to many millions of people in this country. I say millions advisedly. More than 2.5 million people in the UK visit their GP with back pain each year. At any one time, a third of the population is suffering with back problems, and it is estimated that up to 80 per cent of the adult population will suffer significant back pain at some time in their life. What is more, in the vast majority of cases there will be no specific diagnosis. Those who have suffered from back pain know how debilitating it can be. It affects mobility, it affects agility, and the strains produced diminish stamina. The pain affects concentration, the ability to think and rationality, and it necessarily affects the sufferer&#146;s mood. It may make them irritable and can lead to severe depression.</p>

<a name="80117-0009.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="08011776000370">There has been much debate about the impact of mental health conditions and the associated stigma and difficulties that can lead to people losing their jobs. Amid the concern about the psychological well-being of the UK workforce, those with physical problems have often seemed to have received less attention. The number of working days lost to psychological problems or stress is, of course, high. However, as the Work Foundation report points out, almost twice as many workers are affected by musculoskeletal disorders such as back pain, arm or neck strains, or diseases of the joints. Back pain and similar problems affected over 1 million people in 2005-06 and, according to the Health and Safety Executive, were responsible for 9.5 million lost working days, at a cost to society, in 2007 prices, of over &#163;7 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="08011776000371">What happens when these people visit their GPs with a complaint? All too often, out of compassion and concern for their patient, the GP will issue a sick note advising that they take time off work. They may be advised to stay at home for weeks or months while they wait for tests and then treatments to make them feel well again. For those of us who fall ill with flu or minor infections and spend a week in bed, this probably sounds like common sense. However, for many people with long-term acute conditions, it may not always be the right approach. As the report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"><a name="08011776000810">&#147;Work can be both cause and cure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000778">The physical conditions of work may indeed have caused or aggravated a musculoskeletal condition but, equally, prolonged inactivity may well make the condition worse. Moreover, absence from the work environment and the associated isolation may worsen the depression associated with the pain and make recovery less likely. Certainly, many GPs and employers mistakenly believe that sufferers from musculoskeletal disorders must be 100 per cent well before any return to work can be contemplated.</p>

<a name="80117-0009.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="08011776000372">Some employer surveys suggest that back pain and other musculoskeletal problems account for as much as two-thirds of long-term sickness absence. The Department of Health estimates that almost a quarter of the more than 2.6 million people of working age claiming incapacity benefit suffer from these problems. Surveys of people affected suggest that thousands of people in this country want to work and think that they are capable of work but are instead stranded on incapacity benefit. One survey undertaken by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, aptly titled the <I>I Want to Work</I> survey, tells how people with rheumatoid arthritis desperately want to keep working but encounter a raft of barriers. The most commonly cited barriers are the inability to get fast access to their rheumatologist and the attitude taken by employers once they learn that an employee has a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Nearly 400,000 people in the UK have rheumatoid arthritis and 12,000 new cases are reported each year. Unlike other forms of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects people of all ages, hitting people in their 20s or 30s at the early stages of their careers. Almost a quarter of those with the disease stop working within five years of the diagnosis, at a cost to the taxpayer of &#163;89 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="08011776000373">With an ageing population comes the increasing prevalence of a host of chronic conditions and an increasing number of people who do not want to be written off. They want to be independent and economically active. We have to address the barriers to their participating in the labour force if we are to have a sustainable future economy. The Work Foundation report considers the interrelationship between improving health outcomes and improving work outcomes. It suggests that perhaps if employers were more educated about their employees&#146; conditions and flexible over adapting tasks, and if the NHS was better geared towards helping people stay in work, we could both reduce public spending and better support people with musculoskeletal conditions who want to work but find it impossibly difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="08011776000374">The report suggests that changes in the attitudes of both healthcare professionals and employers are needed to help people with MSDs to stay in work. Not only does each need to think in terms of how to support people in their jobs; they also need to  think about how to collaborate better. GPs, rheumatologists, nurses and employers should talk to each other about the support that their patients or employees need and how to work round the illness, rather than letting the illness itself dominate.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="08011776000375">Some employers, of course, are enlightened. I am an adviser to the board of Transport for London. TfL and its predecessors have long had extremely progressive policies on staff welfare&#151;that is, despite what you may have heard from the RMT trade union. Its occupational health service has undertaken a programme to address back pain. There has been an in-house physiotherapy service for lower back pain since 2001. Attractive educational materials including a CD-ROM with amusing video clips and job-dependent exercises for staff were developed and widely distributed in 2005-06. They are now provided internally in some types of training. A back exercise class was introduced to augment one-to-one physiotherapy for back pain and is focused on maintaining and improving back fitness and flexibility.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="08011776000376">A two-hour class in pain physiology is an entry requirement into this exercise class and employees learn complex concepts about it with remarkable ease. Each exercise class includes some educational content and the employee who attends all 10 classes will learn about anatomy, soft-tissue healing, how to stand, how to lift, how to adjust your chair and so on. The classes are run three times a week at different times to allow employees to attend without interfering with their shifts. Employees are encouraged to continue to attend once their back pain has been relieved, if they would like to, in order to keep up the level of back fitness that they have achieved. One big change in approach is the relatively new expectation that employees attend such classes in their own time if they are not off sick. TfL is moving from a paternalistic approach to a partnership approach with employees. The responsibility for an individual's health remains with that individual and all the work of the occupational health team supports that basic reality. Further work has been undertaken to develop a lower-limb exercise class, primarily for those with knee or ankle problems. This was introduced in 2007 and has proved enormously popular. Evaluation of the impact of this class will begin soon.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="08011776000377">The analysis that has been done so far on the effectiveness of these TfL services, in particular the ones on lower back pain, is relevant to today's debate: A pilot study carried out in 2001 demonstrated that employees who received physiotherapy intervention returned to work 12.6 days sooner than would be predicted using historical data when employees did not have access to a physiotherapy service. A more recent study, in 2003-04, found that employees who were referred to the back pain service after more than six weeks&#146; absence had twice the length of absence of those referred within six weeks and four times the  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1478"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>length of absence of those referred within two weeks. Thus early referral for physiotherapy can be seen to have significantly reduced further time off. Sitting at home waiting for the problem to resolve just prolonged the amount of time that people took off work. Moreover only 13 per cent of employees referred to the lower back pain service in September to December 2005 for first-episode lower back pain had a recurrent episode leading to absence during the following year; and only 23 per cent of employees with a previous history of lower back pain had a recurrent episode leading to absence during the following year. This compares favourably with recurrence rates of 26 to 37 per cent reported in research. This confirms so many of the conclusions of the Work Foundation report.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="08011776000378">Let me just say a few further words about the importance of early intervention. It is now widely acknowledged that early intervention is essential to support people with musculoskeletal diseases to continue with their jobs. For many, as the TfL work has shown, fast access to physiotherapy can make a huge difference, while early access to drug therapies for those with progressive illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis can slow or even halt the progression of their condition. Delay in getting the right diagnosis or treatment therefore increases the probability of the person losing their job or prolonging their absence from work.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="08011776000379">The Government recognise that in their Health, Work and Well-being Strategy, and we have the welcome appointment of Dame Carol Black as national clinical director for health and work. But the aspiration of an NHS geared to support people in work and flexible working for those who need it is far from the reality. The <I>Fit for Work?</I> report tells us of long waiting times for care, certain employers&#146; lack of capacity to deal with sickness, lack of employee awareness about conditions and their management, and mixed messages on the effectiveness of various methods of workplace interventions or return-to-work programmes, all of which are barriers to making good and healthy work a reality for those suffering from MSDs. It goes on to advise that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"><a name="08011776000811">&#147;Early action, preferably in partnership between GPs, the patient and their employer, can help achieve a balance between the individual&#146;s need for respite and their need to work.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80117-0010.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="08011776000380">As many of these conditions cause a decline in functional capabilities over time, early detection and the targeted treatment of specific diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are crucial in enabling a patient to manage their condition and improve their quality of life. It is clearly essential that this message permeates through the NHS and I look forward to hearing from my noble friend the Minister about what steps are being taken to make sure that this happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="08011776000381">Of course, bringing savings to the budget of the Department for Work and Pensions is not something that the Department of Health is formally tasked with bringing about, but joint working on this issue is essential. The Work Foundation report makes 27 recommendations in all, some aimed at employers, some at employees, and others for GPs and other occupational health professionals. It is not possible to go through all of those in my remaining time but I

It concerns changes to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The Work Foundation makes a strong case for a change to the statutory instruments governing NICE to allow the institute to take appropriate account of the benefits of full and active labour market participation when assessing the cost-effectiveness of treatments. This recommendation could not be more timely. Last week&#146;s Health Select Committee report on NICE recommended that wider benefits and costs, such as the costs borne by carers and social care services, be more fully incorporated into NICE&#146;s assessments. Surely work costs and benefits should also be considered when NICE issues guidance and advice to the NHS.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="08011776000382">As noble Lords will know, NICE evaluations of treatment currently concentrate only on assessing the clinical costs and benefits&#151;that is, those borne by the NHS. It is currently beyond NICE&#146;s statutory remit to consider the wider consequences of keeping more employees in the labour market, so the recommendation is not critical of the institute, which indeed conducts a range of important and helpful work, but rather suggests that its terms of reference and working methods need to be updated. If the Treasury was able to consider the fuller economic impact of MSDs it might be more inclined to support further joint working and partnership between the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions to train and motivate the professionals working in these spheres.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="08011776000383">The Department of Health already acknowledges in its Musculoskeletal Services Framework issued in July 2006 that the year-on-year costs of anti-TNF drugs which are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other MSDs are likely to be offset by keeping patients with rheumatoid arthritis at work and reducing the need for them to claim incapacity benefit. Indeed, it was the Prevention of Work Disability Study commissioned by Abbott and presented to the American College of Rheumatology in November 2006, which showed how anti-TNFs can help to keep people in work, that gave rise to the report we are discussing today. However, these costs and benefits are not taken into account by NICE. As the report points out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"><a name="08011776000812">&#147;Economically efficient guidance on drug therapies may protect the NHS budget, but can put extra strain on [the budget] of the DWP&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80117-0010.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="08011776000384">Since NHS policy and practice can impact on a patient&#146;s ability to return to or remain in work, health policy makers need increasingly to take into account the broader work-related benefits of treatments as well as their more traditional clinical benefits. Employers need to engage with the NHS and avoid adopting a risk-management approach of easing people out of their jobs just because they have a long-term health condition. With the right support, thousands more can thrive in the workplace, contribute to society and enjoy the benefits of work.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="08011776000385">This is, of course, a plea for that clich&#233;d holy grail: joined-up policy making. Like any grail quest, there are many obstacles in the way, but the natural overlap

Some 2.5 million sufferers, at an annual cost to society of &#163;7 billion, are reason enough for overcoming the obstacles. I hope that this short debate will send a powerful message to my right honourable friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State of Health and for Work and Pensions to sort these problems out, so that we invest to save&#151;invest in the health of those 2.5 million sufferers so as to save on the costs of maintaining them on incapacity benefit. That is already, in principle at least, government policy. I call on my right honourable friends to support patients with back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders to enable them to continue in the workplace&#151;a greater priority as they look to tackle public finances.

His spirited and detailed speech means that we do not need to go into much detail. Almost everything in the report has been covered in one way or another. I must say that I found his account of  the situation and his ability to express the interrelationship between the various points made in the report and the recommendations to the Government particularly interesting.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="08011776000388">I was drawn to making a brief contribution to today&#146;s debate because, ever since working for the National Economic Development Office in the 1970s, I have been interested in matters which affect employment and management. This was partly because I could see a connection with the EU Select Committee report on the effect of mental ill health and stress on employment, and because this report covers certain matters which affect women in a particular way. As the noble Lord has explained, the thesis of the report is straightforward. The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders within the workforce is large and increasing, imposing severe costs in terms of lost output, treatment costs, the non-earning of pensions, on businesses, the NHS, affected individuals and the economy in general. Indeed, the report maintains that these conditions are now more common and impose greater costs than does mental illness, which we considered in the EU report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="08011776000389">The report suggests that the way this problem is tackled by employers, doctors and to some extent by sufferers themselves is not as effective as it could be, with the result that some employees are either persuaded to, or feel they must, leave employment altogether. Not only does this mean that they have no resources on which to live during their working years, they also do not earn themselves a pension. The effect on employees&#146; personal well-being in later life and the costs to the state of supporting people who have not earned a pension are likely to grow in parallel with the growth in the percentage of the population that is over the age of 65, like quite a few of us in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08011776000390">The report considers a number of ways of improving the response of doctors, employees and employers to the problems of joint pains, back-ache and other more serious disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and makes two interesting points in this context. First, that the advice of doctors that sufferers should take time off work is not always helpful, and secondly, that the tendency of employers to persuade employees to leave their employment compounds the problem. The report also points out that:</p>

<p><a name="08011776000779">Unfortunately, it seems that once affected workers have left their job for any length of time they may, as a result of a combination of circumstances, never return to work again. The report suggests a number of ways of tackling these problems and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s responses to the points put to her by the noble Lord in his opening speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="08011776000391">I would particularly like to ask the Minister about the kind of help that should be given to small and medium-sized enterprises in tackling the interrelated problems of modifying working conditions so as to enable workers to continue in work, and thus avoid the cost of recruiting and training new employees, while at the same time maintaining output. Such companies are likely to feel themselves overburdened by regulation and paperwork&#151;a cry of pain frequently heard while I chaired Sub-Committee G. Would the Minister consider a scheme that would bring the managers of SMEs together at the local level, possibly through chambers of commerce, for training and the exchange of effective information, including health advice, about what actually works in practice? The learning process might be started at that level with greater ease than in other ways.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="08011776000392">A particular concern highlighted by the report is the double burden carried by women who are caring for children and/or elderly relatives as well as working. As the number of women in the workforce increases, women are particularly likely to be exposed to the risk factors associated with the conflict between work and care roles. Does the Minister consider that employers are sufficiently alert to the damage that can be done to women, as to men, by very repetitious work&#151;for example, at the keyboard&#151;to which they are often assigned? If so, would better training and informing of managers help to improve the situation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="08011776000393">Women are already less likely to earn a full pension than are men because of the demands of family life, although the new pensions provisions may improve that situation.

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="08011776000396">For many years this has been the case. When I was a member on the Regional Health Authority of Yorkshire, I used to look down the agenda for the next 10 years and find that physical disability was not even mentioned. I should like to go back into history for a moment. Years ago, when I came to live in Yorkshire after I got married and I was campaigning for better facilities for disabled people, I was contacted by a young woman from Bradford who had rheumatoid arthritis. This was my first introduction to RA. I went to visit Theresa in Bradford. She was living in a tiny, one-room bed-sit in a terraced house, with the kitchen in a cupboard and, I suppose, the lavatory in another cupboard. She shared this cramped room with her elderly mother. This disabled young woman used a wheelchair; there were a few steps to enter the room. She had difficulty in eating because of a stiff jaw&#151;she had a similar problem with the rest of her body. Even with all these difficulties, her spirit was wonderful.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="08011776000397">A little time after my visit, Theresa contacted me to say that her mother had had a stroke in the early hours of the morning and had fallen half out of bed. Theresa could do nothing until the paperboy passed her window at about 7 am. She attracted his attention by knocking on the window with her long-handled fork, which she used for eating. He went to get her sister, who lived in the same street a few houses down. It is this which made me think that there should be better treatment and facilities for such cases and which made me move an amendment to the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 that disabled people at risk should have a telephone and be able to make contact to get help.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="08011776000398">The report your Lordships are discussing today was produced by the Work Foundation, with a grant from Abbott. It links in very well with the book <I>Women&#146;s Insight into Rheumatoid Arthritis</I>, which was produced two years ago in collaboration with the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and Arthritis Care, with sponsorship, again, by Abbott. Ten Members of the Parliaments, including the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and myself, were very pleased to take part in interviewing 10 women with RA. These were all people who had managed to get their lives together with the correct treatment and drugs and to go on living and working with the care they needed. I congratulate the two voluntary organisations, the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and Arthritis Care, on the support and information it gave its members. They helped them to focus on the positive, not the negative, and to come to

They give back lost confidence and experience, which helps many people to get back into paid employment.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="08011776000399">I enjoyed meeting Carrie and interviewing her for the book. Many people think that RA is a condition of elderly people. I give Carrie&#146;s story to illustrate that this is not the case. Carrie was diagnosed with juvenile RA at the age of three, when her mother noticed a persistent limp. All through her life Carrie has had to have joint replacements, otherwise she would not be able to live on her own, drive, work and walk. The operations are only half the story; there is also the day-to-day treatment. Carrie is on one drug for the disease long term and one drug each day: one is to stop the progression of the disease and the other is to get her out of bed in the morning.</p>

<a name="80117-0010.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="08011776000400">This Christmas I had a card and letter from Carrie. I wrote back to her telling her about this report and the debate today. In her letter, Carrie told me that she had had surgery on her left shoulder; the stay in hospital was, as ever, not good. At one point her surgeon advised her to leave hospital as soon as possible owing to the fact that it was such a dangerous place because of the risk of infection. Luckily the surgery was a success and she remained infection-free. She went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"><a name="08011776000814">&#147;As each year goes by the resources seem to be cut in the NHS. I&#146;ve never known it to affect me so directly from the prescribing of new drugs to having insoles put in my shoes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000780">This is direct patient care. I hope the Minister will do her best to influence the departments so that those people who want to work and do so but have long-term conditions are given the help they need. Carrie is a firm advocate of disabled people working if they can. It builds confidence and increases social life; in theory, it is financially beneficial; and it keeps you physically active, within reason. She told me that she knows many people who just vegetate at home and lack the confidence even to pick up the telephone. There should be hard-hitting courses to get people back into work. There is far too much soft-soaping, she told me. She says she knows many people, far fitter than she is, who will not even try as they do not want to lose their benefits. Carrie says that that attitude is incredibly insulting to her and others who make the effort to retain employment. Although it is a controversial view, she has always believed that the best incentive the Government could use to reduce the number of unemployed within the disabled sector would be to cut benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="08011776000401">Having talked to people with long-term musculoskeletal disorders, it seems to me that there should be a flexible approach. When surgery for joint replacements has to be undertaken and medical appointments kept, that should be taken into consideration and both employers and employees should be helped with such a flexible approach.

</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000782">If this situation is not rectified, I see nothing but problems. Surely this is a matter of joined-up government between the Department of Health and the former department of employment, now called Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="08011776000402">On page 16 the report asks,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"><a name="08011776000817">&#147;How well do GPs and occupational health professionals understand and deal with MSDs as they relate to the workplace? How well equipped is the NHS to provide early intervention, rehabilitation and other support for people with these conditions?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000783">About 30 per cent of GP consultations are for musculoskeletal conditions. Patients need to be diagnosed correctly and given the correct medication and rehabilitation. There is concern that maybe not all of them will see a rheumatologist. Are there enough consultant rheumatologists? Last year the NHS introduced a musculoskeletal service framework. That was welcome, but there is some concern that the clinical assessment teams may not be led by a rheumatologist. There is also much concern that doctors in their training may not have enough hours to conclude the complex matters surrounding the health issues of MSDs. There is even more concern about how the hours of medical education for doctors may be reduced, due to the European working time directive. I hope that will be seriously looked at when the Tooke report is considered.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="08011776000403">Misdiagnosis of these serious conditions, leaving patients to deteriorate, is often seen, as I found in Bradford. One often hears that nurses could be left to deal with these patients. That is confusing for everyone concerned. A specialist doctor needs to do the diagnosing and updating of drugs, while the patient&#146;s journey needs the involvement of a team with advice and treatment from physiotherapists, occupational therapists and nurses.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="08011776000404">The employers need advice too. So much help can be given with the correct equipment, such as the correct office chairs, tables at the correct height, computers, lavatories, access to buildings, adequate transport and parking and much more.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="08011776000405">I have seen a young man so desperate with a bad back that he had to lie on the floor of a train when travelling. The report includes people with back pain, a huge problem for many people who are desperate to continue to work. With the correct treatment, they will do so.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="08011776000406">The report mentions the sick note culture, a great frustration for many employers. When GPs find writing a sick note is the easy way out, it is not good for the patients or the employers. I hope the report, <I>Fit For Work?</I>, will make many people realise how important it is to give people with MSD the right advice, help, medication and medical treatment. I am sure the Minister, who really cares, will do her bit to help and make things better.</p>

I thank him on behalf of the healthcare professionals who work with patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders and on behalf of those patients living with those disorders. I hope that this debate will do a great service to everyone.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="08011776000408">The noble Lord has highlighted the plight of those suffering from musculoskeletal disorders and laid out the wider repercussions of those disorders in society and the workplace. From the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation survey last year, we know that musculoskeletal disorders were attributed by over 68 per cent of employers as the main reason for long-term absenteeism from work, while the Department of Health tells us that 60 per cent of those on long-term absence leave cite musculoskeletal problems as their reason. Many of those people never return to work, resulting in 22 per cent of people on incapacity benefits being musculoskeletal patients&#151;an enormous number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="08011776000409">I wish to concentrate my remarks on the management of chronic pain and declare my interest as the lead for the chronic pain management programme in Cardiff, and as president of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. In our little pain management programme, which I know is in Wales and not in England, so I do not expect the Minister to answer for any devolved health issues, we see people who often have had many thousands of pounds spent on them. They have had treatments to no avail and are still searching for the magic bullet, which, sadly, that does not exist. For some, their problems go back many years into childhood; for others, their problems started with abuse, which was the beginning of their chronic pain and their chronic pain experience. For all of them, their condition has resulted in a series of losses: a loss of role or job, the loss of relationships, or failed intimate relationships. They become depressed, withdrawn and isolated.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="08011776000410">Many try to do what they can on a good day, only to pay for it later by having a flare-up of their condition; that is called underactivity/overactivity cycling. On the pain management programme, they learn about chronic pain and ways to pace their activities to avoid that cycling. They also learn to adapt to their limitations and to have the courage to resume a lifestyle, fully aware that life will never be as it was before the condition started.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="08011776000411">Our programme is run, on a day-to-day basis, by a physiotherapist and a clinical psychologist who teach the patients about the interplay between pain mechanisms and the actions of drugs, and why those drugs often do not work for them. They teach the effect of fatigue and depression on the patients&#146; overall pain experience, and the influence of their social situation on that experience, which covers both work and family demands, including intimate sexual relationships.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="08011776000412">Our patient outcomes are really dramatic; I am very proud of them. Average patient scores for anxiety and depression almost halve. Patients&#146; quality  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1486"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of life scores more than double, while their scores on functioning&#151;and their self-satisfaction scores with it&#151;improve dramatically. Scores are trebled and are being maintained at a six months&#146; follow-up after the programme.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="08011776000413">We have now started a programme to try and keep those still in work there by intervening to stop the downward spiral&#151;and this, our latest programme, has shown even better outcomes than we normally achieve. I know that the numbers are small, and I ask your Lordships to forgive me that, but they are quite impressive. We have only run the programme once: of the seven who completed the programme, six attended a follow-up. Depression and anxiety scores were now normal for four of them, while they had fallen significantly for the other two. Five admitted that they were now taking less time off work; four had visited their GP less, while the other two had visited no more than previously. In all, their functioning scores showed a marked improvement.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="08011776000414">So yes, I am proud of this little programme. My point is that when you empower patients&#151;when you help them help themselves&#151;they can do so much, but such programmes are few and far between. They do not cost much. Our costs are less than &#163;1,700 for each patient completing the programme. That includes the costs of all those who drop out or who, at assessment, clearly will not benefit. The programme is only NHS funded. We integrate with rheumatology, psychiatry and anaesthetic-led pain clinics.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="08011776000415">It is important that people learn to change their own work environment and are empowered to search out and create the support that they individually need. It is tragic that such high numbers are on benefit when, with the best of today&#146;s medical care and pain management, they could be supported to carry on working. We have too often seen what happens to people who leave the workplace due to illness or disability. They languish on incapacity benefit. Depression and worsening health take their toll, and, crucially, they then have a lower chance of getting back into work.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="08011776000416">On average, if you are off sick for six months, you have an 80 per cent chance of being out of work for five years. Once someone has been claiming incapacity benefit for two years or more, they are more likely to retire or die than return to employment.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="08011776000417">A strong evidence base suggests that this psychosocial model of intervention effectively informs the management of musculoskeletal disorders in both clinical and occupational settings. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, outlined a workplace-based programme. That principle forms the basis of the World Health Organisation&#146;s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which is widely seen as the authoritative guide for vocational rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="08011776000418">However, there is limited understanding of the model among patients, GPs and employers, who often find it difficult to look beyond immediate overwhelming physical symptoms. The Department of Health&#146;s musculoskeletal services framework makes only passing reference to rehabilitation and  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1487"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column 1487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>back-to-work vocational reintegration, which is unfortunate, as the pain management model helps us to understand what is happening to people with musculoskeletal disorders and how and why they drop through the net.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="08011776000419">The model has implications for the stakeholders and employees of both the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions. The health, work and well-being strategy may be the best place for such a model now to sit. Dame Carol Black, who, as has been said, is the national director for health and work, expressed the hope that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000864">&#147;in time MSDs will become less relevant to work and working life&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000784">However, she went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"><a name="08011776000818">&#147;Until then, efforts to raise awareness of these disorders must continue with ever greater urgency&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000785">Her vocational rehabilitation task force will look at why so few employers offer occupational health or vocational rehabilitation to their employees.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="08011776000420">The Work Foundation report also makes an important point about self-management, advising us to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000865">&#147;help the individual to find strategies to manage their own condition, which will enable them to make their own decisions about their working arrangements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000786">I therefore suggest that commissioners in health must work in conjunction with vocational services to ensure that rehabilitation to work is well integrated into mainstream clinical practice and that a return to functioning becomes a valued outcome for patients, because it can be the first step towards a return to work.</p>

When I read it for the first time late at night earlier this week, my initial reaction was, &#147;No&#148;&#151;expletive deleted&#151;&#147;Sherlock&#148;, because most of what it said was obvious. I then realised that I was being unfair on the report, because I had never previously seen a combination of effects put together in the same place. People were admitting the quite obvious fact that if you have a debilitating physical condition that removes your ability to go to work and carry out a normal life, you will be more likely, for instance, to be depressed. They go hand in glove. In addition, I have covered virtually everything that is mentioned in the report in many other areas on which I have spoken in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="08011776000422">We have talked about physiotherapists. Regarding soft tissue injuries, last year I ran a small and probably not very successful campaign. It was all about getting in early, getting the right treatment, making sure you are treated early and making sure you listen to the advice. In that way, you will get over the condition&#151;it will not become chronic. That is exactly what this report says. It also says that if you need a drug treatment, you should get it early and you will probably get the benefits early. You will not get the chronic condition&#151;you will not get the wear and tear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="08011776000423">This is not a great surprise to anyone when you think about it. We then try and cross-reference it again. Having had the disability brief for a long time, I have become very aware that certain people who have a condition will be able to access and do certain things, but not everything. It is the idea of what you can do, as opposed to being properly fit and that you can do something. There are many organisations available; they are probably not the ones represented by this group, but if Parliament cannot help people talk to each other, who else can? People are not addressing the fact that they should concentrate on what they can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="08011776000424">Employers should be given the right information early and told that it is not that expensive&#151;this is a mantra I have gone through I do not know how many times. They should be told about early intervention, for example, about breaking up the working pattern or, in this case, about repetitive strain injuries or conditions that aggravate. Then the person will or can still be an active part of your workforce or can go and do another job. If that is done, you can carry on. These are small changes.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="08011776000425">However, we come back to a series of problems that have occurred again and again. The first one is ignorance, at every single point in this process. The GP knows about prescribing painkillers and now also anti-depressants. Having done so for the immediate problems for the patient in the waiting room&#151;the sick note Britain culture is also an issue here&#151;he may well, in his own eyes, be fulfilling his job.</p>

I think I have mentioned young males&#151;a young male who does a hard physical job and probably has low academic qualifications will find great difficulty in even comprehending the idea of retraining. Indeed, the higher people&#146;s academic qualification, the much more likely they are to have a full role in society. Disabled lawyers in wheelchairs do not do too badly. It is that simple. At the higher end of the social and economic scale, jobs tend to be less physically demanding. As your skills are more valuable, people are more readily available to make adaptations for you. That is why the multiplier effect comes down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="08011776000427">The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, mentioned this statistic, which I think I first heard during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill. With X amount of time on benefits, a person is more likely to die than get a job. It is something that carries on. The real message behind this report is one of co-ordination among Government. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, and I had a conversation about this. We are on very familiar ground. As the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said, if the Department of Health gets it right, the Department for Work and Pensions saves money. It is all Treasury money&#151;that is, public money.</p>

If there is that sort of co-ordination at the top, something can then be done&#151;but it still relies on that. You need institutional structures to disseminate information downward to people who may not be used to reading forms or publications to discover about their condition; GPs need to relate this condition to people who go to them and trade unions need to make sure that they know about the condition, and so on. Information needs disseminating so that people can act early enough to stop the chronic situation; that is what is at the heart of this. If this report inspires the Government to start acting in this way, they will have achieved a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="08011776000429">I have a couple of questions that I can fairly ask the Minister. First, what is the formal interaction between the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions on this situation? In the last welfare reform, the Department for Work and Pensions set up a series of training posts and interviews to get people back into jobs, often concentrating on mental health. I was a part of that project. How is that process feeding back into the Department of Health? That is a fair point, which we should all hear about very soon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="08011776000430">Secondly, have we improved the situation of access to physiotherapy to ensure that it is more immediately available and that people do not have to wait for it? If you have to wait on painkillers and you have deteriorating physical health, when muscle tone and mass disappear, you will find it technically more difficult to take exercise. You will have to go through an even longer period of help, which costs, or you will be permanently in a situation of chemical management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="08011776000431">What is happening with those two situations? I would appreciate it if the noble Baroness could give me some information now or at least make sure that we know soon. Unless information is disseminated along with the processes that support it, this problem will simply carry on in its traditional merry way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="08011776000433">The noble Lord&#146;s Motion calls for a concerted approach to these matters, and the Government&#146;s own musculoskeletal framework seems to me a perfect starting point for such an approach. It is fair to say that this framework&#151;MSF&#151;is recognised by patient groups and clinicians alike as an excellent policy document. The vision that the document presents is really very imaginative. It would promote the development of services in the community; provide patients with better information with which to manage their own conditions and thereby avoid being admitted to hospital; improve the way in which the

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="08011776000434">Taken in the round, the framework would undoubtedly mean treatment being delivered to patients in a more timely and effective way. Why is it, then, that apart from the 18-week target for orthopaedics, virtually nothing has been done about the report since it was published more than a year and a half ago? It is almost as if the framework document is sitting on a shelf in Richmond House gathering dust. I happen to know a bit about documents that gather dust in the Department of Health. When I presented my own report some years ago, a senior civil servant, who shall remain nameless, told me that it would simply collect dust on the shelf, along with others. When I told him that I cared not about the report but rather about disabled people, he shrugged, so we got Mrs Thatcher&#151;now the noble Baroness&#151;to straighten him out.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="08011776000435">I respectfully submit that this report really needs an injection of ministerial enthusiasm. As far as I can see, no Minister has stood up to give wholehearted backing to the framework, or to put in place what is required, which is a sort of clinical champion to pick up the recommendations in the MSF and run with them. One problem with doing so is the complete absence of outcome measures. That is a major deficiency, because at the moment we have large variations in expenditure on musculoskeletal conditions between different PCTs around the country, as has been mentioned already. Without any measure of outcomes, these variations and what they mean for patients are very difficult to interpret.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="08011776000436">The national budgeting database reveals that, as a percentage of spending, musculoskeletal conditions account for as much 10 per cent of the budget in some areas, and less than 1 per cent in others. Why is there that enormous variation, and what does it mean? Without an investigation by a neutral body, such as the National Audit Office, we will not know the answer. It suggests to me that, at the very least, the quality of care that some patients are receiving is a good deal less than it should be. That should worry us, given the scale of the problem that we are dealing with.</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="08011776000437">The estimates that I have seen are that nearly a quarter of all adults and around 12,000 children are affected by musculoskeletal problems which limit everyday activities. More than 1 million people under 45 are affected in one way or another. According to the framework document, up to 60 per cent of people on long-term sick leave cite musculoskeletal problems as the reason. The real figure may be considerably higher, because a large proportion of arthritis sufferers experience depression, which is another significant cause of incapacity, as many noble Lords have already mentioned.</p>

If they were included, it is certain that we would have a lot more data about the outcomes than we currently do. Would the Minister consider such an inclusion?</p>

<a name="80117-0011.htm_para34">
<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="08011776000439">Perhaps it would be helpful to mention that the GP general medical services contract governs the provision of primary care services in the UK. Under the contract, primary care service provision is measured against a quality and outcomes framework, or QOF. GP services are measured in points, up to a maximum of just over 1,000, and each point is worth a nominal amount of money to the GPs, thereby incentivising them to tackle those clinical areas included in the QOF. There are no points in the QOF for musculoskeletal disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, and so there is no contractual incentive for GPs to make these a priority.</p>

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease which affects the spine, joints, tendons and ligaments and, in its severest form, can result in complete spinal fusion causing extreme physical limitations. What may not be appreciated by noble Lords is that the joints between the spine and the ribs are affected, which severely limits breathing. Expansion of the chest occurs when the ribs move upwards, forwards and outwards. This movement is prevented when the joints are fixed. Respiration  is then maintained only by movements of the  diaphragm.</p>

An X-ray showed arthritis of the thumb and a blood test surprisingly revealed ankylosing spondylitis. The disease can be very difficult to diagnose in the early stages and can easily be overlooked due to the large number of people who complain of back ache. The report cites a survey undertaken by the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society, which found that the average time it took patients to see a rheumatologist was 27 months.</p>

About one-third of people with ankylosing spondylitis may be unable to work at any one time. The report cites a recent study that estimates the average total cost to society of a person with ankylosing spondylitis as just over &#163;6,000 per year, largely as a result of early retirement caused by the disease.

A wait of more than two years to receive a diagnosis is unacceptable for people suffering from such progressive, chronic diseases. One of the most significant proposals in the musculoskeletal service framework was the development of clinical assessment and treatment services, known as CATS. The team brings together skilled professionals from primary and secondary care, including GPs with special interests, and rheumatologists and nurse practitioners for faster assessment, diagnosis, treatment referral to other specialists, and to support a return to work.</p>

<a name="80117-0012.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="08011776000445">The problem is that no additional funding has been allocated to implement the new services proposed, and there appears to be no mechanism to ensure that the quality of the service is improved or even kept at today&#146;s standards. This system of CATS is a wonderful idea on paper, but early detection and treatment will be possible only if these teams contain professional expertise and diagnostic tools to ensure that MSD sufferers receive the swift diagnosis and speedy treatment, which is so essential to their rehabilitation.</p>

<a name="80117-0012.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="08011776000446">Time and again we have heard that the Department of Health deflects its responsibilities to the PCTs when they are asked how implementation is progressing. With no information being collected centrally, how can the Government possibly assess how their guidance is being implemented? What guarantee is there that the quality of care being given to MSD patients is what is should be? What MSD patients want from CATS is swift access to an experienced rheumatologist. Without proper assessment of how these teams are structured, the quality of care they are receiving remains unclear. This is just not acceptable for people whose future quality of life depends on early diagnosis of their condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="08011776000448">If the NHS is to diagnose and treat quickly, and help patients return to work, it needs the necessary resources to do so. I noted with interest last week&#146;s Health Select Committee report into NICE and its recommendations regarding the need for an assessment of the wider societal costs of treatment, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, mentioned. If NICE considered the benefits to the taxpayer of supporting patients to work, it would undoubtedly conclude that it was worth the investment in the NHS to deliver returns to the Exchequer.</p>

Inevitably in all such debates there has been criticism about mistakes and deficiencies. We all make mistakes, so I would like to make a constructive suggestion which I mentioned during Question Time yesterday.

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="08011776000450">At Guy&#146;s we were fortunate to have the senior surgeon Mr Rex Lawrie to chair these meetings. He was expert at doing so because he created an atmosphere that was friendly and not threatening. They were the most popular meetings that we had. When some poor registrar stood up to confess some mistake that he had made with the sweat pouring off his brow and seeing his future prospects disappearing in the distance, the senior surgeon would reassure him by telling him of a bigger mistake that he himself had made recently. He was creating an atmosphere in which people were honest about their mistakes. That is the ideal environment in which to learn how to minimise their mistakes. It became rather like the general confession, and just as therapeutic. I wonder whether the Minister would consider introducing similar meetings to the Department of Health. It would certainly improve matters for the patients and for those who work in the NHS. Who knows: the Department of Health might start a fashion throughout all government departments.</p>

The framework has produced examples of good practice in orthopaedics on the 18-week website to help organisations to learn from the success of others, precisely so that people all over the country can get good and swift treatment and advice. A series of 18-week commissioning pathways, including some for common orthopaedic conditions, has been published. The purpose of the pathways is to support discussions between key local stakeholders around the services that they should be commissioning to meet and sustain the figure of 18 weeks.

That is 10,500 more consultants than were working in the NHS in 1997. Forecasts show that there will be around 2,500 more consultants by 2010, in accordance with the increasing demand for more specialist doctors. The emphasis of CATS is on multidisciplinary working, and evidence shows that many successful teams are led by other professionals such as nurse practitioners, but that is not to say that I denigrate the role of consultant rheumatologists, who do the most fantastic job, where they are available.</p>

The MRC wants to expand its portfolio of musculoskeletal research. Last summer I had the privilege of visiting the Bath Institute for Rheumatic Diseases&#151;BIRD&#151;an independent registered charity which raises funds to support research and education into many aspects of bone and joint diseases. The research it carries out is first class but its real value-added is the way in which it works in close collaboration with the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases trust and the University of Bath, thus enhancing benefits for patients.

A key element of this is the activity of the Health and Safety Executive, which works to ensure that employees are not injured or made ill by their jobs. Musculoskeletal disorders are a major cause of work-related ill health in Great Britain. A priority for the HSE over the last decade, therefore, has been to reduce the number of musculoskeletal disorders caused by work. The HSE has been working closely with employers and trade unions to improve risk management and to give managers, staff and safety representatives the tools they need to prevent musculoskeletal disorders developing because of work. One example of this is its Better Backs campaign, which has been mentioned.</p>

We now need to consider what we can learn from it as we plan the best way to support employers, particularly smaller ones.

For example, if we instruct NICE to attach additional weight to treatments that can get people back to work, that, by implication, means that we are attaching less weight to improving the health of retired people or those with terminal illnesses who will never be well enough to return to work. The consequences of any change would therefore need to be considered very carefully, including any interplay with anti-discrimination laws. However, it is an issue that the Government are looking at actively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="08011776000469">We also need to work more with healthcare professionals, and GPs in particular, to ensure that they better understand occupational health issues, the links between health and work and the role that they can play in helping patients to remain in or return to work. We want healthcare professionals to appreciate that a return to work should be one of the indicators of a successful outcome of the care that they provide to their patients. The Government are working with the professional medical bodies to provide tailored education and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="08011776000470">The other day, I saw some research that had been carried out by Doctors.net.uk in September last year. It was based on a survey of 1,500 GPs and found that two-thirds of doctors were unaware of the evidence that work is good for health. There is therefore much to do in that area. However, we are doing a lot of work with GPs, examples of which include a training programme for them that the Department for Work and Pensions has been piloting in partnership with the Royal College of General Practitioners, and modules in health and work that have been developed for inclusion in undergraduate medical degree syllabuses.</p>

<a name="80117-0012.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="08011776000471">The DWP is also developing a range of tools to provide practical support for GPs and other healthcare professionals. For example, it has produced an online learning module for GPs about handling difficult consultations with patients on the subject of a return to work. This programme of work builds on ground-breaking independent research, commissioned by the DWP and published in September 2006, showing for the first time that work truly is generally good for health and well-being. In some areas, GPs and Jobcentre Plus are working together closely on the ground, and Jobcentre Plus representatives are working in health centres, which is excellent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="08011776000473">The noble Lord, Lord McColl, mentioned the QOF. GPs are, of course, at the forefront of managing musculoskeletal conditions. Work in other clinical areas, such as coronary heart disease, asthma and diabetes, has shown that both the level and quality of care for these conditions in primary care can be greatly improved by inclusion in the quality and outcomes framework. I know that many noble Lords see the inclusion of musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoporosis, within the QOF as key to improving services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="08011776000474">The Department of Health is committed to developing new clinical areas within the quality and outcomes framework. Indeed, we have found it frustrating that the negotiating process has not succeeded in delivering the continuous quality improvements that we see as a fundamental feature of the QOF. That is one reason why my noble friend Lord Darzi signalled in his interim report that we intended to take a more wide-ranging look at how to reshape incentives for quality and outcomes in primary medical care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="08011776000475">The activity that I have mentioned is now starting to bear fruit and we are seeing a real and positive shift in the way that healthcare professionals consider employment. Perhaps I may give one example. Dame Carol Black has met more than 30 of the main medical colleges and health professional bodies to agree a ground-breaking consensus statement on health and work. However, it is clear that we need a real change in attitude if we are to help more people of working age to find and stay in work, regardless of health conditions. As is said in the report, <I>Fit for Work</I><I>?</I><I> Musculoske</I><I>le</I><I>tal Disorders and Labour Market Participation</I>, we need to be more positive, focusing on what people can do and not on what they cannot do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="08011776000476">To support this change in culture, the DWP is also currently revising the format and content of the statutory medical certificate, moving towards more of a &#147;fit note&#148; system than a &#147;sick note&#148; one. The department is working with employers, employees, healthcare professionals and their representative bodies to produce a certificate that will assist and encourage doctors to provide clearer and more helpful fitness-for-work advice for their patients. The revised certificate will also provide employers with the information needed to help to facilitate an employee&#146;s earlier return to work wherever possible.</p>

Incapacity benefits are being replaced from October this year with a new employment and support allowance. The new allowance will have a revised medical assessment&#151;the work capability assessment&#151;which will be much more positive than its predecessor. It will consider what customers can do, as well as what they cannot. It will also consider the customers&#146; perceptions of their illnesses and the barriers that

Comprehensive support will be made available to benefit recipients through the very successful Pathways to Work programme, which will be available across the country from April this year. Pathways support can include access to the ground-breaking condition management programmes, which help people to manage their conditions and return to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="08011776000478">All that demonstrates just how much progress we have made, but of course there is more to do. That is why my right honourable friends Alan Johnson and Peter Hain asked Dame Carol Black to carry out a review of the health of working-aged people. The review, which is due to report shortly, will contain recommendations for government and should help to shape the agenda over the coming years. In particular, Dame Carol is likely to focus on ways to expand access to occupational health and early interventions, provide more support for employers, move to a more positive &#147;fit note not sick note&#148; culture, and improve links between GPs and employers&#151;all the things that noble Lords have today rightly asked for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="08011776000479">In conclusion, we welcome this debate and firmly support my noble friend and others in their efforts to raise awareness of this critical issue. From my experience of working in the south Wales valleys with an MP and his constituents, I am well aware of the impact of musculoskeletal diseases on the lives of individuals, their families and communities. But that was 20 years ago, and there was not such great understanding then of the link between work and well-being. Work was seen as being for the fit and healthy&#151;the wholly well. I am glad that attitudes have changed and continue to change and that work these days is much more flexible. The Government have recognised the importance of the issues raised and are taking steps to address them. Debates such as this will, I trust, not only act as a catalyst for further action by all partners involved, but in some way contribute to a much needed change in the culture.</p>

We did discuss this both before and subsequent to 1999. I am delighted that the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has tabled Amendment No. 3 on somewhat similar lines. The reason it is time to change the name of this second Chamber is due to consequential Amendment No. 72. Amendment No.72 gives power to the commission to separate peerages from people sitting in Parliament. That is important. After putting down this amendment, I read the recent report of the Public Administration Select Committee, <I>Propriety and Peerages</I>&#151;its second report of the 2007-08 session. What is says is interesting, because it coincides with my thinking. Paragraph 138 of the report states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011776000866">&#147;a peerage is much more than an honour, not a prize but a duty. A seat in either House of Parliament should be sought for one reason only&#151;to serve the people. It is not always clear whether all putative peers are attracted by the chance to improve the law or provide better scrutiny of the business of government. We doubt it is overly cynical to suggest that some people might be tempted by the title of Lord or Lady. In our view such people have no place in Parliament&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08011776000787">That paragraph supports my argument that we ought to split the occupants of the second Chamber from the peerage. If that is going to be the case, we need a new name for the second Chamber. Reading on, paragraph 140 of the report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"><a name="08011776000823">&#147;The Government has indicated in its last White Paper not only that it agrees that the link between the honour and the seat in the legislature should be broken, but that this idea had support from the cross-party group convened by Mr Straw before that White Paper was published&#148;.</p>

Those two paragraphs clearly recommend a split between a peerage and the right to sit in the second Chamber, and the consequential effect of that is a requirement to change the name. I declare that I am not hooked on the word &#147;senate&#148;. It was the word I chose, but I would not mind something else&#151;I am concerned with the principle. For clarification&#151;not related to the amendment&#151;I will make my position clear on reform of this House.

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="08011776000505">Amendment No. 1 destroys affinity with the monarch as to the creation of a life peerage under the royal prerogative, which is also slighted by other provisions in the Bill, but I shall not take your Lordships&#146; time to go through those at this point; there are quite a few of them. The Oath of Allegiance, taken on grant of a written summons of attendance, will presumably go, thus making another change to the composition of the House. It would change it from a wholly appointed Chamber into a wholly elected Chamber, which cannot be achieved under the Cranborne deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="08011776000506">We enter very choppy seas in this debate in Committee. Is Clause 10, which reneges on the deal, to stand part of the Bill? This was discussed at Second Reading and need not be discussed at this point in the Committee stage. Are Clauses 14 to 17, which foreclose on the peerage for life granted under the Royal Prerogative to stand part of the Bill, albeit, as recognised by Section 2 of the House of Lords Act, no enabling provision as to implementation under standing orders is given to this Act&#151;prime legislation which operates direct? It is contrary to convention as recognised by the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="08011776000507">How can we know whether the ship of state will weather these seas today. The Bill has been drafted and brought forward by a series of well-meaning volunteers who really represent no one. One has to take that into account in a venture which is, in essence, not particularly constructive. The Government have affirmed for the fifth time, from 1999 until the Second Reading of this Bill, that they propose to honour the Cranborne deal. Is not the reality of the situation that whatever amendments are made to the Bill, should it reach the other place there will be an objection and the Bill will fail&#151; the fate of any Private Member&#146;s Bill which is not taken up by the Government? I oppose Clause 1 and I shall oppose in due course, for these reasons, many other amendments.</p>

The point that I want to dwell on very heavily is that there have been two significant events since Second Reading which I believe the House should take into account.</p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="08011776000509">The first has already been referred to&#151;that is, the publication, just before we rose for the Christmas Recess, of the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration. This report originated from concern about the cash for peerages question. I wish to quote two parts of the summary at the beginning of this 85-page report to indicate how important it is to our deliberations. The report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"><a name="08011776000826">&#147;Our main proposal is for an immediate House of Lords reform measure, clearly defined in scale and scope&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000789">I repeat, &#147;clearly defined in scale and scope&#148;. It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"><a name="08011776000827">&#147;Its primary purpose would be to put the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission onto a statutory footing, and empower it to take decisions on the size, balance and composition of the House against agreed and explicit criteria. A mechanism is also needed for peers to resign from the House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000790">In other words, the Select Committee of the other place is commending two of the three basic principles contained in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="08011776000510">It further goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"><a name="08011776000828">&#147;Our recommendations build on principles to which the major parties have already signed up. We hope that the experience of the last two years will provide the impetus to make them happen, and with a proper urgency&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000791">I think that puts the whole of our debate today in a completely different context from that which we discussed at Second Reading because a Select Committee in the House of Commons, which has

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="08011776000511">The other point of interest is that the Prime Minister himself appeared before the Liaison Committee in the other place and was asked a direct question about his attitude to the Bill. He repeated that he and the Justice Minister, Mr Straw, would look at it. He expressed concern over the legislative timetable in the other place, which is quite natural, but said that the measures in the Bill are not so contentious.</p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="08011776000512">So here we have a Select Committee of the other place urging that these reforms take place and the Prime Minister indicating that the Government would at least be open to considering these proposals if we were to present them to the other place. It is therefore my contention today that, while we are perfectly willing to accept many of the amendments without the need for much debate and to discuss others with their promoters and debate them on Report, there are none the less a raft of amendments&#151;of which this is one&#151;that fall quite wide of the narrow purpose of the Bill. They are what I call extraneous amendments. </p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="08011776000513">Of course, we could debate those amendments ad infinitum. If we were having a debate on the name of the House, I would agree with the noble Earl that it should be called a senate. However, the Bill does not attempt to deal with all these issues. It does not attempt to de-link serving in the House from an honour, nor to deal with the number of Bishops in the House or with those issues covered by some of the amendments on today&#146;s Marshalled List. Given the time constraints in the House, we must decide at the beginning whether we are going to proceed though all the amendments, including those that have nothing to do with the Bill as it is narrowly drawn, or whether we are going to stick to those that relate to the Bill itself and meet the wishes of the Select Committee in the other place. It is my great hope that we will agree to do the latter.</p>

<a name="80117-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="08011776000514">I do not think we will see the debate on an elected or unelected House for many years to come. I am reinforced in that view&#151;we dwelt on this on Second Reading&#151;by the report of the Conservative Party&#146;s task force under Mr Kenneth Clarke. He is a senior and well respected parliamentarian and a strong advocate of an elected upper Chamber, and yet he reported that they would wish to have a statutory appointments commission. When asked why he would do that when he believed in an elected upper House, he said, &#147;Because I don&#146;t expect to see that in my lifetime&#148;. Now, I wish him an enjoyable, cigar-laden lifetime, but I think he may be right. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that if and when I come to his memorial service&#151;which is going to be less interesting than if he had all those other attributes in his life&#151;I very much doubt that we will have an elected House by then.</p>

I would not expect the Government to mess up their legislative programme with endless days on the Bill with all these extraneous amendments. Nor would it be fair to those other Members of the House who have their own Private Member&#146;s Bills if we were to occupy our Fridays with this Bill. I plead with the noble Earl and others to withdraw these amendments so that we may confine ourselves to those that relate to the three main purposes of the Bill. If we did that, we would be doing a service to this House, to the other place and to the country at large.</p>

Any of us who have been Ministers&#151;and in this House there are many who have held ministerial office&#151;know just how often one thinks of a good idea for new legislation that is naturally supported by everyone who is sensible and right-thinking; one then makes a proposal to Parliament, and those wretched parliamentarians have the temerity to come forward with amendments to it. I have known countless examples of Ministers who wanted to bring forward perfectly sensible proposals, only to discover that other people in this House and in another place have an entirely different view and wish to debate the issues. That, of course, is the point of these two Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="08011776000517">I join the noble Lord, Lord Richard, in this tremendous sense of d&#233;j  vu. He and I have been debating these issues for donkey&#146;s years, and I expect that we will continue to do so. In fact, your Lordships have been discussing this issue since the party of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, championed the whole idea of an elected house in 1911. If it was so easy or so obvious we would have solved this problem years ago, but it is not. It is so fiendishly complicated and extremely difficult that, even when the noble Lord and his friends try to promote what looks like a Bill of limited ambition, we create 200 amendments. I do not know whether that is a record; perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>

My dear wife, when she realised that I would have to give up all my Fridays for the rest of the year, was rather appalled; she was delighted, however, when the noble Lord, Lord Steel, decided to bring the Committee forward to a Thursday afternoon. That noble Lord also made an excellent point about the Select Committee report in another place, because something has changed since we debated this at Second Reading. It is an important report, not just because of the difficult issues that it dealt with&#151;the potential scandal of cash-for-peerages, and the workings of the Appointments Commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Coddenham&#151;but because it came forward with various proposals for change, some of which I am not entirely sure that I agree with.</p>

However, we should get a response from the Government before we get to that, given the normal practice in these instances. I hope that the Minister can give us an idea of when he believes that a report will be made&#151;whether it will it be made in the proposed White Paper, or be separate, or whatever the answer is.</p>

Now, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Caithness for having introduced this amendment, and indeed to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, whose Amendment No. 2 is tied to it. It is entirely fair that we should consider the name of the House. In fact, I rather hope that my noble friend will consider accepting the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Richard, which I slightly prefer to that of my noble friend. I certainly hope that my noble friend will not press his to a Division, but will consider the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Richard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="08011776000521">The name of the senate conjures up certain important parallels for me. It is not just the Senates of Rome or Venice, which were in their time hugely influential bodies. We also have Senates in the United States and in Italy, and those two chambers have the most significant powers and authority of any Upper House in the world. In the past, my party has advocated the use of the word &#147;senate&#148; to replace a House of Lords. This is not the most essential item that we shall be discussing in this Committee, but it would probably be better to have a senate rather than the House of Lords if we are to change the method of selection to this House. That is partly because it conveys a sense of authority, and what is the purpose of all this disruption and reform if not to create a more powerful House, more able to help the other place to do its job properly, and help it to hold the Executive to account?</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="08011776000522">It also reflects the fact that the House which we have now is already very different&#151;in many ways arguably better, and in some ways worse&#151;from the House that we used to have. The House that we should want to create will also differ from the House that we have now. What we have now is no longer a House of Lords; it is a House of some Lords, because, in 1999, more than 650 Peers were excluded from the House, so we have Peers outside the House and Peers who are not Members of the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="08011776000523">Although it is not grouped with Amendment No. 1, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has tabled a most interesting amendment, Amendment No. 6, which we will no doubt discuss later. That takes the logical step of separating the peerage from membership of this House. The noble Lord does not go the extra inch&#151;or perhaps I should say &#147;centimetre&#148; to the modernising noble Lord, Lord Dubs&#151;and stop calling your Lordships&#146; House a &#147;House of Lords&#148;. Instead, he suggests that he should be &#147;Mr Dubs ML&#148;, which I find deeply unconvincing, but that is a debate to which we shall come later.</p>

If we are to have a reform, it should be based on a new name and a stronger House using its powers to the full, with the full authority and confidence that that would convey. I therefore agree with my noble friend that a senate, a body that can look the other place in the eye, should be our aim, and I hope that we will consider more in debate the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, though I do not know whether he expects to press it this evening.</p>

There is widespread consensus on the suitability of the four reforms itemised in the Long Title of the Bill as tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Steel. It would be sensible to get on with implementing those changes. The reforms proposed in the new clause tabled by the noble Earl and the whole variety of amendments that other noble Lords have tabled are interesting and important, but I venture to suggest that they are not urgent. We should get on with those matters that are urgent. We should with reasonable expedition send a properly considered Bill to the other place so that we can offer it a way in which the functioning of this part of Parliament can be improved, and the other great matters on which there is not yet consensus and which certainly will need to be addressed should take their time in due course.</p>

We do not wish to be distracted from pursuing that useful aim by vast numbers of red herrings, which have to be tackled some time, but which are not apt to be tackled now. One example of how dangerous it is to go down this route appears in Amendment No. 72, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in which he contemplates that the commission will recommend people not only for membership of this House but also for the bare honour of peerage. If so, why does it not do the same for knighthoods and all other honours? A peerage will then become an honour and have nothing to do with the commission or this House. Do let us get back to the bedrock of this Bill. These amendments and a large number of others deal with interesting topics but not with the substance of this Bill.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"><a name="08011776000829">&#147;Although we have made legislative proposals, and believe that is the right way to proceed, it would be possible to achieve much of what we recommend without legislation.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="08011776000534">The report makes that entirely clear. The legislation is not actually necessary to implement the majority of the recommendations&#151;and all the important ones&#151;in the report. Your Lordships should not be bounced into dealing with this Bill faster than we normally do just because of a report that does not say legislation is necessary and which has not been considered properly by another place. I remind your Lordships that it is an extremely useful report, but it is only made up by a committee, which includes six members of the Labour Party, three Conservatives and two Liberals.

I am sure he thought he meant it, even though events might have thwarted him in the mean time. It is important that the Minister tells us what the Government&#146;s attitude is.</p>

The Clerks, quite rightly, are very precise on that. All these amendments are to do with the Bill. They may not be in the narrow world that the noble Lord wants them, but they are all part of the debate that we ought to have as this Bill proceeds through Parliament.

We should be careful about moving as fast as he appears to wish us to do. Some people might say, &#147;What&#146;s in a name?&#148;&#151;but surely in the House it is clear that names are very important. This whole building is about semantics. Sometimes we hear people complain that a matter that we discuss here is a matter of semantics, but words are important. I remind the Committee of the occasion when the Post Office decided to change its name to Consignia, which some of us thought would mean that it would actually modernise its practices and offer a better service to the country: far from it, nothing of the sort. Very soon afterwards, the Post Office had to revert to its

What is serious about the noble Earl&#146;s amendment is that it will give an impression that there has been a radical change in the role and responsibility of the House, when that is obviously not the case. In that sense, it is wholly premature.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="08011776000544">Reference has already been made to the report by the Select Committee in the other place, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, rightly drew our attention to a particular paragraph. I endorse a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde: this is an issue of considerable importance to this House. Not only has the other place not discussed this report yet and not only has there been no response to it yet from the Government, but it is hot off the press with regard to this House. I wonder how many noble Lords, if I asked them, could say that they had read all 150 pages of the report and evidence; I suspect that some of us would have to admit that we have only skimmed through it. It is obviously premature that we should look at that issue raised in the report, even when it is not intended that it should comprise legislative proposals, merely small changes. The noble Earl&#146;s amendment, Amendment No. 72, talks in terms of a divergence of the membership of this legislature from the peerage. That is a completely new issue that is totally outwith the Bill proposed by my noble friend Lord Steel, and I very much appreciate what he said just now. It would be extraordinary if we went down that path without a great deal more careful consideration in this House.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="08011776000545">Other issues still await the complete and comprehensive reform proposals that we are looking to hear about from the Minister in a few minutes&#146; time. I take one example, hot from the press today: the Senior Salaries Review Body issued a statement of which I have only the BBC&#146;s analysis and summary, but it is of relevance. It is headed, &#147;Some Lords &#145;would like sick pay&#146;&#148;. I do not know which Members of the House made that suggestion to the SSRB, but it is relevant to this debate that the SSRB, as the BBC summary reports, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"><a name="08011776000832">&#147;Any &#145;fundamental&#146; changes to the system of allowances should be considered as part of wider reforms of the Lords and not before&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011776000792">That is yet another way in which we in this House must clearly realise that there is no way in which tinkering with the issues will assist the real comprehensive reform to which we all look forward.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="08011776000546">There are, in the amendments, some other matters to which the noble Earl may not yet have given his attention. I take one at random; it may interest the right reverend Prelate, who is on the Bishops&#146; Bench. It is suggested by the noble Earl that, in future, we are all to be called senators in a fully appointed House. Are the Bishops to be called senators? I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Goodhart, who had to leave the Chamber just now. The role of the Bishops in the House is completely missed by the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="08011776000549">These are premature amendments. I hope that there will be a general feeling throughout the Committee that that is the case. I am relieved to hear that my noble friend Lord Steel and his colleagues who promote the Bill also feel that this is inappropriate for this Bill. He and his colleagues have, on so many occasions, referred to the Bill as transitional, incremental and as dealing with short-term problems. In this House, short-term problems seem to me, as a comparative newcomer, sometimes to stretch over decades. Even given that, it would be wrong to include this amendment in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="08011776000550">The issue, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has already said, is that we are expecting very soon a White Paper from the Government, after years of digestion of the issues. I hope that the noble Lord will tell us what &#147;the new year&#148; means in this context. Is it early spring, mid-spring or Cornish spring, which is earlier than spring everywhere else in the country? I hope that we will see the White Paper in March. I further hope&#151;I hope that the Minister, when he responds, will give us some indication&#151;that, when it comes, there will indeed be draft clauses for pre-legislative scrutiny. I hope that they will be submitted to a Joint Committee for that pre-legislative scrutiny. In this House, we all recognise that ignorance of the way in which the two Houses co-operate is manifest. It was certainly true when I was serving in the other place. Therefore, it would be really helpful if, when those draft clauses come forward, they are subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by both Houses.</p>

<a name="80117-0014.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="08011776000551">My noble friend Lord Steel thought that the fact that Ken Clarke, with whom I have worked on these issues, did not expect to see the full comprehensive reform in his lifetime was a good reason for making rapid progress in some directions. I would simply say that new Clause 1 is the wrong direction in which to make rapid progress. I hope that the Committee will endorse the general view expressed in Amendment No. 2, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Richard.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Steel, has put down an interesting Bill, to which noble Lords are entitled to table amendments. It is wrong for some noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Bledisloe, to try to close down discussion on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="08011776000553">We are dealing now with Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which are related to each other. In my rather curious position as a recycled Peer in this establishment&#151;recycled inasmuch as I am here by quasi-democratic situation, as an elected hereditary Peer&#151;I support the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. It is interesting that the new body should be called a senate, with senators; he is quite right, and I hope that that will happen in due course. He is also right to say that there should be a de-linking of the peerage and the legislature. I hope that these things will happen in the fullness of time.</p>

We wait with bated breath for these famous proposals to come forward. We are, inevitably, a revising Chamber, but we need to change. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, made that entirely clear. He is right to say that we should have democracy. If we believe in democracy in this House, or in this country, we should start to practise it. It is no good us going around the world pontificating about democracy if we do not practise it ourselves. The Bill and the whole reform of the House of Lords are predicated on that, which is why I support also the amendment very cogently argued by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, and I hope that the debate will continue properly in the order which has been taken. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is right: if the noble Lord, Lord Steel, decides to occupy Fridays on the issue, he is entitled to do so, and it would be a legitimate thing to do. If he does, I shall certainly come here to discuss with other noble Lords, because the future of the House is of great importance to the nation as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="08011776000559">The interesting contribution made by the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, adds yet another piece of timber to the increasingly complicated pile that is now before us. I think that we should go back to the approach made by the noble Lord, Lord Steel, fortified as it now is by his colleague the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. It has grieved me a great deal to see a great historic party&#151;the Liberal party&#151;diminished as it is, as divided as it has been on so many questions. But it seems to me that we now have the glimmering of an agreement, because they are both saying that propositions of the kind promoted by the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Richard, are running ahead of the game.</p>

<a name="80117-0015.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="08011776000560">We should address the real thing: the four propositions, as summarised in the Title, have an intrinsic merit of their own. They are almost all built on analyses put before the House in a series of reports. None of them can really be challenged on its merits. They are all improvements of an existing state of affairs. As the noble Lord, Lord Steel, has emphasised many times, it is a step forward and, to that extent, it may or may not be a transition. But at least, it is something that coherently and comprehensively propounds four changes that would help the House to gain in authority, to work better and to remove certain anomalies that should be removed. We should be delighted to commend the two young and sparkling members of the Liberal party, the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Steel. I am all for it. Three cheers for this astonishing alliance.</p>

<a name="80117-0015.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="08011776000562">I note that the noble Lord has said once again that this is a limited Bill and a sensible measure. While there are many things with which I agree, I remain somewhat suspicious of the description of it as a limited Bill. That is partly because of the distinguished career of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, himself. He has not really been well known for introducing small, insignificant Bills in his career. I feel that many people who support the Bill do so partly because they agree with it but also partly because they hope that it will kick into the long grass any other reform of the House of Lords, including electing it. For that reason, I remain somewhat suspicious of the Bill, despite the fact that I agree with many points in it.</p>

<a name="80117-0015.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="08011776000563">The noble Lord, Lord Steel, also pointed out that many of the amendments seemed to go wide of the Bill. In that sense, I agree with him. When the Bill was put forward, the matters that were concentrated on at Second Reading were more limited than many of the amendments before us today. None the less, the Title of the Bill is the &#147;House of Lords Bill&#148;, and, as has been pointed out by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, amendments would not have been accepted if they had not been valid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="08011776000564">Despite the important issues that many of the amendments raise&#151;they should be given an airing&#151;there are in the Bill many aspects that people would want to consider in a lot of detail. It is difficult, on the face of it, to understand the rationale behind many of the details, for example the proposal that at least four of the members of the Appointments Commission should be privy counsellors. I am not sure why that is. Those are the kinds of detailed issues in which people have a valid interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="08011776000565">The noble Lord appealed to us to be expeditious, and one of the good aspects of this House is that it does not go in for filibustering. Despite the public image at times of elderly Members of the House of Lords wittering on, in fact most Members of the House seem to speak with admirable succinctness. I hope that I shall be one of that number. Nevertheless, there are many details in the Bill that it would be wrong to gloss over in a too-hasty consideration. For that reason, although I understand the noble Lord&#146;s desire not to go too wide and deal with matters that are not the Bill&#146;s main focus, there is every reason to give the Bill proper, thorough scrutiny.</p>

I do not see how it is possible to proceed without that. As part of that, I also argue that the time has come to take the debate into a much more serious pre-legislative scrutiny than perhaps we have normally for legislation in both Houses of the UK Parliament.

By that I do not mean a No. 10 website into which people send e-mails. I mean proper electronic consultation and debate throughout the kingdom about the role of this House and then perhaps there can emerge a public consensus about what a 21<sup>st</sup> century second Chamber looks like in the context of the United Kingdom.

There is general consensus that the primacy of the Commons should remain and that the second Chamber, whether 80 per cent or 100 per cent elected, should be a revising Chamber.

If he had been in his place an hour and a half ago, he would have heard the speech that I made proposing my amendment in which I made the enormous mistake, as it turns out, of speaking to the amendment and not to the generality of the argument. This has been a fascinating debate on the general arguments, which we have been round and round and round, and we will go around them again in this Bill.</p>

If he produces a Bill that was bound to be controversial, and which he knew would be once it is in the public domain, any noble Lord would be entitled to table amendments to it and to have them discussed. If the amendments were not in order, I have no doubt that the excellent Clerks at the Table would not have allowed us to put them down. The noble Lord, Lord Steel, cannot now say, &#147;Oh gosh, isn&#146;t it terrible? You want to discuss things which I don&#146;t want to discuss. I merely want to discuss the things that I want to discuss&#148;. That is not on.</p>

It is a clear and simple proposal that there should be some input from the Secretary of State and the House of Commons before we move to a change to the name of this House. On any view of the matter, that is a sensible way to proceed. I have thought very hard about whether I should seek a vote on the amendment, and in the end I have decided not to. But I give warning to the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and the promoters of the Bill that I shall return to this subject at a future stage, if there ever is one.

There are some Members who desperately do not want me to speak and others who are desperately urging me to speak. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, understated the issue when he said that I had let a cat out of the bag. It would appear that I have let a whole herd of cats out of a whole lot of bags this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="08011776000630">The noble Lord, Lord Richard, chided me for not addressing the amendments, but I return to the point that I made at the beginning: the Bill is not a whim of mine. Various people have said that I want the House to debate the things that I want to debate. Not at all. The Bill, which has very narrow and specific purposes, is the result of work done by many Members of the House, of whom I am merely the spokesman. Way back in the first Second Reading that we had in July, people thought I was making a joke when I said that the reason I was the spokesman was that I missed the meeting at which that decision was taken. It was not a joke; it was absolutely true. I am simply the servant of a large group of Members who feel that there are four issues which do not brook further delay.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="08011776000631">In light of the trouble that we have had recently on cash for peerages&#151;a problem which has afflicted all three parties for a very long time and about which the public are extremely annoyed&#151;the first issue is whether we should deal with the creation of a statutory appointments commission. The Conservative reform task group has said yes, the Government have indicated that they are in favour of it, the Select Committee in the other House has now said it is in favour of it, and on that narrow point we have put this forward in the Bill to deal with the cash for peerages question.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="08011776000632">The second issue is the hereditary by-elections and I shall respond immediately to what the Minister asked me. I consider that the undertaking given about retaining the hereditary Peers is important, but I do not think it applies to the amendment. I think the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, was correct when he said that it did not apply to the issue of the by-elections. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, referred to the dignity of the House. I do not see how it impresses the public or increases the dignity of the House to have people coming into the House because they are hereditary Peers elected by two or three other people. That simply will not wash in this day and age.</p>

In 1999 an agreement was reached by the present noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury&#151;the then Viscount Cranborne&#151;and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg. The agreement was that there would be 92 hereditary Peers in the House until such time as stage two of the reform was complete. In order to ensure that 92 remains the correct number, there have to be by-elections for that purpose. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, has confirmed that the by-elections were part of the agreement.</p>

I am explaining why I invite the House to reject Amendment No. 1 and to reject all amendments which fall outside the narrow scope of the Bill. That is not to say the amendments are improper or in any way unconstitutional; of course they are not. They all have interesting topics and, as I have indicated to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, I am in favour of many of them. But they are not within the narrow confine of the Bill, and if the Bill is to have any chance of succeeding we have to restrict ourselves to the subjects of the Bill. If we go wider, frankly, the Bill is dead in the water. It will not go anywhere. We are not going to come here every Friday for the whole of this Session to discuss this issue to the exclusion of everything else; that is simply unrealistic. We have to decide this in facing this first amendment, which falls outside the narrow purposes of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="08011776000636">I was in the middle of describing what those narrow purposes are and reminding the House that the hereditary by-elections came into being as a result of an amendment&#151;the Weatherill amendment&#151;to the agreement that had been made. It was not part of the original agreement to retain the hereditary Members, and the by-election system has been crude and unacceptable. It has lasted much longer than was foreshadowed at the time.</p>

The question is whether we still believe that Members should enter this House by virtue of heredity. I do not believe that in this day and age public opinion believes that is right, and the other Chamber of Parliament certainly does not. It is an important issue.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="08011776000640">The third part of the Bill deals with the ability of Members to retire from the House permanently. It deals with both reducing the numbers of the House, which is desirable, and reducing our average age. The fourth and minor part, which no one has touched on today and is not all that important, is simply to bring this House into line with the other House in saying that those who transgress the law, to the extent of suffering a year in prison, should not be lawmakers.</p>

<a name="80117-0016.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="08011776000641">Those are four very specific, narrow, limited points, on which there could be many amendments.

The scope in this House is whether an issue is covered by the Long Title of the Bill. Anything that is within the terms of the Long Title is within the scope of the Bill. </p>

It is exactly the same in the House of Commons. &#147;For connected purposes&#148; covers everything. A herd of cats could run through this Chamber for the whole of this Session if noble Lords wanted, and there is nothing we could do to stop it. All I am saying is that the reality is that either we confine ourselves to the four purposes of the Bill or we do not, and if we do not the Bill is going nowhere. For that reason, I oppose the amendment.</p>

He has now said it again with great emphasis. I think he is wrong. As has been said by many people, if the Bill is put down then amendments can be put to it and they are perfectly justified. If you take the noble Lord&#146;s view, who is going to decide what is within the narrow confines and what is just outside them? I suppose it would be the noble Lord, Lord Steel&#151;but that is a very bad way of conducting a Committee stage.</p>

Those new matters are certainly connected to House of Lords reform in general, I do not dispute that, but the minute we go wider than these four points, the Bill cannot realistically proceed through to the other place. That is what I hope to achieve. If the House disagrees, we can go on discussing amendments about the number of Bishops, separating peerages from honours and so on for ever more.</p>

They are within the connected purposes, and the Clerks have allowed them to be tabled.

Nor is my amendment intended to undermine the aristocracy or do away with the time-honoured titles of the nobility; it is aimed simply at severing their link with the legislature, as the noble Earl said, in name as well as in function. It would also apply in the case of a wholly or partly elected Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="08011776000684">The amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Dubs might achieve a similar aim.

Some may say that once all vestiges of the hereditary principle in membership of your Lordships' House have gone, my purpose would be achieved, as the British political genius would enable any arrangements, no matter how contrarily named, to be pragmatically and effectively operated. But our constitutional arrangements are a part of our culture. They are for all our citizens to understand and value, and are of particular importance in the current climate of disaffection with politics. They are taught in schools. There is widespread confusion about what the House of Lords is all about, neatly encapsulated in the typical cartoon of the ermine-clad, coroneted old buffer, which is of course completely inaccurate.</p>

As noble Lords have said, it is a common name for a second Chamber in francophone countries and in the USA. But a change of this nature happens only once in a very long while, and we should apply ourselves to seeing whether there is not a feasible British term.

No doubt being eminent historians, they would tell us of the difficulties they had in the 1650s when the House of Lords had been abolished and his Highness Lord Protector Cromwell decided that the Commons needed a balancing Upper House to stop it running amok.

How large should this committee be and who would decide on behalf of each party group who should be the members? The noble Baroness suggests that the Lord Speaker should decide, but the Lord Speaker is not intimate in her knowledge of the Conservative or Liberal Democrat groups, or even the Cross Bench groups in this House. A Conservative or Liberal Speaker would have exactly the same difficulty with other groups in the House. Should the names come from leaders, chairmen or convenors of the groups, having consulted with their members as appropriate? In short, the amendment seems to set up an elaborate machinery involving people from outside Parliament over whom your Lordships&#146; House will have no control either as a House or through party groups to do relatively little.

We certainly do not have to follow anyone because, in any case, there are so many different versions. A senate gives the impression, which is important, that we are an integral part of the decision-making in Parliament. We will not be just a debating chamber at the other end of the building that occasionally becomes difficult and stroppy and has a different view. We will be an integral part of the legislature of this country. The word &#147;senate&#148; would give the Chamber that status.

I suggest that if we are going to have any change to the name of ourselves as individuals or to the name of the House, then senate would be the odds-on favourite, provided that the change of name occurs when there is a change in the composition of the House. If we do it without changing the structure of the House&#151;and this is not the amendment on which to debate that&#151;it will be silly.

The problem that we would have is twofold&#151;I shall be brief because those points have already been drawn out in debate. One is about composition. The other is about process; whether it is appropriate to be embodied in legislation. The point about composition has already been well rehearsed.

That allows flexibility to have discussions to meet the very points that have been raised. So I revert to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs: it has been very valuable rehearsing the case. I am quite sympathetic to the noble Baroness's point. There is a case for looking at the name. I am one of those who would be wary about calling it a senate, so I think that there is a case for having considered reflection on that, not rushing into it, which is why I was opposed to the earlier amendments, but I am sympathetic to the core of the point made by the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000008">The noble Baroness said: I will also speak to Amendment No. 72 with which Amendment 69 is grouped and which also stands in my name. Both amendments are about independent advocacy for looked-after children. Amendment No. 69 concerns advocacy when their care plan is being reviewed and Amendment No. 72 concerns advocacy when significant decisions are being made about the care plan.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011758000009">We have been briefed by Voice and the Children&#146;s Society on this issue. Both organisations are concerned at the fact that looked-after children and young people continue not to be heard when decisions are made about their care despite successive legislation and guidance requiring a whole range of professionals to ensure that this happens. Research studies provide evidence that in practice authorities are failing to meet their duties in this regard. While many more children in care are actively involved in reviews and planning meetings than used to be the case, some professionals continue to make assumptions that children will not want to, or would be unable to, participate in reviews and planning meetings.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011758000010">A 2006 CSCI report on children&#146;s views found that many continue to be intimidated by the number of adults in meetings, find the language used difficult to understand and are not confident enough, or are not given enough time, to get their views across.

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011758000011">In a paper by Boylan and Braye, one young man is quoted as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011758000157">&#147;You ain&#146;t got a say in what&#146;s going off&#151;everybody&#146;s talking about you and not to you&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000142">In stark contrast, Chase noted in a 2006 paper the following view from a young person who had an advocate from the organisation Voice. The young person said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011758000158">&#147;Before I had an advocate social services and I were talking at cross purposes and I wasn&#146;t getting proper help ... the advocate improved the communication between all of us ... she gave me some power back&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000143">Isn&#146;t that significant&#151;she gave me some power back? He continued that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011758000185">&#147;all the others, teachers, social workers etc were talking amongst themselves but no one was talking to me, they were not involving me or explaining anything to me&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000144">By supporting children in reviews and planning meetings, professional independent advocacy empowers them to have their views taken seriously, as required in law. A professional independent advocate makes sure that children understand what is happening to them, helps them to navigate the system and supports them in understanding their rights.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08011758000012">The need for high-quality, professional independent advocacy will be further heightened by the commitment in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, taken forward in Clause 8 of this Bill, to strengthen the statutory framework so that a local authority cannot place a child out of authority unless it is satisfied that such a placement is in the child&#146;s best interests. We have had numerous debates on that issue. Although we are wholly supportive of this measure, with the caveats about children&#146;s welfare, it will inevitably result in a significant number of placement changes, especially for those already placed out of authority. It must be recognised  that looked-after children, particularly those with communication impairments, about whom we talked yesterday evening, are particularly vulnerable during times of change.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08011758000013">The existing statutory right in relation to complaints has had only a limited impact. That is in part because the number of looked-after children making complaints remains low. Many children simply do not understand that they have a right to complain and do not know that they have a right to an advocate to support them through the process. Anyway, children and young people do not want to have to resort to a complaints procedure before they can get the support that they need to get their views over. They would rather have support at an early stage and therefore avoid the problem escalating and avoid having to come into confrontation with the people who care for them day to day. I believe that better outcomes and potentially long-term cost savings can be achieved if independent advocates are involved and support children to be involved far earlier in the decision-making process.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08011758000014">As I mentioned yesterday when we were talking about another amendment, a survey of advocacy services across England carried out by the Children&#146;s Society in 2006 found that a quarter of advocacy providers reported that they had not been able to respond to a referral from a disabled child at all. It is quite clear that the most vulnerable children are not getting the advocacy that they need and they are the ones who need it most. I hope that the Minister will look kindly on these amendments and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000015"><b><a name="80117-gc0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="08011758000197">Lord Judd:</b> The amendment makes an important point and I look forward to hearing what my noble friend the Minister has to say in response. During the years when I was privileged to be director of Oxfam, one thing that I learnt, among many others, about assistance to those who are vulnerable and in need is that one of most important contributions that can be made is advocacy. It is essential to be able to see things from the standpoint of the person who is being helped. Again&#151;I do not apologise for repeating the point&#151;no one questions the good will and commitment of so many of those who are trying to help and who give their lives to such work, but it is essential to ensure that central to considerations is what the children themselves believe. Some of the most vulnerable and disturbed children have difficulty in putting forward their own position. In recent work that I have done on immigration and asylum, I have sometimes blanched at the predicament that the youngster faced with the array of complicated administration and law. The amendment raises an important point and I hope that my noble friend will be able to say something reassuring.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000016"><b><a name="80117-gc0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08011758000198">Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> We have great sympathy with these amendments and are most grateful to the Children&#146;s Society and Voice for their time and patient explanations. We recognise the concern of children and young people that they fail to be heard when major decisions affecting their care are discussed. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, this leads to the wrong presumptions being made and to young people being intimidated. The idea of having an independent advocate to support a child&#146;s individual case in the review of their care plan is certainly sound. The Children&#146;s Society has worked out that this will cost in the region of &#163;3 million. As it would, for us, be an uncosted spending commitment, we are unable to support the amendment. The Children&#146;s Society and Voice understand our position. I hope that we will be able to look at this as part of our future policy work, but in the mean time I hope that the Minister will look favourably on what is an important amendment.</p>

I thank Her Majesty&#146;s Government for introducing the right to advocacy for children making complaints and for introducing advocates for children in the secure estate.

I have heard from some of them at Voice conferences&#151;I should say that I am a patron of Voice.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011758000018">I need hardly add anything to what noble Lords have so eloquently said on this matter. This is an important set of amendments. As vice-chair of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Children and Young People in and Leaving Care, I hear each month from children in care how their wishes and rights are ignored. I am frequently reminded that care plans can be ignored. The Committee may wish to hear Mr Justice Munby&#146;s observations in the journal <I>Family Law </I>in<I></I>2004. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011758000159">&#147;The simple fact is that there are real problems affecting too many of the children in our care system. Too often their substantive rights under Article 8 are not respected as they should be. And too often these problems arise and continue because the children affected do not have the support and representation they should have and which, it might be thought, Article 8 entitles them to have&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000145">Article 8 imposes procedural safeguards. He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011758000160">&#147;And the burden may extend in some instances to an obligation not merely to permit representation but even to ensure that parents&#151;and particularly children&#151;are properly represented when decisions fundamental to the children&#146;s welfare are being taken&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000146">So there is a strong legal argument for the extension of the duties described here.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011758000019">I shall hear and respect what I expect the Minister to say&#151;he has said it before&#151;about the importance of the independent reviewing officers, the independent visitors and the children&#146;s councils in developing the voice of the child. Sadly, the situation is that, as we have heard time and again in Committee and as I know from listening to children, children require a strong, independent advocate whose focus is not on resources or local authority rules, who is a professional operating in a professional framework and who can take up the child&#146;s concerns at the earliest stage possible. Neither a local authority social worker, nor an independent visitor, nor an independent reviewing officer can be enough.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011758000020">I shall give a brief illustration of a recent case involving five children&#151;three siblings and two siblings. They had come into care for some of the most serious reasons possible and life had become better for them. According to their reviews, they had lived happily for the previous five years in a large house near the sea, far away from the inner London borough that was their corporate parent. They all thought that they would live there until they were 18. Things changed one Monday afternoon. One of the boys, aged 12, rang Voice at 4 pm to say that their social worker had just visited and told them that they were all being moved the next day at 10 am to three separate homes. The foster carers had been informed two weeks previously that the children were being moved. This was not because of the quality of the childcare, parenting practice or, importantly, child protection, but because the foster carers were not   


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC579"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column GC579</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>co-operating with the borough. They were told, &#147;Don&#146;t tell the children; it will upset them&#148;. A complaint was sent and I shall not go into further details.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011758000021">The matter went to court and the judge found that the decision to remove the children from the care of the foster carers was procedurally unfair and perverse, because there was no consultation, no consideration of the harmful effect of removal from the placement and failure to consider or evaluate the children&#146;s security in the placement and the progress that they had made. The judge found in the children&#146;s favour, but the damage had to a large extent been done; the foster siblings now have no contact and believe that they are not together because of something that they have done. So it is important that we ensure that there is an independent advocate at earlier stages to ensure that children&#146;s views are heard. If that were to happen, such cases would be unlikely to occur.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011758000022">Amendment No. 95A, standing in my name, would place a duty on children&#146;s homes and foster care agencies to provide access to advocacy. Sir William Utting concluded in his report <I>People Like Us</I> in 1997 that looked-after children need independent advocacy as a source of protection and as a means of making their voices heard within an otherwise closed system. An advocate can develop a relationship with a young person over time and engender the trust and safety needed for them to raise child protection issues and any other issues of concern to them in placement or elsewhere. The advocate will be able to offer support to the child, take up issues on their behalf as they arise and support them through the protection procedures or any other procedures that may be necessary.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08011758000023">My amendment would ensure that children had access to an independent advocate wherever they were placed&#151;in a foster agency or in residential care. It would ensure that children could be supported in raising safeguarding issues and other issues of concern by an advocate who was independent of the care authority and the placement provider. I hope that the Minister can accept this amendment but, before I conclude, perhaps I may briefly reinforce what I expect will be said later about the need for children with disabilities in long-term residential care to have access to ongoing advocacy.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08011758000024">I am grateful to the Children&#146;s Society for reminding me that there are more than 13,000 children with disabilities living away from home in England. New research from the Children&#146;s Society found that, despite government guidance, a quarter of advocacy providers were not able to respond to referral from a disabled child at all. The most vulnerable children were the most excluded: two-fifths of providers said that they could not provide advocacy for children who did not communicate verbally. I hope that the Minister can say that he will introduce a duty on providers to ensure that appropriate advocates are visiting children with disabilities in long-term residential care. I look forward to his response.</p>

The association has for five or more years been providing lay advocates for children and young people in custody in the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. That has proved beneficial and I am sure that the association would be willing to share its experience with those extending the advocacy principle to children and young people in England.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08011758000026">On the merits of the amendments, there is an urgent need for inarticulate children and young people to be represented. I would like to see the system starting off with those in custody of whatever kind, then going on to the 13,000 handicapped children just mentioned by my noble friend Lord Listowel, some of whom clearly have the greatest difficulty in making their views known or putting forward any kind of complaint. Finally, the new system might be extended to those who are in the generality of the care population.</p>

My noble friend Lord Listowel mentioned disabled children. I particularly mention learning-disabled children, because they often have a great deal of difficulty communicating and find it hard to express their wishes and preferences. In my opinion&#151;and, I am sure, that of many Members of the Committee&#151;independent advocacy is crucial to ensure that the child&#146;s views are taken into account.</p>

One measure of how a custodial institution is working is the level of complaints. Frequently one would find that there were virtually no complaints in young offender institutions. People would say that the young people did not want to complain: absolute nonsense! When I found an establishment that was employing advocates, I saw that the complaints suddenly went up, along with a general understanding of what was happening. People were enabled to complain. The Committee must consider not just those with learning difficulties, but those who cannot communicate anyway. It is desperately important that advocacy is provided. Resources will be cited again, but this is a resource that must not be cut.</p>

Yesterday, I was accused of not looking back far enough, but I well remember all these issues being talked about in the 1970s&#151;the lack of communication, the need for independent advocacy and so on. It is extraordinary that we have been arguing about this sort of thing ever since.</p>

Last night, the Minister looked rather surprised at this and suggested that communication is getting much better. I hope that it is; I hope that the fact that our figures are a little out of time means that some of these things are already happening. However, I join my noble friend Lord Listowel in saying how important this whole area is if we are to move this thing on at all. I certainly agree that advocacy is crucial, as is specialist advocacy where there are special needs. Special needs include those who cannot communicate or have not learnt to communicate and merely listen to what is said to them, and sometimes not even to that.</p>

The examples of poor practice mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, are clearly of concern. We believe that the key issue is to improve the professional practice of social workers involved in the day-to-day conduct of children&#146;s cases and of the independent reviewing officers who will be responsible for monitoring the case as a whole and overseeing the regular reviews of the care plan, taking full account and expressing the views of the child in care.</p>

We are providing that duty for precisely the reasons set out by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. The Bill extends the responsibilities of IROs to monitor the performance of the local authority&#146;s functions in relation to a child&#146;s case, ensuring that they effectively oversee the care planning process so that it is fair and reasonable and gives proper weight to the child&#146;s wishes and feelings.

That is why, for example, we have been funding Voice, the organisation mentioned by the noble Baroness and the noble Earl, for the past three years, to extend access to its advocacy service for disabled children and other vulnerable looked-after children. I pay tribute to the work of Voice. Statutory guidance also makes it clear that we expect children to have access to advocates beyond the complaints procedure; for example, a child should be able to secure the support of an advocate in putting forward representations concerning any changes that may be required to the services that they receive.</p>

I am glad to be able to tell the noble Earl that the children in the categories covered by his amendment&#151;namely, those receiving services from children&#146;s homes and fostering services&#151;will be looked-after children and will therefore benefit from the statutory framework that I have set out. We accept that practice in this area needs to improve. Elements of the Bill will ensure that that happens. We also support other improvements in professional practice that will meet the objectives set out in the debate.</p>

When we started considering this Bill in Grand Committee, I said that our amendments fall into two categories: those that are probing and those that are Oliver Twist. This is an Oliver Twist amendment. We appreciate the rights that children already have for advocacy, but research makes it clear that there is further need. I do not think that  &#163;3 million is a lot of money; indeed, I happen to believe that this measure would be cost-neutral because of the improvement and greater stability that would arise from the child having a good voice. That is what the advocate is: someone to help the child with its own voice.</p>

When she got a complaint, she always dealt with it so generously that the complainant became a devoted customer of that hotel chain for the rest of his life. If you make advocates more generally available and easily accessible to children, you will get more complaints.

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011758000045">I ask noble Lords to imagine three scenarios. The first is that you, as an adult, sit in a room at a desk opposite someone who has a file, in which they have information that you do not know. That information is your identity and they will not let you see it because they cannot, or they think that they cannot. The second scenario is that you, as an adult, have written to the authority that cared for you when you were a child and you receive in your post one day a letter that tells you something that you have never known before&#151;the name of your mother. The letter says that it can tell you that because she is dead. The third scenario is that you go as an adult to see the voluntary organisation that looked after you when you were a child. You sit down with the people there and talk to them about the fact that you need to piece together various bits of information in order to understand your identity and what happened to you as a child. They say, &#147;I understand that. This is a very difficult issue for you. Here is someone who helps lots of people who are in your situation, and we will sit with you while you read through this file. We will talk to you now, and we will remain in contact with you in the future. You can talk to us at any time about how you feel about what you have learnt&#148;. I did not invent any of those scenarios; they have all happened to people. That is why this amendment stands as it does. </p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011758000046">Requests from adults who were in care for information about records of their childhood are retained by local authorities and governed by the Data Protection Act. That Act is rather clumsy and difficult; it is frequently interpreted in vastly different ways, some of which I have just outlined, by different authorities. It presents particular difficulties for people who were in care, because it draws a distinction between what is regarded as personal information&#151;data that relate directly to that person&#151;and what it calls third-party information. Crucially for former care adults, third-party information is frequently deemed to include the names of the other people in their family&#151;their parents and their siblings. That means that when former care adults apply to find out information about themselves, they can be given the barest information: You entered care on this date. You left care on the following date&#148;. Crucially what it does not tell them, apart from their identity, is their family history&#151;key things that people want to know, such as who they are, what their identity is and, principally, why they ended up in care and why this happened to them. There may be very good reasons why it happened, but the adult is not always allowed to know.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000047">A survey was carried out in 2005 by Professor Jim Goddard and Julia Feast, who works for BAAF. Their report, <I>A Childhood on Paper: Accessing the Child-care Files of Former Looked After Children in the UK</I>, shows the problems with the Data Protection Act and its different interpretations, which make it difficult for professionals to know what they are and are not allowed to say and for the former care adults themselves to get information that the rest of us would take for granted. For other people who have been in different types of care, legislation has long recognised this problem. People who are adopted can now find that personal information, as can people who are in permanent fostering arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000048">There is case law on this matter. A primary example is the Gaskin case, which went to the European Court of Human Rights. If anyone wishes to understand quite how gruesome the implementation of current policy can be, I recommend that they read the dreadful case of Graham Gaskin. That is the legislation to which the Government currently cling. I am glad to say that many of the charities now do not. Many of the charities that were the big providers of care have long since realised that they have an ongoing duty to the people for whom they cared often a very long time ago. They have a policy of giving people whole, open access, with support, to their care records. The problem is principally with local authorities.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08011758000049">This is a subject that the Minister and I have discussed several times. We often come back to the fact that many of these records no longer exist. Local authorities&#146; children&#146;s homes have been reorganised many times in the period to which we are referring. Records disappear. They get chucked out in filing cabinets. This amendment is not an attempt to conjure up information that no longer exists, but it asks for a standard of service to be provided by authorities, even in cases where information does not exist, whereby people who seek information are treated properly and with respect. People can come to terms with the fact that their records no longer exist, but they do so better if somebody sits them down and tries to explain to them how that came to be, rather than if they simply receive a letter to that effect in the post.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011758000050">This amendment would not require more resources, which is crucial in view of some of the discussions that we have had. It would not require authorities to hire anybody else or to set up any expensive new system. It would simply require them to have a policy of openness; it would place a duty on them not only to maintain their records but to make those records open to those who wish to inspect them. It would also bring all bodies up to the level of the best because it would allow voluntary organisations and statutory authorities to transfer information. Former care adults will often find that they were in care in different places at different times and a frequent stumbling block is that one organisation will tell them what happened to them and another will not or cannot.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011758000051">The amendment would give people the right to have information relating to them and to their family history.

That is a form of protection that authorities need to have because some of the people whom we are talking about go on to lead very disturbed and chaotic lives. Revealing some of that information to them might lead them to seek some kind of vengeance. In that case, there is a power of discretion. The amendment does not specify how, but it would require authorities to carry out this service in a sensitive and meaningful way. It is not appropriate to give people letters containing the most important personal information. I hope that the

I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000052"><b><a name="80117-gc0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="08011758000209">Lord Hylton:</b> In his reply, will the Minister say whether some of this information could be made available under the Freedom of Information Act? That may be a theoretical possibility, but it would not surprise me if it is not known to the people who could benefit from it. On those grounds, it is probably wise and desirable to incorporate something of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000053"><b><a name="80117-gc0002.htm_spnew4"><a name="08011758000210">Lord Adonis:</b> I fear that my response to the noble Baroness will be the same as the one that I gave the last time we debated the issue. The Government&#146;s position has not changed. We believe that the appropriate statutory framework already exists to ensure that adults who were looked after can access their case records. First, there is already an obligation to keep records. Regulation 8 of the Arrangements for Placement of Children (General) Regulations 1991 already requires local authorities and voluntary organisations to open a case record for each child whom they place. Details of what must be kept are set out in Regulation 8(2) and amplified in guidance. Local authorities are already required to retain records for 75 years after the date of birth, or for 15 years after death if the child dies before the age of 18. </p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011758000054">Secondly, there is, as the noble Baroness said, existing entitlement under the Data Protection Act for adults who were in care to have access to the personal data in their records. As she said, information relating to other persons must be handled in accordance with the principles of the Data Protection Act, and there is room for the exercise of discretion by the local authority to disclose information relevant to the individual&#146;s understanding of the issues that they face because of their experience of being looked after. There is also provision for individuals to apply to the Information Commissioner if they are unhappy with the local authority&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011758000055">There will, of course, be individual cases of adults who are trying to piece together information about their time in the care system several decades ago and who cannot do so because the records are incomplete. Sadly, no new legislative provision can address that. I say this with some feeling as a former child in care whose entire records over 13 years in care were destroyed when I sought to gain access to them. I am not one of the very old category of people in care whom the noble Baroness mentioned, but, alas, that is the past. I am glad to be told, however, that record keeping is now more consistent and the guidance clearer than it was in previous decades, as the Children Act 1989 set a better framework than existed previously.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011758000056">The integrated children&#146;s system to which I referred yesterday and the detailed resources that have been produced to support it aim to improve record keeping still further. The ICS covers all children who are looked after, including those who are placed for adoption. I know that my response will not satisfy the noble Baroness, but I hope that it at least testifies to improved practice in this area.</p>

The noble Baroness is absolutely right about the difficult and often traumatic experiences of former looked-after children as they seek access to records that are or are not available; she is right that they should be given proper personal support. That is covered by guidance. It is, as I found myself, the practice of good local authorities and it should become universal practice.</p>

One reason why I keep returning to this matter again and again is to make the point that the guidance and the existing statutory framework are not working. There is a huge variation between departments. The Minister talked about the use of discretion around personal data. What scope do local authorities have to exercise discretion? What can they say and what can they not say? It clearly varies from authority to authority. The Minister said that there is guidance, but there is huge variation: people in one local authority are invited in and given sessions with trained social workers who talk them through the difficulties and the fact that their records have disappeared, whereas people in the neighbouring authority get a letter. Clearly the guidance is not working. I do not imagine that the Minister will change his mind, but I wonder whether he will accept that there is a need to review the way in which the current guidance is being implemented to see whether it can be improved.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000065">The noble Baroness said: I will also speak to Amendment No. 101, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley. The purpose of the amendments is to enable children in care to appeal in their own right, first, in Amendment No. 73, to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal and, secondly, in Amendment No. 101, against a placement move.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08011758000066">On Amendment No. 73, the Bill does not address the issue facing those looked-after children with special educational needs who wish to appeal to the special educational needs tribunal, SENDIST. Currently, children in care do not have anyone who is sufficiently independent from the local authority in a position to act for them in tribunals. Therefore, they are being denied access to appeals. This is a significant issue for looked-after children, because almost a third&#151;28 per cent&#151;have a statement of special educational needs, compared with just 3 per cent of children generally. Looked-after children with special educational needs are even more vulnerable and have considerably poorer educational outcomes than other children with special educational needs. There is all the more reason, therefore, for them to have a proper assessment of their needs.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08011758000067">Yet the evidence shows that local authorities often fail children with special educational needs in a number of ways. They refuse to make statements or make inaccurate statements with vague or misleading information about provisions that they are legally obliged to provide. They also make bad school placement decisions. Without adequate recourse to SENDIST, those problems are compounded. As things stand, however, looked-after children have no proper recourse to SENDIST. The Government recognise that the situation needs to be addressed. In the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, they promised to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011758000186">&#147;issue strengthened guidance to carers and those with parental responsibility setting out how they can support children in care with SEN, including their right to appeal. Where carers experience difficulty supporting a child or young person&#146;s appeal we will ensure that Independent Reviewing Officers (IROs) advise those who appeal to SENDIST on behalf of the children in care&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80117-gc0002.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08011758000068">While those measures represent a step forward, they are not an effective solution to the problem. The proposal for revised guidance seems to imply that it is required only for foster carers and does not address the needs of children placed in residential care. There is a real problem here. To challenge decisions by a local authority, the authority itself would need to go to the tribunal and, depending on the complexities of the case, invest in alternative professional opinions or reports to challenge decisions that it had already made. Again, the reference in the White Paper to independent reviewing officers advising carers is a helpful start to increasing the viability of tribunal appeals in relation to children in care, but alone it would not make more funding available or compel an appeal to be brought.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000069">Clause 17 introduces a statutory requirement for a designated member of staff for children in care. This is a welcome step, which will, I hope, lead to earlier and quicker identification of children in care with special educational needs and to better record keeping and evidence gathering in relation to statementing. However, such individuals would not have rights to appeal under the current system. If they considered that a child needed a statement or that the contents of a statement needed to be appealed, they would need to refer the matter back to the social services department. In addition, such teachers will be employed by local authorities and will still lack the level of independence that would ensure that appeals were brought where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000070">We move the amendment on behalf of the Children&#146;s Society. It believes that looked-after children with special educational needs in residential care should be granted an entitlement to appear in their own right, as is the case in Scotland for young people aged 16 and 17. In addition, it believes  that those children should be granted a statutory  right to independent advocacy to support them in doing so.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000071">Amendment No. 101 also relates to the child being able to appeal in its own right. The purpose is to enable application to the court for Section 8 orders in relation to children in care. One of the most frequent issues brought by children and young people to independent advocacy services relates to their being moved from placement to placement when that is not in their care plan and is against their wishes. Clause 10 provides the need for review before children are moved to alternative accommodations, but we do not believe that that offers strong enough protection. We would like to see a new legal provision that permits children with sufficient understanding, and others, to apply to the courts to prevent a placement move. We believe that that could be done through an amendment to Section 8 of the Children Act 1989, allowing children to seek leave to the court to apply for a Section 8 order. There are four types of order: a contact order, a prohibited steps order, a residence order and a specific issue order. It has always been an anomaly that these orders cannot be made in respect of one of the most vulnerable groups of children in society&#151;looked-after children. The amendment would extend that right to those children.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000072">The amendments are wholly consistent with what children and young people have been saying to the Children&#146;s Rights Director for England and they very much reflect the advice that Dr Roger Morgan has been giving on these matters. I beg to move.</p>

I believe that the latter situation is why so many of these children and young people go on to difficult futures and too often end up

<p><a name="08011758000075">The noble Baroness is concerned that children in care may have less effective access to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal because, as she said, their social workers, as employees of local authorities, might be unlikely to appeal against their own authorities on behalf of such children. Let me say clearly that, if this were the case and appeals were not being made to the tribunal on behalf of these children when they should be, that situation would be unsatisfactory and would need to be addressed. We know that some cases are appealed by local authorities on behalf of children whom they look after. The issue is whether this is not done in other cases where it should be to best serve the interests of the looked-after child.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011758000076">In October, when the former Education and Skills Select Committee of another place published its report on special educational needs assessment and funding, I announced that we would be conducting research into parents&#146; experience of the SEN assessment, statementing and tribunal system. We will ask researchers to look at the position of those caring for looked-after children with SEN, including local authority social workers, and whether they are reluctant to appeal to the tribunal and, if so, why that might be. In the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, we announced that we had asked Ofsted to report on the progress of children in care with SEN in 2009-10 and that we would consider whether the arrangements for appeal to the tribunal on behalf of children in care should be reviewed. On the basis of these two reviews, we will wish to consider the case for extending the right of appeal in the way that the noble Baroness suggests, but we believe it right to wait for this further information and advice before we take a step with such radical implications as that set out by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011758000079">Our view is not the same in that respect. Section 8 orders, other than residence orders, do not apply in respect of those children who are in the care of the local authority under a care order. There are good reasons for that. For such children, parental responsibility has been conferred on the local authority through the making of the care order. The making of arrangements for contact and for placement of a child who is in care is part of the local authority&#146;s statutory duties in respect of that child. Once the family courts have made an order to place the child in the local authority&#146;s care, it is right that the local authority has the ongoing statutory responsibility to plan for that child&#146;s care.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011758000080">The Children Act 1989 is predicated on the basis that the courts are to decide whether the grounds for making a care order are met. If so, beyond the making of the order, it is for the local authority, rather than the courts, to exercise responsibility for the supervision of the care order. The role of the independent reviewing officer is important here in monitoring the local authority&#146;s implementation of the care plan.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011758000081">Other important safeguards are already built into the system to meet the objectives set out by the noble Baroness, particularly the duty to allow reasonable contact with parents and others and the requirement to take account of the child&#146;s wishes and feelings and those of his parents in taking decisions about placements and contact. A child who is the subject of a care order is, of course, also entitled to apply for a care order to be discharged and for a contact order under Section 34 of the Children Act 1989, and the IRO has an explicit duty, set out in regulations, to help the child to obtain legal advice to do so. Recourse to the full range of Section 8 orders is therefore not necessary. We do not go so far as the noble Baroness on this issue but we believe that there are already sufficient safeguards in the system.</p>

The amendments are all about the designated person in the school to be responsible for the welfare of looked-after children. First, may I say how much we welcome the fact that the Government have now agreed to put that on a statutory footing? However, what concerns us is dealt with first by Amendments Nos. 74 and 76, which should be seen as linked and which seek to remove from Clause 17(1) the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08011758000187">&#147;designate a member of the staff at the school&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000147">and to insert different words so that the clause would read that the governing body of a maintained school must,</p>
<ul><a name="08011758000188">&#147;ensure that a member of the staff at the school is designated&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000148">We think that it is for the head teacher to make such staffing decisions. The head teacher knows what is required, knows the people available to do the job, knows their qualifications and their characteristics, and should be the one to carry out the task, overseen, as are all other major decisions in the school, by the governors. That is why we tabled Amendment No. 76, which would designate a governor to carry out that role.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011758000087">Amendment No. 75 is a probing amendment, not an Oliver Twist amendment this time. We wonder what sort of person the Government have in mind when setting up this statutory duty to have a designated person. The amendment says that it should be a teacher, but we are not necessarily totally wedded to that. It is important that the person should have the appropriate status in the school and the appropriate power to bring about change, if that is what the looked-after children attending the school need. The qualified teachers on the staff tend to have that status and power.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011758000088">The other issue is training. The designated person must have the appropriate training to be able to understand the needs of a looked-after child. Subsection (2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011758000180">&#147;The governing body must ensure that the designated person undertakes appropriate training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000149">Given that 28 per cent of looked-after children have a statement of special educational needs compared with 3 per cent of children generally, will it be insisted on in regulations that that training must include training in special educational needs? That is most important, whether or not the person is a qualified teacher, particularly given that even qualified teachers, unless they are specialists in this area, have relatively little training in special educational needs during their initial teacher training qualification course. Many of them fortunately continue their professional development by learning about SEN. Given that every teacher is a teacher of special needs, every teacher should do that. It is, however, particularly important that this designated person, whether or not they are a teacher, has that sort of training. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that subsection (2) includes that.</p>

Let me make one observation in Grand Committee that I made on Second Reading. While it is obviously essential to have someone who has the ultimate specific responsibility of ensuring that things are happening, that should not become a substitute for the culture in a school. It seems to me that there is a cultural issue here that affects all staff. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that in teacher training, in-service training and the rest there is constant emphasis on the special responsibilities and needs in this area. Sometimes in society we like to have someone to blame when things go wrong and to say that they were specifically responsible when something did not happen. That person is never going to be able to achieve all that should be achieved creatively and imaginatively unless they are working with a well informed and committed bunch of colleagues.</p>

An essential element of improving the quality of care for looked-after children is improving their education, so we support the proposal that someone with the appropriate status should be designated to be responsible for looked-after children to ensure that they are given any extra support that is needed at school. We want to make certain that looked-after children are given the same chances at succeeding as their peers, and this requires some extra help. Even knowing that there is someone there could be an important resource. Given that the key to this is bettering the children&#146;s educational prospects, perhaps the person best designated to do this would be a teacher, as they need to be able to assist looked-after children in their educational plans and they should be properly trained. For a similar reason, we support the further amendment that a member of the governing body be designated to monitor the scheme. That adds a useful area of oversight, which will secure high standards of care and support and ensure that a designated teacher for looked-after children does not get ignored by a school&#146;s administration.</p>

This gives me the opportunity to ask the Minister a question. If he does not have the answer now, perhaps he could write to me. Given, for all the reasons that we have heard about, how important it is to get the earliest possible help to children who are in need of one sort or another&#151;certainly those who go into care&#151;does the basic teacher training course pay enough attention to this area? In other words, does it give teachers enough training to be able to help to diagnose such things at a very early age&#151;not necessarily diagnose them themselves&#151;and pick up signs that they can then refer to a specialist? I would be particularly grateful if we could look at that. Otherwise, I intend to table an amendment on Report.</p>

The points that have been made by all noble Lords who have spoken are crucial. The culture of the school certainly needs to take account of all the areas that we have been discussing, and the members of the governing body perhaps need to have extra support. The idea might well be tried out in the pilot schemes of the social work practices, if it is not happening already, because there, within an area, there would be the sort of resource that we are looking for, so a governor from the school could have that sort of contact with specialists in these areas. This comes back to the point that, after prevention and early diagnosis, resources are crucial. What we are asking schools to do is so important that we must also ask the Minister&#151;I know how committed he is to all these areas&#151;for extra resources to see that this is not just another thing that has to be met out of whatever resources the school has.</p>

She asked whether the designated person with responsibility for promoting the educational achievements of looked-after children would be a teacher. It is our firm intention that that person should be a teacher. We intend to achieve that by regulations under Clause 17(3). She also asked whether the training would be for real. Clause 17(2) introduces a strong legal requirement that the governing body,</p>
<ul><a name="08011758000189">&#147;must ensure that the designated person undertakes appropriate training&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011758000150">That is as strong as it gets in terms of new legislative requirements. I can assure the noble Baroness that this will be underpinned by guidance to spell out what it should mean in practice. For example, we will look at whether there should be accredited national training, which is what we have done in the case of special educational needs co-ordinators where we are improving the national training requirements following the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000098">The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked whether we could improve initial teacher training in this regard.

The purpose of this amendment is to enable young people to stay with their foster carers between the ages of 18 and 21. The <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper indicated a desire to enable young people between the ages of 18 and 21 to stay with their former foster parents; it said that pilots of such schemes would be run in 2008. We believe that the provision of stable placements for young people making the transition into adult life&#151;both those going into further or higher education and those needing more intensive support&#151;could make a massive difference to their life chances. Indeed, we had a lengthy debate on these issues yesterday. Many young people in care will have experienced significant disruption to their lives and they are likely to need additional help and support to enable them to succeed educationally and to make a successful transition to adult life. Despite this, children in care are often required to leave their foster carers before they are 18. Children in care, despite their vulnerability, are leaving care at a younger age than most other young people have to leave their families, which they do on average at about the age of 24.</p>

However, many local authorities do not provide even this option. We believe that every local authority should enable the provision of placements for young people between 18 and 21. We welcome the pilots, but we believe that it will be necessary to introduce regulations informed by them to resolve several issues and to avoid the myriad interpretations of the scheme across local authorities that may prevent foster carers from being able to provide these placements to young people desperately in need of support.</p>

Will former foster carers retain their status as foster carers if they are not also fostering others aged under 18? If so, does this mean that they will not have an annual review?

This is especially important during the stage at which a child is making the transition into adult life. Whether for a child going on to higher education or for a child who still needs intensive care, support during the transitional phase can make an enormous difference. There are some supported lodging arrangements that occasionally enable foster carers to provide a placement for a foster child post-18, but these are unregulated. More important, there is no guarantee of support for the foster carer of the young person.</p>

That means that they would be entitled to the training and benefits that come with the status of a foster carer. It would not necessarily mean that they would continue to receive the financial benefits that a particular placement entitled them to&#151;although that would be ideal in a world of infinite resources&#151;but it would allow them to access the more general benefits that come with the status of a foster carer, such as training, support from the local authority or social worker, an annual review and an easier way to continue their legal insurance.

I have only one small addition to make. It sometimes seems that we address these issues in a terribly clinical way. I want to mention the reality, which is that a genuine affection often develops between a fostered child and the foster parent. That is hugely important to a child who has perhaps grown up in his early youth in unstable situations. This is an argument for ensuring that the foster carer can be put in a position to afford to give some continuing care to the child.</p>

The Government are hugely to be congratulated on wanting to assist children in care through university in their post-care phase. However, to enable them to go back to their foster parents and be part of the foster family, in a similar situation to that of other children with their own parents, would be an added asset to that which the Government are already providing. I hope that they think that this is a good idea; I very much support it.</p>

It is therefore not surprising that care leavers are overrepresented in some of the most vulnerable adult groups, including young parents, prisoners and the homeless. Precisely to tackle this issue, we intend to run the pilots described by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, which will support arrangements to allow young people to remain with their former foster carers when they are no longer in care. Such arrangements will, in certain circumstances, include support from the local authority in the form of payments to the foster carer. These young people will be able to stay with their carers until they are 21. The intention is to create an environment where young people can move on at a time of their choosing with the right support, in precisely the way described by the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="08011758000125">The noble Earl asked about funding for the pilots. We are providing &#163;1.5 million each year for three years to support them. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was particularly concerned about the legal basis for and regulation of the pilots. Carers of 18 to 21 year-olds are not foster carers and are therefore not legally treated as such. We will consider whether and how these carers should be regulated, which will of course be an important issue. It could be achieved through the powers in the Care Standards Act 2000. Extensive amendments are planned to the 2000 Act in the Health and Social Care Bill, which was introduced in another place on 15 November. That Bill would permit registration of carers of 18 to 21 year-olds, or any other particular group of adults, and regulation of their activities by the new Care Quality Commission. There is therefore no need for any additional powers to regulate that type of care.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011758000126">As for wider changes concerning the rollout of foster care practice beyond the age of 18, it would be premature to legislate around foster carer status further at this stage.

I apologise for this, but I am not clear whether the Minister said that he would write to me about that report&#146;s figure of an additional &#163;740 million needed each year to ensure a proper range of foster placements.

<p><a name="08011763000004">Currently, disabled children in 52-week residential school placements do not have the protection of looked-after status. These are some of the most vulnerable children and young people in society. They are in effect living away from home permanently; they are mostly a long way from their family home and often parents can find it difficult to visit them. We know that disabled children living away from home are more likely than others to be abused, because research shows that, in general, disabled children are more than three times as likely to be abused as other children.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011763000005">Looked-after status acts as an important safeguard for those children who do not live with their families. It means that a plan is drawn up which considers all of the child&#146;s needs, including arrangements for them to keep in contact with their families wherever possible. There is a legal requirement that a designated social worker visits regularly and formally reviews how the child is getting on at set intervals. That gives an extra level of protection that I am sure we would all want for all children living away from their parents.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011763000006">Without looked-after status, those safeguards simply do not exist. For disabled children in residential special schools, the law says that the school should review a child&#146;s statement of special educational needs annually. However, research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that many local education authorities do not attend these meetings and, when they do, they tend to focus only on the child&#146;s education, not on their other needs. This does not promote the welfare of the whole child, which is what children and young people who are living away from their families need.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011763000007">Of course, some parents whose disabled children are placed away from home do have the time, resources and capacity to visit their children frequently and regularly. My amendment therefore gives discretion to local authorities so that, when they are certain that a child enjoys ongoing contact with their family, looked-after status is not necessary.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011763000008">While I welcome the Bill&#146;s new measures outlined in Clause 16, which propose an annual visit to children in residential placements, I am concerned that they will make little practical difference. They are dependent on Sections 85 and 86 of the Children Act 1989, which require home authorities to be informed when children are in long-term health or educational settings. However, government-commissioned research shows that this is not happening. As a minimum, we need guidance to remind health and education services of their notification duties. However, what we really need is for these children to have full looked-after status. After all, is one visit a year enough to protect a vulnerable child with severe learning disabilities and, perhaps, no speech? Why should disabled children have a lesser level of safeguarding protection than other children placed away from home?</p>

The school insists that all children placed there have looked-after status and the regular visits and monitoring of the child that this brings. This is not done to stigmatise the child&#146;s family, but simply to recognise the fact that the child&#146;s family is not there. The child is cared for by the school, not by the parents. Sunfield School feels that, without this, children are more vulnerable because they are far away from home and have little involvement with their families. The school takes the issue very seriously and the amendment would ensure that other schools and local authorities would follow its excellent example.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08011763000010">The amendment is not just about safeguarding, it also tackles the issue of accountability. Residential placements of 52 weeks are expensive. Do you want to spend &#163;100,000 on average each year on a residential placement for a child and not want to be regularly updated about how that child is progressing? In response to my speech at Second Reading, the Minister stated that the issue of looked-after status should depend,</p>
<ul><a name="08011763000220">&#147;on the assessment of the particular needs of each child and the nature of their disability&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/11/07; col. 1097.] </ul>
<p><a name="08011763000176">We agree that each child&#146;s individual needs should be paramount. This is why the amendment would give local authorities the freedom to decide on looked-after status based on whether it is in the child&#146;s  &#147;best interests&#148;. But the crucial difference, if the amendment were to be accepted, is that looked-after status would automatically be conferred on the disabled child placed away from home, unless their best interests prove that to be unnecessary.</p>

These are the most vulnerable children and giving them that status might bring with it rights, such as they are, to advocacy, and would perhaps strengthen the right to have a communication aid, if necessary, because then a duty would be imposed on the local authority to gain the child&#146;s views and feelings. In many cases they cannot do that unless they have a communication aid. For all those reasons, and the many reasons eloquently outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, I support the amendment.</p>

It seems that when we are dealing with the vulnerable and those at risk in our society, we need belt and braces. We cannot allow there to be gaps into which people may possibly fall. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me for using such a crude phrase, but this amendment is essentially about belt and braces.</p>

I am tempted to make one observation that I hope Members of the Committee will take seriously. I sometimes worry about those in the private sector who are dumped in residential boarding schools and whose parents totally fail to support the children in any full sense while they are there, beyond feeling that they are in the school. Perhaps we should look at that area at some time.</p>

I have beaten the drum on previous occasions for the principle that responsibility for children should never be regarded as a fragmented exercise, but rather as a unified matter. This is an example where the fields of education and social services share a responsibility. In many of the cases that I came across as a judge&#151;and I am sure that the experience of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is much superior to mine&#151;and in criminal jurisdiction, I was shocked by the number that involved disabled children who had been gravely abused and taken advantage of in these situations. Therefore, even if there is an element of double banking of care and concern, the amendment is wholly justified.</p>

We need a flexible legal framework for the provision of services in a way that is capable of responding to individual need and of being adapted to the particular circumstances of each family. The most effective solution is to strengthen the framework under which local authorities are notified of, monitor and supervise all children who are placed away from home, regardless of whether the placement is for educational, health or other reasons.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000020">Under Clauses 15 and 16, there will be an improved regime of arrangements for placing authorities to notify the local authority concerned of the placement of a child in long-term residential accommodation. More significantly, they introduce the requirement for the local authority in which the child is ordinarily resident to visit and maintain contact with the child for as long as the placement lasts. This will mean that the child will be subject to regular visits by a representative of the local authority and will ensure that a child&#146;s needs are met, not just at the point of placement but in the event of any change of circumstance during the placement.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0004.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08011763000021">However, we remain of the view that where the local authority is involved in the placement decision and is contributing to the funding of a child placed away from home, the child should normally be looked after. Only in cases where, having undertaken an assessment of need, the local authority is satisfied that there is a high ongoing level of parental support for the child, do we believe that looked-after status should not apply. This position is already set out in guidance, but we intend to set it out further in statutory guidance.</p>

He said that there would be &#147;regular&#148; visits from representatives of the local authority. Can he qualify that by giving me an idea as to the number of visits? Are two visits &#147;regular&#148;&#151;or three? It is a slightly ambivalent word.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08011763000030">The noble Baroness said: The purpose of our amendment is to broaden the scope of what is taken into account during the inspections of children&#146;s homes. Our amendment changes the provisions of Section 147 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 that relate to adoption and fostering functions. This seemed like the most logical place to amend that Act, as I assumed that this section&#146;s broad scope would include children&#146;s homes. I ask your Lordships&#146; forgiveness if I have attempted to amend in error or in the wrong place, but I hope to have support for the spirit and intention of this proposed change.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011763000031">Essentially the amendment would place a duty on the inspectors to make inspections about more than just the number of beds a children&#146;s home provides and the average cost of meals per child per day. I know that the Minister will say that that is not just what the inspectors do, but there is a fear out there that it is very much a tick-box exercise. Our amendment would obligate inspectors to take a more holistic approach and consider the promotion of the welfare and safety of the child when carrying out inspections. We recognise that inspectors will report on circumstances where children are being harmed or endangered. However, as we understand it, there is no statutory duty to consider the real aims of children&#146;s homes&#151;promoting a child&#146;s well-being&#151;when they are inspected.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011763000032">I point out that this refers only to the inspection already carried out in the provisions of this Bill. We have no intention of mandating inspections of foster parents&#146; homes or the like. We intend this amendment to apply to the institutional premises connected with these types of care provision&#151;namely children&#146;s homes. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000033"><b><a name="80117-gc0005.htm_spnew0"><a name="08011763000245">Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I support the amendment. I am sorry that it is there, but I am not surprised, because when, in the context of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill, we were able to prevent the Government from forming the monster inspectorate of criminal justice, custody and whatever, and allow the retention of independence in inspection of prisons and probation, it was precisely because experience had shown that it was much better to have single-issue inspectorates to focus on particular aspects that could form conglomerates and inspect particular experiences. In speaking on that matter, I was minded of the inspection of safeguarding children, in which I had readily become involved when the then Chief Inspector of Social Services had been charged with doing that. She asked all the associated inspectorates to join her, because they each had a different aspect to bring, and therefore there would be a holistic outcome. Education and prisons inspectorates joined, and so on.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011763000034">My worry about this monster, the CIECSS, is that actually it is education-based and education-focused. Under its remit, education is the main task of that chief inspector. I am concerned that this amendment refers to something that would have naturally fallen under the Chief Inspector of Social Services, had it been there, and then need not have been seen as necessary. However, it is required, because the current  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC606"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column GC606</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements leave people to doubt that the new arrangements allow that focusing on this very important aspect. Indeed, I suspect that, had the old arrangements continued, the current Chief Inspector of Social Services would have been noting with great care the points made throughout our Committee proceedings, many of which he would have felt it incumbent on him to monitor in future. I wonder whether those issues could be monitored by a CIECSS, which would have so many educational distractions from the supervision of all these aspects of care.</p>

So I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for filling in the gaps that I left.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000036"><b><a name="80117-gc0005.htm_spmin0"><a name="08011763000247">The Earl of Listowel:</b> I support the amendment and thank my noble friend for the inspirational reports from the joint chief inspectors on safeguarding children. I was particularly grateful for the attention that their last report drew to the situation for children in Yarl&#146;s Wood detention centre, which was extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011763000037">When the Commission for Social Care Inspection had responsibility for children&#146;s homes, what I heard when visiting several children&#146;s homes at the time was how helpful the inspectorate was to those homes. It was giving advice, for instance, about the key worker role in homes and how key workers should seek to spend one evening or some regular time each week with the child, perhaps doing the washing up together or playing ping pong; doing some sort of informal activity that would help the child to bond with their key worker. That is so important, and is the sort of thing that a good inspectorate could help to expand.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08011763000038">I highlight the continuing lack of capacity in many children&#146;s homes. The Government set a target that 80 per cent of staff in children&#146;s homes should have NVQ level 3 in childcare. Level 3 is very basic indeed. Unfortunately, some time ago that target had not been reached. How much progress has been made towards achieving that target? Perhaps it no longer exists; I know that it was a difficult target to reach. That sort of capacity needs to be built. I have been informed by people in this area that they are concerned that the new inspection regime is not permitted to concentrate on giving recommendations rather than saying whether there is a pass or fail.</p>

I rather suspect that the Minister will reply that all elements of the Every Child Matters agenda have to be inspected for, and that is how it is all covered. I understand that there is a feeling out there that if it is not spelled out they do not inspect for it, and I am sure that this is where the amendment is coming from. I very much support the spirit of the amendment. It is an important aspect of what these places do.</p>

The issue is whether existing legislation achieves the objective that she has set out, and we believe that it does. Section 119(1) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, read with Section 117(2), sets out the factors to which the chief inspector must have regard in performing her functions. The first item on the list is,</p>
<ul><a name="08011763000221">&#147;the need to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011763000177">This is a core responsibility of Ofsted and of the chief inspector, and it applies to all the inspection functions carried out by Ofsted, including those mentioned by the noble Baroness. Children&#146;s homes, which the noble Baroness mentioned, are inspected twice a year. The duties of the chief inspector are as I have set out and the chief inspector has a power to inspect more frequently if she has reasons for concern.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08011763000041">In addition, the existing national minimum standards for fostering services, against which fostering services are inspected, already provide a clear framework for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of looked-after children placed with foster carers. Section 4 of those standards focuses specifically on &#147;securing and promoting welfare&#148; and includes detailed standards related, for example, to protecting children from abuse and neglect, promoting their development and health and promoting their educational achievement.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08011763000042">Similarly, Section 2 of the national minimum standards for adoption agencies focuses on,</p>
<ul><a name="08011763000222">&#147;securing and promoting children&#146;s welfare&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011763000178">related, for example, to ensuring that children are placed with suitable and approved adopters who can best meet their needs and keep them safe.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011763000043">Ofsted, with other inspectorates, also inspects how services for looked-after children contribute to their well-being when undertaking joint area reviews under Section 20 of the Children Act 2004. After the programme of joint area reviews ends in 2008, the Government will continue to inspect services for looked-after children at local authority area level, under arrangements for comprehensive area assessment set out in the October 2006 local government White Paper <I>Strong and Prosperous Communities</I>.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011763000044">We take the view therefore that the existing duties of the chief inspector meet the concerns raised by the noble Baroness.</p>

Am I mistaken in what I have been told&#151;that it is simply to check that whatever institution is being inspected is meeting the standards required, or is there also a requirement that it should give advice? Should it ask how this can be done better? Have you thought of trying it this way? Have you looked at what so and so is doing? My understanding is that the inspectorate is not required to do that; it is simply told to judge the institution against the standards and say whether it fails or passes. I should appreciate clarification from the Minister on that point.</p>

Therefore, he is correct to say that its role is to inspect against standards. But the very nature of the process of inspection means that advice and support will be given. Therefore, I do not think that there is a hard and fast distinction as drawn by the noble Earl. However, I shall write to him with a fuller account of how Ofsted sees the position and I shall encourage the chief inspector to engage directly with him.</p>

One report after another had been extremely negative and it would have been very helpful for the organisation to have been told what it might do. When it asked, the inspectorate told it that its job was purely and simply to inspect and that it was not there to tell the organisation how it might do better. Can advice be given to the inspectorate that, without moving into the consultancy area, it could reassure the relevant organisation or at least suggest guidelines on what it might do?</p>

<p><a name="08011763000048"><b><a name="80117-gc0005.htm_spnew6"><a name="08011763000253">Lord Ramsbotham:</b> Following on from that, when the prisons inspectors were asked to take part in the first inspections of secure training centres we discovered that our approach, which was based on the aim of the inspection being to help the establishment improve its operational efficiency&#151;it was conducted in the form of a free consultancy&#151;was very different from the rather &#147;tick box&#148; approach that was offered. The latter might have produced a result that could then be league-tabled but it did not help the establishment to move forward. We tried very hard to feed our approach into the other inspectorates when they inspected custodial or residential establishments because the staff needed that help. As my noble friend Lord Listowel mentioned, an inspectorate can share its experience of practice in other places or spread good practice. However, the existing structures do not seem to have that procedure built into them.</p>

Foster carers have long called for the introduction of a national registration scheme for them through the General Social Care Council, as is available for many other members of the children&#146;s workforce. Registration would provide a major boost to the status of foster carers and improve the respect and treatment that they receive from other workers. Registration would also allow for the introduction of

Taken all round, it would be a good measure. The GSCC is very willing to have this additional group of members, and it would improve the professionalisation of foster carers, which we would all like to see.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08011763000067">Amendment No. 97 is about responsibility delegated to foster carers by the local authority. The 2002 fostering regulations require all fostering services to enter into a foster placement agreement, which should include the circumstances in which it is necessary to obtain in advance the approval of the responsible authority for the child to take part in school trips or to stay overnight away from the foster parent&#146;s home, but not for other everyday issues.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08011763000068">It is important to note that there is no standard formula for how a foster placement agreement is supposed to operate. According to people whom I have spoken to on Fosterline, most foster carers would not be aware that it existed, and there is minimal enforcement of it. However, the key point is that there is massive confusion about what responsibility local authorities can delegate to the foster parent and how they should do so. The problems of overnight stays were massively improved by the issuing of statutory guidance. The Government could perhaps now look at how foster placement agreements work and what circumstances they cover in the review of the fostering regulations next year. It could be that a commitment from the Government to produce guidance under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 might be an appropriate way of filling in this gap. Foster parents need to know what they can decide about in everyday little matters relating to their foster child and what they have to refer back to the local authority. It cannot be very efficient for foster carers to keep running back to the local authority and thereby causing a delay on matters on which they could easily and safely take the decision themselves. I would be most grateful if the Minister could tell us whether there is an intention to look at this in the review that is coming up.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08011763000069">I want to leave Amendment No. 96 to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. However, I am glad that she is trying to split, very transparently, the actual fee that is paid to the foster carer for doing the work of fostering the child and the allowance that is paid to cover the expenses of looking after that child. Amendment No. 98 is about making sure that if a foster parent is accused of an allegation they can continue to receive the fee, because in those circumstances the child will have been taken away from them so they are no longer entitled to the allowance. That is natural justice. It is about being innocent until proven guilty.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08011763000070">The possibility of an allegation being made against them is a constant fear for foster carers. Due to the nature of the children and young people placed with them, and the often fraught relationships between foster carers and birth parents, unfounded allegations are, sadly, a regular occurrence. An allegation is often used as a way of trying to break a placement, or is

Surveys have shown that around a third of all foster carers will face an allegation during their fostering career, and the vast majority turn out to be unfounded.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08011763000071">Government timescales for the resolution of allegations, set out in the <I>Working Together</I> guidance, desirable though they are, are routinely being missed in allegation cases against foster carers. <I>Working Together</I> states that 80 per cent of allegations should be resolved in one month, 90 per cent should be resolved in three months and all cases should be resolved in a year. Research by Swain in 2006 has shown that 50 per cent of allegation cases last longer than three months and one in 10 last longer than a year&#151;in some cases several years. To compound matters, in a third of all allegation cases where some or all children have been removed&#151;which is really the de facto suspension of that foster carer from their job&#151;almost all foster carers have their fostering income cut, and 46 per cent have their income stopped completely.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08011763000072">Research has also shown that 60 per cent of foster carers facing allegations are not receiving the access to independent support during an allegation that they desperately need and which they are required to receive under the current national minimum standards for fostering services. The amendment would protect foster carers from the immense financial hardship that can accompany an allegation investigation, and it would give local authorities greater incentive to resolve investigations within an acceptable timescale. If they are continuing to have to pay the very small fees that some foster carers get, it certainly makes it a very good thing that they speed up their investigations. We really need to keep these foster carers, and if there is an ongoing case against an innocent person, for all the reasons that I have outlined, they will obviously have lost the allowance because they have lost the child. If they lose the fee as well, they will have to get another job.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000073">We are desperately short of foster parents, and we are paying them only a very small amount. It is against natural justice that they should be seen as guilty because their retention fee&#151;as I would call it&#151;has been taken away from them while the allegation is heard. If we can reach the target of 80 per cent resolved within a month, the payments that we are talking about will be very small. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that we will not lose a lot of foster carers because of financial expediency&#151;they have no income and have to get another job. We will lose them, and that would be extremely sad. Amendment No. 98 would be possible if the split sought by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, were put into place. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011763000075">Amendment No. 96 relates to the publication of the payments that foster carers receive. At the moment, there are vast discrepancies between different local authorities and independent providers. Not only do the remuneration payments, or what are often called fee payments, differ, but the allocation to cover the costs of fostering also varies immensely. Our amendment seeks to arrange for the publication of payments made to foster carers, and we also seek assurances that the publication will be comprehensive, providing a breakdown of what is actually covered and the different criteria for each scheme. Otherwise, the publication of payments would not be useful as a mode of comparison.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011763000076">Amendment No. 97 would empower foster carers to have more responsibility in decisions about their foster child. Children in foster care are often prevented from doing what other children simply take for granted&#151;school holidays or even haircuts&#151;because of insurmountable red tape and the delays of bureaucracy. We therefore support the amendment.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011763000077">Finally, the last amendment in the group ensures that payment continues to be made to foster carers against whom there have been allegations of wrongdoing until there has been an assessment of the claim. This is simply a question of innocent until proved guilty, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, and we are happy to support it, especially as a large proportion of foster carers will face allegations at some point. It will also encourage local authorities to resolve allegation claims quickly, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said. It is not as though we have an unlimited pool of foster carers.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011763000079">I shall also speak briefly to Amendment No. 96 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. It is important for good financial practice as well as for allegations that we should distinguish clearly between payments to meet the full cost of caring for a child and the fee. The financial officer of any public company would not like to make a single payment for two totally different purposes without making it clear what they were and how they were differentiated. I therefore support the amendment. If that is not done, there is a temptation to defer adjusting the payment for the full cost of caring for a child by saying that the total amount of money is reasonably right for the time being. That is what happens in this world. It is most important to differentiate between those two items. The full cost of caring for the child should be specified and can therefore be adjusted when it should be adjusted.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08011763000082">On Amendment No. 96, the national minimum allowance for foster carers, which we announced in July 2006 and which has been warmly welcomed by foster carers and their organisations, was introduced to help to ensure that no foster carer was out of pocket as a result of caring for a looked-after child. Our good practice guidance, which was published alongside the national minimum allowance, was intended to support fostering services in improving their payment systems. In addition, the recent White Paper <I>Care Matters</I><I></I>includes a further commitment aimed at improving transparency around payment systems and foster carers&#146; eligibility for payments; that is, their allowances and their fees. We announced in the White Paper our commitment to require all fostering services to publish details of their payment structures for foster carers in relation to the task undertaken by carers and the level of training required. It is essential that every fostering service provider has in place an effective policy on payments to foster carers and that that policy is available to carers. By requiring local authorities to publish full details of their payment structures, including allowances and fees, we will ensure that that is the case and therefore meet the objective of this amendment.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08011763000083">Amendment No. 98 seeks to ensure that foster carers continue to receive a fee until a qualifying determination has been reached. Where a fee is paid, a decision by the fostering provider to cease payments pending formal termination of approval, as the noble Baroness said, leads to a sudden loss of income, and that can be difficult for carers to manage. There may be a number of reasons why that happens. It may be that an allegation of abuse has been made against a foster carer and an investigation is taking place. In those cases, it may be appropriate for a fee to be paid until there is a qualifying determination. I fully take on board the points that the noble Baroness and other noble Lords have made about the need for the timely investigation and determination of such complaints. We believe that this is an issue of great significance to foster carers, and we will be looking at the timescales for allegations as part of our review of the national minimum standards for fostering providers with a view to promoting best practice in this area.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08011763000084">However, there may be other reasons why a fostering provider makes a decision not to continue to approve an individual as a foster carer. For example, the welfare of a child may have been put at risk in some way by the carer&#146;s actions, or it may be that the foster carer, or an adult member of the fostering household, has been convicted of an offence which would automatically bar him or her from fostering. In such cases, it may be entirely inappropriate for the  


<notus-date day="17" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC615"><b>17 Jan 2008 : Column GC615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>carer to continue to receive a fee until such time as the decision to discontinue a carer&#146;s approval has been formalised, taking account of any recommendation by the fostering panel.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011763000085">Amendment No. 94 seeks to bring foster carers within the group of social care workers registered by the General Social Care Council in England and the Care Council for Wales in Wales. Foster care is a truly unique occupation, and foster carers are substantially different from other groups that are registered and regulated by a central body. Therefore, we are not sympathetic to proposals for a national registration scheme. The fostering services regulations and national minimum standards set out clearly the basis on which an individual should be approved as a foster carer and the comprehensive range of information that must be taken into account in deciding whether an individual is suitable to be a foster carer. They also set out the Government&#146;s expectations of the fostering service and its carers in improving outcomes for individual children.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011763000086">Under existing legislation, carers&#146; performance must be reviewed regularly, and the Government have funded the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council to develop a set of training and development standards for foster carers that illustrates clearly the standards expected of every foster carer. These standards were published in May 2007, and we have already announced our intention to link them with the revised national minimum standards for foster care to improve the training and development that all foster carers receive. This framework is appropriate, and we would not wish to change it at present.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011763000087">Finally, on Amendment No. 97 on the delegation of responsibility to foster carers, it would not be appropriate for the Government to prescribe centrally the precise circumstances in which responsibility should be delegated to carers, as this will depend on the needs and circumstances of the individual child. Schedule 6 to the Fostering Services Regulations sets out, for example, the matters that should be covered in the foster placement agreement, which the responsible authority must enter into with the foster carer before a child may be placed with that carer. These include the circumstances in which the carer must obtain in advance the responsible authority&#146;s approval for the child to take part in school trips or to stay overnight away from the carer&#146;s home.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011763000088">The placement information record, which should be completed for all children living away from home, details the arrangements for meeting the child&#146;s needs where responsibilities are divided between a number of people. It must, for example, set out where the responsibility lies for taking a child for routine medical or dental treatment or for giving consent for medical treatment. Existing legislation and statutory guidance are clear about how the local authority&#146;s duties in respect of looked-after children should be discharged and about the need for clarity around the delegation of responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000090">On Amendment No. 98, I understand what the Minister said about the situation that pertains if a member of the foster carer&#146;s household, or even the foster carer themselves, is convicted of something that would make them ineligible to be a foster carer. In that case, the person is immediately disqualified from being a foster carer. In that situation, unfortunately, I can see why the fee would have to be stopped. However, the Minister also mentioned the situation in which the foster carer has behaved in such a way that puts the child at risk. Surely that is something to be determined by those who are looking at the allegation. There may have been an allegation that the person has behaved in that way, but the matters around that will have to be determined through the proper procedure, which might take a few weeks.</p>

The fee is removed from many foster carers while the allegations are being investigated, and it does not seem right that a local authority should simply be able to opt out of paying them. It is a self-defeating policy, because the local authority will then have the expense of recruiting more foster carers. Even when that foster carer may be found innocent, as many are, they have already flown the nest and got another job. I accept part of what the Minister said, but I am still concerned about another part of what he said, and I might want to bring the matter back on Report.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08011763000093">The Minister&#146;s remarks on Amendment No. 97 are yet another example of what has happened many times in this Grand Committee when he has read out what the current situation is and cited the legislation, the regulations, the guidance and all the rest of it. Yet Members of the Grand Committee know that it is not happening. Listening to what he said about what should be in the fostering agreement, I was puzzled as to how any foster carer might be confused about what decisions they can and cannot take. Yet they are. They ring the fostering advice line for advice about what decisions they can take. They are greatly frustrated about not being able to take the sort of quick and fairly insignificant decisions that most parents would take without thinking twice. Local authorities might need further guidance on how regularly to refresh the mind of the foster carer about what exactly is covered in the foster caring agreement.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08011763000094">I accept what the noble Lord said about localism, that it makes sense for some of these decisions to be decided locally and that that is appropriate given the particular circumstances of the child.

However, this is not the first time that this has arisen. Many such situations have

Therefore, we propose this amendment to scrap centrally imposed adoption targets and the financial incentives attached to them, which are not always in the best interests of the child.

If the Government wish to continue with these targets, they must think more carefully about how they will support the families and ensure that decisions made about children&#146;s placements are appropriate, because it is terrible for the child to be promised a placement with a family and for that placement to then break down.

The local government White Paper commitments mean that government will agree targets with local authorities only against indicators drawn from the national indicator set. From April 2008, there will not be a national indicator measuring the number of adoptions of children from care, so the Government will not, under the terms of the new performance framework, agree targets to increase adoptions from care with local authorities, which is the point underlying the second part of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

That is what the noble Lord was raising and, arguably, he should have raised the issue under this amendment. Clause 31 changes the sunset clause. Under the Children Act 2004, a register of private fosterers was to be set up under Section 45 in relation to England and under Section 46 in relation to Wales. Section 47 states that if the regulations relating to that register have not been laid within four years of the passing of the Act, which would be November 2008, Sections 45 and 46 would fall.

That will give the Government practically two years in which to get the regulations written and the register up and running. We feel that that is perfectly adequate.

As to why we are seeking this additional time, I should make clear that we are not signalling that we have abandoned the idea of introducing registration, but that we need more time to see whether the current notification system is working. Before deciding whether to introduce a registration scheme, we need to assess fully the notification system. To do that we will need advice from the relevant experts. We will need to look not only at practices in different types of area and in authorities with high, medium and low levels of notification, but also to try to understand what prevents people in various situations notifying arrangements to their local authorities. We need to grasp the question of whether a registration scheme would encourage or deter private fosterers coming forward to the authorities. We are anxious not to deter fosterers from coming in where we need them.

In my view, the responsibilities are the same as those of any parent who has their child living with them. Curiously, the responsibilities are not clearly set out in law in England, although they are in Scotland. When a child is taken into local authority care and is placed with a foster carer or put into a children&#146;s home, or where a child after the separation of his parents is sent to live with one of them, surely the same responsibilities must be relevant. It is critical for the child and for the parents of that child with whom he is not living that the child receives the parenting that he needs. We all know that parenting is fundamental to all aspects of a child&#146;s well-being, including his education. The present position leaves uncertainty, which is potentially bad for the child and for the concerned adults. In the amendment, I propose that we should insert into the 1989 Act the relevant wording from Section 1 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

<ul><a name="08011763000223">&#147;a parent has in relation to his child the responsibility ... to safeguard and promote the child&#146;s health, development and welfare ... to provide, in a manner appropriate to the stage of development of the child ... direction ... guidance&#148;.</ul>

It allows for a framework to appreciate situations where a relationship may have ended, but responsibilities to the child have not. So, as I said, we are very happy to support the amendment.</p>

This is one occasion, if I may put it like this, where Scotland is ahead of us. The fact that it is in statutory form in Scotland is a good indicator to us, because the Scots are very keen on child welfare, that the wording there would be appropriate for us.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08011763000147">There are a number of court decisions on what is meant by parental responsibility. That is absolutely useless for most people because you have to trawl through the cases. What is needed&#151;and I very much endorse the amendment of my noble friend Lord Northbourne&#151;is a clear recognition in statute, not only of the importance of the parental position but is a clear and simple definition of what parental responsibility actually means.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08011763000148">It may be that it was not needed in 1989. I remember being very much involved in 1987-88 in giving advice on the Children Bill and then going around the country, on what we used to call road shows, training the judiciary and the lawyers on how to work the Children Act. This point did not come up then, but I think that, nearly 20 years later, the rather unhappy experience we have seen through the courts and particularly for social services, the Probation Service and, indeed, the criminal justice system, shows that some understanding of what is really meant by parenting needs to be in primary legislation. For those reasons I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000149"><b><a name="80117-gc0007.htm_spnew10"><a name="08011763000292">Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I, too, very strongly support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Northbourne. As has already been mentioned, it produces a definition which we have been searching for. Certainly at the back of my amendments yesterday about adding the responsibility of care for those in custody was that somebody should be exercising the responsibility of a parent on behalf of the people in custody.</p>

<a name="80117-gc0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08011763000150">Currently I am involved with the development of a suggestion about a new type of administering custody, which is much more localised. The first part of that study has been trying to establish what would be the ethos of an establishment like that. It all boils down to this: what are you going to be doing in loco parentis? Therefore, I think it is extremely important that the provision should be replicated. It is unfortunate that it was not in the Children Act 1989 because it took, if noble Lords remember, a judicial review brought by the Howard League to get formal acceptance by the Government that the terms of the Children Act 1989 applied to those in custody, which previously were denied. Therefore I strongly support the amendment and hope that it will be accepted and put in the Bill.</p>

I do so in particular because if a judge in the family courts as eminent and experienced as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady

I only regret that in such a provision it is not possible to put in the words &#147;love&#148; and &#147;happiness&#148;, which are the things that most parents want to give to their children. If you ask any new parent: &#147;Do you want him to be a footballer, a judge, a shopkeeper or a builder?&#148; the answer always is &#147;No, I just want him to be happy&#148;. Regretfully, you cannot really add that in a piece of legislation. However, it sounds to me like a very useful amendment, as far as it goes, so I support it.</p>

I appreciate that there may well be arguments over the proposed subsection (2), because it is difficult to define all the elements concerned, even the quantifiable ones. Elements like love, affection and loyalty are unquantifiable and can therefore never be the subject of definition in law.</p>

<p><a name="08011763000156">I accept that the content of the proposed subsection (2) appears most sensible and comprehensive.

<p><a name="08011763000181">in other words, be descriptive and inclusive rather than exclusive. In the circumstances, therefore, if the 1989 Act were to be amended in this way, it would, in the words of Dr Johnson, concentrate the mind wonderfully.

<p><a name="08011763000158">As the noble and learned Baroness knows, the approach to parental responsibility taken by the Children Act 1989 itself implements a Law Commission recommendation.

Such a list would, in its view, have to change from time to time to meet differing needs and circumstances. That was its view then, but we are happy to take further advice, including from noble Lords. I will say on Report whether we believe that it would be appropriate to move on this matter.</p>
