However, eligibility for the scheme will be subject to periodic review, and the Government do not rule out extending it in the future. We will closely monitor Scotland&#146;s Fresh Talent Scheme, which has been in operation for only two years.</p>

<a name="70627-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07062768000014"></a>Do the Government want to attract the best foreign students from around the world? By allowing foreign students and graduates to stay on and work for two years after they graduate, they contribute to our economy, gain work experience, are able to pay back some of their education fees and, most of all, there will be a link with their countries for generations to come. To my knowledge, we have the same Home Office rules here as in Scotland. We now have a Prime Minister who openly champions Britain. Why cannot the Government put the two-year rule into placeright now?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07062768000016"></a>In respect of the International Graduates Scheme, only five weeks ago we introduced a scheme that allows overseas graduates to stay for a year. That is a significant move and change of policy because, at the moment, there are 220,000 students from outside the EEA in English higher education institutions. The Government see that as a significant change of policy. It is precisely in the direction that the noble Lord asked us to move, and we think it right to take account of progress in that policy before we consider extending it.</p>

I cannot say precisely how long but if the noble Baroness wishes to ask me about that in a few months, I shall ask my officials to see what reflections we have on the initial experience. One of the issues that we need to address first is what the numbers are. Because the scheme has only just started we have no idea how many of the 220,000 overseas students studying in this country will choose to apply. If the Government are being responsible, it is absolutely correct that we should see what the impact of the one-year scheme is in numbers and patterns of students staying in this country before we commit to any extension.</p>

In those discussions, we have welcomed the engagement of those states in attempting to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe. As the Prime Minister said directly to President Mbeki, we believe that the crisis requires an African solution but one that can be delivered with the support of the international community.

But is it not of considerable interest to the developed world if the venture fails, because it would have to pick up the bill? Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government, via the Commonwealth and other international organisations, do their best to maintain international interest in finding a solution to the Zimbabwe problem?</p>

I think that I said to the House some time ago that, when people talk about the Zimbabwean economy melting down, I took a different view: it has melted down. Many say that inflation will be 10,000 to 11,000 per cent at the end of the year; that is an exponential, not a straight-line increase, and no economy in the world has ever recovered of its own internal volition from such a crisis. After the deplorable policies of this regime have been extinguished, the rest of the world will have to pick that country up.</p>

In a way, we all owe them a debt of thanks for what they are doing; they did not wish that on themselves. I do not want to say anything negative about President Mbeki&#146;s efforts. He has made them on past occasions, and they have not been blessed with success, but he has managed to bring together for the first time in a very long time the opposition and representatives of the Government. My fear is that the perpetual violence visited on the opposition means that their capacity to take part in a free and fair election, should that be secured, will be so greatly diminished that they will never be on a level playing field.</p>

Of course, the high cost of this flooding will initially be borne by individuals and businesses. Do the Government have discussions under way with banks and other financial institutions to ensure sympathetic treatment for short-term funding requests, which will be essential if communities are to recover in a reasonably short timescale? Will they get involved in discussions with insurance companies&#151;which will of course become involved&#151;to try to ensure that when premium rises comes through, as they surely must after this event, they are contained to that which is essential to cover additional, proper costs?</p>

They are all looked at by telemetry to keep track of what is happening at any time of any day and to give accurate warning. Many rivers have sluices and gates. As we meet now, engineers are actively managing water flow in the main rivers to hold it back or divert it to ease pressure. The Environment Agency has a key role in monitoring what is going on and is not simply the arbiter of a weather forecast that may or may not be accurate.</p>

Of the &#163;15 million, some &#163;9 million affected maintenance. General administration and other matters were also affected. I have been assured that none of that would have changed anything that has happened in the past few days. That &#163;15 million was put back for this year; hence, I can be positive about the second part of the question.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07062768000112"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we return again to this issue, as promised, following our interesting and robust debate in Committee. This issue is of central importance to the way in which various agencies responsible for offender management will do their business in the wake of the changes created by the Bill. As was pointed out, there was complete agreement in Committee that all concerned should indeed co-operate. The question was whether that co-operation should be a statutory duty in the Bill. Given the consensus in Committee, I hope that the Government will be prepared to listen on this occasion.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07062768000113"></a>The Government&#146;s argument rested mainly on the reference to Clause 3(3), in which the Secretary of State is authorised to make probation provision with any person and,</p>
<ul><a name="07062768000283"></a>&#147;may in particular authorise or require that other person ... to co-operate with other providers of probation services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000256"></a>It was argued that this amounted to the same position as that in our amendment. It is in fact crucially different, because a duty to co-operate is just that; an obligation to co-operate. This is important, because, as we all know, without such an obligation there is always the very real chance that there will be no such co-operation in the face of the constant competing demands on the time and resources of so many agencies in the field, and where optional commitments are the first to be ignored.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07062768000114"></a>We also heard how there are already precedents in other areas, such as the duties of agencies under the Children Act and the duties to promote equality under the race relations legislation, which became a reality only when it became a duty. Members on all sides of the Committee&#151;the noble Baronesses, Lady Gibson, Lady Stern and Lady Howe, the nobleLords, Lord Judd, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Waddington, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia&#151;adduced many powerful arguments to support this case. They brought a considerable weight of wisdom to bear, which I suggest the Government should take very seriously. I recognise and applaud some of the changes that the Government are making, such as introducing reducing reoffending partnership boards. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, actually talks about being,</p>
<ul><a name="07062768000284"></a>&#147;in many ways in violent agreement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/07; col. 494.]</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000257"></a>However, she should respond now on this issue, because we are far more likely to see the end-to-end offender management that we all seek through such a duty to co-operate.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07062768000115"></a>I also sought to demonstrate that there has beena very different outcome in Scotland, where the situation was very similar. At the outset, there were consultation exercises in Scotland and England on changes to offender management, which produced very similar responses: an overwhelming resistance to a more centralised system from both ends of the UK;  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_605"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 605</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and less than 1 per cent of responses in favour of the plan in England. Scotland chose to listen, resulting is eight community justice authorities rooted in their local authorities consisting of a range of statutory partner bodies, including the voluntary sector, with an additional wider range of partners. Silos are being broken down and, although it is still early days, the enthusiasm from the Minister down for this way of working is palpable.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07062768000116"></a>The point about illustrating this model just up the road is not to argue that it necessarily should be emulated in every respect or be dismissed because certain structures are different in England and Wales from those in Scotland, but to demonstrate what can and has been done in another part of the UK where the issues are not radically different, but where, as a result of the sort of changes that we have been advocating on these Benches, the outcomes are seriously good and the approach really worthy of consideration. It is our belief that this amendment will materially improve outcomes for the better, for better effective offender management, for the reduction of reoffending and for the better rehabilitation of offenders. We urge the Government this time to listen. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, of course knows all about the situation in Scotland. But I hope she will agree, to give the Government their due, that the Scottish system, as yet, is untested. It is on the statute book, but those concerned are still working out their roles in the new system. The noble Baroness said that the situation is different in Scotland; for example, there is no probation service and that work is done by the social work department. However, there is an aspiration in Scotland&#151;whether the new Minister is very enthusiastic, I have no idea&#151;that everyone should work together. The Act is designed to make that happen. We do not yet know whether it will work, but we shall see whether it does. We must remember that when talking about Scotland.</p>

I am not clear whether it is effectively a probing and debating point to say that co-operation is important or whether it is a genuine attempt to say that we should stop the Bill, tear it apart and remodel it on the Scottish model. I thank the noble Baroness for shaking her head. Clearly, it is not that.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07062768000119"></a>Therefore, the amendment is about whether we should put something explicit on co-operation further into the Bill. The amendment is not aided by the fact that, technically, it is flawed because it refers to probation boards rather than probation trusts, which, clearly, is what the Bill is all about. But let me not be nitpicking in that respect. It is really about whether there is a need to do this, given that there are already responsibilities on parties and further powers elsewhere in the Bill to insist on proper co-operation.

But from what I understand&#151;no doubt, my noble friend on the Front Bench will clarify this&#151;the duty to co-operate will be reinforced by other elements in the Bill and we should not be so simple as to assume that simply putting it again in the Bill will transform behaviour.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07062768000120"></a>The transformation of behaviour that is necessary to get a better reduction in reoffending will come in part from such measures, but even more so from the central structure of the Bill which is trying to ensure that there is a more end-to-end system of offender management and the development of a diversity of suppliers under proper local and central control. I hope that I have not been too harsh on the noble Baroness because I respect much of what she says in many debates.</p>

<a name="07062768000121"></a><b><a name="70627-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07062768000826"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> My Lords, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has been harsh, he has just got hold of the wrong end of the stick. If we wanted to destroy the clause, the amendment would have been quite different. My noble friend, with her considerable experience in Scotland, has been able to identify good practices there. Her amendment seeks to find out whether it is possible to establish a system in which a duty is placed on agencies to co-operate with each other. That is an important point. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, is aware of the fact that until there was a duty to co-operate in terms of the duty to promote equality under the Race Relations Act, agencies did not have to do anything. They could sit quietly; the Race Relations Act could not damage them because they were doing nothing unlawful. At the same time, they never promoted equality to the extent required under this proposed new clause. By promoting this duty, there will be a positive response in terms of co-operation between different agencies.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07062768000122"></a>Let us look at what happened when this issue was debated in the other place. The Bill received its Third Reading in the Commons on 28 February. It was amended by the Government so that court work is now exempt from its provisions. However, Clauses 2 to 5 still open up the work of the Probation Service to market forces and privatisation. A consultation document entitled <I>Restructuring Probation to Reduce Re-offending</I> was published on 11 October 2005. It is an interesting paper in which the Government propose to abolish the National Probation Service and replace it with a fragmented market of competing providers. It received 740 responses, of which under1 per cent were in favour of the proposals, which demonstrates very effectively that people are still unclear about this. All my noble friend&#146;s amendment seeks is to make sure that agencies co-operate with each other so that in the end-to-end management of this service, there are positive outcomes.</p>

If this debate had been taking place in  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_607"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around 1997, I would have some sympathy with the thinking behind the amendment. The noble Baroness rather understates the extent to which partnership and co-operation between different criminal justice and other agencies has moved on, particularly following the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. We have bodies like crime and disorder reduction partnerships, youth offending teams, local criminal justice boards and a raft of other bodies working to ensure that the agencies work together. The structure of the Bill itself continues to encourage co-operation and joint working when dealing with some of the difficult problems that those in the Probation Service haveto face. This legislation builds on that co-operative approach, one that has become a much more significant part of the criminal justice system. This amendment is a bit out of time and rather unnecessary. All it does is extend the length of the Bill to no great purpose.</p>

As I understand it, the Bill is all about the better management of offenders, and Part 1 in particular concentrates on the Probation Service. If you picked up this Bill, you could be forgiven for thinking that Part 1 is not really about the management of offenders, but the imposition of a different way of commissioning probation services. One element of making everything better is evolving the partnership of everyone involved. Many noble Lords have said that the probation system is not working as well as we should like. That is because co-operation has not been happening as much as people would like. Therefore, if we hope that the Bill will result in the better management of offenders, surely it is right to include in it all the words which we think will bring that about, including the element of co-operation which has not been as good as it should have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07062768000126"></a>The amendment is necessary because co-operation between the Prison Service and the Probation Service is of the first importance. In the past they have had a somewhat different ethos from each other, which may explain why co-operation has been less than perfect. I agree that it is important to have it on the face ofthe Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07062768000127"></a>As to designation, I do not see how the Secretary of State can effectively know all about local voluntary organisations. Some will be good, some will be mediocre and some will be bad and, therefore, any designation should be done at a local level. Perhaps this could be incorporated in a future refinement of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07062768000129"></a>First, I thought the Bill was about partnership and co-operation and that the difficulty people were having with it was that it was moving out of the existing system&#151;which, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Warner, has moved on to some extent&#151;into a position where even greater co-operation was made possible by the opening of markets. I use that term unreservedly and without the need to apologise for it, although opening those markets to the voluntary and private sectors is a cause of great concern among other noble Lords. The Bill&#146;s core being partnership and co-operation throughout, I should like clarification from the government Front Bench and from the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, of the difference they feel the changes in the service will make.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07062768000130"></a>The second area of confusion in which I find myself relates to the comments about the whole Bill and the fragmentation of the service by the movement forward in the Bill. I understood that we were talking not about fragmentation but about trusts which would have greater powers to draw the services closer together. It is to be hoped that the Bill has the capacity to retain central control on some services. I believe this is essential for the specialised services of which I have considerable personal experience, particularly in the treatment of sexual offenders. That is a very important element.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07062768000131"></a>While recognising and agreeing with the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, that there is a need for co-operation&#151;I do not think anyone on the Floor of the House will disagree with that&#151;I find it difficult to understand some of the comments from her side of the House on how that will be brought forward and improved by the amendment.</p>

I agree that matters have moved on; there have been various Bills&#151;they have not only been on offender management&#151;advocating co-operation, working together and so on that have been somewhat allowed to go in their own directions.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07062768000133"></a>The amendment attracts me because if you are talking about end-to-end offender management being the important aspect of the Bill, it ought to involve co-operation and, in particular, the Prison Service. But the Prison Service is hardly mentioned&#151;I think it is mentioned once in the entire Bill&#151;and end-to-end must involve it. Indeed, we must assume that training in the Prison Service is of an adequate level and parallel to that given to those who undertake probation duties.</p>

I assure her that the Government take very seriously her comments about co-operation. I hope I will be able to help the House to agree that there is very little, if anything, between us. I agree with the comments made by my noble friends Lord Warner and Lord Filkin about how this matter should be looked at. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, has asked some very pertinent questions. We have moved quite a long way forward. The Scottish model, which  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Baronesses, Lady Linklater and Lady Carnegy of Lour, have referred to, is admirable but set in a slightly different structure&#151;a different system&#151;and would not necessarily fit that easily here. </p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07062768000135"></a>I have listened carefully to all those who have spoken. We are still very much in agreement about the importance of partnership working and the close co-operation between agencies involved in the supervision of offenders. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, is therefore right when she says that the whole Bill is about partnership; it is about nothing if not that. No one doubts that the task of reducing reoffending can be tackled effectively only by a full range of agencies working together. It is just not going to happen unless that occurs. That is whywe have established, both through statute and administratively, a whole range of mechanisms to facilitate multi-agency working.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07062768000136"></a>I outlined those mechanisms in Committee on21 May and followed that up in greater detail in my letter of 4 June to noble Lords who had spoken in Committee. I do not apologise for the fact that that detailed note spanned over eight pages, because it was important for us to track through all the different statutory and other arrangements that we have in place to ensure that co-operation is embedded as a reality&#151;it is systemically there&#151;and cannot be inappropriately uprooted. I shall not repeat that detail today, but I remind noble Lords of the examples contained therein&#151;the crime and disorder reduction partnerships, through which we delivered the prolific and other priority offenders programme; the multi-agency public protection arrangements; the local safeguarding children boards; the local criminal justice boards; the regional reducing reoffending partnership boards; and so on. All those initiatives have created a culture change in the way in which agencies now work together.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07062768000137"></a>In the past few weeks I have been privileged to go up and down the country and speak to many of those working in the crime and disorder reduction partnerships, and I have been deeply impressed by what I have listened to. I have heard police officers who know as much about what is happening in education and health as they do about what is happening on the streets, and vice versa. They are thinking laterally; they are planning together; they are plotting, frankly, against the crooks and how better to address some of their needs. It is truly inspirational. So often we believe that by legislating we fix things. In fact, by legislating we create a framework within which others can fix things, and we already have much of that legislation. I do not disagree with the noble Baroness when she says that co-operation is vital.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07062768000138"></a>The question we now have to address is what we can do to facilitate even greater and more effective co-operation. We have to cast our net more widely than we have in the past, so that arrangements encompass not only statutory agencies but all those agencies, from whichever sector, that have something to offer in the reduction of reoffending. That is what our proposals in Part 1 seek to do. The importance of co-operation is crucial to those arrangements. As I pointed out in Committee, Clause 3(3)(a) explicitly  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enables the Secretary of State to authorise or require&#151;I emphasise &#147;require&#148;&#151;providers to co-operate with one another and with other agencies involved in crime prevention, crime reduction or work with victims. Those expectations will be clearly set out in contracts.</p>

<a name="70627-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07062768000139"></a>The extent to which probation boards are ableto demonstrate their commitment to partnership working is one of the key criteria in the process that is under way to determine which probation boards should move to trust status first. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, says about making sure that co-operation is real, but this is a way in which we think we can deliver it. Thanks to the amendment agreed in Committee, the Bill now includes, in Schedule 3, a provision to ensure that probation providers participate fully in the negotiation and delivery of local area agreements.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70627-0004.htm"/>


<a name="70627-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07062768000140"></a>This apparently straightforward amendment sits entirely outside the rest of the proposals in Part 1.It deals with the arrangements that we currentlyhave, whereby local probation boards operate in accordance with the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. It seeks to require local probation boards and other organisations that are involved in the supervision of offenders, such as the Prison Service and other organisations that are designated by order, to co-operate with one another. Now we know that that is really all that it does.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07062768000141"></a>The amendment is technically deficient&#151;I do not complain about that because it was what the noble Baroness was saying that was important, not the technical deficiency; we could, I am sure, cure that if we thought that we should do&#151;and it fails to connect with the rest of the proposals in Part 1. It also fails to offer any real alternative to what we do now. None of us is naive enough to think that a simple duty to co-operate, without any worked-out system to underpin it, will change the way in which agencies work together. The amendment certainly will not facilitate the greater involvement of voluntary sector providers, nor offer more flexibility in commissioning of services. It will not, for example, enable any services to be commissioned regionally or across the prison gate&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, mentioned that. It maintains the existing divisions between agencies and geographical areas, which our proposals aim to bridge.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07062768000142"></a>I welcome this debate and the support from all sides of the House for the principle of co-operation, but this amendment will not help us to achieve it.I invite the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, to withdraw her amendment. This has been a valuable debate because it has reinforced again the fact that there is no disagreement in this House about the importance of co-operation or about the need to embed it between all agencies&#151;public, private and not for profit. We are all conjoined in our belief that that is the only way in which we will reduce reoffending in our country.</p>

The point about Scotland is that it is a fine example of what is possible in different, but not very different, circumstances. The arrangement has been live since the early spring, and had been running for a year before that; the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, might be interested to know that there have already been some very good results.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07062768000144"></a>Of course I am aware of the range of agencies and of the way in which things have come on since the 1970s. One or two very important points have been raised. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, if everything was perfect&#151;if we were all co-operating so well&#151;we would hardly need to be here. My noble friend Lord Dholakia gave a very important example involving the simple addition of a duty to co-operate. Co-operation is of course in people&#146;s minds&#151;we all want co-operation but, in reality, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, will know, there are often pressurised, difficult and competing demands and the things that you would like do not necessarily occur.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07062768000145"></a>I have not made much of the slight anxiety that contestability&#151;when agencies may be pitted against each other&#151;may further undermine what we are suggesting; we seek to facilitate co-operation and ensure that it does indeed occur. After all, here we are. We all agree that this is an aspiration devoutly to be wished, but we want it to be more than an aspiration that may occur a great deal of the time. I understand that a lot of Part 1 is predicated on the assumption of co-operation. Ours is a simple, but crucial, added adjustment. It moves the Bill from the aspirational, and very often the real, to the obligatory. I simply cannot accept the possibility, suggested by the Minister, that the amendment would diminish the Bill and create divisions. This is an important core issue regarding how we all work together to make the Bill as good as it can be&#151;the duty to co-operate is an important element. Having said that, I seek the opinion of the House.</p>

At that time I proposed the removal of the word &#147;punishment&#148; from the principles of the Bill, as I did not think that punishment was the right word to apply to the activities of the Probation Service. During the discussion points were made by several noble Lords, which I have read and considered with great care. I read in particular the comments of the Minister. She said that she understood that punishment was included in the Bill because:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07062768000275"></a>&#147;Punishment is the sense of loss of liberty or other rights and freedoms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000258"></a>That was not the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, when Home Secretary, and others; which was that prison was punishment and that the deprivation of liberty was the punishment awarded by the court. It is not a sense of loss of liberty; it is an actual loss of liberty. A sentence is an actual thing, not a sense of something.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para10"></a>

</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000259"></a>I accept that punishment is an integral part of the sentence because it is the sentence. However, it is the sentence awarded by the courts, not the Probation Service. As many noble Lords pointed out, the duty of the Probation Service is to execute the order or sentence of the court. It is required to do that over a period awarded by the court, and it has to do it in a manner appropriate to the sentence, the crime that led to the sentence and the needs of the offender, which have to be worked out; hence, the whole basis of the offender management system&#151;end-to-end offender management based on the needs of the offender and aimed at rehabilitation.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07062768000281"></a>&#147;(c) the proper punishment of offenders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000264"></a>Those other four&#151;protection of the public, reduction of reoffending, ensuring offenders&#146; awareness and rehabilitation&#151;are aims and proper purposes for the Probation Service and are what it is all about; but punishment is not its role. If we are really being helpful in describing to people what probation is all about, we need to have a &#147;doing word&#148; that explains it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07062768000153"></a>I am grateful to those Members of the House who mentioned other words. The one that seems to me to fit the bill best is &#147;enforcement&#148;. That explains that there has got to be some enforcement of what the court says. This is not something to be treated lightly or wantonly; this is something that has to be done on behalf of the public to protect them, and it has to be done properly. What is it enforcing? It is enforcing the order of the court. The court determines that people come into the hands of the Probation Service. Therefore it seems to me that it is much better than having the wrong word &#147;punishment&#148; to have the right word &#147;enforcement&#148; of what it is that the court determines that the Probation Service should do. Again, because this is an important Bill and we hope that it has in it the proper description of what the management of offenders should be, and although we are playing with words, we should get those words right. These are the words that, having reflected on our discussion in Committee, I suggest to noble Lords are better than the word &#147;punishment&#148;, because they describe what is required and they refer to enforcement, which many noble Lords felt ought to be in the Bill. They emphasise that it is the courts which are responsible for the sentence that has to be enforced.</p>

It involves the substitution of &#147;the proper punishment of offenders&#148; with &#147;the proper enforcement of court orders&#148;. Simply, it reiterates the strongly held view of so many in the field as well as those speaking in Committee that the role of those working with offenders in the community or in prison is to see that the wishes of the court are carried out properly and are enforced. Those court orders, asthe noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, are the punishment, and it is the role of the court topunish. The principles underlying a sentence are the protection of the public, the reduction of reoffending, the needs of the victim, the awareness of the offender and rehabilitation. The responsibility for those in the community is to see that the court&#146;s wishes are adhered to and to facilitate their completion. If that fails, there is a return to court for a further decision on punishment. We would all be appalled if we found that probation officers or prison officers, or any other person working with offenders, had taken it on themselves personally to punish an offender.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07062768000159"></a>There is considerable confusion in the Bill in the use of aims, purposes and services. Indeed, there is a perception in the Probation Service that it and the public are confused about what its true purpose now is. Its core work had been to advise, assist and befriend, but that has developed as the years have gone by into a role that is now perceived to be much more to do with enforcement. This does not sit easily with those earlier values that many in the Probation Service still wish to adhere to.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07062768000160"></a>As an erstwhile social worker, though not a probation officer, I believe that unless we can not only restore but keep the true enabling, restoring and supportive role, predicated on a proper professional relationship in anyone providing probation services, we will be doing all of us a great disservice. For it is the belief in that capacity to change, for someone to move from being an offender to a citizen again, that makes possible the rehabilitation and the cessation of reoffending that we all earnestly desire.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07062768000161"></a>Part of that process is that officers do all in their power to ensure that the court&#146;s orders are carried out to a successful conclusion and, therefore, they are indeed the agent of the punishment imposed by the court. That is very clear. There is a fine line which distinguishes that role between the enforcer and the enabler, which is not merely semantics, but makes a difference between a humane, constructive and affirming role and the negative, counterproductive trend that we have started to see. This is evidenced by such things as the fourfold increase in breaches in the past five years, mechanistic processes and the concern of the Lord Chief Justice, for example, that the automatic recall of released offenders for technical breaches has become a &#147;trapdoor to prison&#148;, as he put it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07062768000162"></a>Punishment has indeed got its place, and we must never forget that.

I think that he is wrong&#151;we are working with words and words are hugely important in a Bill such as this. My inclination, subject to what the Minister will say, is to support the amendment, because it is important for the understanding by prisoners and probation officers and for the relationship between them.</p>

As most noble Lords who have been present throughout our proceedings will know, I was quite distressed by this mistake, as I would describe it, when it originally came up in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill in 2000. I protested then against the use of the word &#147;punish&#148;. I imagine that the reason it was introduced was to give the impression that everything was toughening up. It seems to me that it was a fantasy to think that the public reads Acts of Parliament to see that the Government are toughening up by putting in &#147;punish&#148; when it was not there previously. I am not sure that it had any effect whatever in making people think that things had toughened up. It always seemed improper to ask public servants to punish someone; that can be a role only of a court. Of course, &#147;punish&#148; is not what is actually meant, because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, said, I imagine that the Minister has no intention whatever that probation officers should start punishing people. If they were to do so, presumably they would be subject to some disciplinary action. All they can do is implement, administer and enforce orders passed in some judicial way.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07062768000165"></a>The use of the term confuses the offender, who is not sure what sort of person a probation officer is, and it confuses the probation officer, who is not sure what sort of person he or she should be. It also works against effectiveness and against helping people to give up crime. We know what helps people to give up crime: it is a close relationship with a supervisor who is respected by the supervised offender; it is rebuilding local links and giving a person a stake in everyday life; and it is giving that person an identity other than &#147;criminal&#148; of which he can be proud, such as &#147;worker&#148;, &#147;student&#148; or &#147;member of society&#148;.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07062768000166"></a>Since we started our debates on the Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has constantly talked about rehabilitation. I am certainly with him in sayingthat, if we could delete all instances of the words &#147;management of offenders&#148; and replace them with &#147;rehabilitation&#148;, the Bill would be much more evidence-based. Certainly, it would not include the word &#147;punishment&#148; as a function of probation officers. I very much support the amendment and I would not even object to the formulation of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, of &#147;implementation&#148; rather than &#147;enforcement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07062768000168"></a>I am opposed to the amendment, although I share the view that to some extent this is an argument about words. The subsection that we are looking at also refers to the protection of the public, the reductionof reoffending and the rehabilitation of offenders, which are all things that a sentence can be designedto achieve, but a sentence can also be designed to achieve what it is suggested should be taken out&#151;namely, the punishment of offenders.</p>

<a name="70627-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07062768000169"></a>I appreciate that others are arguing very differently but I think that it sends a wrong message to suggest that the Probation Service has nothing whatever to do with the punishment of offenders. The Probation Service is part of the criminal justice system, and punishment is part of that system and of sentences, in the same way as are seeking to achieve a reduction in reoffending, rehabilitation and protecting the public. Some may argue that penalties given by courts are basically about punishment. Doing unpaid work may have a rehabilitative effect but it is also a punishment that can be imposed. If we delete the reference to punishment of offenders from the clause, I think that we will send the wrong message about one of the roles of the Probation Service.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07062768000175"></a>I support the amendment because some years ago the Audit Commission brought out a report, <I>Misspent Youth</I>, which analysed the different ways in which a young offender could be rehabilitated in society. It came to the conclusion, which may not be surprising to your Lordships, but which was a point worth making and needs repeating, that the single most effective thing in restoring a young offender was for that young person to encounter an adult who believed in them. In my own work and ministry, I have seen that time and again, especially in the inner city. When young offenders meet an adult who believes in them, that becomes the path to restoration.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07062768000176"></a>The amendment is important because it points out the role of the new probation trusts in providing offenders with people who believe in them. Words in the end are important. I repeat that punishment is important&#151;it is at the heart of the Bill&#151;but, when describing the services of the probation trust and the people who work there, we need to emphasise the need to recruit people who believe in the potential of an offender to repent, to be restored and to be rehabilitated. Frankly, I worry about the sort of people who might be attracted to work for probation trusts because they see &#147;proper punishment of offenders&#148; as one of the five things that they are meant to do. That worries me and it is why I support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07062768000178"></a>It is difficult to counter many of the arguments that my noble friend Lord Rosser set out so clearly. I am genuinely puzzled about the amendment and why so many noble Lords are apprehensive about the word &#147;punishment&#148;. In my five years as chairman of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, I spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the issueof punishment and its contribution to changing behaviour and&#151;this is also worth bearing in mind&#151;how victims viewed punishment as part of the process of change.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07062768000179"></a>&#147;Punishment&#148; is certainly a word that enters into conversations between staff and offenders, whether they are young or old; we delude ourselves if we think that it is not. The dictionary meaning of the word encourages one to be a little less squeamish about it. The term embraces several concepts in the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>. My recollection is that the courts themselves tend to use dictionary meanings of words in their interpretation of the law. One concept of punishment is,</p>
<ul><a name="07062768000285"></a>&#147;infliction of a penalty in retribution for an offence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000265"></a>so there is some sense of paying back. Many of my conversations with victims and their families strongly suggest that there is some expectation of offenders facing consequences for their behaviour and making some kind of retribution or payback. That is often

<ul><a name="07062768000286"></a>&#147;unpleasant consequence ... experienced ... under specific conditions so that, through avoidance, the desired ... behaviour becomes established&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000266"></a>If that is not about rehabilitation and changing behaviour, I am not sure what is. I think that we all agree that the management of offenders should have trying to change behaviour at its heart, but that is an integral concept within the term &#147;punishment&#148;, too, as I have tried to show.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07062768000181"></a>The Government seem to have the words right in the Bill. The words &#147;proper punishment&#148; reflect an appropriate aim that the Secretary of State should have regard to. That is a more constructive aim than simply being an enforcer of a court order. The amendment would weaken, not strengthen, the role of probation staff, and the House would be wise not to go down that route.</p>

There is nothing more dreadful to a philosopher than to hear people say, &#147;It&#146;s just a word&#148;. The word&#146;s connotation is enormously important. The main point made by my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham is that there is an important distinction between issuing an order that someone be punished and ensuring that that punishment is properly carried out. The one is the role only of the courts; the other is a crucial element in the role of the probation officer.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07062768000183"></a>To overlook the ceremonial aspect of the word &#147;punish&#148;&#151;or &#147;make an order&#148;&#151;is to confuse the role of the probation officer with that of the judge, magistrate or court as a whole, who have the authority to issue a punishment. The probation officer, on the other hand, is being given the authority to ensure that that punishment is carried out. We need to bear that distinction in mind. It is enormously important both for the probation officer himself, as my noble friend Lady Stern has said, and for the criminal that they should understand the difference between the official issuing of the order and the person who is, perhaps to the sorrow of the criminal, ensuring that that order is carried out. That is a huge difference. Although the amendment obviously turns on one word, it is very important indeed.</p>

I understand, having heard the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Warner, that there is an underlying sense that they want to ensure that people do not think that non-custodial sentences are an easy option and therefore want the word &#147;punishment&#148;to be attached as closely as possible.

We will come back on a later amendment to the question of who is responsible for punishment and how it is carried out. It is a very important distinction in the role of the state and of those actors, public or private, who carry out the orders of the state. The Bill is intended to enable private actors to carry out some of those orders, but not, I suggest, to allow private actors to punish on behalf of the state, which would be improper. That is an important distinction, which we should not cross.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07062768000185"></a>When I read the Carter report, I understood that part of the problem of our currently overcrowded prisons was the failure to enforce fines. That seems to have been lost in all this. Part of what we are trying to do with the Bill is to provide non-custodial ways of enforcing court decisions. Reduction of offending should be a major part of this, and rehabilitation has to be part of that. Therefore, it seems to me that the language matters a great deal. The instructions that we are giving to the providers of probation are to enforce the decision and to promote rehabilitation; they are not to be the punishers.</p>

It carries within it a very important question of principle as to the relative functions of the courts and the Probation Service. The distinction between punishment and enforcement of court orders is very real. That should not be overlooked. Subject to that, I wholly agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, so I will not repeat them or risk spoiling them by paraphrasing them. I well understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that there is a difference between enforcement and implementation. But if one is better than the other, I believe that it is only by a whisker. I am perfectly content to go along with the word proposed in the amendment, which I support.</p>

The amendment has been discussed largely as though Clause 2(4) is a brief for probation officers. It is not. The wording of the Bill&#151;I hesitate to say so after a very eminent retired Law Lord has spoken&#151;indicates, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said, that this is a list of what the Secretary of State must have regard to when implementing the earlier part of Clause 2. He has to see to it that the arrangements that he makes for the Probation Service enable the proper punishment of offenders. That does not mean that probation officers are the punishers, but the arrangements in the clause add up to, among other things, the proper punishment of offenders. I shall listen to the reply to the Front Bench very carefully. I hope that when the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, replies, he will justify what he said in that context&#151;it is about the aims of the Secretary of State in implementing Clause 2, if I understand the clause correctly.</p>

That subsection was inserted into the Bill in another place at the request of my right honourable and honourable friends, and it repeats the drafting of a section in the first NOMS Bill, if we can call it that, which was published in January 2005.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07062768000189"></a>I do not intend to return to the detail of the arguments that I put in Committee, as that would be improper now that we are on Report, but I argued for the retention of the phraseology in the Bill as drafted. I accept of course that whatever one inserts into the Bill in the way of a list of aims or principles, as happens in subsection (4), there is bound to be a debate around the precise content of that list. That is something that the Opposition always like to do, much to the disbenefit of the Government, but it is a healthy way to hold the Government to account. It may be irritating to the Government, but it is what opposition is about&#151;trying to get at what is underneath the drafting of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07062768000190"></a>It has been important to have the debate again today. I have to say that I am unable to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for the simple reason that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, was very quick to point out in Committee, my honourable friend Mr Edward Garnier accepted the drafting of subsection (4) as it is in the context of Clause 2 on Report in another place. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07062768000287"></a>&#147;in respect of the amendment, I applaud the Minister&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000267"></a>he goes a bit far, does he not?&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07062768000288"></a>&#147;and wish him well in that part of his work&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/2/07; col. 1007.]</ul>
<p><a name="07062768000268"></a>We assented then; we do not dissent now. If the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, were minded to press the matter to a Division today, I should have to invite my noble friends to abstain.</p>

I listened with very great interest to the debate, which, as has been said, we have had before and at length. However, it falls to me to set out again the reasons why we cannot accept the amendment. I fully understand the spirit in which it has been moved and the purpose behind the debate. There was fair reflection from all sides of the House that one of the purposes of probation work is to ensure the effective carrying out of sentences and that those sentences rightly include punishment.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07062768000192"></a>As noble Lords will recall, the probation aims were added to the Bill, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, in response to requests made in Committee in another place. She was right to say that that was the case and right to insist on that clarity. As the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, pointed out, the Bill now places a duty on the Secretary of State to have regard to the aims in ensuring the provision of probation services. That is exactly why that part of the Bill is there.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_622"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 622</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70627-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07062768000193"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, stole my thunder, because I was going to quote back to your Lordships&#146; House the words of the Member for Harborough, Edward Garnier, in confirming the Opposition&#146;s view. I rather agree with the noble Baroness that applauding an amendment is a novel practice in Parliament and might be considered by some to be a bit over the top. Nevertheless, Edward Garnier made his position very clear and we are grateful to him for that.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07062768000194"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, picked out, the aims replicate the aims that currently apply to probation by virtue of Section 2 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The noble Baroness is entirely consistent: she did not like it then and she does not like it today. They are intended to define the core outcomes and the core work of probation. Of course, no list is ever perfect or complete, but the aims are very easily understood and have served their purpose well. When they were added to the Bill in the other place, there was no suggestion that it would be useful as a task to reopen them atthis stage.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07062768000195"></a>More fundamentally, it would be most unusualif the aims of the Probation Service, one of the linchpins of the criminal justice system, did not,as the amendment suggests, include the proper punishment of offenders. After all, society asks that those who have committed an offence should, as many noble Lords said during the debate, be properly punished. That is a well established concept. It has been set out in statute in the current probation aims going back to 2000 and as part of the purposes of sentencing in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07062768000196"></a>The concept of punishment fits into a wider context. Society also expects to be protected and expects offenders to be rehabilitated in order to reduce the likelihood that they will reoffend. That is why that is also included in the aims and in the purposes of sentencing. The aims reflect what society expects the criminal justice system to achieve and it is entirely right that probation providers should have regard to them when working to deliver the sentences passed by the courts.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07062768000197"></a>I also point out that the amendment is technically inaccurate. The enforcement of court orders is, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will understand, a function, not an aim. Indeed, the enforcement could play just as important a part in the protection of the public or in the rehabilitation of offenders as it could in the proper punishment of offenders, depending on the requirements of the order.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07062768000198"></a>I am grateful for what noble Lords have said in the debate. I hope that, having heard my very simple and straightforward reply, they will think again about whether they should push the amendment to a vote. We cannot agree with it, because it runs counter to all that we seek to achieve in the Bill and in earlier legislation.</p>

<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_623"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 623</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill. In fact, that is the total opposite of its intention. I am trying neither to weaken the provision nor to strengthen it, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, suggested; I am trying to explain the purpose of my amendment and to make it absolutely crystal clear who does what in the criminal justice system. I assure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool and the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that I am neither squeamish nor apprehensive about punishment, and never have been. I have, however, always been one of those who believe that punishment should be given by those who are responsible for giving it, and it should be absolutely crystal clear who those people are.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07062768000200"></a>I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, that I based my amendment on the title of clause, which is about the provision of probation services. That phrase is reflected in two other subsections, which refer to what the Secretary of State has to do in exercising his functions in relation to any &#147;probation provision&#148; by making and carrying out arrangements. I think that the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Warner, were talking about the aims of courts, not about the aims of probation. That is absolutely right: the aims of courts are the sentences. That is their job, but that is not the aim of the Probation Service. I am extremely grateful to my noble friend Lady Warnock for explaining so clearly the distinction between those two and for saying that the words do matter.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07062768000201"></a>I always listen with great respect to what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, says. I agree with him, as did other noble Lords, that there is precious little between implementation and enforcement. I came down in favour of enforcement here, because the word was used in our previous debate. If, as a result of what we decree this afternoon, this matter is taken away to be considered for further processing in the Bill, as Ihope, I would not object one bit if the word &#147;implementation&#148; were substituted.</p>

<a name="70627-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07062768000202"></a>However, the explanations of punishment that have been given do not stand up. They do not reflect the difference between the job of the courts and the job of probation. If the word &#147;punishment&#148; is related to the Probation Service, it does not help the service to do its work or people to understand what it does. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07062768000209"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall also speak to the remaining amendments in the group, which are all consequential on Amendment No. 4. I am grateful to the Probation Boards&#146; Association and the National Association of Probation Officers for their support, and I thank noble Lords who have added their names to the amendments. We return to the major bone of contention between these Benches and the Government that we were unable to resolve in Committee. We firmly believe that the power to commission probation services should be in thehands of local probation boards and trusts. My amendments seek to make that happen.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07062768000210"></a>The government system puts the power at the centre, with the Secretary of State. That denies the localism that we believe should be at the heart of service delivery. In Committee the Government sought to reassure us by arguing that most services would in fact be commissioned locally by lead providers operating within a framework agreed with the regional commissioner. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said there was not as much between us as I thought. I have looked very carefully at everything she

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07062768000211"></a>The Government&#146;s Bill clearly puts the power to commission services into the hands of the Secretary of State alone. He may delegate that power to others, but it is his choice, his power, to exercise as and when he chooses. There is no guarantee that he would delegate that authority, when he would do so or that he would do so in an appropriate manner which meets local needs. There is no guarantee that he will use his centralised power only if it can be shown first that local probation boards or trusts have failed in their own commissioning to ensure the satisfactory provision of probation services.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07062768000212"></a>All the Minister&#146;s assurances about delegation by the Secretary of State cannot disguise the simple fact that the Bill vests the power to commission services centrally, in the Secretary of State&#146;s hands. I was nearly caught out there, still thinking that this was one of the powers in the Home Office now moved to the Ministry of Justice. Let us see what powers remain at the Home Office tomorrow. Perhaps that will go too. Perhaps, like the DTI, it will go &#147;poof&#148; into thin air. Let us see what happens.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07062768000213"></a>We have redrafted our amendments since Committee to make our intentions even clearer. My amendments would vest the power of commissioning services in the local boards and trusts, but they ensure, too, that the Secretary of State would have a backstop power of commissioning where services would not otherwise properly be provided&#151;or, of course, he could provide the services himself. I hope that that will meet the concerns expressed earlier on Amendment No. 2 by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07062768000214"></a>Our proposed new clause to require probation trusts and boards to prepare plans also contains a scrutiny and backstop power for the Secretary of State. The trusts are required to produce a plan setting out what services they consider need to bemet during the forthcoming year, who will be commissioned to provide them and at what cost. If the Secretary of State considers that the trusts will not make sufficient provision of probation services, he can modify the trusts&#146; plan.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07062768000215"></a>We believe our amendments give the right balance between the importance of local commissioning and the need to give the Secretary of State the backstop power to step in if things go wrong. They would not hinder the roll-out of contestability; they would empower local probation trusts and boards to commission services that meet local needs. We prefer to see local decision-making wherever possible. In the context of probation provision, we believe it is both possible and preferable. I beg to move.</p>

I do not think that any of us&#151;I hope none of us&#151;is content with where we are; change is necessary. I think there is agreement, certainly with the main opposition Front Bench, that we need a wider diversity of supply and we need contestability in the system if we are to get better outcomes and results. I hope there is agreement that that requires innovation about how we deliver these goals. This will not be achieved by just doing more of what we are doing at present. Therefore, if there is substantial agreement, at least with the opposition Front Bench, on those elements of what the Bill needs to be about, the debate becomes one about means rather than ends: how do we get to a system thatis better at protecting the public and at reducing reoffending by better harnessing the diversity of supply and contestability and creating a culture where the existing deliverers rethink what they are doing to get better outcomes and better results?</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07062768000218"></a>The amendment is flawed because it will not lead to the shift of culture, thinking and role that is required to achieve these ends. It will not lead to significant use of the voluntary sector. It will not lead existing delivery bodies to realise that they have to think about how and when to use other suppliers, nor that their current processes may not be the most perfectly designed to get the required results. I say that for two reasons. First, we know it if we look at public service reform over the past 20 years. That is what happens to institutions; when they are required to make a significant shift, they usually do the minimum necessary to comply. It is as if the opposition Front Bench had said to local government in the 1970s, &#147;We won&#146;t have compulsory competitive tendering but we will have voluntary competitive tendering. We might do something about it if we thought what you did was unsatisfactory&#148;. Nothing much would have happened, and not enough would happen in this context if we passed an amendment like this. People would do the minimum necessary to avoid intervention by the Secretary of State. That matters a lot, because it would not reduce reoffending.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07062768000219"></a>Secondly, it would not be possible to have regional commissioning. I would have thought it was self-evident to most of us that there are a limited number of occasions when regional commissioning is in the interests of reducing reoffending. They will be few and far between, but there are occasions when you want to commission on a wider scale than the local, and you certainly want to be able to commission across the prison gate. The amendment is not likely to make that happen.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07062768000220"></a>The fundamental argument is the one of shift of culture. We would get incrementalism. We would get, largely, the status quo, and there would be lots of legalistic arguments about when the Secretary of State was justified in intervening. We will not shift culture, and I fear that this is in part a wrecking amendment, disguised in the seductive clothing of localism. For that reason I do not find it persuasive.</p>

However, the National Association of Probation Officers makes the point that crime is mostly local, and people expect the solutions to come locally. They will trust a local system much more than a central one. In fact, very often the local system worksbetter; of course it does&#151;we know the problemsat the moment&#151;but my noble friend&#146;s group of amendments includes a fallback position for the Secretary of State.

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07062768000222"></a>I do not want to keep referring to Scotland, but there is a basic assumption in the Scottish legislation that everything happens locally because the functions of the Probation Service are carried out by a department of local government, the social work department. There is no thought in Scotland of a central solution like this. That is much more likely to work. I see what the Government are trying to do; it is rather characteristic of them: &#147;If we give it to the Secretary of State, who, after all, is operating on behalf of the people, everything will be all right&#148;. I do not think it will. My noble friend has made a good compromise, in a way, in her group of amendments, giving the Secretary of State a fallback position. I hope the House will support this.</p>

Local services have had plenty of opportunities over the years to do allthese things. There has not been a great deal to stop them undertaking some of these changes. Some loosening-up changes were undertaken by the previous Government, who made provision for probation to commission more services from outside. We have to ask why it has not happened. We also have to consider&#151;as I considered very carefully&#151;when the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, thanked her supporters, that they would say that, wouldn&#146;t they? It is worth bearing in mind that some of these amendmentslook to some of us, who have been down this track in other areas, like classic public-sector protectionism. However one wraps it up, they have an underlying presumption, I suggest, in favour of public sector providers, rather than having the best person to do particular jobs.</p>

In meeting those needs, it may well be necessary to commission some specialist services&#151;a good example would be for sex offenders&#151;over an area that is much wider than that covered by the local trust or boards.

As in other parts of the public service, we need more contestability. The noble Baroness acknowledged the need for contestability, but her amendments would make that less likely and a wider range of service providers less likely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07062768000226"></a>To effect the changes, the Secretary of State&#146;s powers should not be fettered by these amendments. It is not a question of centralism versus localism. This is about the machinery that is more likely to effect change in circumstances about which there is a lot of dissatisfaction. It is naive to believe that, if this were left to the 42 local trusts, they would all embrace equally, firmly and enthusiastically the concept and principle of a mixed economy of providers. I am surprised that the party opposite, which has accepted contestability in other areas of public service provision, such as the NHS, seems here to be halting and inhibiting that development in criminal justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07062768000227"></a>A lot of honeyed words have been used during the passage of this Bill about the work of the Probation Service. I support much of its work and the way that many of its staff do an excellent job in extremely difficult circumstances. I spent two years as a Home Secretary&#146;s special adviser and five years as a chairman of the Youth Justice Board. That has given me an opportunity to see up close&#151;and not always comfortably&#151;the culture of some parts of the Probation Service. My noble friend Lord Filkin rightly drew attention to the issue of culture. That is at the heart of this matter. There is a tendency in some parts of the Probation Service to look inwards defensively, and then turn aside from involving outsiders. Some of us have actually seen that in action. It is a sad fact of life.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07062768000228"></a>I find it interesting that ACEVO supports the model in this Bill. The voluntary sector has sometimes been on the receiving end of that culture where it has got&#151;and, in some cases, has developed&#151;good services that will benefit offenders but has been thwarted in its attempts to make them available. That is in a culture of localism.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07062768000229"></a>This is not an attack on the Probation Service, but it is a strong urging to leave the structure of the Bill as it is on commissioning if we really want to see a mixed economy of providers which will deliver the kind of services that we all acknowledge many offenders need.</p>

Part of the thrust of government policy through successive Governments over the past 30 years has been to remove autonomy and the power to innovate from local authorities and give it to the centre. I hope that we may be shifting away from that centralist drive to a period in which local interests and diversity are allowed. If we are to move to a wide diversity of supply&#151;to quote, I hope accurately, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin&#151;we need the diversity of supply which comes from partnerships with local voluntary organisations, and I stress the word &#147;local&#148;.

This point has already been made but there are examples that I may highlight later about innovative specialist services, particularly those provided by the third sector, which often go beyond what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred to as local. We come back to the point about referring to the third and voluntary sector as though it exists only locally. It can exist locally and nationally, as my organisation can testify. These specialist services often need to be delivered on a more regional basis and we need to allow for that. They could be delivered on a regional, or in some cases, national level.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07062768000237"></a>In this debate, there has often been a tendency to talk as if what matters is the sector that an organisation comes from. People have enthused about the private sector and public sector ethos and mentioned the third sector and the voluntary sector in terms of our ability to engage with service users. While there may be some evidence to support some of the characteristics present in those sectors, such an approach is far too simplistic. Each sector is very diverse with organisations demonstrating good and bad practice. Commissioners need to have the strength and freedom to commission services from the right provider for the job, no matter what sector they come from. Any presumption in favour of one sector limits that freedom, which would therefore mean that the best service for the offender and the public is not necessarily being commissioned. Public services are just that: services for the public.</p>

<a name="70627-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07062768000238"></a>What matters is getting the best service to reduce reoffending not which sector provides it. Often, the right approach is to work in partnership across the sectors to make the most of all the talents. In case there is any doubt about where I stand on this, I want to place on record my respect for the excellent work undertaken by probation officers who work for the Probation Service, many of whom already work in partnership with my own staff at Turning Point and other organisations throughout the third and voluntary sector providing substance misuse services as part of community sentences in places such as Somerset and Sheffield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07062768000239"></a>I understand that some concerns have been raised about the ability of the third sector and voluntary sector to deliver what is required of it. I want to finish with some examples so that we can move on from the issue of the third sector and voluntary sector as part of a mixed economy. They show what is already being achieved by my own organisation and others from the voluntary sector that are working in partnership with probation services throughout the country to deliver substance misuse treatment as part of sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07062768000241"></a>Unfortunately, the way in which services are currently structured means that the third sector has often played a rather limited role in the provision of probation services. The amendments would retain those limits rather than allowing commissioners the freedom to get the best service for the offender and the community. The third sector is not asking for special treatment. Third sector organisations should have to prove alongside other organisations that they can do the job as should statutory and independent providers. Nevertheless, to get the best and most innovative services, commissioners need to look at every sector, and all providers should have the opportunity to demonstrate what they can do to improve the system.</p>

We passed the costs upwards to the Treasury. Usually, the Treasury did not give enough to provide what was needed to match those tasks. You went through what was called a basket weaving exercise where you looked at all these tasks and at what was desirable, essential or nice to have to do them. You then presented Ministers with a series of options, explaining that because this was the only resource that you had, these were the options. You asked, &#147;Which ones, Oh Minister, are you going to take and which are you going to give up?&#148;.</p>

So when they said that prison cost X and so much per year, what they meant was what it cost per prisoner out of what they had been given. But they did not calculate the difference between what they had and what they needed. Exactly the same is true of probation. You have only to ask the chief officers of probation about this. In

First, she makes provision for that sort of basket weaving exercise to take place in the form of a plan in which the Secretary of State, and everyone else who needs to be, is involved. It includes working out the cost of what is needed. That will have to go to the Treasury. If the Treasury does not give you the money, there is no point in planning to do something when you cannot get the resources. Secondly, in the event of failure, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment proposes a new clause to make certain that there is a machinery to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07062768000247"></a>Everything else that we are discussing has nothing to do with whether it is public, private or voluntary sector provision: it is all about the reality of enabling probation staff to do the task&#151;the rehabilitation of offenders&#151;which this Bill is all about. Therefore, I could not support these amendments more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07062768000249"></a>These new amendments seem to me to be a model of clarity, but they also reaffirm the crucial distinction in the argument between the Government&#146;s position, which is that the primary accountability and statutory duty for commissioning is upwards, in the hands of the Secretary of State, and the position in these amendments&#151;that the primary power should lie with local boards or trusts, that they should prepare plans for the year, and that needs can best be identified and met locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07062768000250"></a>The amendments also give the Secretary of State a backstop power to commission services should a trust fail to do so or where there is a gap. But successful commissioning&#151;commercial or in the public sector&#151;is always best close to the business. However, to refer to what the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, said, local commissioning does not mean that there should be any restriction on which sector these services can be commissioned from. It is not exclusive, because the power lies locally, and the noble Lord described that it is already the case. The Government argue that because historically boards have not contracted out more than 3 per cent or so to other providers&#151;although the figure was higher before 2001&#151;the commissioning responsibility and power should be transferred to the Secretary of State, presumably via the ROMS. The Minister has said that there can be national, regional and local commissioning, but the issue is where the commissioning authority and power lie.</p>

We pointed that out in Committee. We are all agreed that to commission a wider range of providers from the voluntary sector and the private sector alike is highly desirable. But if we assume that best value in terms of quality will continue to be the guiding principle in reducing reoffending, we will not see a great difference, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has pointed out, in results from the commissioning process unless and until significantly more funds are made available so that there will be a real widening of the pool of available interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07062768000252"></a>We understand that there is a place for central and regional commissioning for particular services. The service of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, isa good case in point. However, the retention of commissioning power locally&#151;which is where,after all, the overwhelming proportion of offending originates&#151;not only links local needs for offender management with available provision but, crucially, creates and develops local confidence in that provision. That lies at the heart of greater community sentencing, which in turn is partly a solution to prison overcrowding. Above all, end-to-end offender management must be coherent, clear, enforceable and responsive to local needs. That is precisely what local boards represent. It is also what a recent YouGov poll shows that the public want; we on these Benches want it as well. We support the amendment.</p>

I am utterly committed to local services where local services are appropriate. I understand the way in which the wording of the amendment has been put&#151;to try to ensure that the Secretary of State can intervene when other services need a more centralised service. It is for very different reasons from those that I oppose the amendment; I think that it is all about change. It is about ensuring that the services we have on the ground are much more effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07062768000254"></a>The noble Baroness said that the Probation Service had been meeting its targets. I have some questions about the targets that are met, when we all know that reoffending is going up. What are the targets? Have the Government set the right targets? That is the challenge that I would put if the targets are being met and reoffending is increasing. Something significantly different needs to happen in the behaviour of the services on the ground. The argument for the mixed economy has been made, and the Liberal Democrat and Conservative Benches have said that that is not an issue in this debate; but I believe that it is. As the noble Lord, Lord Warner, pointed out, there has always been the capacity for this change, and it has not taken place.</p>

I want to go back to the issue of the delivery of services at a local level. I, too, speak from experience of having to work to change the culture in two large organisations. One was the Meat Hygiene Service and its veterinary provision and the other is the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. One of the big issues about change is compliance, and learning good experience and good practice from other regions. If you work only from the local level, you lose those things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07062778000002"></a>When I went into CAFCASS, there was some good practice around the country. Compliance with what was needed to change the system to ensure that more children could be dealt with was nil. Compliance needs to be clear across the country, because that is how you can make better use of resources. I would like to argue for more resources for all the services that I am involved in&#151;I do&#151;but I know that resources are finite and the only way to make better use of them is by changing the way that people work. That is why I hope that we will be able to move forward in a better way that changes services, gives greater direction when those services are not being changed, allows successful probation trusts to be innovative, and allows them to be able to work from probation trust to probation trust with the help of the centre to develop regional services of the kind that I know cannot be delivered locally. Then we will have a service to be proud of.</p>

I base my view on what happens at present and I do not share the view that probation boards and probation trusts will, in fact, involve the voluntary sector and others in developing and expanding services. Their approach to date shows that there does not seem to be too much enthusiasm for doing that. If we were to pass an amendment that in reality gives them continuing power to make those decisions, we will not make progress. It is interesting that, as I understand it, the voluntary sector, the CBI and the Local Government Association support the measures in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07062778000007"></a>I appreciate what has been said about a backstop power as far as the Secretary of State is concerned, but it is very vague. The amendment does not really say under what precise circumstances or against what criteria it might be used. Frankly, one can see that if this power were to be introduced there would simply be endless arguments as to whether the situation had been reached where the Secretary of State was justified under that proposal to intervene.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07062778000008"></a>I am afraid that I share the view expressed just now that the amendment is a call for the status quo. That is what it is in reality&#151;it is leaving decision-making on commissioning greater involvement of the voluntary sector with those who have not done it until now, and there is no indication that their views might change. The Bill and the changes being made are about a change in culture and about indicating that thereis an alternative&#151;there are alternative providers and providers who may be able to expand, develop and improve services. If you want that kind of increased involvement and development, you do not handover responsibility for achieving it to boards which, the figures and records suggest, have not been particularly good at doing so until now.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07062778000009"></a>This cannot be a debate about what might be in the interests of a probation board&#146;s association. Surely we are talking about what is in the interests of addressing reoffending, and that must be to involve as many people as possible in the voluntary sector and elsewhere who can contribute, develop and assist with programmes in that regard.</p>

However, the noble Baroness&#146;s point is very important if, as is her view&#151;and she may well be right&#151;the threat of this Bill is producing a change. The Bill provides that the commissioning will be done not by the probation boards or probation trusts but by commissioners. However, if you remove the role of the commissioners and give it back to the probation boards and probation trusts, on the noble Baroness&#146;s own argument, you remove the incentive which she is now applauding.</p>

They say that there is a real risk that local voluntary sector groups would lose out in the commissioning process to large national organisations. Indeed, the Government&#146;s model for the voluntary sector has been strongly criticised by the Charity Commission on the ground that charities are being put at risk by a growing dependency on poorly funded contracts to deliver public services. The probation officers&#146; organisation therefore supports the amendment because it believes that, if enacted, it would ensure that probation boards and trusts, which have detailed knowledge of local areas, would be responsiblefor commissioning.</p>

A whole range of your Lordships have worked with such organisations in one capacity or another. Support for localism&#151;witha lot of the work being carried out at a local level&#151;certainly does not mean that there is not total confidence in national and regional organisations playing their part. There is concern that the smaller voluntary organisations will lose out in the process because of the greater bargaining power, staffing and so on of the larger organisations. But we are also talking about ownership of what goes on in a local area&#151;the ownership of the people who live thereand the contributions that they can make to the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07062778000015"></a>I could not agree more with what the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, said about the approach of the Probation Service. It is now much more in favour of seeing commissioning happening at a local level where appropriate, and of course it should be available at national and regional levels, if appropriate, for certain specialist services. If the Probation Service has been encouraged in that view by the introduction of the Bill, that is good. This is very much a local issue. There may be a need for national or regional areas of support as well but we must encourage local areas, with appropriate resources being put in their direction, to take ownership in the genuine rehabilitation of offenders. I certainly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07062778000019"></a>This has been a very important debate on the fundamental issue concerning the proposals inPart 1&#151;that is, where the responsibility for commissioning probation services should lie&#151;and it follows on from debates that we had in Committee.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07062778000020"></a>We have heard some extraordinarily powerful speeches. A number of them came from my noble friends Lord Filkin, Lord Warner and Lord Rosser, the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. But those who are concerned also made fine points. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, raised some interesting points, as did the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, and my noble friend Lady Turner, together with the contribution from the noble Baroness,Lady Howe.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07062778000021"></a>Perhaps I may get us to the essential position, which was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale. These provisions are about not only the service providers but the people who use the services, both victims and offenders. I listened very carefully and was interested in how many people spoke of the latter, as opposed to those who provide the service. We need to concentrate on the victims and offenders who are in need and, as my noble friend Lord Warner said, we need to look at how we can shape things to meet their needs most appropriately.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07062778000022"></a>I recognise that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has reviewed the amendments that she tabled earlier and that she has presented a more streamlined set for us to consider now. I also recognise that some of the technical deficiencies have been tidied up. However, some significant ones remain&#151;not least the continued references to both trusts and boards, which simply do not work alongside one another under the arrangements in Part 1. But I should like to focus on the policy.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07062778000023"></a>What is the set of amendments before us designed to achieve? As I understand it, the noble Baroness supports the principle of commissioning and contestability. Her amendments do not, therefore, seek to challenge this principle but to make the probation trust the lead commissioner of probation services. However, that is exactly what the Government&#146;s proposals do. We have made it clear that we do not intend regional commissioners acting on behalf of the Secretary of State to hold myriad contracts directly with a range of providers. Instead, regional commissioners will have contracts with lead providers at the area level. Those lead providers will in practice be a probation trust at the outset. Noble Lords will recall that we have committed to contracting only with the public sector for offender management for three years, and that court work will remain with the public sector indefinitely and could be removed only by a positive endorsement by both Houses. I cannot emphasise enough how much I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, when he says that this is not &#147;and/or&#148; but should be &#147;and/and&#148;. It is a false premise to believe that we have to choose between local, regional and national. On occasion, national will be necessary because of the specialised services; on occasion, regional will be the most efficacious because of the need to build capacity; but on the  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_639"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>majority of occasions, local will be absolutely essential because it will respond more appropriately to identified need.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07062778000024"></a>Lead providers will be responsible for commissioning services locally, and the Secretary of State will delegate many of the functions for co-operating with other agencies to them. For example, in relation to local area agreements it will be the lead provider&#151;the local provider&#151;to whom the Secretary of State will delegate the task of negotiating and delivering local improvement targets. The pre-eminent position of local commissioning is clear.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07062778000025"></a>Why then do the Government object to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay? The truth is that these amendments do not place local commissioning in a wider context or provide a clear framework of accountability within which it can operate. Though the noble Baroness supports the greater involvement of other providers, her amendments provide no levers to ensure that this happens. It is important to look at the question raised by my noble friend Lord Rosser in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Why have they not been more involved before? That was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. Why are they more involved now? How do we sustain that engagement? The levers are therefore incredibly important.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07062778000026"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendments rely almost entirely on probation trusts deciding for themselves which services to deliver direct and which to sub-contract&#151;an arrangement that has led to 96 per cent of services being delivered in-house. The amendment is entirely unclear on the basis for the Secretary of State&#146;s intervention. He may commission services from others or deliver them himself, &#147;If it appears to&#148; him,</p>
<ul><a name="07062778000091"></a>&#147;that sufficient provision ... is not being, or will not be, made&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07062778000074"></a>by probation trusts or boards. I ask the question that was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale: on what basis and when is he to make this decision, and where does the ultimate statutory duty lie? What are the lines of accountability between the trust and the Secretary of State? What levers does the Secretaryof State have to raise performance of the trustaside from the blunt instrument of commissioning elsewhere? All this is unclear.</p>

<a name="70627-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07062778000027"></a>The Government&#146;s approach, I respectfully suggest, is coherent in this regard. It places the statutory duty with the Secretary of State, who then commissions the majority of services through a lead provider&#151;a lead local provider. It provides, through the contracting process, levers to encourage trusts to involve other partners and to raise performance across the board. It gives flexibility for the Secretary of State to commission some services on a regional basis or across the prison and probation divide. He may do that not only in response to poor performance by the local trust, which is the implied ground for intervention in the opposition amendment, but where consultation and a needs assessment indicate that this is appropriate and merited. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, reminded us in Committee that local commissioning is not always best, especially where

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07062778000028"></a>Where there is poor performance, the Government&#146;s approach enables the Secretary of State, in due course, to look for other providers in the public, private or voluntary sectors who are better able to deliver. Before I conclude, I draw to the attention of the House the widespread support for our proposals&#151;support which has been alluded to in part already. The voluntary sector, as your Lordships have heard, supports our proposals. ACEVO&#151;the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations&#151;is the professional body for the third sector&#146;s chief executives and has more than 2,000 members. It has issued briefing to your Lordships for Report, which I have had the privilege to look at, and which I am sure noble Lords in this debate have seen too. I shall read it out for those who may not yet have had that advantage. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07062778000077"></a>&#147;We do not believe that the amendments discussed during the Committee stage of the Bill, allowing probation trusts to retain commissioning responsibility, would provide the catalyst needed to increase the role of the third sector. Without structural change, there is no reason to believe that the current small proportion of services which are contracted to the third sector should grow&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70627-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07062778000029"></a>I need to reply to my noble friend Lady Turner because she raised a question on whether allowing more statutory contracting to take place from the public sector would somehow dilute or diminishthe position. ACEVO does not believe that a great proportion of an organisation&#146;s income coming from statutory contracts compromises independence orwill have that effect. The private sector supports our proposals. I must say that it is perplexing to find noble Lords opposite not supporting business, but there we are. Things change in this world. The CBI has also issued briefing for Report, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07062778000078"></a>&#147;The Bill&#146;s proposals to introduce diversity of provision will capitalise on the best each sector and each provider has to offer. This should deliver a more joined-up approach, giving hard working probation staff more support in delivering the best rehabilitation services possible&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70627-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07062778000030"></a>The LGA supports these proposals. In its briefing produced for Second Reading, it set out how we had agreed to meet its concerns about councillors on probation trusts and local area agreements. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07062778000079"></a>&#147;If the Bill is amended in this way&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="07062778000092"></a>&#147;the Local Government Association believes that it would address our concerns about local accountability. We believe that these amendments would complement the positive proposals contained within the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07062778000031"></a>While I acknowledge that there are still concerns, the public sector Probation Service is embracing the change too. We invited 35 of the existing 42 probation boards to express an interest in forming part of the first wave of trusts in April 2008. Only the seven probation boards classified as poor performers were not eligible to apply. Out of those 35 boards, nearly two-thirds expressed an interest in becoming trustsin April. That is an impressive indicator of the commitment to change in the service. Many of the very best boards are already working in the way we

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07062778000032"></a>The bottom line is that the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, do not deliver what she wants and are instead, I regret to say, a recipe for confusion&#151;something that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, but for different reasons. I submit that the Bill delivers what the House wants&#151;local commissioning but with genuine opportunity for increasing the involvement of other providers, set within a clear framework of accountability. That is why I cannot accept these amendments as a way forward. I acknowledge that, looking at what the Government proposed 18 months ago and the paper to which the noble Baroness referred in earlier discussions, these proposals are very different. The reason for that is because we listened and worked with local government, the public and private sectors, and the not-for-profit third sector. Those three sectors are now conjoined in the belief that what the Government have arranged and settled with them is the best way forward. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment and to agree with us that we now have an arrangement which will work.</p>

Of course, it is tempting to respond to each and every person, but that would be wrong. The arguments put forward today were covered at great length in Committee and it is the nature of Report that one does not return to them. I appreciate that few of those who have spoken today were with us in Committee, but I am sure that they will have read <I>Hansard</I> avidly and seen the rebuttals that took place on that occasion.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07062778000034"></a>The amendments in my name allow for national and regional commissioning by the Secretary of State where it is appropriate for that to happen. They enable contestability to be rolled out in a way that we believe is satisfactory. Throughout Committee, noble Lords across the Committee expressed their concern about how the Government were trying to roll out contestability. We do not feel that the Government have made an effective case for the way in which they wish to roll it out.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07062778000035"></a>The Government have maintained throughoutthat contestability is only safe in the hands of the Secretary of State. No, it is not. There lies the difference between us. These amendments deliver what we on these Benches want. We want local people to have the power to commission probation services that will serve the local needs of local people well. They have a clear objective: trust people. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07062778000080"></a> Clause 3, page 3, line 21, after &#147;arrangements&#148; insert &#147;for co-operation&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70627-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07062778000040"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the United Nations and other international institutions there is often a provision for an explanation of vote. I have been anxious to have an opportunity&#151;this relates directly to the amendment&#151;to explain why I supported the Government on Amendment No. 2. I supported them because I was convinced that the dynamic is there for co-operation and because my noble friend was extremely persuasive in arguing that the whole principle of co-operation and partnership is central to everything the Bill is about.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07062778000041"></a>I suppose that if I had any degree of anxiety, it would be&#151;one that I have expressed before&#151;how far that genuine intent of Ministers is institutionally shared to the full everywhere that it should be shared. I say to my noble friend that the purpose of my amendment is to give substance to what she argued so well. If the whole cause of co-operation and partnership is central to the Bill and everything it is about, it seems a bit peculiar that when it comes to the making of contracts and agreements we just talk about provision.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07062778000042"></a>We need to support my noble friend in ensuring that the words are in the Bill to make it explicitly clear what these agreements and partnerships are about. It seems not altogether impossible that as time goes by&#151;and this tends to happen in life&#151;bureaucracy reasserts itself. There will be those who see the relationship with, for example, the voluntary sector, as the sub-contracting arrangement; that it isabout encouraging voluntary organisations to gear themselves to be effective, efficient and more economic providers of service than the Government are able to be. We have heard both in Committee and this afternoon that that is not the intention of the Government; the intention of the Government is to engage these people.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07062778000043"></a>I have some difficulties with the phrase &#147;third sector&#148;. I did not ever feel when I was director of Oxfam that I was director of part of the &#147;third sector, I believed that I was director of Oxfam. That is something very different; and I will obviously not go into it now. We need to be very clear, and fair to everybody, that these contracts and agreements are about what the Minister has emphatically assured us is her intention, the purpose of the Government and central to the Bill. From that standpoint, I hope that the Government will at least feel able to take this point seriously and see how it might be met. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07062778000045"></a>Listening to our debates today, it seems to me that two visions of the Bill are running at the same time. I suppose that one could say that it is about A or B, and then we would all be happy. The first vision is about co-operation and partnership. We have heard a great deal about that from the Government Front Bench, from the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, which is supported by everyone involved in these discussions. That is obviously the only way to achieve what we all want: the rehabilitation of offenders. It is hard to see how that can be done without co-operation and partnership.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07062778000046"></a>Then there is another vision of the Bill, which is probably in the forefront of the minds of the noble Lords, Lord Filkin and Lord Warner, who have spoken a lot today, which is that the Bill will introduce competition and contestability, which is in their view the basic way to get a good outcome.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07062778000047"></a>I am not sure that those two approaches are compatible. Presumably, one will win out over the other. On that basis, I support the noble Lord, Lord Judd, because he suggests that version 1, or vision 1, should win out. I very much agree, because it seems to me the only way in which we shall achieve the objective of rehabilitating offenders and having a safer society. I am very happy to have added my name to the amendment and to support it.</p>

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="07062778000048"></a><b><a name="70627-0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07062778000418"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I was not going to speak on this amendment, because I did not think that there was anything contentious in it until I heard my noble friend's speech. In my vision, these things work together. It is one vision: the vision of a service where the best wins out for those for whom the service is there&#151;as the noble Baroness said, for those to whom it is delivered, those who need to enjoy a better life and not go back to prison. I think that those two things can go hand-in-hand.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07062778000049"></a>I am sure that Members on the Conservative Benches&#151;I am careful not to say the Benches opposite, even though they sit opposite, because I am a Cross-Bencher; it is a difficult language&#151;accept that competition often brings out the best. It can bring out the worst, if it is competition for the cheapest. We have been assured by the Government that they are not looking for the cheapest and some of us will be holding them to all that they have said about quality services. I hope that those two things can go hand-in-hand because that is what co-operation and work in the service is about.</p>

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="07062778000050"></a><b><a name="70627-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07062778000419"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, there may be some differences among us over how commissioning will work&#151;I was reflecting on that point during our previous debate. I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, in that I think that there is a good deal of crossover in those visions. I do not see them as being in contradistinction to each other or in conflict. There is certainly a shared commitment to ensure the best possible outcome&#151;I do not mean that in straight financial terms but in terms of what we are trying to  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_646"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 646</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve, which is to reduce reoffending. So I take issue with the noble Baroness on that.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07062778000051"></a>I certainly do not take issue with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is trying to make in this amendment and an earlier one, when we discussed the need for co-operation. It is a point which we debated at some length in Committee. The noble Lord then proposed that we should extend the definition of &#147;contractual arrangements&#148; to include the concept of negotiated partnerships. The amendment suggests instead that the contractual arrangements are made &#147;for co-operation&#148; with any other person for the making of probation provision.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07062778000052"></a>Understandably, the noble Lord asked us to go away to think of some more imaginative wording for this subsection. Perhaps we have not risen to the thesaurus challenge, and I will have to disappoint him. I say that with some sadness because I know that he feels that the term &#147;contractual arrangements&#148; does not reflect the holistic and co-operative approach that is necessary for the successful management of offenders..</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07062778000053"></a>Those are important points and I thank the noble Lord for making them again in his customary courteous, effective and forceful way. The reason why we have to draw a line and not agree with him is this. The legislation needs to be as clear and precise as we can possibly make it. The provision in Clause 3(2) achieves just that, setting out very clearly that the Secretary of State may make contractual or other arrangements with any other person for the making of the probation provision. The problem with adding a concept like &#147;co-operation&#148; is that it adds ambiguity, and, as we know, ambiguity does not make for good legislation.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07062778000054"></a>What I can say&#151;I hope that this will reassure the noble Lord; it certainly should&#151;is that we will reflect the spirit of his amendment and what he wants to achieve in the guidance for implementing the Bill. It is more properly located there, because the guidance is about the feel, the quality, the material way in which the legislation will be implemented. It will also describe better, in more sensitive language, how we contract with providers. That is a better way to achieve his goal, and is how the relationship with providers will be established and developed.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07062778000055"></a>Because we are in a contracting arrangement does not mean that there will not be co-operation. There will have to be co-operation; it is essential. That means that we need co-operative forms of working. All those things can be the subject of contractual description, and so on, and that is where the guidance will aid and assist us.</p>

<a name="70627-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07062778000056"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will accept my assurance that we understand what he is trying to achieve. We certainly want to reflect the spirit of what he proposes but for good reasons of ensuring that we have the right phraseology in legislation, we cannot support the amendment. I am grateful to the noble Lord for having raised it and for making his customary contribution as he has.</p>

If there is one very juicy contract to let and five little ones, and six organisations in an area, how do you make the six organisations work together and co-operate when they are all fighting for the one juicy contract and do not want the five little ones?</p>

I should have thought that where there is a lot of contractual talent out there, the process will enable and facilitate working together, perhaps by the bringing together of a joint bid where that is appropriate, so that those services can be linked up and provided in one contract, rather than having small groups fighting each other for the contract.

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07062778000061"></a>I thank the Minister for his characteristically considerate response. I remain anxious that, if the whole Bill is about co-operation, it does not specify in precise language what the contracts and agreements with particular organisations are about. They are about co-operating with government, not only about co-operating with each other. Co-operating with government means that they are not only service deliverers. Of course we want the greatest possible cost-effectiveness, but co-operation is also about the development of policy and listening to organisations when contracts are being made and saying to them, &#147;Now look, this is the objective. We are considering you as an organisation with which we would like to co-operate because of your hands-on experience and your policy experience, and because we value your input&#148;. Simply using this cold language about a contract or an agreement to provide a service does not underline all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07062778000069"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we tabled Amendment No. 8 because representations had been made to us that a number of non-governmental organisations find overwhelming the vast and complex forms that accompany the bidding process, and that this is a barrier to the sort of mixed economy that we would like. The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, talked about two visions for the Bill. I think that there are two visions for the public service. One, which I have heard from a number of people on the new Labour Benches, is for an American-style process of contracting out, but without the great benefits to the United States of its very sharp decentralisation to

England is the most centralised country in the democratic world. That is partly why we want structural change; so that we can move away from that.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07062778000070"></a>We have a different vision, which is based very much on the Nordic model of a mixed economy. I wish that we had more evidence-based studies of how well that model operates. It operates very locally and very effectively, and I note that 60 to 70 per cent of the population votes in local elections in Norway. There are no obstacles to structural change there, and no centralised governments having to impose on Conservative local authorities.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07062778000071"></a>Nor do we share the concept of a monolithic third sector, co-ordinated by the director-general of the third sector and the Cabinet Office, which means that only very well funded large-scale non-governmental organisations can manage the complex biddingand negotiation process. We therefore wanted to emphasise that, if one has an effective mixed economy, we must treat the private sector&#151;the for-profit sector&#151;and the voluntary sector rather differently. Through the amendment, we want to tease from the Government how they will handle that.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07062778000072"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, for her letter on this point. We received it just as the debate was starting, so we have not yet had the chance fully to absorb it. However, I note that, under the heading &#147;Contracts&#148;, it says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07062778000090"></a>&#147;This is still a draft list ... We are consulting at the moment ... Draft contracts have been shared with Probation Boards via the Probation Boards&#146; Association&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07062778000076"></a>It would therefore be appropriate at this stage for us not to press the amendment, but perhaps to return to it at Third Reading. However, we ask the Government to recognise very clearly that if we are to have the sort of mixed economy that we on these Benches want, retaining the autonomy and diversity of the not-for-profit sector&#151;and, indeed, helping that sector to develop rather than moving towards the sort of private sector national provision which the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Filkin, seem to prefer&#151;we need to know rather more about the contracting process and how we will handle these different not-for-profit and for-profit providers.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, for indicating already that he does not intend to press it to a vote at this stage, and that there is time for reflection. He is right that this is an important issue. I tried to explore it in part in Committee on 5 June&#151;at col. 1100 of the <I>Official Report</I>&#151;when I spoke to my Amendment No. 82. I wanted the Government to put clearly on the record how they would expect contracts with charities to be drawn up, and to say whether the same type of contractual conditions would be applied to both private companies and not-for-profit organisations. In response, the Minister confirmed that the Government would be able to apply penalties to third sector organisations if they failed to meet their contractual obligations. He implied that contracts would be basically the same for both private companies and not-for-profit organisations. Noble

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07062792000004"></a>I returned to the issue on the last day in Committee, on 12 June, when we debated the commencement amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I asked why the Government had not yet put draft model contracts before the House and whether they would do so before Report. We heard nothing more until today, the first day on Report, when the Minister&#146;s office delivered to us on these Benches and the House what appears to be a very full series of documents, in the region of 25 pages, on service specifications, drafts for consultation and service level agreements. I appreciate that there may be very useful and interesting information here, but it will not take anyone by surprise when I say that, whereas the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, says that he has not looked at &#147;too much&#148; of it, I have looked at virtually none of it because of the other amendments to which I have been speaking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07062792000005"></a>It is important that we resolve the issue of how not-for-profit organisations are likely to be treated. The process of awarding contracts must be carried out in such a way that it does not put the third sector at a disadvantage and does follow the principles of best value in the commissioning and delivery of services. Both of those principles work for the public good and the good of the not-for-profit sector.</p>

It makes extremely clearly on behalf of the sector the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. Welcoming, as we all do, that the Bill has the potential to enable the professional third sector to play a much more significant role in delivering services to offenders&#151;and hear, hear to that&#151;ACEVO states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07062792000098"></a>&#147;There is significant work to be done to ensure that the market is designed in a way which will allow third sector organisations the opportunity to play to their strengths&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07062792000096"></a>One way of doing that is to:</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07062792000009"></a>Secondly, it will be important for private sector organisations to be able to build into their bid not only fair rates of pay for those who will be working for them but a quality service to the clients or customers of the service, while allowing that the private sector needs ultimately to make a profit. Thirdly, some quite difficult considerations may arise when probation services themselves are bidding.Will they, for example, be obliged not to put in a loss-making bid?</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07062792000010"></a>Those are examples of the kinds of practical problems that will inevitably occur. The Government may say that they will cover them in guidance, but another way of dealing with them is to have them as footnotes to a model contract.</p>

<a name="07062792000011"></a><b><a name="70627-0009.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07062792000119"></a>Baroness Stern:</b> My Lords, I have a couple of remarks on the important issues raised about contracting with the voluntary sector. I am particularly concerned about what it means for what I would call civil-society organisations. I am not talking about the big-business-like organisations that belong to ACEVO, write briefs to people in the House of Lords and know what they are about. I am talking about the small organisations that have a moral, ethical or religious reason for wanting to do something to make society better in their own way and for wanting to do something different&#151;for example, people connected with churches who do circles of accountability with sex offenders. It is incredibly difficult work that only very dedicated people will do. There are organisations made up of people who used to be involved in abusing drugs who then want to help other young people to get off drugs. </p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07062792000012"></a>In the world I used to inhabit&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred before leaving the Chamber&#151;people like that got grants, because those who gave the grants were very grateful that those people were there to do what they did. No one else wanted that work or was able to do it. They were given grants and they accounted for them. A local person helped them with the business side to ensure that it was all done properly. It was a relationship where they were supported, encouraged, allowed to develop and given enormous gratitude. It seemsthat there is no place for people like that in the relationships and contracting which we have been discussing. Those people will never get to first base: they will not be able fill in the form or satisfy the criteria. We will therefore lose them. A big concern about this market approach is that we will lose so many of the things that could make the lives of ex-offenders and of people in society so much better. I am very concerned about it and I hope the Minister will be able to respond.</p>

Part of our work now is to understand better how we can make that activity more sustainable and easier for them and provide longer-term provision. The noble Baroness, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and other noble Lords will know as well as I do that sustainability was one of the difficulties facing the voluntary sector because of short-term contracts lasting just one year. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was touching on the sustainability point in his comments about the need for footnotes to contracts.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07062792000014"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that it is important for us to come back to this. However, I should like to make a few remarks which I hope will be helpful. First, I apologise for not getting the agreements to the House more quickly. We did it as fast as we could. I could have waited until after today but I very much wanted noble Lords to have in their hands an example of the direction of travel. I thought that that might give some assurance that we were all thinking along the same lines.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07062792000015"></a>As noble Lords will know, local probation boards have been operating since April 2006 in accordance with service level agreements&#151;SLAs&#151;which are agreed between the board and the regional commission acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. I wanted to send noble Lords the extracts so that they could have a taster of how they work. I shall look at further extracts to see whether I can send anything else in addition. I think that an exampleof the current service specification of offender management is helpful. As noble Lords know, the SLAs are not legally binding but represent an important step forward in the move to a fully commissioned environment.</p>

<a name="70627-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07062792000016"></a>As I am sure noble Lords are aware, we intend the first wave of probation trusts to go live in April 2008. At that point, those trusts will move from SLAs to legally binding contracts. The process of developing the contracts is now well under way and is taking the existing SLAs as the starting point. I emphasise thatit is a starting point. As far as possible, we want contracts to focus on outcomes in order to free trusts and other providers to be more innovative in how they achieve results. We are gathering the specifications for each area of work, such as unpaid work, into separate contract schedules that will sit under a generic set of terms and conditions. Drafts of most of the required contract schedules have been developed but they are currently subject to legal scrutiny. I am not able to share them at this stage, but I hope that if they are ready at a subsequent point we might be able to do something about that. However, I will send noble Lords a list of schedules so that they can see what we have in mind. We are consulting probation chairs and chiefs throughout the process so that, when we reach a draft that is ready for consultation, we will be happy to make it available to the House and to noble Lords who have attended this debate.</p>

We are constructing a demonstration project with Clinks. Here I should say that I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, will agree that Clinks is a small, dynamic organisation which has demonstrated clearly what small groups of people with passion can do. Clinks will look specifically at how we can develop and sustain this part of the market&#151;the small-scale voluntary sector which makes up 70 per cent of the market and has a real passion and commitment to this work. These local providers do not want to enter into consortia and do not form part of national providers. We want to capture that. Clinks has kindly indicated that it will help us with the demonstration project and we hope to get something of good quality out of it. I can assure the House that the whole process has been very consultative. We are pleased that various parts of the sector have come forward and generously and willingly helped us to recast and recraft the contracts in a way that makes better sense for them&#151;and therefore better sense for us because we will then be able to help the people whom we care about in more meaningful ways.</p>

I hope that we shall have time for some informal discussions on this issue before we return to the Bill at Third Reading.

There are, among the subtexts of the debate, some who see England as a corporation in which strategic planners structurally change what has to be done from the centre and everything is done for profit. We all know that this is an area in which idealism and altruism are shown by dedicated individuals&#151;often awkward sods doing things locally.

The amendment relates to the role of the voluntary sector in providing probation services. This issue was debated in Committee andI have taken into account the comments of noble Lords. The amendment I am proposing now has been redrafted for the purposes of Report stage.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70627-0010.htm"/>


<a name="70627-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07062792000026"></a>The proposed new clause requires that at least7 per cent of probation budgets other than restricted probation provision as defined in Clause 4 should be used for services provided by charities. During the last discussion in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, was surprised that I proposed the figure of7 per cent until I pointed out that it was the figure suggested at the time by the Home Office. The amendment is supported by two co-ordinating bodies for voluntary agencies working with offenders, and I am glad that the noble Baroness has given them a good report. The bodies concerned are Clinks and the Corporate Alliance for Reducing Re-offending.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07062792000027"></a>In Committee, some noble Lords expressed the fear that a requirement of this kind could be regarded in practice as a ceiling rather than a minimum, limiting the contribution to charities of 7 per cent of probation budgets. The charities with which we have consulted are unimpressed by that argument. They point out that they have never seen anywhere near7 per cent of probation services budgets devoted to voluntary sector partnerships, and therefore the figure would represent considerable progress. Moreover, the clause makes the point by enabling the Secretary of State to increase the minimum percentage level by statutory instrument if it seems appropriate to do so as time goes on.</p>

<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_655"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 655</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particularly expert in delivering high quality services in the areas of accommodation, employment, education, mentoring, addiction issues, mental health, work with offenders&#146; families and community engagement. NOMS has developed targets to get more offenders into employment and sustainable accommodation, improve their education and involve them in drug treatment programmes. If these targets are to be achieved, the involvement of voluntary and community organisations is crucial. Yet the history of the past few years shows that the Probation Service has often been reluctant to engage the voluntary sector in partnership except when it is required to do so either by legislation or by centrally driven targets.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07062792000029"></a>Until 2001, the Probation Service had an official target to devote 7 per cent of its resources to voluntary initiatives. This was not a statutory requirement and the service never quite achieved that percentage. However, the existence of even a non-statutory target pushed up the proportion of the service&#146;s budget devoted to such partnerships to around 5 per cent. Regrettably, the 7 per cent target was removed in 2001. After that, the proportion of the probation budget spent on contracts with the voluntary and private sectors combined plummeted to less than 2.5 per cent. Faced with the threat of contestability, the Probation Service has recently begun to remedy this by adopting a target of devoting 5 per cent of its budget in 2006-07, and 10 per cent in 2007-08, to partnerships with the voluntary and private sectors.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07062792000030"></a>The Government&#146;s principal argument about the evolution of targets is that of best value, and that is understood. They argue that charities should not be given work if it can be provided at better value by the public or private sectors. Of course no one can dispute that. The problem is that, in reality, even when charities can provide better value the process of contestability could prevent them getting contracts to work with offenders. The amount of bureaucracy which has them tied up in paperwork and so on could be a tremendous disadvantage to any of the voluntary organisations. By specifying a minimum level of contracts with charities, the new clause would guard against the risk of the voluntary sector&#146;s unique contribution being squeezed out of the process.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07062792000031"></a>Past experience shows that unless the Probation Service has to devote a significant percentage of its budget to voluntary sector partnership it is unlikely to do so. By requiring it to do so, the amendment would guard against the risk that charities will be squeezed out of work with offenders, in complete contradiction to the Government&#146;s stated intention of involving the voluntary sector more extensively in the rehabilitation of offenders. The purpose of the amendment at this late stage is to seek from the Minister an explanation of how she sees the expansion of the role of voluntary organisations and what kind of resources will be available to them in future years. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remains the same: it is important to ensure that charities are not disadvantaged under the new system of contestability and can secure as much of the contract work as is appropriate given their undeniable skills, commitment and flexibility. I note that the amendment is supported by the two co-ordinating bodies for voluntary agencies working with offenders, the Corporate Alliance for Reducing Re-offending and Clinks, a body the Minister praised in her response to the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07062792000033"></a>In Committee I was one of those who expressed concern that, if a minimum required percentage of services to be provided by the third sector were included in the Bill, it might rapidly become the ceiling. That objection has, to a great extent, been overcome by subsection (2) of the new amendment today. The Secretary of State is given the power to increase that percentage by order; that means he could respond to changing circumstances. We are still of the view that the third sector could and should form a minimum of 7 per cent of the delivery of interventions. Indeed, I have always made it clear that I would be happy for the third sector to take the lion&#146;s share of service delivery where it is the right organisation to do so and is in a position to deliver to the standard required.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07062792000034"></a>I share Mr Cavadino&#146;s fear that the Government&#146;s methods for rolling out contestability may mean that private and public sector agencies, in effect, get more work than voluntary organisations, not because they are better at the work but because they have more resources to enter the bidding process in the first place. I feel that that is not what the Government intend. When we look at the model contracts, we may find a way through this by Third Reading. At the moment there is no doubt that the public and private sectors could put teams of people on to the intensive process of writing complicated bids, often at very short notice. That is the real world.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07062792000035"></a>We need to know from the Minister how the Government will ensure that the third sector is not put at a disadvantage in the bidding process. The third sector is, and must be, a vital part of the delivery of offender management services. So, although I still have a long way to go before I am persuaded fully to support the amendment, I recognise the advances it makes. It is important in that it gives the Minister the opportunity to demonstrate how the third sector will not be disadvantaged.</p>

Of course one wants to see everyone possible involved, but I have to return to the point that I tried to make earlier: this is all very well, provided thatthe resources are there to commission the people. I have not yet seen set out what will be required professionally of the Probation Service and how much of its budget that will take. It is no good saying, &#147;You have to do that and, incidentally, you have to ensure 7 per cent for the voluntary sector&#148;. That could eat into its statutory requirements, and then what is the Probation Service to do?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07062792000037"></a>Having read through the regulatory impact assessment in great detail, I am not conscious that these sums have been done. I have tried to engage with the chief executive of NOMS to find out whether the professional probation services provided by the public sector had been costed and the budget that will be available to commission services from the other sectors. Without being too dogmatic, I think that people have to be clear about this. It is no good launching an intention with which everyone agrees unless it can be delivered; otherwise we will end up dispiriting, not only the people on the receiving end of hopeful contracts which can never be given, but too many members of all three sectors.</p>

I am encouraged by the history of the 7 per cent requirement. In the past it had a good effect; then it was removed and matters slipped a little. There could be a case for a percentage which could move upwards. However, having said that, the group that I am most concerned about, the smaller charities, must be put in a position where they can compete for the role they would carry out superbly well. I am equally encouraged to hear from the noble Baroness that Clinks is involved in a demonstration in this regard.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07062792000039"></a>We will probably come back to this area. There is some hope if we concentrate on the vital point of providing adequate resources to enable the probation services to carry out their essential functions.</p>

That has been echoed by all noble Lords who have spoken today, and I fully share that desire. Indeed, it has been one of the key drivers of the Bill. That is why we have been working very closely with the sector and are so heartened by the support for the Bill from many voluntary sector providers, such as Nacro, Rainer and Turning Point. I have already mentioned the positive response that we have had from these bodies and I am very happy that we are working with Clinks.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07062792000041"></a>The reason that I cannot accept the imposition of a target for the amount of work that should be contracted to any one sector has already been explained. I share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that a required percentage could very quickly become a ceiling that is met with difficulty without any real effort to go further and look at the people who can deliver the work. At the moment, approximately 75 per cent of contracts and grants are with the third sector and 25 per cent are with the private sector. The target for 2006-07 was 5 per cent of each board&#146;s main grant; the future target is 10 per cent of each board&#146;s main grant for 2007-08, and probation boards are in the process of preparing subcontracting plans for their regional offender manager, setting out how they will reach the 10 per cent target in 2007-08. Some boards will hit those targets, but the average is likely to be around 3.5 per cent in 2006-07 and 6 per cent in 2007-08. We hope we will be able to accelerate that. By the end of 2008,

That is, of course, dependent on outcomes; it is why it is so important that contracts are outcome focused so that those who produce those outcomes are likely to succeed in getting the contracts.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07062792000042"></a>We understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said on this occasion, but I hope that, with some of the standard contracts we are working on, we will be able to deal with the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton: the need to reduce paperwork, to have standard contracts, to have sustainability built in through longer terms and resilience, and to be able to assist smaller organisations to take advantage of the system without being burdened. We are going in the right direction, and I hope that at Third Readingthe noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and others will feel happier that we have built in a sustainable process through which we can all be more confident that we can deliver on the things that we want to. That is why it is so important that we have Clinks and others helping and working with us to see how we can deliver this better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07062792000052"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, as we know, despite the progress of recent years, considerable challenges remain in our efforts to eradicate poverty. The European Union, which represents the world&#146;s largest multilateral grant provider, largest single market and main trading partner of most developing countries, can potentially make a huge contribution to eradicating global poverty.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07062792000053"></a>It is just over five years since the Cotonou agreement, the successor to the Lom&#233; convention, was agreed by the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) partners and ratified by this House. The agreement marked an important step forward in the EU&#146;s relationship with the ACP states, improving and strengthening the principles and priorities of that partnership.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07062792000054"></a>The 2000 Cotonou agreement made several important changes to the Lom&#233; convention, including an overriding objective of poverty eradication, improving and simplifying development assistance through the European Development Fund (EDF) and making good governance underpin the agreement. The Cotonou agreement provides for a revision every five years. The first review was concluded in February 2005. Its aim was to improve the implementationof the agreement, focusing on certain areas of co-operation and addressing some new politicaland security issues. The trade provisions were not considered as part of the review, as they are the subject of a separate ongoing negotiation to establish economic partnership agreements, to come into effect on 1 January 2008.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07062792000055"></a>The first order details those changes. The central objective remains the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty. New commitments by the international community to the millennium development goals, and on the need to improve the effectiveness of our aid, have been reflected. The changing security and foreign policy climate has been taken into account with an agreement to co-operate in the fight against terrorism, to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to prevent illegal mercenary activities and to support the work of the International Criminal Court. The procedures for conducting political dialogue and addressing human rights, democracy and rule of law concerns have been elaborated.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07062792000056"></a>Language concerning several potential areas of co-operation&#151;for example, in regard to the fight against poverty diseases, supporting youth development and use of information and communication technologies&#151;has been strengthened. A new emphasis has been given to supporting countries facing post-conflict or post-natural-disaster situations. The UK fully supports all of these changes. We firmly believe that they help to enhance and strengthen the longstanding partnership between the EU and ACP states.</p>

This represents a significant increase over the ninth EDF, which provided &#8364;13.8 billion over a five-year period to the end of 2007. That is a firm demonstration of the EU&#146;s collective commitment to supporting the development of ACP states and OCTs. The UK is contributing approximately &#8364;3.36 billion, representing 14.82 per cent of the total. That too is a significant increase over our commitment to the ninth replenishment, reflecting our confidence in the ability of the European Commission to deliver poverty-focused assistance to ACP and OCT partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07062792000059"></a>EU member states will also be able to increase their contributions to the 10th EDF. As aid is scaled upin the context of the EU&#146;s 2005 aid volume commitments, EU member states will be able to look to the EDF as a vehicle for channelling additional resources. The UK believes that that voluntary mechanism provides a continuing incentive to the European Commission to improve the effectivenessof the EDF. The European Investment Bank will supplement those resources with an additional&#8364;2.03 billion for loans through the Cotonou Investment Facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07062792000063"></a>I have three questions. First, the EDF is funded separately from the EU budget. The EU has not always been an effective mechanism for giving aid. How will the Government monitor the allocation or lending of funds?</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07062792000064"></a>Secondly, to which countries do Her Majesty&#146;s Government envisage the greatest amount going? That is important; the amount of EU aid to the poorest countries has gone down over the past10 years. How do the Government intend to rectify that?</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07062792000065"></a>Thirdly, do they envisage most resources being allocated on bilateral programmes or through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank?If large amounts are to go directly to recipient Governments, how do Her Majesty&#146;s Government envisage that corruption and fraud can be reduced as much as possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07062792000067"></a>The relative position of the recipient countries in the ACP framework is, and always has been, that they are much weaker on average as recipients than arethe donators&#151;the member states of the European Union. To some extent that difference has not narrowed as much as we might have expected because of the slowness of development in some recipient countries. The fact that the EU is much stronger gives us the opportunity to increase our contribution; the figures for EDF 10 show an impressive increase from previous figures. A lot of progress has been madeover the years since the old days when the Lom&#233; convention first started.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07062792000068"></a>The negotiating postures between the member states and the recipients can often bring problems when the recipient countries do not effectively negotiate what they should be getting and lose out, not only in certain marketplace opportunities and aid fund receipts, but also in how they can deploy their strategies for internal economic development for the few years ahead of whatever year of settlement this is.</p>

<a name="70627-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07062792000069"></a>This gives the opportunity, which the Conservative official spokesman referred to, for the European Union to carry on increasing its monitoring, supervision and surveillance procedures for these matters. This is a matter of concern. There is a general impression that a lot of improvement has been made in the technical surveillance capacities and the ability of the officials representing the European Union and the member states to make sure that the money is deployed properly for specific projects.The use of money remains a concern in certain countries. The Minister may wish deliberately to avoid highlighting which countries are giving concern, but that is of help to the House if that information is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07062792000070"></a>At the time of Commissioner Patten&#146;s work on the previous negotiations, when Cotonou started in 2000, there was to be much more focus on the eradication of poverty, rather than the general disbursement of aid in a much vaguer way, as one had had hitherto. Does the Minister feel that progress has been made in that focusing exercise, so that the millennium development goals of the United Nations are beginning to be achieved by the global activities of the EU as part of that general picture? Commentators and people in the entertainment business have made great intellectual contributions to these matters and registered their disappointment at how these goals are not being achieved. More needs to be done by the European Union, which&#151;speaking from memory and not having the figures to hand&#151;gives more money in aid than the United States does. One significant proportion of total US aid goes to one country&#151;Israel&#151;which can be classified as an advanced country and not a developing country. The figures for the European Union are therefore impressive and we welcome the increases.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07062792000071"></a>There are, as the Minister knows, still exemptions in these fields, which are disadvantageous to developing countries. One thinks of the exemptions for sugar beet, and other favoured markets in the European Union, where the cartel protection for

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07062792000072"></a>The EU-Africa second summit will take place in Lisbon in December 2007. It will not primarily deal with matters such as aid and European Investment Bank activity. It is much more to do with non-economic, non-financial, non-aid matters. It is also about an ambitious strategic new partnership with African countries&#151;part of the ACP framework&#151;on security and so on. Security as a global umbrella concept is important from the point of view of development, so there is a link there. It is good to see that that link&#151;the wider context between the EU and Africa&#151;is developing apace. The success story is there.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07062792000073"></a>Good governance has to be emphasised much more, and the five-year reviews constitute a good framework on which to develop these matters over the 20-year period, but the good governance syndrome needs special attention. I hope the Minister can reassure us yet again that that will be given priority. She said that trade issues were not directly involved in this and that they were a separate part of the discussions coming through the other frameworks. That brings us back to the question of whether our international institutions, which were developed after the Second World War, are still as apposite as they should be for direct assistance to developing countries, and whether they need to be modified in any of their parameters and procedures to help countries, besides just representing the advanced and wealthy West. I am glad that, as she said, the United Kingdom is giving nearly 15 per cent of the total of these increased figures. The partnership agreement between the ACP group of states and the EC has got off to a good start. A lot more needs to be done, and we welcome the increases that will come, presumably, as the years unfold. It is still in the early stages;we need to be reassured that the procedures and administration are running efficiently. On that supposition, I am happy to support these orders.</p>

I have always been rather uncomfortable with the concept of the ACP, which seems to reflect the colonial geography of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Does the Minister feel that the continuation of a major flow of aid and assistance through this structure distorts the way in which aid is distributed globally? Are more worthy developing states left out because of this historical relationship between European Union member states and their former colonial territories? I am concerned about the continuation of that. Perhaps states that are not within the ACP are less looked after by developed countries than other states that are better off.</p>

In many ways, the expertise in development finance has moved across to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is concentrated in the former Soviet bloc states and eastern Europe. Would it be more appropriate if this institution, with its specialist knowledge in development, played more of a role here than the EIB, which has a more developed economy role?</p>

It is very good news that all around the House we support the general aim of poverty reduction and that we all acknowledge that poverty reduction measures have to be coupled with good governance.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07062792000077"></a>A number of important points have been raised. It is clear that Europe is playing, and will continue to play, a major role in helping developing countries, particularly in Africa, to meet the challenges that they face. The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, cited the fact that the EU was a major player when it came to aid and development. The EC was the world&#146;s third largest distributor of OD aid to developing countries in 2005, behind the US and Japan. Too often the EC receives too little acknowledgement of the work that it undertakes in developing countries.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07062792000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked about monitoring the aid to ensure that it gets to where itis meant to be and is not subverted because of corruption. The creation of Europe Aid has led to better aid management and decentralisation to more able and active EC delegations. As the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said, it is important to have the technical expertise on the ground. Strengthening the EC delegations so that people on the ground work with the people who are disbursing the aid is the best way to ensure that the opportunities for corruption are limited. There is more to do to ensure that the systems are still reformed so that we can address the capacity reinforcement that is still necessary. We want an integrated approach to development co-operation, where policy and funding go hand in hand and good governance is the key to all these issues.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07062792000079"></a>What does the EC do to ensure that its funds are not wasted? The annual accounts and resource management are overseen by its external auditor, the European Court of Auditors. The court&#146;s main task is to provide the Council and the European Parliament with an external independent audit of the European Community&#146;s annual accounts, including those of the development co-operation programme. If we are worried about certain situations, we raise them in management committees and in the Council. We follow everything up very closely.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07062792000080"></a>The noble Lord asked to which countries funds were going to be given in the 10th<sup></sup>replenishment. Discussions about the poverty reduction strategies of the individual ACP countries are under way; it is too early to say to which countries we will allocate money. However, it is clear that poverty is the key focus for low-income countries and Africa. More than 90 per cent of funding in the 10th replenishment fund will go

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07062792000081"></a>The division between bilateral and multilateral is, again, still under discussion. I should think that a high proportion goes in bilateral aid, but if I am wrong I will inform noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07062792000082"></a>In response to the question about how DfID is helping to make EU aid more effective, we support the Commission in decentralising much of its programme. In 2002, when reforms were just beginning, only 24 per cent of the value of the European Development Fund portfolio was managed by delegations, but in 2006 that number had risen to 82 per cent. We support the Commission in all these reforms.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07062792000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, asked about the millennium development goals and whether the EDF would assist in enabling countries to reach them. As I have stated, the main focus of the EDF is poverty reduction. We believe that lifting a country out of poverty is the best way to enable it to reach the millennium development goals. One focus of EDF money is on things such as access to clean water and education&#151;things that will enable countries to prosper and reach the millennium development goals. </p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07062792000084"></a>I agree that the EU-Africa summit is a very important occasion for discussions with Africa to improve our relationship and what is happening on the ground.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07062792000085"></a>I was asked whether the World Trade Organisation and other global organisations should be modernised to ensure that they can meet the difficult trade challenges in today&#146;s world. The Government are continually seeking to modernise institutions such as the UN and WTO to ensure that they are in better shape and can meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07062792000086"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked whether the Government believe that the ACP is still an effective way of channelling aid and whether aid is distributed in the most appropriate way. It is very important to maintain the relationships with the countries in the ACP but not every ACP country receives the same proportion of aid. The countries that are the most needy and deserving receive the most money. It is not a &#147;one size fits all&#148; tool but an organisation in which we provide targeted aid so that we reach the parts that need to be reached.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07062792000087"></a>I do not think that the European Investment Bank is an innovation. It has certainly been involved since the Cotonou agreement was made five years ago. Whether it was used under Lom&#233;, I am not sure, but I will inform noble Lord. The EIB is a useful tool, although I take on board the noble Lord&#146;s comments that perhaps other EU entities might be more appropriate.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07062792000088"></a>In conclusion, the Government believe that Europe has a key role to play in the international community&#146;s efforts to eradicate poverty. The amended Cotonou agreement and the 10th EDF provide a valuable framework for Europe&#146;s co-operation with the ACP states. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="070627100000008"></a>The information is provided in writing and also verbally, and a risk assessment is offered where that is deemed appropriate.

Before I came to this House, I had responsibility in my union for many thousands of members who worked in what we then called the non-profit sector, so I have knowledge of them and their work and a tremendous amount of respect for them.

In 2005, in evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, a representative of the judiciary warned that they could not be involved in a body such as a probation board if competition were introduced into services for the courts and therefore, surely, into the Prison Board&#146;s decisions as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="070627100000010"></a>As my noble friend Lord Judd said when we debated this in Committee, it is very important if we are co-operating with others, as this Bill allows&#151;indeed, wants us to do&#151;outside the formal public service, to remember what the priorities are. Surely, one priority is to maintain what works well at the moment and not to detract from it because that would be detrimental to everyone, especially offenders. Although my noble friend the Minister has assured the House that there are no immediate plans to open up this area of work to competition, I and the National Association of Probation Officers believe that it would be better to ensure that this does not happen in the future either.

Indeed, the growing number of indeterminate sentenced prisoners are choking the ability of the probation boards to get through the work. They can do it only if they have the very best professional service. Therefore, it seems to me absolutely vital that this should remain in the hands of the professionals because it is now such an obviously front-line service.</p>

It will be recalled that we had a debate in Committee in which we expressed concerns about possible conflict of interest. This is another situation where a conflict of interest could well arise if the writer to whom the business hadbeen contracted were to have a commercial interest in the outcome, because he or she was involved in contracting for other business connected with the service. The House has already expressed an opinion on conflict of interest, and this is another such issue.</p>

She also tabled the amendment in Committee.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="070627100000017"></a>In Committee I made it clear that we do not seek to interfere in the Government&#146;s negotiations with those who are trying to protect more offender management services from being opened up to contestability. This amendment would add to the Clause 4 protection the provision of assistance bythe Probation Service to the Parole Board and the Secretary of State in the early release and recall of prisoners.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="070627100000018"></a>I certainly agree with the noble Baroness,Lady Gibson, that the Probation Service provides impartial, accurate, reliable, skilled and professional advice to assist the Parole Board in making its decisions on the release of prisoners. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, I make no excuse for those being honeyed words&#151;they describe what happens; and that is what we should be doing. The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, argues that if this function were to be commissioned via contestability, there could be an immediate conflict of interest.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="070627100000019"></a>I merely make two observations. First, in Committee, at col. 1032 of the <I>Official Report</I> of5 June, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, appeared to say that the reason for the Government refusing this amendment was mainly that the Parole Board Rules 2004 already provided robust safeguards and that the rules would soon be further tightened in the form of a statutory instrument. When will we seethat statutory instrument? Secondly, what is the Government&#146;s view of the harm that would be done by adding this protection if it will exist anyway? I am rather puzzled by that.</p>

In particular, I dwell on the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, who rightly expressed concern about the importance for public safety of the issue. I am mindful of that.</p>

<a name="70627-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="070627100000021"></a>The amendment seeks to add the work that probation does in relation to the Parole Board to the definition of &#147;restricted probation provision&#148; in Clause 4. The Government fully understand those concerns. To demonstrate our commitment on this point, we have given a guarantee to Parliament that we will not contract with a non-public sector provider for core offender management work for three years, which was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I am happy to assure noble Lords again that this guarantee includes the provision of assistance to the Parole Board. In addition, the new provision in Clause 3(7) would make explicit the contractual obligations that probation providers would be under to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between their duty to give advice impartially and their financial interest. That is an important issue, which is important to my noble friends Lady Gibson and Lady Turner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="070627100000022"></a>However, it is not appropriate to add this work to the restrictions in Clause 4. The clause was added to the Bill to meet the specific concerns that had rightly been expressed in relation to court work. Having listened carefully to our stakeholders and to the Members of the other place, we agreed that it was right that we should not seek to compete this area of work until we could demonstrate to the House that the safeguards in place were robust enough to meet those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="070627100000023"></a>The work that probation does in relation to the Parole Board is of a different order, because robust safeguards are already in place. Probation involvement in the parole process is rigorously governed by the Parole Board Rules 2004, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, referred. It is our intention, as I think has been picked up by the noble Baroness, to strengthen that even further by revising the Parole Board Rules so that they take the form of a statutory instrument. That is extremely significant, because it requires parliamentary scrutiny. The noble Baroness asked when that statutory instrument will be brought forward. I cannot give her a precise date, but it is at the forefront of our thinking. If we were to decide that the time was right to open up this area of work, the rules would be rigorously applied to all the providers involved in delivering the work, regardless of whether they were from the public, private or voluntary sectors.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="070627100000024"></a>With that in mind, I hope that my noble friends will agree that their amendment is unnecessary and that they will withdraw it. We greatly value the work that is done by the Probation Service, and we understand entirely the sensitivity of the work that it does in support of the Parole Board. From an earlier ministerial incarnation, and having read many of the reports that are prepared on Parole Board cases, I greatly respect the professionals who do the work,

I am grateful to the Bill team for pointing out to me that the amendment on which I won the Division did not quite do what I had hoped&#151;I got it wrong. Apparently the amendment I pressed applies the procedure only to the power in Clause 5(6), which is not what I intended.

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="070627100000036"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is a return to a subject discussed in Committee that is extremely important to me, to the National Association of Probation Officers and to trades unions generally: collective bargaining. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 transfers the determination of terms and conditions for probation staff to probation trusts. This amendment keeps collective bargaining at national level and retains the status quo. I make no apology for that. National collective bargaining for the Probation Service is a necessary prerequisite for the maintenance of probation as a profession across England and Wales. If each trust were allowed to have different terms and conditions for probation staff, it would not only be detrimental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the service but would also cause chaos. It would not be good for the well-being of workers in that service. In Committee, I said that it is always difficult and demoralising for staff who are carrying out the same jobs to be paid on different pay scales. That has been proved time and time again, and that does no service to probation as a whole. I make no apology for reminding the House of what was said in Committee because it is crucial to the aims of this amendment, which is not designed to produce what was described by my noble friend Lord Bassam as,</p>
<ul><a name="070627100000142"></a>&#147;an ironclad straitjacket for the service&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/6/07; col. 1075.]</ul>
<p><a name="070627100000037"></a>but to ensure that something that has worked well, efficiently and effectively is not destroyed in future. Although the Probation Service has always been made up of a number of local probation employers&#151;there are currently 42 probation areas in England and Wales&#151;since the 1940s there has been national collective bargaining. There is also continuous service for staff moving between different areas. For example, service-related entitlements, such as annual leave, are not affected by moves between probation areas, and all staff are covered by the local government pension scheme. This means that there is a national professional career structure which enables them to move between probation areas without detriment. This free flow of staff between areas has been to the benefit of the service as much as the staff, enabling enhanced professional career development for staff, reducing staff wastage and ensuring maximum benefit from the training investment made in staff. In other words, national collective bargaining underpins the very existence of the national probation profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="070627100000038"></a>Probation Service pay and conditions have been recently modernised and, with effect from April 2006&#151;only last year&#151;the Probation Service pay modernisation agreement was implemented. This modernised pay structure has introduced harmonised terms and conditions for all grades, new flexibilities&#151;an &#147;in&#148; word&#151;for employers and a job evaluation system for all grades. Geographical and market forces arrangements are also in place to enable employers to take account of the circumstances in which they find themselves without needing to move away from the national agreement.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="070627100000039"></a>Separate collective bargaining arrangements for each probation employer would be inefficient: it would necessitate an increased role for human resources and industrial relations for each separate employer. Such separate arrangements would be particularly inefficient for a relatively small staff group, with the Probation Service covering just over 21,000 staff across the whole of England and Wales, and having only 6,500 qualified probation officers. In the interests of efficiency and effectiveness, and to ensure the continuation of the probation profession, it is therefore important that national collective bargaining for the Probation Service be retained and provided for in the legislation.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="070627100000040"></a>In response to my amendment in Committee, my noble friend Lord Bassam said that the Government, </p>
<ul><a name="070627100000143"></a>&#147;have no plans to change the current arrangements whereby pay and terms and conditions for probation staff are negotiated on a national basis through a national framework and national machinery&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070627100000119"></a>Naturally, I was pleased to hear that. However, he then went on to talk about an element of flexibility being needed,</p>
<ul><a name="070627100000144"></a>&#147;to respond to future local circumstances which by their very nature&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070627100000120"></a>cannot be anticipated. Of course they cannot. But then he went on to talk further of flexibility and localism. Alarm bells rang even louder in my head, as they would in the head of anyone who has ever been involved in national collective bargaining, and that applies to either side of the industry. Elements of flexibility and recognition of the localism of the service cannot sit alongside national collective bargaining in relation to pay, pensions and leave. The two are totally incompatible.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="070627100000041"></a>It is no good saying to me that the Government&#146;s intention is not,</p>

<p><a name="070627100000121"></a>and then to go on to enthuse about elements of flexibility and localism&#151;the very elements that would destroy national collective bargaining once and for all.

Let me put her mind at rest. I have not heard what the Minister is going to say, but if he does not satisfy her and she does not take this matter further at Third Reading, I give advance warning&#151;irrespective of how the House feels about whether we can tidy this up at Third Reading&#151;that I shall move an amendment and seek the opinion of the House, including that of the Labour trade unionists, on the Government&#146;s action on the matter.</p>

My noble friend Lady Gibson has made out the case for the amendment. She is obviously representing the views of the National Association of Probation Officers, with which I have considerable sympathy, hence my hope that the Minister will have something helpful to say. I noted with interest what he had to say about the approach of the Probation Boards&#146; Association, and suggest that he ought to grab this amendment with a degree of enthusiasm.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="070627100000052"></a>My background is in the transport industry, not least the railway industry. I saw the effects under the previous Government of the break-up of that industry and national collective bargaining. One group within the railway industry whose bargaining position was greatly strengthened by the decisions of the previous Conservative Government was the train drivers, because negotiations then took place on a company-by-company basis. They had considerable bargaining power and, having secured a particular increase in one company, went along to the others and demanded comparable increases. The result has been a considerable improvement in the pay of train drivers.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="070627100000053"></a>The Minister may feel that we might end up with a shortage of probation officers or staff. If we do, and if we have bargaining done separately by each probation trust, precisely the same scenario will apply. If a probation trust feels that it has a problem securing sufficient probation staff, it is likely to offer an increase which will attract such staff. If staff in surrounding areas find that the rate of pay or conditions are better in the next area, they will simply decide to move. Then that adjacent area will have a similar problem, and will have to move on its pay levels.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="070627100000054"></a>Therefore, an argument could be made that it might be in the interest of the National Association of Probation Officers to go along with what is proposed. Clearly, however, the association has a view, with which I sympathise. It is better from its point of view to have national bargaining and a degree of stability. I

If there are issues over recruiting sufficient probation staff, he may find that not having national collective bargaining causes problems for the different probation trusts, which after all will be under contract to deliver services. Something that they might think about in negotiations is that if they do not pay an appropriate rate, and have difficulties recruiting, that may affect their ability to deliver contracts. I am sure that that would concentrate their minds quite considerably.</p>

I do so from a contrary position but in agreement with the previous speaker. For a decade, I had the privilege of being the general-secretary of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, which, by definition, consisted of professionals who entered the Civil Service anywhere in the United Kingdom but in a career service. In a sense they did not care, when they left university or qualified, whether the job was in London or Manchester; they joined a national service to serve wherever they were required. The Probation Service has had that privilege. Over the years, people have risen to the most senior ranks in the Probation Service, and that should not be given up easily. I agree entirely with my noble friend Lord Rosser that that has been the result of empowering ASLEF in the railway industry. I argue that it is not a sensible route to go down, because in practice you want to have the best qualified staff in the best jobs and in the best places to play an efficient role in the Probation Service. I very strongly support the amendment.</p>

First, the noble Baroness gave a mythological illustration. I can bring noble Lords nearer to reality with an illustration of what happened when the Welsh CAFCASS was split from the main body of CAFCASS. The Welsh decided to pay its staff more than we paid ours in England. As a consequence, we experienced considerable difficulties in negotiating because the costs of paying all the staff in the English regions would have been considerably more than in Wales. That illustrates what can happen.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="070627100000057"></a>Secondly, this demonstrates that the probation service is a national service. Our earlier arguments about local and national are illustrated here. Some things need to be national. It underlines what the Government have been trying to present: having some issues where you can look right across the piece&#151;collective bargaining&#151;but ensuring compliance in other issues. The value of having similar pay and conditions is that you can have similar expectations of people undertaking a task. That needs to be driven, I fear, from the centre. That does not mean that I am a centralist; I think there are great issues about local determination. The noble Baroness pointed out that flexibility at local level is possible within collective bargaining. With those two points I support the noble Baroness.</p>

As my noble friend pointed out at some length&#151;she made an excellent case, and I have no need to repeat it&#151;we are looking here at career progression in a profession. Obviously, as has been pointed out, if you have a national profession, people expect to have terms and conditions of service that apply across the whole structure.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="070627100000059"></a>On localism, it has already been pointed out that there is a modernised pay structure in operation,with certain flexibilities. There is a job evaluation in operation, which allows for variance. Geographical aspects and market forces can be taken care of under the same arrangement. Therefore, the limited localism which is necessary in the structure is already provided for. As my noble friend pointed out, if we wereto depart from a national collective bargaining arrangement, the result would simply be anarchic and very, very bad for morale. I hope that my noble friend will be able to accept this amendment. Everybody who has spoken in the debate so far has been in favour of it, and I am sure that my noble friend on the Front Bench would like to respond in a similar way.I hope he is able to do so.</p>

One of the things of interest to me throughout the debate is that, although we have talked about many things, we have not often concentrated on the probation staff themselves. In prisons, nothing will be right for prisoners unless things are right for staff,and the same goes for offenders in the hands of the Probation Service; unless things are right for the probation staff you will not get the quality of service out of them.</p>

<a name="70627-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="070627100000061"></a>One thing that has concerned me is that the Government created a National Probation Service, but it has not been in existence for very long before we find that its headquarters have been subsumed into NOMS and its director is now a subordinate of someone called the director of performance and improvement somewhere in NOMS headquarters. I am very glad that my noble friend Lady Howarth reminded us that we are talking about a National Probation Service. There should be national things for a national service. National collective bargaining must come in the whole collection of national things required for a national service with a national roleto play.</p>

As the basic idea of the Probation Service is accepted but is being thought through again as a national service, the amendment will provide the protection needed during that period to ensure that the whole service emerges as a national body.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="070627100000065"></a>From my reading of proceedings on the Bill in another place, and from correspondence on the Bill, it appears that the Government previously gave a commitment that an amendment would be forthcoming to satisfy those who support the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson.

I understand the spirit in which it has been tabled. I would like to reflect further. I have heard the voices around your Lordships&#146; House. I noted in particular that my noble friend Lady Gibson said that neither she, nor for that matter the staff involved, are opposed to flexibilities. That is a very sensible position to adopt, because it is clearly not a million miles away from the Government&#146;s position.

I think that it is for the convenience of the House that I deal with them together. In Committee, we dealt at some length with Amendment No. 18. I simply want to say that I believe that legislation should be clear to those involved, and it is not immediately clear to everyone in the voluntary sector and the outside world that &#147;person&#148; also covers organisations. In the light of my own work and experience, it is absolutely clear that some alarm bells might be rung in the voluntary sector if people interpret the legislation to suggest that these arrangements should be with a &#147;person&#148;. There is a great sense of corporate responsibility in the best of the voluntary sector in which everyone feels that they carry, individually and collectively, the responsibility for what is being done, how money is being spent and how the objectives are most effectively achieved.</p>

If my noble friend and the Government are determined to use &#147;person&#148;, they at least should add &#147;organisation&#148;, which would clarify the situation immensely. If my noble friend suggests that this could be clarified in guidance, that would be helpful, but I cannot see why the point cannot be made plain inthe Bill.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="070627100000083"></a>On Amendment No. 19, I have noticed the very helpful Amendment No. 24 standing in the name of my noble friend, which is a move in the direction concerning a lot of us. But when policy is made, it is important that we think hard about means as well as objectives and general purpose. To give the Secretary of State responsibility for ensuring that professional training is properly resourced seems very sensible. This is happening in many parts of the education sector, including higher education, where departments of state with particular interest in aspects of the work are able to finance it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="070627100000084"></a>As I have argued before, if we are to take professional training and preparation seriously, it cannot be approached just on the back of an envelope, switched on and off, and improvised and arranged at short notice. People have to makesound arrangements and be confident that those arrangements will be sustained over a sensible period. In that context, I urge my noble friend, even at this stage, to take seriously this issue of means for achieving the ends. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps it would be helpful if,in responding, the Government would also speakto their interpretation of government AmendmentNo. 24, which covers some of the same ground. Part of our difficulty with Amendment No. 24 is the difference between &#147;may publish&#148; in proposed new subsection (1) and &#147;must publish&#148; in proposednew subsection (2), and whether guidelines are enforceable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="070627100000086"></a>We are concerned that while we have well qualified people in the service, particularly for serious offenders, the number of serious offenders we let out on licence is likely to increase. We need to make sure that the people concerned with them have the right qualifications and experience. I feel that both in Committee and on Report, the Government have not been well served by some of the more enthusiastic supporters of privatisation and the corporate state. They tend to give the impression that we do not need to worry about these things because the private sector will provide somehow or other and, if it does not produce qualified people, we need not mind because they will be bright and they will do the work. We are in favour of co-operation and a mixed economy, but nevertheless we want to make sure that the right people are in the right place and that they have had the right training. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are good probing amendments for that purpose. Our discussion of this needs to tie in with what the Government mean in their rather unclear Amendment No. 24.</p>

Although we are going to discuss qualifications under Amendment No. 24, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has rightly pointed out, a lot of that amendment is about guidelines. We are not just about guidelines; we are about the actual delivery of training. We are not just interested in it going to individuals; we are interested in the training of the organisations that have to carry out tasks, and that covers the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="070627100000088"></a>&#147;Training&#148; sometimes sends shivers up my spine when I think about the difference between what is said to be happening, what is required to happen, and what is actually happening. To my concern, I heard the other day that, for example, the so-called eight-week training for prison officers has been reduced by a week to seven weeks. In other countries, prison officers have a degree-based course for up to a year. I have the same concerns now that we have an increased number of less than fully trained probation staff, many of whom are asked to carry out tasks for which they are not adequately trained. As the private and voluntary sectors become more involved&#151;we all hope they will&#151;it is terribly important that their people are trained in exactly the same way to carry out these purposes, and that there is a mechanism to make certain that the training is verified so that they are not allowed to practise until they have been tested or attested to see that they are up to the right standard.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="070627100000089"></a>This looks like a small amendment, but coming from the noble Lord, Lord Judd, naturally there will be more to it than that. I am extremely glad that he has raised the issue in this way, and I am glad too that &#147;professional preparation&#148; has been included, as well as &#147;training&#148;, in Amendment No. 19. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendments in the spirit in which they are meant so that they can tie in with government Amendment No. 24, which is on the same subject&#151;although guidelines are not the same as delivery.</p>

It is absolutely crucial as we move into this somewhat flexible world that people are equipped to carry out whatever level of professional supervision is required, and that there is appropriate training at the right level. We are in a state of flux, as we all know, because the degree to which contracts are being offered is very limited&#151;one year, two years, whatever it is&#151;because of the transition and we need a period where that can be worked through. Above all, we need to be assured that the professional standard whichhas been the key mark of the probation training organised and provided by the department&#151;whatever it is to be called in the future&#151;will conform to the level necessary for its probation officers to supervise their clients.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="070627100000091"></a>I hope the amendment will be accepted. Anyhow, I intend later on to table a more detailed amendment on training to ensure that the future is provided for. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Judd, will support that amendment as well, as he supported me on a previous occasion. At the moment, we need some reassurance. </p>

<a name="070627100000092"></a><b><a name="70627-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="070627100000183"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment. I am most concerned about the continuing professional development of probation officers, which is costly to ensure. It involves a probation officer having time away from dealing with clients and administration; that is one cost which has to be set aside. It also requires a senior probation officer to have time away from dealing with clients or administration, so that is another cost. It is very easy for an organisation which is worried about its expenditure to cut back on the time allowed for continued professional development and to cutback on supervision from senior officers. That is catastrophic for the retention of staff and the ability of staff to form and keep therapeutic, if you like, relationships with those in the front line.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="070627100000093"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for sending me a sample contract, which is helpful to some degree,but the minutiae of practice&#151;supervision, for instance&#151;is not laid out in it. In one sense, one understands why&#151;it seems like only one detail of practice&#151;but that kind of detail can get lost. For instance, we are talking now about having different providers and we heard earlier that there is no reason to judge one kind of provider against another; that we should use simply outcomes to judge performance. I have a lot of sympathy with that point of view. But if one looks at care homes, at children&#146;s homes or at prisons, one finds that where private providers are involved&#151;although there are good examples, particularly if the private provider has worked in the industry in the past&#151;there is the danger, where one is trying to save costs and looking at the situation in a strictly businesslike way, that one cuts back on the essential support for those working in the front line.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="070627100000094"></a>It can be really costly to spare the time for people in the front line and their managers to sit back and reflect on practice, yet that is exactly what the social care White Paper, <I>Options for Excellence</I><I>, </I>has emphasised. We need to do more to help staff to reflect and we should be developing learning

That is the way forward. I would appreciate reassurance from the Minister that he takes that concern on board, and that&#151;I know we will talk more about this issue on AmendmentNo. 24&#151;in the minimum standards there is a strong protection for the supervision of probation officers in the future. There is real concern that it is already deteriorating.</p>

If he will forgive me, I shall not address that; it will be interesting to see how the Minister responds to it.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="070627100000096"></a>In Amendment No. 19 the noble Lord returns to the issue of training, which occupied so much of our energy in Committee. He is right to bring it back. In Committee, noble Lords on all sides expressed a concern that there was no reference in the Bill to something as essential as training. In approaching the issue of what should be in the Bill, my first principle is that one should be looking to set a benchmark that everyone should seek to attain, but one should not try to put into the Bill something that is so prescriptive that it writes out of the scene those&#151;I am thinking in particular of the smaller charities&#151;whom I wish to encourage to take an active role in achieving success under contestability, getting the contracts and providing the services.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="070627100000097"></a>I agree with what has been said: what is under discussion on this amendment must be informed by the Government&#146;s position on Amendment No. 24. When I saw that amendment I was extremely encouraged. There have to be some reassurancesfrom the Minister about the implications of that amendment, but at first blush it appeared to provide a good balance between ensuring good practice and avoiding the heavy-handed prescription that could serve to shut out the smaller charities from bidding for contracts.</p>

<a name="70627-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="070627100000098"></a>I accept that when we get to government Amendment No. 24 there will be issues about the words, in subsection (1),</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="070627100000137"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may publish guidelines about... qualifications&#148;,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="070627100000123"></a>But when I looked at the implications of that, I found it reassuring. I thought the Government might well have found a way through the training minefield. Of course I am not going to jump to conclusions&#151;we have not heard the Minister on that amendment&#151;but I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that it is my expectation that I may well be satisfied with the government amendment. That is why I do not offer my support to him at this stage, because I suspect that his amendment will be withdrawn pronto because of Amendment No. 24.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="070627100000100"></a>There are two areas of concern here. Amendment No. 18 proposes that the Bill should make clear that payments made under Clause 6 can be made to any other organisation as well as to any other person. I share the noble Lord&#146;s conviction that organisations involved in the serious work of managing offenders should collectively take legal&#151;and, of course, moral&#151;responsibility for the work they do. However, the amendments he has proposed are not the best way to achieve that. The term &#147;person&#148; has been used because it has an established legal meaning that covers a wide variety of bodies with which the Secretary of State might wish to make arrangements, and the term &#147;organisation&#148; is covered by that definition, as is the term &#147;institution&#148;, which my noble friend proposed in Committee. As with his earlier amendments regarding arrangements for co-operation, the way that we will achieve the outcomes I think we all want will be through the contracting process and&#151;to go back to the point I made on the co-operation amendments&#151;through guidance when the Bill is implemented. That is where it is best left. Those definitional terms can be explained in a way that gives clear meaning to the process.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="070627100000101"></a>Amendment No. 19 deals with training. We have had a lot of debate on that. Since tabling this amendment, my noble friend will have seen Amendment No. 24, to which noble Lords referred. My argument is that Amendment No. 24 goes much further than the noble Lord suggested. I trust that that will ultimately meet his concerns. I would very much like noble Lords to consider Amendment No. 19 in the light of what we are trying to do with Amendment No. 24. We will debate that on another occasion; that will be the right place to explore the issue in depth.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="070627100000102"></a>We tabled Amendment No. 24 explicitly to meet the concerns expressed by noble Lords about training. It requires the Secretary of State to publish guidelines on the qualifications, experience or training required of probation officers working directly with offenders&#151;that picks up the point of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. It makes it clear that the guidelines will apply to all providers from all sectors as appropriate. I hope that it will be widely welcomed. I hear what my noble friend says and I understand what he is trying to achieve with Amendment No. 18 but the way in which legal description is required is as I have set out.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="070627100000103"></a>On Amendment No. 19, my noble friend should take careful cognisance of Amendment No. 24, which deals with his central concerns. I hope that he will feel confident if not happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="070627100000105"></a>I was very encouraged, not for the first time&#151;I frequently am&#151;that my noble friend understood what Amendment No. 18 was about and agreed with the purpose. If that is the case, it is not really convincing to go on to say, &#147;But this is not the way to achieve it&#148;. We should be hearing from my noble friend how it could be achieved. I would feel tremendously positive about the approach of the Government, with all the expertise and legal advice at their disposal&#151;I cannot possibly hope to assemble that&#151;if I felt that all that involved saying, &#147;Yes, the Minister said that we agree; now let&#146;s find how wecan do it&#148;. That needs to be clarified. I would be prepared to withdraw Amendment No. 18 on the understanding that before Third Reading he will have something to say about it and that his department will do some serious work on backing up his words.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="070627100000106"></a>On Amendment No. 24, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was very generous, which I appreciated; I respect her thoughts on these matters greatly. She said that we should not be too prescriptive. I do not really find the words &#147;the Secretary of State may make payments&#148; highly prescriptive; it is enabling but it is certainly not prescriptive. Now that she has alerted me to the point, I am beginning to wonder whether I should have tabled some other amendments. I am very grateful to her.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="070627100000107"></a>Similarly, I have been told by the noble Baroness and others that Amendment No. 24 covers my point.I said in my introductory remarks that I was encouraged by Amendment No. 24&#151;it does not, in fact, cover my point. We must put in the Bill the responsibility of the Secretary of State to ensure&#151;I put here in parenthesis that the noble Baroness has indicated that the Secretary of State has the ability to ensure this under the proposed legislation&#151;that what is spelt out as an aspiration, a purpose, even in guidelines, will actually be resourced. I cannot say how much frustration I come across among agencies working in the front line of social policy when aspirations expressed in legislation are not backed by the necessary resources. Here we have a chance to underline the point that aspirations must always be linked to the provision of resources.</p>

<a name="70627-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="070627100000108"></a>We will be debating this more when we reach Amendment No. 24. I have grave anxieties on this front, but in view of the continuing debate, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, noting again that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will be bringing forward a more detailed amendment in this context.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07062764000011"></a>I welcome the survey, which gives us the facts needed to target future work. It indicates that 63 per cent of service personnel are currently registered, in comparison with 60 per cent previously, the majority of whom (65 per cent) choose to register as ordinary rather than service voters. The number serving abroad who are registered has risen from 36 per cent in 2005 to 42 per cent in 2006.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07062764000012"></a>These figures indicate that registration levels have improved but there is still much work to be done, particularly for those serving abroad; the results will help to indicate where our efforts should be concentrated. We will work closely with the Electoral Commission to understand the reasons behind the results and to use them to make further improvements to the quality of information available to all service personnel.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07062764000013"></a>We remain committed to improving arrangements for members of the service community to exercise their right to vote. We will do this by encouraging our people to register and to vote, and underpin this by clear information provided in a timely manner. We shall continue to work hard, with the Electoral Commission, to achieve this.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07062764000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, attended a ministerial dinner on the evening of 11 June, where the German presidency reported on the first meeting  


<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS72"></a><b>27 Jun 2007 : Column WS72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the future group on home affairs, which had met in Eltville, Germany, on 21 May. Over dinner, Ministers discussed the need for the EU to have an effective expulsion policy and the need to protect national security and the human rights of those who pose a threat.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07062764000016"></a>The A-points list was approved and included adoption for rapid border intervention teams (RABITs) regulation, following a general approach in April, and the Ukraine readmission agreement, which was adopted by qualified majority with the UK voting against due to outstanding scrutiny reserves. The integration fund was removed from the A-points list and will go to the Competitiveness Council on25 June for adoption.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07062764000017"></a>The Council opened with the mixed committee items, which included the second generation Schengen information system (SIS II), SISone4all, the visa information system (VIS), data protection and the regulation on a uniform format for residence permits.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07062764000018"></a>The Council welcomed the progress made on SISone4all and noted that the programme was on schedule. The target of lifting internal borders by December was likely to be reached provided that all the evaluation criteria were met. The Commission reported that the implementation of SIS II remained on target for December 2008 and reiterated that all efforts should be made to ensure that the SISone4all programme does not delay the implementation ofSIS II.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07062764000019"></a>There was political agreement on VIS and the presidency hoped for swift implementation. The UK does not participate in the VIS regulation and has been excluded from the accompanying Council decision on law enforcement access to VIS, and therefore did not have a vote on this proposal. The UK did, however, secure a Council declaration that underlines Council support for UK and Ireland access and makes it clear that this issue will be explored further following the outcome of the FRONTEX and passports cases before the European Court of Justice, which deal with the right of the UK and Ireland to participate in measures that build on those elements of Schengen into which we have not opted in. Furthermore, the UK and Ireland made a joint declaration setting out our view of the issue in more detail. The Commission hoped that the new system would be up and running by the first quarter of 2009. The presidency underlined the significance of meeting the commitment made to the European Parliament of reaching political agreement on the data protection framework decision by the endof 2007.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07062764000020"></a>The presidency felt that good progress had been made on the data protection framework decision. The shape of a compromise on the difficult question of scope had been discussed at senior official level. Further discussions will be required. The Council conclusions were agreed.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07062764000021"></a>The presidency noted that good progress had been made on the regulation on a uniform format for residence permits, but concerns remained over minors holding a separate permit. The presidency was hopeful that agreement would be reached soon.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07062764000022"></a>The main agenda items started with Europol. The presidency was pleased with the progress of negotiations to date on the draft Europol Council decision and all member states were content that negotiations on the first chapter had met most concerns. Discussions will now proceed on the next chapters of the text. The presidency recalled the conclusions reached by the Council in December 2006 concerning the financing of Europol and the factthat it remained necessary to clarify the financial consequences of any move to Community financing. The new Council conclusions setting out the remaining issues to be resolved were agreed.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07062764000023"></a>Political agreement was reached on the Pr1/4m Council decision. The presidency anticipated that, by the end of the year, the implementing agreementand operational manual would be finalised to enable new provisions to be implemented swiftly. The Government believe that this proposal represents a practical step forward in cross-border police co-operation that should bring direct, positive results for citizens and help to make the EU more secure.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07062764000024"></a>The Commission gave a presentation on the global approach to migration. The Government noted that further work was needed on the idea of mobility packages and highlighted the need for more consultation and exploration of the policy before commencing talks with third countries.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07062764000025"></a>On the situation at the EU&#146;s southern maritime borders, the presidency highlighted the priority for saving human life and the need for member states to take on a fair share of responsibility and to fulfil their commitments in regard to the FRONTEX toolbox. Practical steps to relieve any burden on southern states would be subject to further discussion.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07062764000026"></a>Most member states welcomed the purpose of the directive on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals but questioned the approach taken by the Commission. There remained concerns in the Council about the administrative burden, added value, subsidiarity and proportionality. A number of member states also questioned the inclusion of criminal sanctions in first-pillar measures. This proposal will be taken forward under the incoming Portuguese presidency.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07062764000027"></a>The Commission presented its asylum package, including a Green Paper on the future of asylum, a proposed directive extending long-term residence to asylum and protection cases and an evaluation of the Dublin system. The Government highlighted the success of the Dublin system and the necessity to develop the concept of regional protection and to include protection issues in the global approach on migration.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07062764000028"></a>The Commission underlined that visa waiver reciprocity continued to be a strong political priority, with the matter being pressed with the US and Canada on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07062764000029"></a>The Commission presented the results of the latest round of negotiations with the US on passenger name records. A deal looks likely and the US has accepted the need to reach a binding agreement with a longer data retention period of up to 15 years. All member states support the negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07062764000030"></a>On the second day of the Council, a general approach was reached on the draft framework decision on criminal records, which the Government welcome.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07062764000031"></a>I informed the Council of the historic creationof the Ministry of Justice and the division of responsibilities with the Home Office and welcomed the opportunities for closer co-operation with EU colleagues.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07062764000032"></a>The Council took stock of progress of negotiations on the draft framework decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, conditional release and alternative sanctions. There was support for the objectives of this proposal and for the general direction of negotiations. However, the Council was unable to reach a decision on the application of dual criminality at this stage of negotiations. Discussions on the whole proposal will continue at working group level.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07062764000033"></a>Over lunch, the presidency got broad support for a proposal for web-based exchange of information between member states on violent video games using age limits and in co-operation with industry. The presidency asked for greater exchange of information between the member states on banned games.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07062764000034"></a>The presidency sought agreement on the framework decision on criminal procedural rights, reverting to a text that included within its scope cases wholly within domestic jurisdiction. It asked those member states that opposed such a wide scope to change their positions, noting that all had committed to some action in this field. The proposal tabled remained unacceptable to several member states, including the UK, and we regret that the compromise package discussed at the April JHA Council, comprising EU law covering defined cross-border cases along with a resolution on wide-ranging practical measures that might bring real benefits, was not pursued.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07062764000035"></a>The Council took note of the discussions on the horizontal approach in relation to certain offences, which concluded that it is too early to take a final decision on whether a horizontal approach to definitions of offences is required, and on the progress of negotiations on the directive for the protection of the environment through criminal law.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07062764000036"></a>The Commission presented its communication on cyber-crime. Estonia circulated a paper on recent cyber-attacks.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07062764000037"></a>There was a state of play report on Rome II and the conciliation with the European Parliament was noted.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07062764000038"></a>Council conclusions were adopted on the global approach to migration, integration, violent video games, e-justice and the procedure for handling legislative files containing first-pillar proposals relevant to the development of criminal law policy.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07062764000040"></a>On 15 March 2007, when I announced the new funding provision for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, I said that land values in the Olympic Park were expected to increase considerably as a result of the investment we are making and that the lottery good causes, having contributed a further &#163;675 million to the Olympics, should share in any such windfall.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07062764000041"></a>I also said that the Mayor and I had agreed that we would rewrite our memorandum of understanding and put in place profit-sharing arrangements to enable the lottery and future regeneration needs of the local area to benefit from the returns on the investment that we are making in the Olympic Park.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07062764000042"></a>The Mayor and I have now agreed a new memorandum of understanding, which will enable the lottery, as well as the local area, to benefit from the returns in investment that we are making in the Olympic Park.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="07062764000043"></a>The memorandum provides that, after the London Development Agency (LDA) has been reimbursedfor its land acquisition costs and disturbance compensation payments (which are not expected to exceed &#163;650 million), the proceeds of the land and property disposals, as and when made, shall be split between DCMS and LDA in a two-stage process.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="07062764000044"></a>First, three-quarters of the additional National Lottery income that we called on (&#163;506 million) will be repaid, through DCMS, along with a quarter of the LDA&#146;s costs (&#163;125 million) associated with the remediation and disposal of land and buildings in the Olympic Park. This will happen on a pro rata basis.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07062764000045"></a>When this is done, the National Lottery&#151;again through my department&#151;will be reimbursed the remaining quarter of its contribution (&#163;169 million) and the LDA will receive the outstanding three-quarters of its costs (&#163;375 million). Again, this will be on a pro rata basis.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07062764000046"></a>If there is a surplus once the repayments have been made, the Government will discuss with the Mayor how best to use this money.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07062764000047"></a>These arrangements are set out in the revised memorandum of understanding, copies of which I have placed in the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="70627-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07062764000048"></a>This is a good deal for the National Lottery, for those who benefit from its projects and for London. It fulfils the promise that I made in my Statement to this House on 15 March. It should give lottery distributors real confidence that the additional funding necessary for a successful Olympic and Paralympic Games will be repaid&#151;providing them and the whole country with a further 2012 dividend.</p>

This provision was removed by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. There is, however, no formal appeal process for refused citizenship applications, although it has been the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s practice for many years to consider representations against refusal in order to assist applicants better to understand why they have been refused and to ensure that flawed refusal decisions are quickly remedied. The option to apply for judicial review of a decision has always been available. The Border and Immigration Agency is reviewing the wording that is currently used in its standard refusal letters.</p>
