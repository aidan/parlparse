<a name="20611-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Medical Schools: Teaching Staff </center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether their commitments on medical training are compatible with cuts in teaching staff at medical schools.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, the additional costs of teaching the increased number of medical students were fully taken into account at the last spending review. The Department of Health and the Higher Education Funding Council are monitoring implementation of medical school expansion and will assess whether shortages of clinical academic staff are an issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I note the Minister's reply, but I hope that in monitoring the situation the Government will recognise that the current situation is extremely dire. Redundancies have taken place or are planned at a host of medical colleges including Bart's, Imperial College, King's, Leicester, Leeds and Newcastle. There are 300 unfilled academic posts in our medical schools, yet we anticipate a 63 per cent increase in medical students up to 2005. The Minister will undoubtedly be aware that this is in large part due to the vagaries of the research assessment exercise, which is grossly underfunded and operates against academic medicine. When will the Government get their act together and have genuinely joined-up government with the Higher Education Funding Council?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has made a number of comments. However, on the core question of universities' ability to handle the increase in medical school places, which is critical to implementation of the NHS Plan, I remind him that medical schools bid for extra places on the basis of their statement that they can recruit the required number of staff to teach the medical students admitted to their schools. In each of the past three years, despite the problems they have talked about, universities have in fact exceeded their targets. I am not complacent and the Government are not complacent&#151;we are monitoring the situation&#151;but I do not believe that the situation is as bleak as the noble Lord suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that there is a longstanding agreement under which clinical academic staff in medical schools <P>


<a name="column_126"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are expected to spend up to six half-days a week in clinical work and up to five half-days in teaching and research? Is he aware that a recent survey has indicated that, because of pressure by NHS managers to see more and more patients, many clinical academic staff are spending between 40 and 58 hours a week in clinical work to the detriment of their teaching and their research productivity? Is this not a major disincentive to the recruitment of clinical academics, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said? What will the Government do to see that that longstanding agreement is implemented?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, if there are pressures in the system in relation to the employment of clinical academics&#151;both from the NHS in terms of teaching commitment and from universities in terms of research commitment&#151;then that is clearly one of the issues that the Department of Health and the Higher Education Funding Council will have to explore and discuss. That is why we recently announced the establishment of a strategic alliance between those two organisations to pick up the very issues that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, talked about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is it not a fact that training encompasses not only undergraduate training but postgraduate training? There is an impossible situation in which we have a severe shortage of medical consultant staff but people cannot find training places in order to become consultant staff. The National Health Service is suffering desperately as a result. What answer does the Minister have to the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the NHS is increasing considerably the number of doctors it employs. As the noble Baroness suggests, to do that we shall have to expand the number of medical school places. At the same time, we are depending on our hard-pressed medical staff to make a major contribution to the teaching of those medical students, which inevitably produces pressure and bottlenecks in the system. The noble Baroness may well have been referring to an article in The Times on 7th June by Sir Peter Morris, president of the Royal College of Surgeons. Of course we are discussing with the Royal College and with other medical bodies how we should tackle those issues. They are not easy to deal with, but we are determined to tackle them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Turnberg: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that responsibility for the clear reduction in funding for medical schools lies with the Department for Education and Skills? Does he agree that co-ordination between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills might be worthy of greater effort?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, yes, this is a partnership between the education and the health sectors. It is clearly incumbent on my department, on the DfES and on the Higher Education Funding <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Council to work together. That is why we formed the strategic alliance between the Department of Health and the HEFC. Later in the month, my right honourable friend Mr John Hutton is meeting with Mrs Margaret Hodge at the DfES and with the BMA to discuss some of these issues. We shall continue to ensure that both departments work together to monitor the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that there is a problem? Does he further accept that a whole new batch of medical students will start in September? Can the House be assured that all this co-ordination and the meetings later in the month will result in positive steps to deal with the problem by September?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the fact is that the medical schools that have taken part in our expansion programme have all given commitments that they will meet the demands being placed upon them. As I say, the record over the past three years is that not only have medical schools met those targets, they have exceeded them. Of course, some medical schools are currently facing certain issues and challenges. In the recent research assessment exercise, some medical schools did better than others. But, overall, there is no hard evidence to suggest that we shall not meet those medical education targets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, is not the simple answer to pay doctors who teach in hospitals rather more money than they receive at present?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that it is simply a question of what doctors are paid. We have an independent pay review body. The Government have accepted the recommendations of the review bodies in each year that they have reported during our term of office. As I indicated, I believe that we need to examine the dual pressures placed on clinical academics by their responsibilities to both the NHS and the universities. However, I also believe that we are receiving tremendous support throughout the country for these expanded medical places and for the remarkable increase in doctors which will come about as a result of that expansion.

<A NAME="20611-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What prospect they now see of an end to the uncertainties and hazards experienced by passengers on the London Underground.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the recent announcement that London Underground has signed contracts for the modernisation of the Tube will end <P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the uncertainties over funding and deliver a massive, much-needed injection of resources into the Underground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether I could gently inquire what on earth is going on. Would I be right to suppose that a kind of trench warfare is taking place with Mr Kiley and the Mayor on one side and the Department of Transport and the Treasury on the other, with ammunition being supplied to both sides by over-paid consultants? One begins to wonder what attention is being given to passengers. Are the Government satisfied about the safety of the system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I always enjoy the definition given by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, of "gently". No trench warfare is going on between the Mayor and the Department of Transport. In fact, we are on target to transfer the assets to Transport for London later this year. The negotiations on that point are going well.
<P>

<a name="20611-01_para0"></a>As to the question of over-paid consultants, the amounts spent have certainly not been comparable with the vast amounts of expenditure on consultants incurred by the previous government during the disastrous privatisation of the railway system. In fact, although the costs are high, they are always high. They always seem to me to be too high, but we have made considerable savings by using the same consultants for both the Government and London Transport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the issue of safety, to which noble Lord, Lord Peyton, referred at the end of his question, is the noble Lord satisfied that all measures have been taken to ensure that full safety will be achieved under these new arrangements? Is he aware, for example, that yesterday an incident of poor maintenance of track involving a private contractor was reported from Wembley Park?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the issue of safety is paramount but it is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive, which will report shortly on the safety aspects of the public/private partnership. If it makes recommendations for changes, those changes will have to take place. As for the incident&#151;or lack of incident because the defects were discovered before any incident took place&#151;at Wembley Park, is it not rather a good thing that that discovery took place first?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, did my noble friend see the editorial in the Independent on Sunday which listed winners and losers and described who did well and badly during the Jubilee celebrations? The clear winner was London Underground. The newspaper said that, when put to the test, it showed how it can handle large events because 1 million passengers used the Underground in an hour at the height of the celebrations. Would it not be a good idea if we spent a little time praising London <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Underground when it does well, as clearly it did last week, rather than griping endlessly in the way that Fleet Street wants us to do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely with my noble friend Lord Faulkner about what happened last week. But, of course, the change goes far wider than the events of a single week. The figure for train kilometres run&#151;in other words, the capacity available for passengers&#151;has been increasing yearly since 1999. Last year's figure was nearly 65.5 million as compared with just over 63 million in 1999-2000. Those are real increases in capacity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may suggest to the noble Lord that the safety issues have not really been satisfied. The RMT, which has 9,000 members among London Underground staff, is holding a ballot on whether to strike in protest at key safety issues. The incident at Wembley Park on the Jubilee Line, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, came to light only because of a leaked e-mail from a manager at London Underground. Will the Minister assure us that the department will take up the matter with London Underground so that it addresses these key safety issues and, in particular, those relating to the incident at Wembley Park?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as I made entirely clear, the issue of safety is a matter for the Health and Safety Executive. The Government will not lean on the Health and Safety Executive in any way. It is responsible for ensuring safety on the Underground. If it says something has to be done, it will be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister or his officials given attention to the signalling problem on London Underground? I am a regular traveller, and trains sit in tunnels for hours, which is always due to the signalling breaking down. Why is the signalling on London Underground so inadequate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I served on the GLC transport committee for a number of years and am well aware of the financing difficulties of London Transport and London Underground over a considerable number of years. There are serious defects in signalling. There are also serious defects in the quality of the rolling stock and the track. That is why there will be £16 billion of investment over the next 15 years; nearly £8.5 billion on trains and signalling; nearly £4 billion on track and around £3.5 billion on stations. Nothing of that scale has been undertaken before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, did I hear the Minister correctly when he said that the same consultants were being used by the Government and the Mayor? Does not that seem quaint, if I am right, bearing in mind the profound differences between the two organisations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it must be my fault that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, misheard <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me. I did not say that the same consultants were being used by the Government and the Mayor; I said by the Government and London Transport. The Mayor's organisation is Transport for London.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, this is a hypothetical question, and none the worse for that. We do not know whether there will be any elected Members. The Government have asked Parliament to consider further reform of the House of Lords. The terms of reference of the Joint Committee ask it to consider and report on a full range of options for composition. Therefore, the facilities available to new Members would be a matter for the House to decide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that Answer. Does the noble and learned Lord, whose energy in reforming this House and in making it a more effective place is second to none, consider that matters would be greatly improved if research assistants were available, at least to the Front Bench, to enable it properly to prepare and execute its duties in Committee and at other stages of Bills in this House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is a reasonable point. Those matters are kept constantly under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord why he thinks that that is a hypothetical Question. Is he unaware of the fact that there are already elected Members in this House?

<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, as with all criminal charges, successful prosecution depends on the evidence that is brought before the courts.

<FONT SIZE=3>with children of both sexes under the age of 16. We intend to introduce modernised and strengthened legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that Answer. He will be aware of the recent case of a girl of 12 and a man of 22. Is he aware that the numbers of reported cases of intercourse with girls under the age of 16 in 1988 were some 2,552, and that that has fallen, 20 years later, to 1,133, and that the number of convictions has fallen from 339 in 1988 to 225 today? Does not that suggest that the law is not being enforced? Is not that a serious matter? Similar statistics apply in the case of girls under the age of 13, and I understand that in that case the offence qualifies as rape.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, first, I am aware of the case to which the noble Baroness referred. It would be wrong for me to comment on the details of that case. However, it is ultimately for the prosecuting authorities to decide whether or not a prosecution will be brought. That must be decided on an objective analysis of the evidence. It would not be in the interests of any child for a prosecution to be brought which the prosecuting authorities thought would fail. One should leave such decisions to the prosecuting authorities.
<P>

<a name="20611-02_para0"></a>As regards the second point, I am aware of the figures to which the noble Baroness referred. It would not be useful for me to speculate on the reasons, but I do not think that they are just to do with the law not being enforced in the same way as it has been in the past. I think that it has quite a lot to do with a change in social attitudes. However, I reiterate that this Government take the view that protecting people under 16 is a vital aspect of the criminal law. We shall bring forward proposals in relation to that later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, first, given that the sex offences review team published its recommendations for consultation nearly two years ago, can the Minister give the House a timetable for when new legislation will be brought before Parliament? Secondly, given the Government's commitment to joined-up government; the extremely high level of teenage pregnancy in this country, second only to the United States; and the increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases among young people, how will the noble and learned Lord's department liaise with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills in order to approach this raft of inter-related issues in an integrated way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as regards timing, I cannot go beyond saying that we intend to introduce strengthened legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. I cannot go further than that from where I stand at present. I agree with the proposition underlying the second part of the question asked by the noble Baroness. There must be very close liaison between the Home Office, the Department of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Health and other departments, in particular the Department for Education and Skills, in relation to all the issues to which the noble Baroness referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that there is no general principle of law which requires the victim to give evidence in a prosecution case? That is evidenced, clearly, by the fact that if there were, we would never secure a conviction for murder.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the proposition advanced by my noble friend. It is not necessary as a matter of law for a victim to make a complaint before a prosecution can be brought. However, in a case which is not murder or manslaughter, the reality in many cases is that if the victim does not make a complaint, that may well give rise in practice to difficulty in obtaining a conviction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble and learned Lord agree that in the case of the 12 year-old girl, the police said that they were powerless to act? Are we accepting in that case that if they were powerless to act, the case of a child under the age of 12 who is abused cannot be investigated unless the child gives evidence? Does not the noble and learned Lord agree that the police have a duty to protect not only parents but children too?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the police certainly have a duty to protect children and they would be the first to accept that. As regards their powers, as the Director of Public Prosecutions made clear subsequently, the need for the victim to complain or give evidence is not a legal requirement. However, the police and the prosecuting authorities must analyse the evidence objectively in such cases. They must decide in a particular case whether the absence of evidence from the complainant will lead to a reduced chance of conviction. If they come to that conclusion&#151;that is a matter for them&#151;they should not bring the prosecution because it would be damaging for everyone involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that while law is clearly important, individual personal values are far more so? If he accepts that kind of thinking, will the Government, with the whole of their power, encourage education on abstinence from sex before marriage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, it is absolutely clear that individual values are vitally important in this area. The role of education in relation to instilling values that we all regard as acceptable is absolutely vital.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Bristol: </B>   My Lords, this is a very serious issue. We must feel for the families involved. <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But does the noble and learned Lord agree that the law by itself cannot make us good and that the matter requires, as has already been indicated, not only education but a multi-pronged approach? Given the significance of the increase in sexually transmitted diseases and the possible problems of future infertility, can the Minister tell us whether education on values and information given to both children and parents will also be a priority for the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I could not agree more with the right reverend Prelate's preliminary remark; namely, that the law cannot make us good and that individual values, education and instilling in children and adults alike the right values are incredibly important. I also thoroughly endorse what he said about the importance of education. We have made it clear that education in relation to the issues that we are discussing is a priority for the Department for Education and Skills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that as long ago as 1984 the Criminal Law Revision Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Lawton, published its recommendations on sexual offences? Chapter 5 of that report was concerned solely with intercourse with young girls. In paragraph 5.10 we recommended&#151;I was a member of that committee&#151;the abolition of the young man's defence. Perhaps the Minister will agree that it may be time for the Government to look again at the recommendations in that report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I was aware of that report. The noble and learned Lord will also be aware of the document published last year by the Home Office, entitled Setting the Boundaries, which takes up a number of ideas in the 1984 report. As I said, we hope to bring forward legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the answer to the Question of my noble friend Lady Young is not a matter of changing the law but of evidence? Since it is an offence to have intercourse with a girl under 16, whether or not she consents, if there is other evidence that the man has had intercourse with her, a prosecution can take place whether or not the girl is willing to give evidence. To that extent, her willingness to give evidence is, to some degree, irrelevant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, in the case to which the noble Baroness referred there was an issue about evidence. Plainly, there is an offence of unlawful sexual intercourse between a man and a woman under 16. The law already exists in relation to that. I accept the point made by the noble Lord, but I do not accept that the law is necessarily perfect in relation to that. Setting the Boundaries indicates the way in which the law can be changed in order to provide better protection. As I say, legislation will be brought forward at the first possible opportunity.

<a name="20611-03_para4"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<a name="20611-03_para5"></a>Clause 29 [Statutory dispute resolution procedures]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McCarthy </B>   moved Amendment No. 34:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 35, line 23, at end insert "by provisions which do not make the statutory dispute resolution procedures less favourable to the employee"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-03_para6"></a><P>

<a name="20611-03_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment takes us back to the statutory dispute procedures where the Secretary of State is given a considerable amount of flexibility to change, alter, add, take away and reduce the procedures. He can modify them. He can amend them in the light of experience, in the light of caseload and indeed in the light of anything else. The amendment proposes that as a result of the power which the Secretary of State, has the statutory procedures should not become worse. It suggests that the modifications should not be less favourable to employees.
<P>

<a name="20611-03_para8"></a>When this issue and clause were debated in Committee, I was unwise enough to say that the provisions in the statutory procedures were so bad that they could not be any worse. I have thought about that and that was clearly wrong. They could certainly be better. There could be something in the statutory procedures to say that one had to have an effective investigation before the employer took any decision. We would not be against that. There could be something in the statutory procedures&#151;we hope that in time the Government might see that this is a good idea&#151;about the suspension alternative. There could be something in the statutory procedures about taking into account the reasonableness of the decision. Indeed, we would not mind&#151;in fact we would welcome it&#151;if the Government decided to abolish the modified procedures which have never been fully explained.
<P>

<a name="20611-03_para9"></a>Nevertheless, it could be worse. It could be much worse. I do not say that the Government intend to make the situation much worse. I do not say that the Government intend to make it worse. I say that the power in the regulations would enable them to do certain things. For example, the exemptions which we hope to see might be taken away. There might be no exemptions. The modified procedures could be extended to cover other issues that we presume that they would not cover now. The 28 days delay could rise to 35 days. More steps could be added to restrict the access to the tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-03_para10"></a>When we raised these questions in Committee my noble friend Lord McIntosh began by reassuring us, but he said that our amendment at that time created several practical difficulties. He said that our amendment,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"raises issues about what constitutes treatment that is more or less favourable to the employee. Different views could reasonably be taken in many circumstances and the tests would be difficult to apply in practice. We might be"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-03_para11"></a>
and this is the critical part I think&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"under certain circumstances, inviting judicial review . . . Amendment No. 162 . . . seeks to prevent us [the Government] from changing the admissibility criteria in any way that is less favourable to the employee".

<a name="column_136"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
Well, yes, of course; that is what we are trying to do. He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it could have uncertain results and invite applications for judicial review. The policy underlying the amendment is too restrictive. It is biased against employer interests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-03_para13"></a>
It is an attempt to maintain a balance. Presumably, the Government have maintained the balance, and we are saying that they should not intervene to make the situation worse. My noble friend continued:

<br>

<a name="20611-03_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20611-03_para15"></a>What he did not deny, as far as I can tell&#151;I am asking whoever answers for the Government to deny it today&#151;was that the Government may move in the direction that we seek to deny them and make the procedures worse.
<P>

<a name="20611-03_para16"></a>Of course, I should like the Government to accept our amendment, but if they will not I should like them to say that they have no intention of moving in the direction that our amendment would preclude. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the statutory procedures represent a significant innovation. We have consulted on them. They have been scrutinised in detail both here and in another place and the procedures have been amended as a result. We are as confident as we can be that they will work in practice. However, experience, unforeseen events or changing circumstances may throw into question the use of particular words&#151;or possibly whole sections of the procedures. It is therefore eminently sensible to build some flexibility into the Bill allowing us to change the procedures in the light of developments.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para0"></a>Clause 29(2)(a) contains an important order-making power enabling the Secretary of State to change the statutory procedures in Schedule 2. Before using those powers, the Secretary of State must consult the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Orders must be introduced following the affirmative resolution procedure. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform considers the power to be "appropriate". The amendment tabled by my noble friend would limit the use of the power to ensure that the procedures were not changed in a way which made them less favourable to the employee.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para1"></a>We have two problems with the amendment. First, it would seriously imbalance the power. As I stated, the power is there to deal with unforeseen circumstances&#151;to correct any practical problems or difficulties in interpretation. If a problem emerged that mainly affected the employer, it might be difficult to use the power to make the necessary adjustments to the procedures because employees might incur some loss&#151;however minor&#151;as a result. That is simply inequitable and would ensure that known deficiencies in the procedure would remain in place much longer than necessary.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para2"></a>Secondly&#151;this point was made by my noble friend Lord McIntosh in the passage cited by my noble friend Lord McCarthy&#151;it is by no means easy in all circumstances to determine what is or is not <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"favourable" to the employee. For example, it is far from clear whether employees would be advantaged or disadvantaged if the requirement to set out grievances in writing were replaced by an obligation to make the complaint orally. Some might benefit if they could not express themselves well in writing, whereas others might lose if they found it difficult to explain themselves clearly and unambiguously in the spoken word.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para3"></a>So I fear that we are not prepared to agree to the amendment and I hope that, in the light of my explanation, my noble friend will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, I have two questions for him. First, is he not aware that the formula of what is not less favourable to employees appears frequently in other areas of statute law and has never caused a difficulty of the kind that he describes?
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para4"></a>Secondly, my noble and learned friend suggests that the power to change things in a way that may be less favourable to employees is to deal with unforeseen events. This happens again and again in the Bill: the Government take powers and then say, "Oh, we cannot tell you to what they may apply; it is all unforeseen". Cannot he produce one example in which it would be reasonable to make a less favourable provision for employees? None of the examples that he gave was in fact of that kind. It is extraordinary that the Government want to take powers for events that are totally unforeseeable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, on the first point, yes, I am aware that there are provisions in employment law describing procedures no less favourable to a particular group. I am also aware, as is my noble friend, that almost all of those provisions have accreted a huge amount of case law around them as to what they mean.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para5"></a>On the second point, the starting point for the provision is that we think that we have the statutory procedures right. It follows that we do not at present identify changes that will be required. By their nature, the changes are unforeseeable at present. But, in the course of my remarks, I gave an example; namely, evidence to be given in writing as opposed to orally. I do not envisage that that change will be required, but it identifies the problem. I hope that I have adequately answered my noble friend's two questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I fear that I do not agree. There are several points to be made. Of course, we do not deny, and the amendment does not preclude, that the Government will from time to time want to make changes in the light of various developments. But on the question of what is less favourable to the employee, I thought that the Government had made a great deal in this House, in another place and in Routes to Resolution of the fact that this is a minimum procedure. It is not everything, for God's sake.
<P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para6"></a>It is certainly not what is in the ACAS code. We have frequently said, "Why not include a little of what is in the ACAS code?" "No, no, no", the Government say, "It is a minimum. The employer&#151;especially those poor employers who have never before had a procedure&#151;could not possibly embrace more than what is in the minimum procedure". OK, I accept that, it is pretty minimum, but in fact it could get worse. In the example that my noble and learned friend gave, it is impossible to say whether the situation is worse or better. With respect, that is frivolous. My examples of ways in which the situation could be made significantly worse are substantive and they were not challenged by my noble and learned friend.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para7"></a>Finally, I am not at this point saying that I expect the Government to accept the amendment. We have for a long time been used to tabling amendments that are not accepted. But we would be making some progress if only Ministers would say that some of the concerns that underlie the amendment are unjustified and unfair and that they do not intend to act in that way. They could say that they do not intend to make the minimum procedure worse. That is what I ask them to do, but they will not do it and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 35:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 35, line 33, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para9"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(4) Minor and inconsequential breach by an employer or employee of the requirements of Schedule 2 shall not result in his suffering any detriment in any proceedings before an employment tribunal and the employer shall not be deemed thereby to have wrongly dismissed the employee."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-04_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 29 introduces Schedule 2, which sets out the statutory dispute resolution procedure. Unlike other procedural clauses in the Bill&#151;for example, Clauses 23 to 28&#151;the schedule relates solely to claims under the Bill and does not alter employment tribunal procedure generally. The whole tenor of the Bill's procedure is one of informality, recognising that applicants may not have easy access to legal advice or support from a trade union and that employers will more often than not be small businesses&#151;very small businesses, in many cases&#151;the proprietor of which has neither the time nor, in many cases, the money to secure professional assistance.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para11"></a>Schedule 2 sets out the procedure in two-and-a-half pages containing three separate parts comprising a total of five chapters. It goes into minute detail, much of which is rightly designed to resolve the differences between the parties by agreement or discussion without recourse to the tribunal. When introducing the Bill, the Minister made it clear that it was a great attempt to make things much more informal and to try where possible to avoid employers and employees having to end up at tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para12"></a>Of course, we have absolutely no objection to that procedure. We think that it is fine. However, with no disrespect to employees or employers, who may be acting for themselves in person and without skilled <P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advice, it will be all too easy for one of the many procedural steps to be taken out of time, carried out incorrectly, or even missed altogether.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para13"></a>About 300 years ago English courts began to erode the rules of "strict pleading" under which the courts of common law sometimes dismissed cases, not on their merits, but because of some defect in the form of the documents presented to the court. There is a legal maxim de minimis non curat lex&#151;the law does not concern itself with trifles&#151;which has its origin back in Roman times where it was expressed as de minimis non curat praetor&#151;a praetor does not occupy himself with petty matters. There is no reason why employment tribunals should be exempt from this long and persuasive line of precedent.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para14"></a>The Minister, in his reply to me at Committee stage, said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as presently drafted, the procedures are clear and uncluttered".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para15"></a>
I agree with that. He then said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each action within them is simple to understand and apply".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para16"></a>
I agree with that, too. He also said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are no convoluted twists and turns".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para17"></a>
I agree with that. He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I feel there is only limited scope for 'minor and inconsequential' breaches to occur".&#151;[Official Report, 18/3/02; CWH.189.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para18"></a>
I profoundly disagree with that. I do not believe that the Minister thinks that that is a serious argument. We know that millions of pounds of social security entitlement is unclaimed because those entitled do not know how to get their entitlement. There are many things that the average person does not know what to do with when filling in forms, and so on. Every government department can tell tales of forms&#151;even those as simple as passports and driving licence applications&#151;being rejected because they were incorrectly filled in.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para19"></a>If the Minister has attended as many counts as I have on election night, he would know how many voters do not seem to understand the simple process of putting a cross in a box next to the candidate's name. Those voters would not claim that&#151;and I repeat my earlier quotation:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is only limited scope for minor and inconsequential breaches to occur".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-04_para20"></a>
I want to be careful not to be disrespectful to anyone or to over-generalise. However, it is a fact that many of the litigants before the tribunals, in person and without professional assistance, can often be employees with limited academic qualifications or, in many cases, with limited English. It is equally true that in the case of employers, many of them acting in haste may also not have the most excellent command of English. Surely there is no harm in protecting employers or employees from the consequences of what would only be a minor procedural error&#151;and I emphasise the word "procedural"&#151;which might otherwise wreck a perfectly valid case.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para21"></a>It is not a scope for cunning parties to avoid what the Minister called the "clear and uncluttered" procedures laid down in the second schedule. The <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tribunal itself will decide whether an omission is minor and inconsequential, entirely within its own discretion, depending on the individual circumstances of each case.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para22"></a>The civil courts, which according to the Government the tribunals are supposed to mirror as far as possible, have what they call a "slip rule" which allows minor errors to be corrected or ignored. It is no assault on the "clear and uncluttered" provisions of the second schedule to allow the same leniency to unqualified parties to proceedings before the tribunal in cases under this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-04_para23"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble and learned Lord who is to answer that, given that the aim is to try to take matters out of tribunals or make matters simpler, it can do no harm at all to the law and can only make it easier. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we debated an identical amendment in Grand Committee. The noble Baroness made her point forcefully and well there and has done so again today. She will forgive me if I rely on similar arguments to those which I relied on at that time.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para0"></a>The amendment is based on the premise that the procedures are complicated and contain obscure and minor requirements which parties of a whole range of types, which she has indicated, could easily fail to follow in full. That is simply not the case. The procedures are spare, simple and easy to understand. They represent the minimum core elements of any procedure. Some have referred to the procedures as "skeletal" or even "sub-minimal". Therefore, I believe that there is little scope for parties to misunderstand what they should do at each stage, even after a fairly swift reading. Minor slips should not occur.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para1"></a>Later, we shall be debating amendments regarding the sending of written communications. Those will permit parties to send either a copy or the original of any written communication which is required under the procedures. Those amendments will reduce further the possibility of minor slips arising.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para2"></a>The procedures are mainly drafted as a series of concrete steps. That is important because concrete steps are easy to verify if they have been undertaken. As far as possible, we have avoided references to any qualitative requirements in the procedures, which are intrinsically much more difficult to pin down. We have thereby reduced the scope for argument to arise about what the procedures require and what they entail.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para3"></a>It may help the noble Baroness if I say that minor and inconsequential breaches of the statutory procedures by employers would not entitle the employees to resign and claim, either in the ordinary courts or before tribunals, that they had been dismissed.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para4"></a>We are also concerned that the amendment would upset the simplicity of the procedures. As the noble Baroness explicitly says, it would encourage parties to debate and dispute whether failures to follow the procedures were "minor and inconsequential" or "more significant". That would in turn generate more <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussion about compliance with the procedures than the substantive issues at stake. That cannot be the right way forward to encourage legal debate about those issues.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para5"></a>With the greatest of respect to the noble Baroness, this amendment deals with a phantom problem. It would create rancour and confusion at the workplace and it would encourage disputes before the industrial tribunal, which I know the noble Baroness does not want to occur. Therefore, with the greatest of respect to the noble Baroness, I invite her to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, it is most polite of the Minister to preface everything he says with "the greatest of respect" and to point out that I moved the same amendment actively and forcefully in Grand Committee. However, I would say to no effect, because the Minister has repeated exactly what he said then. I did not accept it then; had I done so I would not have tabled the amendment now.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para6"></a>I do not believe that the Minister was listening carefully to what I said. I did not suggest that the rules were not clear; I agreed that they were not convoluted; I agreed that most people could understand them. However, I pointed out to the Minister that, nevertheless, in filling in forms, as far as procedural error is concerned, sometimes people make errors because they do not understand. There would not be huge debate as to whether something was a minor infringement because, as I made quite clear, the tribunal would say whether it was. That would be the end of the discussion.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para7"></a>The Minister is nodding&#151;I do beg the Minister's pardon, but I thought he was nodding as if to say, yes, he agreed. Now he is shaking his head in the other direction, so he clearly does not agree. However, I say to the Minister that if someone tables an amendment in the same tones, it does not mean that he or she did not listen to the answer: it means that the answer was not accepted. In my view, the Minister did not listen appropriately to the arguments.
<P>

<a name="20611-05_para8"></a>The Minister may be 100 per cent correct, but perhaps he would like to clarify the point I made about minor and inconsequential matters. I did not understand or accept what he said. In my opinion, the matter should not be decided against one party because either party had made a minor or inconsequential error. I believe that in his last few words the Minister said that the matter would not be serious. Perhaps he would repeat what he said. Otherwise, I must say to the Minister that I do not accept his answer and we would move to a different conclusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I speak with great diffidence because of the ruthless attack that the noble Baroness made on my previous speech. However, perhaps I may help. My point about minor and inconsequential was that in tabling the amendment the noble Baroness was urging us to let industrial tribunals decide the issues. That would inevitably generate doubt and discussion about <P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>compliance and it would encourage disputes in the tribunal. That was unjustified by what I described as a "phantom" problem.

<A NAME="20611-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may clarify one point with the Minister. He was so polite to me at the beginning and spoke with respect and so forth, but he then suggested that I attacked him. Most definitely I did not. However, the amendment, which deals with minor and inconsequential breaches, should not result in suffering any detriment. That was all it was about. The Minister then gave his explanation but I did not catch what he said. I ask for clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I said that minor and inconsequential breaches of the statutory procedures would not entitle the employees to resign and to claim either in the ordinary courts or before tribunals that they had been dismissed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, it is a complicated issue but this is such a minor matter that the Minister could have accepted it without any problem. I should like to test the opinion of the House.

"(4) Nothing in this section or in Schedule 2 shall affect the operation of section 92 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (right to written statement of reasons for dismissal)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-06_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the aim of the amendment is to make clear that Schedule 2 is not intended to undermine the right to a written statement of reasons for dismissal, as specified in Section 92 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. We are asking the Government for the same kind of reassurance that we sought on the previous amendment. No doubt the Government will say that they do not intend to undermine Section 92 of the 1996 Act. Nevertheless, they could accept the amendment and make that clear. If they do not accept the amendment, they can say so.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para1"></a>Section 92 states that an employee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is entitled to . . . particulars of the reasons for . . . the dismissal",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para2"></a>
in a form,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"admissible in evidence in any proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para3"></a>
The terms of the statutory procedure do not clear that hurdle. The terms do not entitle the worker to be told the principal reason or reasons for dismissal&#151;whether they are fair or unfair. They do not say that the employee is entitled to very much. All the employer has to give is his final decision&#151;not the reasons.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para4"></a>The schedule states that the employer must set out in writing the employee's alleged conduct or characteristics or other circumstances that lead him to contemplate dismissal or disciplinary action against the employee. That relates to the view that the employer takes, to set the procedure in motion. At this point, the employer has not heard the worker's case. The employer must send a copy of the statement to the employee and invite him or her to attend a meeting to discuss the matter.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para5"></a>Under the normal statutory procedure, there follows a meeting or hearing&#151;after which the employer must inform the employee of the decision. The employer does not necessarily have to provide the reasons or explain his reaction to the employee's case. The employer can simply say, "I have decided that you <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are going" and notify the employee of his or her right to appeal. There is nothing about grounds or reasons&#151;and not much to make it clear that the statement could be used in a court of law.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para6"></a>If I had time, I would explain why the modified procedure is even worse. It seems to be assumed that the employer can merely say, "I am dismissing you. That's it". The modified procedure does not even embody a proper appeal. Under the statutory procedure, contemplation is all. The employer contemplates unfair dismissal: "I contemplate dismissing you for the following reasons". What if the worker says, "It wasn't me. It was someone else. I was never warned that this might happen. I have been working for the company 10 years and have never received a formal correction. I was provoked. I am entitled to know what you think about the excuses and justification that I advanced"? Nothing in the statutory procedures states that the employee should have an answer.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para7"></a>The Government can deal with the matter in a number of ways. We would like them to accept the amendment&#151;or they could say, "We can't do it today but we will ensure that the regulations will make clear that employees will have the kind or rights already available to them under Section 92 of the 1996 Act". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, although Amendment No. 36 was not tabled in Grand Committee, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn sought and received assurance that the right to a written statement for dismissal&#151;the Section 92 right, to which my noble friend Lord McCarthy has referred&#151;was not adversely affected by the Bill and the statutory procedures. I repeat that assurance again today. Under Section 92 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employer must supply, at the request of the employee, a written statement setting out the reasons for a dismissal. That right to a written statement applies to employees who have been employed for a year or more, although that condition is waived in certain special circumstances surrounding pregnancy and maternity arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para8"></a>That section of the 1996 Act is not changed by the Bill. If a qualifying employee requests a written statement, she or he must be provided with one as now. The existence of a pre-existing Step 1 letter from the employer in which the reasons for a proposed dismissal are set out does not change the position. When the employee requests the written statement, the employer must write again setting out the reasons. Even if the reasons are as set out in the Step 1 letter, the employer must still write again, although on such occasions the employer may choose to shorten the reply by enclosing a copy of the original Step 1 letter. Therefore, we agree with the proposition stated in the amendment&#151;Section 92 is unaffected by the statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para9"></a>However, the amendment is unnecessary. Generally, as my noble friend Lord McCarthy will recognise, it is bad practice to itemise aspects of pre-existing legislation in a Bill which are left unaffected by the Bill. We would depart from that principle only <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where there was good reason to doubt that the pre-existing law was unaffected. We do not believe that there is room for any confusion or doubt of that kind here. Indeed, I am unaware that any organisation picked up this issue as a problem during consultations. In short, I do not believe that there is a need to introduce this amendment. In the light of those assurances, I hope that my noble friend Lord McCarthy will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I have no alternative, but I am not satisfied. I agree that the Government have said that what they are putting in the regulations will not adversely affect workers' rights under Section 92, but I do not see why the regulations cannot say that. I do not understand why that matter cannot be on the face of the Bill. I shall have to consider the issue again at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para11"></a>Schedule 2 [Statutory dispute resolution procedures]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall </B>   moved Amendment No. 37:

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "( ) When a disciplinary matter arises the employer should first establish the facts promptly."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-06_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak briefly. Since Committee stage, Ministers have, as they said they would, revisited this territory. Since we tabled this amendment, the Government have tabled Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 on the disciplinary side and Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 on the grievance side.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para14"></a>I am trying to anticipate what the Minister may say. The Government are saying that they will now pinpoint the basis for including in the statement the grounds given in it. Clearly, that goes some way to ensure that the whole of the relevant circumstances of the case are put on the table. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether that form of words will be introduced shortly, along with the words of giving an employee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reasonable opportunity to consider his response to that information".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para15"></a>
That means that the facts of the case will be fully on the table. Other noble Lords may want to probe this matter. If the answer is that we have made progress we shall consider that in the light of the Minister's comments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, I want to draw attention to the word "promptly". I have read Amendment No. 41, but it does not include the word "promptly". The reason I feel strongly about this matter is that in a previous life I dealt with cases in which an employer threatened disciplinary proceedings against an employee, but the facts of the case were not gathered promptly. There is nothing worse than continuing in an employment when it is <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believed that one has done something wrong. If the facts are not gathered quickly enough, an employee can have such a matter hanging over his or her head to the knowledge of other employees. Perhaps the Minister can tell the House how such a matter will be dealt with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   My Lords, I want to speak to Amendments Nos. 38 and 50. The amendments tabled by the Minister respond in some measure to the debate in Committee. Essentially the issue is whether or not a proper investigation has been conducted prior to the decision to dismiss. The purpose of adding the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and detail the evidence upon which he relies",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para16"></a>
is simply to ensure that that proper investigation has taken place prior to the decision. It is not only a matter of the protection of the employee&#151;although that is important&#151;but also of ensuring that the employer, who is given an additional hurdle in both the modified and the standard disciplinary procedures, is protected. Although the employer who complies with the additional procedures insures himself against a finding that the dismissal was automatically unfair, he is not protected against a finding that the dismissal was unfair for any other reason. It is important that the Government should go further and add more detail to their amendment to ensure that both the employee and the employer are protected by proper, full and detailed investigations prior to the decision to dismiss.

<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Lea. The amendments grouped with Amendment No. 37 mean that the Government&#151;my noble and learned friend will correct me if I am wrong&#151;will speak to Amendments Nos. 41, 47, 54 and 58 that raise entirely new matters. My noble and learned friend nods. Therefore, we have a quite inconvenient grouping which requires a debate within a debate. I want to speak to Amendments Nos. 41, 47, 54 and 58 and I want to know what they mean. The new matter introduced by the Government in those amendments does not answer the case put by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, but introduces a problem of an extremely delicate and serious nature. These amendments are what I may call the "basis" amendments.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para17"></a>I believe I understand what is meant in regard to the disciplinary procedure. The procedure must not continue unless,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the employer has informed the employee what the basis was for including in the statement . . . the ground or grounds given in it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para18"></a>
I can see what that means. The statement may say, "You have broken your duty in some way and I now give you the basis of that allegation". But Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 on the grievance statement relate to quite a different position. Amendment No. 54 requires the same thing and <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appears to be parallel to the disciplinary procedure. In my submission it is not. Amendment No. 54 states that the employee must inform the employer of the basis for the grievance. Amendment No. 58 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The employee must&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para19"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> (a) set out in writing&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> (i) the grievance, and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para21"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> (ii) the basis for it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-06_para22"></a><P>

<a name="20611-06_para23"></a>If we apply that provision to real life, we do not obtain the sort of answer that we received regarding discipline. What does the employee say? He sets out in his written statement, of which he sends a copy to the employer, "You treated me unfairly last Tuesday. You deprived me of my right to contractual overtime". Or he may say, "You have been threatening to treat me wrongly or dismiss me for exercising my rights to trade union activity". That is the grievance. What is the basis for the grievance? What else does he have to say? He has to say something else, because the new amendments require something more of the employee.
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para24"></a>This is exactly the sort of problem Judge Prophet was worried about in the procedures being introduced. What can the employee say when he has already said, "My grievance is that you have stopped me exercising my trade union rights", or, "You have deprived me of my contractual overtime"? Does he have to set out the contract or put in a pleading? Does he have to ask, "What are the basis of my trade union rights"? Does he have to refer to Section 46 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992?
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para25"></a>If he does not have to do that&#151;I apprehend that my noble and learned friend will be aghast at the thought that he has to quote some legal basis; he nods, so I am right&#151;what other basis will he make for his allegation that his trade union rights have been infringed? He has already said, "Last Tuesday you stopped me exercising my rights"; in the first case, a contractual right; in the second, a statutory right. What is the basis for that grievance? What do the Government mean by that requirement?
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para26"></a>Let it not be said that this is something meaningless or trivial, because a tribunal or, particularly, the Employment Appeal Tribunal or the Court of Appeal, will have to give it some meaning. It will have to say, "You, the employee, have set out your grievance in writing, which you are required to, and sent it to the employer, but you have not set out its basis"&#151;whatever that means. Will my noble and learned friend give me a precise and exact illustration of what the basis of a grievance would be for someone who has set out his grievance properly and fully, as one would hope, if it is not a reference to its legal origin; a right that he alleges has been contravened?
<P>

<a name="20611-06_para27"></a>I appreciate why the Government introduced the amendment on grievance procedures. If I may say so with respect to those who authored the amendment, it is a slipshod attempt to look even-handed; they have put in "basis" on disciplinary procedures, so they have put it in on grievance procedures. With great respect, they have not thought it through. What does basis mean in the grievance procedure once you have set out your grievance?

<a name="20611-06_para28"></a>That question needs answering rapidly, because if Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 slip through in a group of amendments that is about something else entirely, the courts will be faced with the deplorable situation of trying to find a basis where the basis has already been stated in the written document the employee is legally obliged to present. I hope that separate accounts will be given of Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 when my noble and learned friend replies. It is not like Committee stage; after his reply we cannot intervene. That is why I set out the problem at this stage.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment tabled by my noble friends Lord Lea of Crondall and Lady Gibson, but I have another reason for intervening. Government Amendment No. 47 raises the issue of misconduct. If accepted, it would pre-empt the amendments on misconduct which follow immediately in my name and the names of my noble friends.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para0"></a>It cannot be too heavily emphasised how serious it is for an employee to be dismissed on grounds of misconduct. It will not only affect his chances of obtaining comparable&#151;perhaps any&#151;employment, but it may also involve loss of benefit. I was for a number of years a member of a tribunal dealing with social security matters. We sometimes had to deal with appeals from dismissed ex-employees who had lost benefit. We used to rule that it was up to those who made the allegation of misconduct to establish it; the onus of proof was on them. If that obligation was not discharged to our satisfaction, the claimant succeeded. Nevertheless, it was a serious matter for the appellant.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para1"></a>Since the charge is so serious, every effort must be made to ensure that it is properly investigated. I am not at all certain that government Amendment No. 47 provides for such investigation. It can be difficult; there may have been disputes between employees; harassment and provocation; perhaps even allegations of sexual harassment. In certain circumstances it would clearly be unwise to take allegations at face value without investigation. It may not even be possible to come to a clear decision as to culpability, in which event a strong warning might be appropriate. In any event, suspension pending investigation would appear to be the wisest course.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para2"></a>Although the government amendment is an improvement on what was there before, it does not go far enough. I hope that when the Minister speaks to it he will set at rest some of my concerns and those of my noble friends. Amendment No. 47 does not provide for investigation and the possibility of warning and suspension. I hope that the Government will consider that point, at least before Third Reading. I shall not be able to move the amendments later on, which is why I am participating in the debate now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, before I begin to discuss this group of amendments, I should confirm that government Amendment No. 54 contains a drafting error. It deals only with the standard grievance procedure. Sub-paragraph (a) makes reference to "paragraph 4" of the modified dismissal <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and disciplinary procedure. In fact, the correct cross reference is to "paragraph 6"&#151;I know that noble Lords spotted the error for themselves&#151;which describes Step 1 of the standard grievance procedure. The error is self-evident. I would therefore ask for the reference to paragraph 4 to be treated as referring to paragraph 6.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para3"></a>The amendments arise from the many debates on investigations that have taken place during the Bill's passage. In Grand Committee on 18th March, I indicated that the Government would explore whether we could devise amendments on the topic that met the concerns expressed but avoided the known pitfalls.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para4"></a>It is worth recalling some of the main problems with introducing into the statutory procedures a reference to investigations. The procedures are written as a series of concrete and verifiable actions. It is intrinsically difficult to define the investigatory process in similar terms and in a way which would generally apply to many different cases and circumstances. There is thus a difficulty in referring to the term "investigations" within the statutory procedures because it is unclear what it precisely entails in any particular case. None of the four government amendments uses the word "investigations". It is also worth noting that none of the other amendments in the group uses the term either. I take that to mean that there is at least a measure of common ground across these Benches on the nature of the problems.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para5"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with government Amendments Nos. 41, 47, 54 and 58. We believe that we have successfully navigated these difficult waters. We have therefore brought forward these four government amendments. We consider that we have tackled the issue in a broad enough way that it can be applied to each of the four statutory procedures. Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 relate respectively to the standard and modified dismissal and disciplinary procedures; and Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 deal with the standard and modified grievance procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para6"></a>Knowing that it is problematic to mention "investigations" per se, we have therefore chosen to approach this issue from a different angle. Investigations aim to uncover information or evidence about the circumstances of the case or a matter of concern. These then constitute the basis for initiating the complaint or other action. With those thoughts in mind, we feel that there is no need to mention the investigatory process at all. Instead, we should refer to the outcome of the investigatory process&#151;the information or evidence which it typically uncovers.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para7"></a>Accordingly, the procedures should place obligations on the parties to disclose the information on which they initiated their action against the other party. The requirement to assemble and convey information of this kind would in practice be a very strong encouragement to the parties to ensure that an investigation occurs; otherwise, they would not be able to divulge any information because none would exist.
<P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para8"></a>Let me now describe how we applied this approach to each procedure. Amendment No. 41 deals with the standard dismissal and disciplinary procedure. It requires employers to ensure that employees are informed of the "basis" for initiating procedural action against them. The Step 1 letter serves the purpose of identifying the issue or allegation against the employee. This amendment would ensure that the employer is then required to provide the supporting information which led him to write that letter.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para9"></a>The information should be disclosed before the Step 2 meeting and sufficiently in advance of that meeting to ensure that the employee can consider his response to it. By this formulation, we ensure that employees are not "bounced" with important new information that the employer knew all along at or just before the Step 2 meeting.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para10"></a>We have deliberately not prescribed how the employee should be informed. This is desirable because it gives a helpful flexibility to employers. We should remember that the procedures will apply to virtually every employer in the country, including the many businesses which employ only one or two employees. Some may wish to convey this information in writing. They are free to do so. Indeed, they could include the information in the Step 1 letter, which will be an attractive idea for many larger employers. Others may wish to convey the information orally by telephone or at a meeting.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para11"></a>Investigations are usually associated with conduct cases. However, we believe that the gathering and prior disclosure of information can help in any dismissal or disciplinary matter. It can help to inform the dialogue between an employer and an employee, not only in conduct cases but also where the employee may be declared redundant or where he or she is thought to be under-performing at work. For example, in the case of an individual redundancy it would help the employee to know what were the redundancy criteria and how he or she scored in respect of them in advance of any Step 2 meeting. Our choice of wording in this amendment has therefore been deliberately chosen to apply to both conduct and non-conduct cases.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para12"></a>Amendment No. 47 deals with the position of the modified dismissal and disciplinary procedure which, as noble Lords will recall, the Government intend to apply to cases of instant dismissal for gross misconduct. As noble Lords know, there is no Step 2 meeting in this procedure. This amendment therefore obliges the employer to disclose the information in the Step 1 letter that he sends to the dismissed employee.
<P>

<a name="20611-07_para13"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 assign the corresponding obligations to employees in grievance cases. We consider that there is great merit in this. Information about a complaint which is disclosed in advance helps the employer to respond more fully and constructively to the complaint; time is used more efficiently; and it might even prompt the employer to undertake investigations of his own into the matter.

<a name="20611-07_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn asked, "What does 'basis' mean here? Does it have a different meaning in relation to grievance procedures from what it has in relation to disciplinary proceedings?" He gave as an example that if the grievance was that the employee had not been able to exercise his union rights, what "basis" would have to be provided by the employee in support of the grievance? It is unwise for me to go too heavily into what the precise requirements might be in a particular case but, in the example given, what more the employer would need to know and the employee would need to convey is when the employee was prevented from exercising the rights; the circumstances&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="20611-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble and learned friend. If he checks, he will see that I said that any worker who is faced with that kind of obstruction from the employer will say, "Last Tuesday you prevented me from exercising my right of carrying out trade union activities in the paint shop". What other basis for that complaint has to be set out? What has to be said that is extra to "Last Tuesday you prevented me from exercising my trade union activities in the paint shop and, of course, as a union member, I object to that"? What else has he got to say?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, subject to confirming that he is a union member and identifying shortly what happened in the paint shop, nothing more would be required. There would be an adequate basis there laid for such a complaint. Nothing more would be required. I do not believe that that would cause any difficulty in relation to resolving complaints by employees. Indeed, it would be helpful for such a short description to be given.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para0"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the point made by my noble friend Lady Gibson. She asked why not include the word "promptly". She emphasised, quite rightly, that time is important in relation to this. Under the heading "General Requirements", paragraph 12 of Schedule 2 to the Bill deals with this point. It states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each step and action under the procedure must be taken without unreasonable delay".

<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
It does not contain the word "promptly", but it seeks to achieve broadly the same result.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para2"></a>We have worked up practical proposals on this topic which are consistent with the style of the statutory procedures, which provide flexibility in their application and which apply to a wide range of issues and complaints. The statutory procedures are improved by these amendments as a result.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para3"></a>Of course it can be said that parties could still fail to undertake any investigation or review of a case. They could meet these new requirements of the statutory procedures by simply providing no or very little information. That would be a very foolish way to proceed for either the employer, in the case of a disciplinary matter, or the employee, in the case of a grievance. It would show that they had acted with no forethought or on no basis of fact. This would immediately suggest that their case was weak. Certainly tribunals would tend to draw that inference. We therefore believe that in practice we are creating sufficient and significant pressure on the parties to assemble full information on the issue.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para4"></a>Let me deal with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in relation to Amendments Nos. 38 and 50. These amendments deal with the two types of dismissal and disciplinary procedures. They seek to ensure that the scope of the Step 1 letter is widened and must include the evidence on which the employer relies when initiating action against an employee. I do not believe that our approaches are very dissimilar, especially in respect of Amendment No. 50 dealing with the modified procedure. These amendments follow our approach in that they require the employer to disclose information of a type which will indirectly encourage the employer to investigate a case before proceeding.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para5"></a>I believe that our approach is to be preferred. Amendment No. 38 would always require information to be set down in writing as part of the Step 1 letter. This has the advantage of establishing a clear record of the employer's views and this might, in turn, assist the tribunal if a case is subsequently brought. However, on balance we believe that more scope should be given to the employer to convey information in different forms at different times. We believe that this particularly helps small business, a section of our economy which the noble Lord often seeks to champion. Indeed, we consulted the Small Business Council when constructing these amendments and it advised us unequivocally that we should try to create this flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para6"></a>We also believe that the wording of Amendment No. 38 is focused too much towards conduct cases. It is not clear to me how it would apply to the case of individual redundancy. The reference to all of the evidence is too inflexible and would lead to the possibility of technical failure. Amendment No. 50 achieves much the same effect as our Amendment No. 47. Our amendment has the advantage of using consistent wording across both the standard and modified procedures.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para7"></a>I deal finally with Amendment No. 37. My noble friend Lord Lea has indicated that he will not move it, subject to hearing what I have to say. He tabled a similar amendment at Grand Committee. His amendment draws on the wording used in the ACAS code. That was drafted as a means of providing guidance. I am not sure that it is sufficiently precise and unambiguous for a statute; for example, what facts should be established? Does that mean each and every one which might have some relevance or does it mean just the salient facts?
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para8"></a>As I have stated, the Government seek to achieve a very similar aim to that of my noble friend Lord Lea. I believe that our amendments are to be preferred because they particularly apply to both conduct and non-conduct cases and also provide greater flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para9"></a>I hope that my remarks have dealt with the points made by my noble friend Lady Turner. I entirely agree with her that dismissal for misconduct is an extremely serious matter. Bearing that very much in mind, we have sought to ensure that there is a proper basis before the procedure is used. I apologise for a long explanation. I commend Amendments Nos. 41, 47, 54 and 58 to your Lordships and ask the movers of the other amendments in that group to consider withdrawing them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, the past few minutes have provided some very useful clarification as to what the Government amendments mean. There has always been a degree of symmetry in this Bill between the discipline procedure on the one side and the grievance procedure on the other. Sometimes the symmetry does not really work. Nevertheless, the points made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and others have probed that matter. However, we are moderately satisfied with the Government's explanation. More work needs to be done before the regulations are published. In a later amendment we suggest that the realities of introducing these two historically important procedures for every firm, however small, in the country requires a great deal of detail for them to make sense in the workplace, whether large or small. With those remarks I withdraw Amendment No. 37.

<P>

<a name="20611-08_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 achieve that effect for the standard dismissal and disciplinary procedure.

This use of different wording is unintended and the amendment ensures that the meetings are described in a consistent fashion. I beg to move.

<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>everything in those amendments at Grand Committee. But the Government could not accept any of them so we return with something which is more modest. We are simply asking for mediation; that is to say, for a third party to recommend that a dispute might be settled in a particular way. We argue that this is a way of not going forward to a tribunal. If one reaches the point where a worker refuses to accept what is on offer by the employer, one can go to the tribunal or add something at that point. We say that we should include not arbitration but mediation.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para30"></a>When dealing with those amendments in Grand Committee, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer&#151;it is a pity that he is not in his place&#151;used a series of bewhiskered arguments against all forms of third party intervention in dispute resolution. In fact, I counted five objections; namely, that third parties complicated disputes; they reduced the incentives of the two parties to reach a settlement; third parties are often thrown over by the stronger party; there are not enough skilled people to reach third party dispute settlements; and that such settlements cost a great deal of money.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para31"></a>I shall be most pleased to be corrected on this, but I know of no research in industrial relations which provides one single fact to support any of these ancient, bewhiskered excuses for external dispute resolution. I would like to have it because I would give it to my students. All they read are arguments to show that it works very well on the whole. In fact, it has been going on since the Greek city states. I dare say that most of the bewhiskered arguments were used by those who were against such a procedure when settling ancient quarrels. The procedure has been used since the 16th century to settle maritime disputes. There was a growth in commercial arbitration in the 18th century. In the 19th century the pioneers of arbitration and mediation in the cotton, iron and steel industries and in the mines avoided a whole series of industrial upsets. Most recently, third party involvement has been used as a much cheaper way, particularly in the United States, of settling family disputes. There is absolutely no evidence that it does any of the things that the noble and learned Lord trotted out to me in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para32"></a>Indeed, it is beginning to be accepted&#151;I hope that the noble Lord who responds will be able to keep me up to date&#151;that in the highest possible regions of this Government a change is taking place in regard to the notion of third party dispute resolution. The Prime Minister&#151;who, as we know, has been against all forms of third party involvement since he was the Labour Opposition spokesman&#151;said the other day that he thought it would be a very good idea if we could have arbitration in relation to the railways. Perhaps that is a sign. Perhaps it means that the Government will at last allow a reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. So there is a sea change.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para33"></a>I want to draw to the attention of the noble Lord a point that I mentioned in our previous debate, so he cannot say that he does not know about it. I refer to the report of the Better Regulation Task Force&#151;a body set up by the Government. It is a very interesting <P>

<a name="20611-08_para34"></a>The terms of reference of the Better Regulation Task Force are to examine the problems, particularly of small firms, in coming to terms with this legislation.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Task Force welcomes the proposals in the Employment Bill, but would like to see more done for employers and employees where there is no line management chain. This will often be the case in small businesses where the employee's manager may also be the most senior person in the business. When the manager is also the owner of the business there is no one higher"&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-08_para36"></a>
That is the statement of the task force, with dominant employer representation and one trade union representative. So those stakeholders who were consulted&#151;who are, of course, employers&#151;said that in such situations access to mediation would be welcome. The report goes on to state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ACAS should be brought into the dispute process before a tribunal application is made. In businesses with less than 50 employees, where there is no management chain, either party should be able"&#151;

this is ex parte arbitration, or mediation&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-08_para38"></a>
Of course it will save in that way. Recommendation 11 under the heading "Access to mediation" is as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ACAS should pilot a mediation service for businesses of less than 50 employees. If successful, the service should be either free or subsidised".

<a name="20611-08_para40"></a>I ask the Government: what about it? I take it that the Minister has read the detail of the report. I take it that is has been read all over Downing Street. This a body set up by the Government. It looks after the interests of employers and has consulted with employers. The employers, particularly the small employers, say: "We do not want to go to tribunals, but we are sensible enough to realise that if we do not want workers to go to tribunals, they must have some alternative"&#151;some alternative to the last word of management.
<P>

<a name="20611-08_para41"></a>Finally, I understand that the Better Regulation Task Force has to have an answer by Christmas. So why do we not have the first indications of the answer now? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I am not attempting to move the amendment; I am merely commenting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry. The amendment before the House is now Amendment No. 45. I understand that the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, may have wanted to speak to Amendment No. 43A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, I have agreed that I shall enter the debate when we reach Amendment No. 55A rather than Amendment No. 43A. I thank the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   With respect, my Lords, are we on the wrong amendment? I understood that I was moving Amendment No. 45 and speaking also to Amendments Nos. 56 and 65.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  My Lords, that is the amendment before the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, there are some issues of different jurisprudences on which I should have commented in speaking to Amendment No. 44 but which can be addressed equally in relation to Amendment No. 45.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para0"></a>A number of different procedures may now be arising. We have ACAS and the role of the ACAS code. We have the interesting and relevant proposition of my noble friend Lord McCarthy in relation to this amendment. We have the question as to how procedures under the 1996 Act dealing with unfair dismissal work. There will no doubt also be procedures dealing with legal challenges to the grievance and discipline procedures within the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para1"></a>It might be convenient if the Minister could clarify one matter in his response to the amendment; namely, how we are going to make sure that there is some reasonable dovetailing between the procedures. We understand that before regulation there will need to be talks between ACAS and the DTI about the relationship between the ACAS code and the DTI. This question is more generally relevant in the light of the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord McCarthy in terms of making sure that there is a reasonable interface between the three or four sets of procedures which can be taken into account by an individual or by an employer. It would be useful to hear some comment on the matter at this stage. I believe that the House will be consulted at a later stage when regulations are introduced, but the question will arise of major points of the ACAS code being taken into account if someone wants to appeal <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in relation to either the grievance or the displinary procedure. That is a relevant problem on which it would be useful to hear some clarification today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall makes an important point. Later amendments will raise the question of where we stand with the ACAS code.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para2"></a>We were told in Committee in another place by my honourable friend Alan Johnson, the Minister of State, that the ACAS code would need to be rewritten once the Bill reaches the statute book. Therefore, it would be extremely useful, in the context of what my noble friend has just said, if the Minister could give us, either now or at some later stage, a conspectus of the changes which the Government's legislation will require in the ACAS code&#151;not least in respect of the matter of mediation in the amendment moved by my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para3"></a>I repeat what my noble friend said. This amendment is being debated with Amendments Nos. 56 and 65. The machinery that is proposed for mediation not only provides some step further than the employer's first and last word, which is what the Government leaves workers with; at the root of the unfairness of Schedule 2 is the fact that workers will be left with the employer's first and last word, especially in the modified procedures to which we shall come. My noble friend's amendments do not suggest some arbitrary or unilateral mediator. If one looks at Amendment No. 65, which deals with the machinery for the mediation, one finds that it suggests that employers should be encouraged to reach agreement with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a recognised trade union of which the employee was a member . . . [or] an agreement made between the employer and such a recognised trade union [generally] . . . [or] in the absence of such a person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-09_para4"></a>
to abide by the suggestions of the "Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service"; in other words, the proposal is mediation by a machinery, or by a "person" who is agreed, or by someone who is put forward under an ACAS scheme.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para5"></a>It seems to me that my noble friend is proposing mediation as an added extra to the employer's "last word" on a most reasonable basis; namely, of agreement, or ACAS. Therefore, both points that I have made&#151;the ACAS code and the place of ACAS in mediation&#151;need to be made clear in respect of this group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_time0"></a><H5>4.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we spent time in Grand Committee debating whether the statutory procedures should be amended to give the employee unilateral access to third party involvement in the shape of mediation and arbitration. In this set of amendments, my noble friend is confining himself to the involvement of just the mediator.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para6"></a>As well as being an academic with unrivalled knowledge of this subject, which, as he says, goes back to the Greek city states, my noble friend is also an <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expert mediator and arbitrator. I do not want anything that I say to undermine or undervalue either his skills or those of other mediators and arbitrators. We simply maintain the belief that mediation should remain a voluntary activity. It should be entered into only where both parties agree. That is the position adopted by the ACAS Code, which invites parties to consider the scope for third party intervention where problems seem intractable or involve very senior management within organisations.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para7"></a>The amendments now before the House would compel the employer to accept mediation. I remind my noble friend, as he reminded us, that the amendment he moved in Grand Committee (Amendment No. 102), was about an arbitrator rather than a mediator. In that sense, it goes well beyond the existing guidance of the ACAS Code, which stresses that both parties should agree to third party intervention.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para8"></a>My noble friend describes his amendments as representing the only real alternative to the tribunals for resolving disputes. However, I doubt whether it would work that way. Compulsion would make the mediator's job much more difficult. It is possible that the employer would not collaborate with the mediator in his examination of the issue. It would certainly mean that employers would feel under very little moral obligation to accept the mediator's recommendations. I suspect that issues would remain unresolved because the mediator's advice would not be readily accepted in those circumstances. Many cases would still go to the tribunal, and the mediator's intervention would be wasted. Indeed, the reputation of mediators might suffer as a result.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para9"></a>Moreover, as I mentioned at Grand Committee, unilateral access to a mediator may create perverse incentives in the system. For example, it might dissuade the parties from bilaterally resolving their differences. My noble friend made some play of the comments of the Better Regulation Task Force. We place considerable reliance on the task force. Indeed, we take its recommendations most seriously. It has made recommendations for increased access to mediation. We accept the value of mediation, but nothing in the report of the task force supports the proposal for compulsory mediation, as proposed in the amendment. It would not only be compulsory, it would also be unilateral.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para10"></a>Before I conclude, I should like to return to the point properly raised by my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall in Amendment No. 44, which we passed by rather rapidly. My noble friend's amendment would place a duty on employers to take the ACAS Code into account when arranging meetings under the statutory procedures, and when disciplining employees. Under Section 207 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, employers are not placed under any direct requirement to observe the code. However, the section does require employment tribunals to take the code into account if it is relevant to any question before them.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para11"></a>It follows that employers who disregard the code in circumstances where it is applicable may well damage their prospects of success in defending tribunal <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proceedings. It is because of this that employers, and others, turn to the codes for guidance; they will do so whether or not there is a cross-reference in the schedule. For that reason, the cross-reference introduced by the amendment is unlikely to achieve anything that Section 207 does not already achieve.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para12"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn pointed out that a Minister in another place had said that changes in ACAS may be needed as a result of this Bill. I do not deny that possibility. However, I believe that my noble friend asked me to give a "conspectus" of what changes would be required. It would be impertinent for me to do so. It is for ACAS to consider its code; it is not for the Government to suggest what changes might be made. No doubt ACAS will address that situation when it sees the Bill on the statute book.
<P>

<a name="20611-09_para13"></a>The fundamental point is that the amendments would significantly change the approach adopted in these statutory procedures, which are being introduced into legislation for the first time. They are being made available to 6 million people who might not have access to them at present. They are meant to contain the basic core features of a dispute resolution system. These amendments would make the procedures much more prescriptive. We do not believe that we should move in that direction. The roles of mediation and arbitration should stay as they are.

<A NAME="20611-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend the Minister sits down, perhaps I may ask him to read again the recommendation of the task force that is to be found on page 28 of its report:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In businesses with less than 50 employees, where there is no management chain, either party"&#151;

that is, ex parte mediation&#151;

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para1"></a>
That is exactly what I am asking for&#151;ex parte mediation&#151;and that is what the task force has recommended.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that deals with the unilateral issue. The Better Regulation Task Force is entitled to its view in that respect. However, to me, it does not imply that it is compulsory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the Government take this view. It is no good inventing herds of bogus arguments against third party intervention, as my noble friend seemed to do. Mediators do not mind wasting their time; indeed, that is their job. They do not suffer from doing their business&#151;they prosper, as do the parties involved. You cannot keep inventing possible situations. You must have facts. I repeat, there is no research known to me that supports any of this nonsense.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para2"></a>Despite the recommendations of the task force, the Government may say that they are still stuck in the bunker. I remind them that they will have to answer the people who are asking them to come out of the bunker, and that they must do so by the end of the year. I hope that they come forward with something better than my noble friend's response. The <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fundamental point behind the amendment is something that is behind many of our amendments: we are not against statutory procedures, nor are we against trying to get people out of the tribunal habit and into the dispute settlement habit. We want that to happen&#151;not because we want to get rid of 30,000 cases, but because we can see coming across the skyline an almost endless series of regulations from the EU, which, unless something is done to make dispute settlement outside the tribunals a real option for the worker, will place intolerable burdens upon tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para3"></a>There must be a real option for the worker, and it must be beneficial. As my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said, workers must know that they can get something other than the first and last word of the employer. The statutory procedures do not provide for anything but the employer's first and last word, which is why they will not work. That is why, sooner or later, the Government must think again. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 46:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 65, line 29, leave out from beginning to end of line 7 on page 66.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para5"></a><P>

<a name="20611-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall also speak to Amendment No. 57 which is parallel to it.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para7"></a>The effect of these amendments would be to take out of Schedule 2 the "modified procedures". That does not mean that we are wholly satisfied with the standard procedures, and other amendments explain why we are not wholly satisfied. However, these modified procedures are unfair in their effect. They encourage not the best but the worst of practices. To cap it all, they are highly uncertain whereas the Government's primary claim for their statutory, obligatory procedures is that they must be certain. They are uncertain beyond redemption in any regulations. Moreover, the uncertainties and problems we have raised before are not cured by the government amendments elsewhere on the Marshalled List. Nor do the government amendments relieve the modified procedures of their unfairness&#151;unfairness possibly as between different groups of employees, as I shall outline later.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para8"></a>I acknowledge that removal of the modified procedures might require some amendments to the standard procedures. The Government could easily do that on Third Reading. It would be a substantial change. However, it is worth noting the archaeology of the modified procedures. In the first government proposals, Routes to Resolution, the modified procedures were absent; we had only the standard procedures. They were suggested by someone in the consultation, but we have never been told who it was and we have never been told why it was. They appeared for the first time on page 14 of the Government's document Response to Consultation without any real explanation or justification. They were described there as modified standards in cases of gross misconduct justifying summary dismissal.
<P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para9"></a>Nothing substantial was said about the innovation in the House of Commons. Indeed, with the greatest respect to another place, partly because they were not provided with the details of the research on which the Government said they relied, very little was said about these procedures in another place. Since then, there has been no justification of any substance. Very little has ever been said about the modified grievance procedure; but then there is very little in it. It is the crudest, most elementary procedure of all. The employee must write setting out a grievance and, as we are now told, the basis for it, whatever that means. Subsequently the employer has only to send a response. That is it. There is no meeting, discussion or appeal. The employer's last and first word is the end of the matter. When and how this supplants the statutory procedure&#151;with a meeting and an appeal&#151;is not made clear anywhere.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para10"></a>The modified disciplinary procedure is in some ways even worse, and it remains so despite forthcoming government amendments. On behalf of the Government, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton said of it:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The modified procedure is necessary. It deals with special cases where it may not be appropriate to follow the full procedure, requiring former employees to attend hearings".&#151;[Official Report, 20/03/02; CWH col. 225.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para11"></a>
The employees in question are employees who have been thrown out of their jobs. What is appropriate when one has been thrown out on one's ear depends on the angle from which one looks at the situation.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para12"></a>One might have thought that one would be careful when preparing to impose in Schedule 2 such crude and unfair procedures as the implied terms of every contract of employment in the land. I pause to say that they may be implied terms in even more contracts. In Clause 29, the Government have power to extend these provisions to those who are not technically employees. It would be interesting to know whether they intend to use that power soon after the Bill becomes an Act. Regardless, no such care was taken to avoid what is unfairness and uncertainty. The line has never been drawn in a meaningful way between standard and modified procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para13"></a>In Committee, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The modified procedures will by regulations be applied in respect of cases where the dismissal has already occurred and therefore it is instant or near instant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para14"></a>
He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by the time one gets to the modified procedure, the employee has already been instantly, or near instantly, dismissed".&#151;[Official Report, 20/03/02; CWH cols. 239-40.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para15"></a>
At one point in the debate, he was concerned about preserving the right of summary dismissal and "instant" or "near-instant" dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para16"></a>The suggestion that paragraph 4 of the modified procedure applies only to cases of "instant" or "near-instant" dismissal, just because it arises from gross <P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>misconduct, may be thought to suffer from the logical defect of a defectively distributed middle in the argument. The modified procedure speaks of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"alleged misconduct which has led to the dismissal",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para17"></a>
of the worker. We do not know what is meant by "misconduct". As we shall hear later, in Committee, the Minister explained that the regulations are not going to define misconduct. However, on the Pelion of an uncertain "misconduct" is piled the Ossa of "near-instant dismissal"&#151;which is even less meaningful legally.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para18"></a>Dismissal from employment is defined and described in Sections 95 to 97 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Dismissal includes any case&#151;I summarise the three cases&#151;where the employee is given notice of dismissal by the employer; or works out a fixed-term contract; or is summarily dismissed. So the words of paragraph 4 on modified disciplinary procedures on their face apply to cases of dismissal with notice, or to a case of non-renewal of a fixed-term employment, just as much as to instant or near-instant dismissal. When the employer says, "You've broken the works rules and that is misconduct. I am giving you three weeks' notice, to which you are perhaps entitled", what will apply&#151;the modified procedure? On the face of it, it does apply. We should be told whether the regulations will make it clear whether it applies. So far, no one has told us whether it applies. One might think that, in introducing a whole new section of procedures, someone would have thought about when it will apply.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para19"></a>Moreover, three weeks' notice is not a near-instant dismissal. I ask my noble friend the Minister to answer the following example. Suppose that an employer dismisses for misconduct three employees. One he dismisses summarily, or instantly. To the second he gives one week's notice, which is less than the worker is entitled to. However, to the third he gives six weeks' notice, saying, "That's longer than you're entitled to but I like you. So you can have garden leave of absence for the period of the six weeks' notice". To which of these three examples does the standard procedure apply and the modified procedure apply? No one knows. And yet we shall be introducing this implied term into every contract of employment in the land.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para20"></a>The matter gets worse. Where the dismissal associates misconduct to another ground, life is not as simple as the authors of the Bill suggest. Suppose an employer says to a fourth employee, "You can get out now. You've been guilty of misconduct and you're also being made redundant. You can 'respond'"&#151;the word in the Bill&#151;"as much as you like, but you're out. Get off the premises". On Second Reading, my noble friend Lord McIntosh gave an example from his experience as an employer, when he had to say to an employee:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Clear your desk and be out in half an hour'".&#151;[Official Report, 26/02/02; col. 1407.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para21"></a><P>

<a name="20611-10_para22"></a>If the employer in my example had not consulted properly about the individual redundancy, it would be an unfair dismissal. However, even if he has consulted in advance, the employee with two years' service is <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>entitled to his redundancy payment. Why should he have to go through some further procedure if that payment is refused? Which procedure applies to him when he is told that he is redundant as well as otiose? Is it the modified procedure? When he complains of a lack of warning, is it a grievance, or is it in the disciplinary procedure? Paragraph 48 of the ACAS code makes it abundantly clear that, in the middle of a disciplinary procedure, a grievance can arise.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para23"></a>I quoted paragraph 48 in Grand Committee. I shall not do so again. But, as I understood it, Ministers agreed that a grievance can arise in the middle of a disciplinary procedure. I can see that one might argue for the standard procedures, but some procedure of that kind should apply. However, I find it very difficult to imagine that the modified grievance procedure should be made to apply when the employer is trying to exercise and use the modified disciplinary procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para24"></a>The lack of clarity is compounded by the fact that the procedures are inadequate. As the Law Society pointed out in its briefing sent to your Lordships:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a sanction with the severity of summary dismissal is being contemplated, the highest standards of procedural fairness should be required".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para25"></a>
That is not true under the modified procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para26"></a>It gets worse. The Government Response to the consultation document stated three times that the modified procedure applied only to former employees. We asked them to use the words "former employees" in regard to the modified disciplinary procedure. However, they said, "Oh, no. We could not possibly do that". Yet, that is what was said in the response document. Does the procedure apply only to former employees? That question is important in relation to a point to which I shall come.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para27"></a>The Minister of State, my honourable friend Alan Johnson, said in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are trying to set down what is necessary and to frame the measure in such a way as to encourage the resolution of disputes in the workplace".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee F, 13/12/01; col. 167.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para28"></a>
How on earth does the modified procedure encourage resolution of disputes at the workplace? As my noble friend Lord McCarthy said, although misrepresented on this point several times, including in the Secretary of State's latest letter to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we have never objected to the idea of settling disputes in the workplace. However, we do say that the modified procedure will not help to do so.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para29"></a>The case against forcing an employee, on pain of limited access to a tribunal or on pain of reducing compensation even if he eventually wins a case, into the modified procedure is that it will not contribute to that goal and will work against it. The employer is able to say, "This is my answer. That is my first and last word. You can't have mediation because the Government have now said that they will not agree to it", despite the report to which my noble friend referred. Both the TUC and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux were very concerned about such a move away from the ACAS code in statutorily imposed procedures. The modified procedure moves furthest from the ACAS code.

<P>

<a name="20611-10_para30"></a>There is a proper place in regulations for making clear what is unclear in statute so long as the statute sets out the broad framework of the principles. But there are no principles in the Bill to say when the modified or standard procedures will apply. It is the legislation of a madhouse run by janitors who are either lazy or obsessive in pursuit of objectives to which they insist their procedures will contribute when they will not.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para31"></a>It gets worse. The proposition that a summary dismissal or near-instant dismissal always terminates the contract of employment&#151;it seems that that is what is involved in the Government's position&#151;assumes an answer to a problem which, as the law stands, is currently of great complexity. The moment of termination of the employment contract has been affected by two competing principles. The old master-and-servant principle of automatic dismissal says that whenever the employer dismisses, the contract of employment comes to an end.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para32"></a>A different principle from the law of contract, often dubbed the "elective" principle of termination, holds that termination of employment arises when the employee accepts, or elects within a reasonable time to accept, the repudiation of the employer or, in a sense, to resign. Recently, on 28th May, the Court of Appeal said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The right of an employee to resign when faced with repudiation of his contract by the employer",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-10_para33"></a>
is important. Lord Justice Sedley pointed out in the case of Cerberus Software v. Rowley in 2001 that the issue had not yet been finally resolved as to exactly when each principle applied to termination of employment contracts. It was what Lord Justice Ward called "murky waters".
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para34"></a>For the Government to settle that the automatic principle applies, which, it seems, is what is meant by the modified procedure, in the schedule to the Bill, which does not face up, and has never done so, to the problems which exist in the law as it stands, is an extraordinary method of promoting sensible law reform, whichever of the principles applies. And there are other, equally difficult issues. I make no excuse for saying to your Lordships that they have to be faced today. If they are not faced today, they will never be faced. They were not faced in Grand Committee by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para35"></a>I shall take just one example, although I could quote many; that is, the problem of group dismissals. After the decision in Parr v. Whitbread & Co in 1990, where an employer dismisses a group of employees in circumstances in which all the employees could have committed the misconduct in question, and where each member of the group was capable of having committed the misconduct and the employer cannot identify the individual perpetrator, as the law stands, the employer is entitled, if he has solid grounds for his belief, to dismiss each and every member of the group. That will not be an unfair dismissal.
<P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para36"></a>The principle is not limited to summary dismissals, but it arises most often where the employer has made investigations but despairs of ever finding the culprit and decides to get all of them off the premises. Does the modified procedure apply to group dismissals?
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para37"></a>That is the last of my questions, which I shall summarise in this form. Does the modified procedure apply to group dismissals? Will the Government tell us whether the modified procedure applies only to summary dismissals or, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, said more than twice, to near-instant dismissals? If it applies to near-instant dismissals, what length of notice makes it "near instant" and what length of notice places it in another category so that the standard procedure applies? It is no good to tell me that we shall find out when we read the regulations. The Government will have to tell us when they give notice of the regulations and they must have some idea now. If they do not, they should take the provision out of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para38"></a>In addition, are the Government deciding the difference between the elective and automatic principles of termination of employment contracts? Will they tell us why, in all cases where an employer decides to use the modified procedure, it is necessary to allow him to use that privilege in a manoeuvre by saying that this is a dismissal for misconduct, which is more than likely to unbalance industrial relations at the workplace between different groups of work people, especially if he gives different notice to different groups where he alleges misconduct?
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para39"></a>Why is that procedure, in which the employee has no right of appeal, no right to a meeting and no right to discussion but must accept the first and last word of the employer, appropriate? Whatever the employer's ultimate right to effect a summary dismissal, there is no need to encourage it in the way that the modified procedure does.
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para40"></a>It would serve the Government's aims much better to swallow pride on this matter, whoever first thought of the modified procedure in the middle of the formulation of their Bill&#151;it came in late&#151;and to recognise that these unfair modified procedures are likely to cause more disruption and bad feeling at the place of work than almost anything else in the Bill, let alone causing many preliminary reviews in the tribunals. There will be argument as to whether the employer was entitled to apply the modified procedure. Do the Government believe that that will save tribunal hearings?
<P>

<a name="20611-10_para41"></a>The need to investigate by the employer, which my noble friends have pressed, is totally lacking in the modified procedure. The best move that the Government could make to restore confidence in their approach to workers' rights and to save them from the charge that there is inherent in Schedule 2 an inroad upon the enforcement of employment rights in an unfair modified procedure would be to drop those procedures from the Bill. I beg the Government to reconsider this matter between now and Third <P>

<A NAME="20611-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  My Lords, I must inform the House that if this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 47 to 50 inclusive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak briefly in support of Amendment No. 46. The issue which concerns us most on these Benches is dismissal for gross misconduct. We accept that in a limited number of cases of dismissal an employee's behaviour may be both flagrant and unambiguous. But even in such apparently obvious cases, in our view there will remain an argument for proceeding with caution in taking the decision to dismiss. In any event, such considerations will not apply in the overwhelming majority of cases of gross misconduct. In most cases the opposite will be true.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said, the severity of the sanction of summary dismissal requires that higher, not lower, standards of procedural fairness should be adopted before such procedures are followed and such action is taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, this amendment deletes the modified dismissal and disciplinary procedure in its entirety. Amendment No. 57 would do the same for grievance procedures. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, moved an identical amendment in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, started by discussing what he described as "the archaeology" of this measure. He started by saying that the issue was not raised in Routes to Resolution. I have an in-built objection to referring to the archaeology because I want us to consider what is in the Bill, not the consultation procedure beforehand. However, since the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, made the point, perhaps I may say that paragraph 3.15 on page 18 of Routes to Resolution states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There will be cases, for example gross misconduct or harassment of an employee by a manager, where it would be unreasonable to expect all these actions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-11_para2"></a>
that is, the actions in a standard procedure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to be completed. Tribunals would therefore be given some discretion when assessing whether the failure to follow these actions was reasonable in the circumstances or should lead to some enhancement or mitigation of the award".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-11_para3"></a>
Those are matters which we shall come to. However, it is not the case that the issue has arisen for the first time.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, also said that there is not any right of appeal under the modified agreement. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 2, Part 1, Chapter 2 specifically provides for appeal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. I hope that I said that there was no right of appeal in a grievance procedure. My noble friend said, correctly, that Routes to Resolution states that the tribunal would have a discretion to set aside some parts of the standard <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure. What I said&#151;if the noble Lord looks at page 17 he will see that it is correct&#151;is that no modified procedure, which is separate from the standard procedure, was proposed in Routes to Resolution, and that is true.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_time0"></a><H5>5.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the modified procedure arises from an issue which was raised for debate in Routes to Resolution and referred to in the response to consultation.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para5"></a>I do not know why the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, keeps stating that the line is not clear. We have made clear from the beginning that the modified procedure deals with instant or near instant dismissal. Without anticipating in detail what the regulations will say, the difference between instant dismissal and near instant dismissal is fairly clear. Instant dismissal takes place when the person who is capable of taking the dismissal decision, the employer, or whoever it may be, is present when the incident takes place and says, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, "Get out". Near instant dismissal is when the employer is not immediately available. He has to be called from another part of the premises or from off the premises, but as soon as he returns he says, "Get out". There is nothing particularly significant about the difference there.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para6"></a>Clearly, those dismissals exist in real life. Neither the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, nor the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, suggested that there are no cases in which instant dismissal might not be justified. They both think that the number of cases should be limited as far as possible&#151;of course they should&#151;but neither of them say that they should not exist. They arise from cases of gross misconduct. Some are unfair&#151;as few as possible should be unfair&#151;but others are not. Tribunals consider the individual cases on their merits, but there is no blanket prohibition against instant dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para7"></a>So, under the existing law, it may be completely lawful for an employer to dismiss instantly in extreme situations without first suspending the employee or imposing some other disciplinary measure. It is our intention to leave the underlying law on unfair dismissal unchanged. When the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, says that that is an inroad into the enforcement of employment rights, I have to say that I believe he is wrong. I believe that the introduction of modified procedures as opposed to no procedures, which is the present situation, cannot fairly be described as an inroad into employment rights. The noble Lord says that they are unfair and crude. At present, an employer who summarily dismisses is not required to follow any minimum procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, asked specific questions about cases which he described. He mentioned the three individuals who are given different periods of notice. He added to that a fourth individual who is made redundant at the same time. Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord&#151;I know that he does not like me saying it&#151;that those matters will be <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determined by regulations, and we shall consult fully on the regulations. But we have stated our intentions&#151;I am sure that this is what he wanted me to say&#151;to apply the modified procedure to instant dismissals or near instant dismissals. I cannot be drawn on the specific examples given except to say that we consider that the standard procedures should apply to all other cases except instant dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para9"></a>Some noble Lords believe that the modified procedure will undermine the sound guidance provided by the ACAS code. As we know, the ACAS code advises that most cases of gross misconduct should not result in instant dismissal but should first be subject to an internal procedure before a decision is taken. I see no reason to believe that ACAS will or should change that advice. Employers should still take it into account when assessing what to do in individual circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para10"></a>The schedule does not change the obligation on the employer to act fairly when dismissing. As now, the ACAS code should be taken into account by the tribunals when assessing whether the employer has acted reasonably and fairly. That is the point of the quotation I gave from Routes to Resolution. If it is currently unfair to dismiss an employee instantly for certain types of gross misconduct or in particular circumstances, that will remain the case in the future.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para11"></a>The modified procedure sets a new procedural standard below which employers should not fall in any circumstances. But it does not absolve employers from the need to follow more elaborate procedures where necessary. That may well involve employers suspending employees while investigations take place. It may well involve meetings with the employee before a decision is taken. Despite what has been said, the modified procedure is necessary. It deals with the special case where it is not appropriate to demand the following of the full procedure because that would involve requiring ex-employees to attend hearings. However, it does not reduce the standard against which tribunals will judge the fairness of employer actions in cases of instant dismissal. We recognise that such dismissals may or may not be fair. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, if he reads Hansard tomorrow he may agree that he seemed to be saying at one stage&#151;and I should like to know whether he wants to be left on the record as saying this&#151;that whether or not the modified procedure is available to the employer depends on where he happens to be. If he happens to be there and sees this act there can be an instant dismissal. If he is half a mile away he does not have much chance. If he is 50 yards away, perhaps he would come back. It is bizarre to think that putting a provision on the statute will encourage those who have never had procedures in their lives to look at the Bill and say, "Oh, yes, I see". Why must we have <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have this big procedure at the top? Let us have this little procedure at the bottom where, in the case of grievances, there are no appeals.
<P>

<a name="20611-11_para12"></a>The Minister seemed to be saying that the only aspect that will decide a court or tribunal is where the employer happens to be at the time. He cannot mean that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the reverse is the case. I was trying to be helpful by explaining the difference between instant and near-instant dismissals, as those were the words used by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. I tried as always to be helpful, but I made it clear that the chance of whether the employer happens to be on the spot, 50 yards or half-an-hour away, is not the significant factor between the standard and the modified procedure. That is why we have used the words "instant" or "near-instant" dismissal. The implication is the opposite to that which my noble friend Lord McCarthy seeks to draw.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I should like to say that I am grateful to my noble friend when he clarifies issues, but I wrote down what I thought he said in what was the first definition we have ever had of a "near-instant" dismissal. As I understood him, he said that the instant dismissal is when the employer is present and says, "Get out". That is a summary dismissal in law, but if the Government want to call it an instant one, I do not mind.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord then said that the near instant dismissal is when the employer is not there but comes back. I wrote down, "When the employer comes back". If I have written that down wrongly, I apologise, but if he looks at his text I think he will find that that is what he said. The employer comes back and says, "Get out".
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para1"></a>I imagine myself in the Court of Appeal where an unhappy employee who has been told to get out says, "I was wrongfully dismissed at common law". Someone says, "Well, you should not have been allowed to go to a tribunal because that was a near-instant dismissal". The employee says that the employer was nowhere around. He came back the next day and said, "Get out". Is that a near-instant dismissal? With the greatest respect to those who thought up this curious paradigm, that definition is absurd.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para2"></a>However, the Minister said something that was very important. He said that the modified procedure would apply to ex-employees. I notice that he did not say a word about the law on termination of contract. So he is adopting the automatic theory on termination. Is that what the Bill says? So the courts had better look at this deep area of what Lord Justice Ward called "murky waters" and realise that the Government are by a side wind legislating on that.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para3"></a>Then the Minister says that these are the cases to which the modified procedure will apply. So in all cases where notice is given the modified procedure will not apply. Therefore, an employee would be very sensible <P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when an employer says, "Get out", to ask, "Are you giving me notice?" If the employer says, "Well, all right, you can have a week's notice, but I want you off the premises anyway", that is not a near-instant dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para4"></a>I touched on a further point which the Minister did not seem to notice. The modified procedure applies to all summary dismissals whether or not they are justified at common law. So it applies even where the employer instantly or summarily dismisses wrongly. In other words, the modified procedure application is at the choice of the employer. Whether or not he is right in law, if he says "Get out", the modified procedure applies&#151;especially if he is present because then we know it does. Just how far he has to be away to come back we are not sure.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para5"></a>So can he be sued in an employment tribunal? Every time he says, "Get out" the employee has to start his grievance procedure. He has to send that letter before he can get to a tribunal. That is the point where the Minister, with the greatest of respect to him, was most in error.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para6"></a>The Minister says that it is wrong to call this an inroad into employment rights enforcement. But if the employee has not done what Schedule 2 says that he must do, he is not allowed to go to a tribunal. Even if he has complied with it he has to wait 28 days. We shall come to that matter.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para7"></a>Therefore, the modified procedures encourage the worst practice. They encourage summary dismissal. Where it is a matter of a grievance they encourage the employer to give his first and last word and know that that is the end of it because there is no meeting and no appeal.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para8"></a>What possible contribution to what the research documents rightly call "the need for further dialogue at the workplace" can such crude and silly procedures possibly have? I hope that the Government will think again. If they cannot withdraw the modified procedures, at least at Third Reading they should come back with provisions that working people can recognise as having elementary fairness. At the moment there is no fairness. The worker is left vulnerable. I say that especially in view of the policies advanced by parties other than the Government. Those who are vulnerable need protection. The modified procedures deprive them of it. But at the moment there is nothing that we can do except to leave the Government wallowing in what is a terrible mess and which is opposed to their professed aims, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-12_para23"></a>The Peers who were interested in coming to the meeting were not able to get into the meeting room because it was too small. Although it was very squashed and very hot, I appreciate the support of those who came.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para24"></a>Since then I have received numerous telephone calls and letters in which I have been inundated with examples of bullying. Obviously, with this meeting I touched the tip of an iceberg, one which certainly will not dissolve and most probably will grow. All of those who attended believed that, as the law stands, there is no adequate legislation to challenge bullying at work. I know that the Government do not take that view, but I merely say to them, "Try being a trade union representative and using the law as it stands and you will know how difficult it is".
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para25"></a>We cannot ignore the fact that bullying exists in thousands of workplaces and that in many it is endemic: it has happened for years; it is the norm. At the meeting, instances were cited from the health service, teaching, the voluntary sector, engineering and, indeed, from the Post Office&#151;perhaps I should speak to my honourable friend the Minister in another place about that because I am sure that he would be interested in those bullying cases.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para26"></a>All types of offices, including government offices, were involved and several Ministries were mentioned. I shall not embarrass any of my noble friends by naming them, but I urge all Ministers to look over their shoulder because bullying is occurring. Of course, it also takes place in many kinds of factories, in workplaces large and small and in all parts of the United Kingdom. People attended the meeting from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and all parts of England.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para27"></a>The Dignity at Work Bill recently passed through the House, for which I thank your Lordships. It is now scheduled for the other place but unfortunately, as I said, the Government are not backing it. Perhaps they will think again. It is an extremely popular piece of legislation with working people and good employers who were also present at the meeting stressed that good employers need not fear the Dignity at Work Bill. As they pointed out to me during the meeting and afterwards, when they remained behind to speak to me about it, they have had to face bullying at work and agreed that a specific law on bullying would have helped them.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para28"></a>We are now considering the Employment Bill, which sets out to be good legislation. The Government are rightly proud of having introduced it, but we need to encompass as much as possible in the Bill. Because it is a forward-thinking piece of legislation and one that should last for a good while, the amendment would add significantly to it. The amendment is a simple but sincere attempt. It covers employers, employees and managers because in many aspects of grievance procedures all three, or two out of those three, may be involved in bullying. My noble friend Lord Lea will speak a little more about that in a moment, but I ask the Government seriously to consider the amendment. It is intended to be helpful and could improve the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20611-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support my noble friend. We are seeking to make an important clarification as regards a possible difference between bullying and other matters that may come under disciplinary or grievance procedures. The key issue, to which my noble friend just alluded, is that there are often three sides to such disputes, not two. The key point is that an appeal will in practice often relate to the manager's position in the line of command in relation to the ultimate employer. The manager in question will therefore not be taking the hearing, as he would in the case of an ordinary grievance. So the manager could either be the person being said to have done the bullying, which would constitute a grievance, or the person in a disciplinary hearing who was saying that the employee was doing the bullying. Would it then be right for the manager to be the person to take the case, as it were, instead of a third party?
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para29"></a>I wonder whether Ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry and the DTI corporately have yet shown sufficient ingenuity in addressing what I may call the variable geometry. We do not have to be Picasso to work out that the picture is different from a two-dimensional one. The manager is often the pig in the middle between the other two parties.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para30"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Gibson for her work and refer briefly to the interesting meeting upstairs last week. As a trade union official of some years' experience, I can normally tell quite quickly whether there is a big head of steam behind an issue. There is a big head of steam worked up behind this one, which should be released without adding to the frustration by saying that it does not really come under this Bill or that perhaps it should come under my noble friend's Dignity at Work Bill. We do not know what will happen to that Bill. Something must be done.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para31"></a>We have narrowed down what is the proper connection between the broader ideas on bullying, which have been the basis of the campaign, and the unique, narrow opportunity presented by this Bill. We have made a modest suggestion that I hope will be accepted as useful: that the employee could be deemed to be a third party if the employer takes action under the disciplinary procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-12_para32"></a>The amendment may not represent the optimum formulation, but as we are nearly at the last stage of the Bill, our real request is to move forward, put some cards on the table and not just go round in circles arguing about what bullying is, because we have been doing that for as long as I can remember. We want some evidence that the right degree of intellectual agility is being shown to try to address the proposition for which my noble friend has been campaigning. We have started to crack the issue and I hope that my noble friend the Minister can say something positive about it today.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, let me acknowledge from the outset that this is an important issue. To her great credit, my noble friend Lady Gibson has brought it to the House's attention more <P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than once. She has certainly proved to my satisfaction that there is what my noble friend Lord Lea calls a head of steam behind it. It is clearly something that deserves the Government's attention.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para0"></a>We do not normally oppose or support Private Member's Bills, but on Second Reading of my noble friend Lady Gibson's Dignity at Work Bill, I identified certain problems with the Bill, the definition of bullying and the extension of new types of protection that the Bill would entail. But that does not mean that we do not have to take the issue seriously.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para1"></a>Bullying is typically handled under internal procedures in two ways. Employees can raise allegations of bullying under grievance procedures, which is covered by Amendment No. 55A, and employers can use their disciplinary procedures against employees who are accused of bullying, with which Amendment No. 43, over which we passed somewhat rapidly, is concerned. The amendments seek to allow the employer or the manager to initiate an appeal against a Step 2 decision under the standard statutory procedures for both dismissal and discipline and grievances in cases involving bullying. The procedures currently permit only the employee to request the appeal.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para2"></a>I must say that there is something odd about the amendments, because they concern the appeal, which is an appeal against the employer's initial decision after the Step 2 meeting. It is odd to let the employer appeal against his or her own decision. I am not aware of any voluntary procedures that involve such an unusual arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. It is not as daft as the Minister has just implied because the employer and the manager are not necessarily the same person.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am coming to that matter. The amendment provides that the employer, the manager or the employee has the right to institute an appeal. I assure my noble friends that I have given the matter a great deal of consideration during the past few days because it is puzzling. It is a very difficult matter to define, a very difficult matter to legislate for, and it deserves proper consideration.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para3"></a>The amendment refers to the ability of a manager to initiate an appeal. I suspect that my noble friends are concerned about the position of a middle manager who is pronounced guilty of bullying by the employer when considering a grievance by a bullied employee. However, having listened to my noble friend Lady Gibson I believe that she raised a point which does deserve consideration; namely, where the appeal would go through a manager who is himself accused of bullying. That is certainly a consideration which I had not thought about before.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para4"></a>When my noble friend Lord Lea refers to the manager being the pig in the middle, I can see the argument that the middle manager should be entitled to appeal. Of course, a manager is simply another employee for the purpose of the statutory procedures. <P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Managers are entitled to use the statutory procedures, just as other employees are. Therefore, aggrieved managers are entitled to raise a separate grievance with the employer about the way that they have been treated by the employer's consideration of the other employee's complaint. I believe that that is a more sensible and logical way to deal with the issue because it avoids introducing unusual steps into the grievance procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para5"></a>In practice, it may be unnecessary for the manager to lodge a grievance in those circumstances. Often, the employer will initiate separate disciplinary action against a bullying manager. This process will give ample scope to accused managers to put their side.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para6"></a>I have already referred to the difficulties in defining bullying. That is a problem that has dogged discussions of this difficult and sensitive issue over a number of years. There is no precise, accepted definition of bullying that could be used for legal purposes. That is why there is no legislation against bullying. I do not believe that introducing it without any attempt at definition, which the amendments would do, would avoid the problem of creating great practical difficulties of interpretation.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para7"></a>I have identified what I believe are real problems with the amendments, but I acknowledge the importance of the issue to a very large number of noble Lords, and the head of steam beside it. I believe that we should meet to discuss the matter between now and Third Reading and I invite my noble friends to do just that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his speech. Having spoken to him informally, I know that he does recognise that bullying is increasingly becoming an issue in employment terms. I should like to offer a quick aside on the definition. When, over 25 years ago we were talking about racial harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation we were always told that they were difficult to define. Somehow we managed to get over that. Perhaps if we meet, which is an extremely helpful suggestion on the part of the Minister for which I thank him, we can deal with this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(c) issue the substantive version of the procedure after consideration has been given to the points submitted."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-13_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of Amendment No. 61 is to pinpoint some of the problems that we shall be facing as the relevant regulations are tabled. This is an opportune moment&#151;we had one brief bite at it upstairs&#151;because soon there will be intensive consideration of what is going to be a revolutionary impact on all companies in the country. We know that those companies will range between multi-plant companies, groups, public limited companies, and so on, down to very small companies. Within that spectrum there will be a whole variety of companies in terms of geography, size, employment hours and people.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para17"></a>As regards communicating important new procedures, we have been told that in industrial relations the communication would typically relate to the appropriate size of bargaining unit, or people with a particular logic, as to why they are the group being consulted.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para18"></a>I do not believe that it is too late to shed light on this matter because I suspect that it cannot be transposed into practice just by the best brains in the country sitting in a room. The matter needs to be carefully considered in order to ensure that we have a meaningful account of who has to do what in a particular environment.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para19"></a>It ties up with the fact that a useful cross-reference arises in government Amendment No. 64 on the right to be accompanied. I believe that that is relevant because it is important that firms and workers' representatives understand that there is a new chapter opening up here as to who is to be involved, and how, in various procedures. The ideal solution will be an explanatory note&#151;not just a unilateral notice board signed Department of Trade and Industry&#151;on how Mr Struthers in King's Lynn will deal with issues concerning the night shift in the transport depot . That is the degree of detail required of the domestic procedures which the Government wish to have credibility. That is why many issues will not need to go to industrial tribunals, as my noble friends Lord McCarthy, Lord Wedderburn and Lady Turner have stated on many occasions. All of that is true. However, it is also true that we have an opportunity to ensure that robust procedures are in place to ensure that the domestic environment is improved so that not only are such matters settled through procedures but the climate is improved so that the issues do not even arise. In my view new procedures will be required in almost every workplace as a result of this Bill.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para20"></a>On the opposite side of the argument, I know that there is a concern about too much regulation. The better that this matter is addressed in the initial stages&#151;and we are talking about a procedure at the time of introduction&#151;the longer it is likely to be before an issue will arise. Additionally, there would be worries about people's motives and about misrepresenting where people are coming from. If this can be got right from the start, however it is expressed, there will be a degree of joint ownership of the procedure. That is what we are aiming for. I do not necessarily intend a connection with trade unions, although I am a trade unionist and that is what I should like to see. However, I believe that there must be some degree of joint ownership of those procedures. That must be put in at the start.
<P>

<a name="20611-13_para21"></a>In Grand Committee, my noble friend indicated that some important matters need to be examined but not necessarily put on the face of the Bill. It would be useful if he would indicate how the Government visualise these matters being taken forward. There must be an acceptance that procedures are not being parachuted in from Whitehall but that they make sense in the workplace. We believe that over time they will make a great deal of sense in the workplace and we want to get them correct from the outset. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support my noble friend Lord Lea. The Minister in another place rightly spoke of the measure in terms not only of reducing the number of cases which go to employment tribunals but of introducing organisation, discipline, opportunities and rights to about 6 million workers. That is an innovative and exciting prospect and we do not want it buried. We need to have a clear explanation of how the Government intend to handle the matter.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para0"></a>They cannot handle it themselves, except by drawing attention to it. However, I believe that it is the responsibility of employers' organisations, trade unions and other bodies to ensure that when the Bill becomes law everyone knows of it and their rights. We know that the Government will not accept the amendment and we hope that provision will be contained in regulations. However, when will discussions take place on when these 6 million people will be told of their rights and who will be consulted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I agree with a great deal of what has been said and the thinking behind it. When we provide statutory procedures for the first time we want to ensure that they will work. I have a great deal of sympathy with much that has been said about the amendment because&#151;and I have bored the House with this previously&#151;as an employer of about 35 people in the only unionised market research company in the country, I did exactly what the amendment proposes. I produced a draft&#151;or rather it was produced by the union because it was much better qualified to do so. We provided the opportunity for comments and we finally provided a substantive version.

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para1"></a>However, when I consider the implications of writing such procedures into the Bill in the form suggested, I start to shudder. I was going to say that I could write a whole Bill on the subject, but I could not. I could give instructions to the departmental lawyers to give instructions to parliamentary counsel to write a Bill on the subject. It is enormously complicated and it requires a great deal more than what is provided in the amendment. Let us consider, for example, the issue of nominated individuals to whom complaints should be made. There is a wide variety of places of employment and of multi-plant organisations. I find it difficult to see how without injustice to a considerable number of employees one could produce a formula which could work for all of them.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para2"></a>However, we have the ACAS code. It provides guidance to employers about consulting their workforce before introducing their own procedures. That is what makes sense to me. I have no problem with that as guidance and we would encourage the parties to follow it voluntarily, as does ACAS. However, it is quite another matter to impose a new legislative requirement to consult. It would go beyond the effect of the ACAS code and it would take the Bill into different and controversial territory.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para3"></a>We have problems with the notion that employers of all sizes should be legally obliged to consult their workforce on their procedures. What would the cost be in terms of additional burdens on millions of employers, the majority of whom are in daily personal contact with their employees and do not need to go through statutory procedures for this purpose?
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para4"></a>We are concerned with positioning the amendment within the statutory procedures. Schedule 2 specifies the statutory minima; it does not deal with the detailed application within voluntary procedures. The amendment takes the schedule into areas which it was not designed to cover.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para5"></a>The schedule does not provide an entitlement to employers to vary the procedures themselves. Yet the amendment seems to encourage employers to vary the procedures after consulting their employees&#151;and quite right, too. It would even entitle employers to introduce procedures which were inferior to the minimum specified by the schedule, if their employees agreed. We had some difficulty with that when we considered Clause 39 in Grand Committee. Surely we do not want to open up that possibility.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para6"></a>We know that many employers already operate good procedures. We hope that many more will adopt their own procedures following the Bill's implementation and the introduction of statutory procedures. In many cases, employers will consult their workforce before introducing or changing the procedures. But we believe that such consultations are best taken on a voluntary basis without imposing any legal requirement to do so. We certainly do not want to cut across, for example, existing consultative arrangements with recognised unions, which might be the effect of these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, these issues will not go away; we have not heard the last word on the subject. Indeed, although my noble friend said that he shuddered at the implications of my amendment, perhaps he was shuddering at some of the issues which must be examined before the Bill is enacted.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para8"></a>When speaking to the amendment he used the expression "one size fits all". We are not talking about a single currency or a single interest rate and I shall not say that the penny has dropped because I shall mix my metaphors. Clearly, "one size fits all" is the nature of the Bill. As regards certain procedures, one size does fit all and I could say the same about any aspect of the Bill. The fact is that large firms, small firms, geographically dispersed firms, electronically based firms and so forth must introduce a procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para9"></a>I welcomed the Minister's reference to the ACAS code and for one moment thought that my noble friend was saying that it would be a generally agreed point of reference. It is inevitable that people will have a good look at the code, but in order to avoid disputes about how a procedure is introduced we cannot deny that this is a procedure. It is a procedure, and they appear in the Bill, so let us not use words as though they have no meaning. We are discussing the unique occasion on which they will be introduced.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para10"></a>This has been a useful opportunity to highlight these issues for discussion. When the brainstorming is up and running between the DTI and everyone else, I hope that something will have come out of our discussion today. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 67, line 19, at end insert "and should as far as reasonably practicable further seek to agree with the employee, or with a recognised trade union, a mechanism for the conduct of appeals taking into account the recommendations of any relevant code issued by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-14_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20611-14_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a modest and minor amendment. We are dealing with the general requirements which apply to Schedule 2, the statutory dispute resolution procedures, and we are trying to add to what it proposes should be done in respect of appeal.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para14"></a>Part 3(13)(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the case of appeal meetings which are not the first meeting, the employer should, as far as is reasonably practicable, be represented by a more senior manager than attended the first meeting (unless the most senior manager attended that meeting)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-14_para15"></a>
An element of an appeal mechanism is that the person taking the appeal was not involved in the first instance case. One must try to introduce an element of perceived independence or to bring a fresh mind to the issue. Part 3 is better than nothing but it is not enough&#151;particularly for the millions of people who will never reach a tribunal.
<P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para16"></a>The Government want to discourage people going to tribunals but say, "It will be all right. Tribunals will have the full rigour of the ACAS code". That is all very well but the overwhelming majority of employees do not get to a tribunal. The employer might know the law and be aware that he only has to observe what is said in the Bill. We want to insert in Part 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and should as far as reasonably practicable further seek to agree with the employee, or with a recognised trade union, a mechanism for the conduct of appeals taking into account the recommendations of any relevant code issued by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-14_para17"></a>
The amendment specifies "any relevant code" because we are not certain what the Government will do about the present code, which they will have to change to take into account the Bill's provisions. The code that we know and can reasonably ask the Government to consider is paragraphs 27 to 31 of the ACAS code on discipline and grievances, which generally deal with appeals.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para18"></a>One would not necessarily have to take into account all those provisions but parts of the code are of particular importance. There is provision for time limits in the Bill but not for a hearing by a manager not previously involved. The Government may say that many small firms only have one manager but in most cases they could find someone within the organisation who was not previously involved&#151;even if it is a member of the board. That will add to the feeling of equity.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para19"></a>If one does not want employees to go to tribunals, one must find an alternative to the employer's last word. The trouble is that the employer took the decision and was present. With an appeals procedure, one wants somebody who was not present and&#151;says the ACAS code&#151;someone who was not previously involved. If that proves impossible, the code says that one should seek an alternative form of perceived impartiality&#151;which is recognised by the Better Regulation Task Force. The code states also that if new evidence emerges as a result of the appeal process, time should be allowed for investigation and comment. That might result in a slightly different decision.
<P>

<a name="20611-14_para20"></a>I do not see why some, part or all of that should not be embodied in the Bill or regulations. I ask the Government to give me a friendly reply. I do not want them to say that we are trying to return to external dispute resolutions. We are not. We have given that up. We are saying that the employer should be asked to consider the possibility of bringing to the appeal process someone who was not previously involved because it would look better for the employer&#151;who should investigate also getting agreement between the parties that the worker himself might accept. That would be in the spirit of the ACAS code but there would be no compulsion. The amendment is an attempt to focus the Government's attention on the need to engineer a shift, so that there will be an alternative to the employer's last word. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20611-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend describes this as a modest amendment.

<a name="20611-15_para0"></a>The amendment is meant to fit the general requirements in Schedule 2 and, in particular, appeal meetings that are not the first meeting. Part 3(13)(3) states that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the employer should, as far as is reasonable practicable, be represented by a more senior manager than attended the first meeting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-15_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20611-15_para2"></a>I got the impression that my noble friend was not recognising that point.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para3"></a>The amendment proposes that the parties should seek to agree a mechanism for the conduct of appeals. I do not understand what is meant by "a mechanism". Is the intention to establish a joint system, whereby decisions about the conduct of appeals could be made&#151;or about the rules of conduct themselves?
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para4"></a>I find it difficult to understand the amendment and suspect that it is necessary. Part 3(13)(2) states that appeal meetings must be conducted in a manner that enables both the employer and employee to explain their cases. Is that not the amendment's objective?
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para5"></a>I and my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer have said several times this afternoon that use of the ACAS code should be encouraged even more than now. We agree with the Better Regulation Task Force in that regard but we have always resisted bringing the code into statute. The parties can draw on whatever guidance the ACAS code provides&#151;the amendment does not add anything of substance.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para6"></a>We have tried to keep the statutory procedures as short and simple as possible. We resist all embellishments, unless there is an extremely good case for them. The amendment would complicate the procedures. Part 3(13) covers most of the points made by the amendment and many people, including me, would be confused about its meaning.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I cannot resist responding to the Minister. I said that the amendment is modest and that it does not ask for much. It is just a little broader. I pointed out the fact that "a more senior manager" was on the statute book and on the face of the Bill. But to echo the Minister, he could have been there; he was not far enough away. He could have been the person who told the inferior person to sack the worker. ACAS wants someone who is not directly involved. It is better if it is a senior person because it will be easier for such a person to reverse the decision. It will be no good using someone with no authority. You cannot bring out the man who looks after the cars; you need someone with authority to reverse a decision of managers. It should be someone who is not involved in the dispute, and that is not on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para7"></a>The Minister says that he does not know what is meant by "mechanism for conduct". Those are three words and I can explain them in one: procedure. All noble Lords know what a procedure is and we are talking about a mechanism for the conduct of an appeal. That is a procedure.

<a name="20611-15_para8"></a>To reject this amendment will not do. The Government can continue to reject amendments, but I return to the point that there will be no reduction in tribunal hearings. This amendment is modest and it may induce a few people not to demand their day in court. If the Government will not accede to that, there will be no reduction in the number of tribunal hearings. When the results of the latest directives come in one will see that the figures will have risen and the Government will get around to introducing such a measure in the end. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 A meeting held for the purposes of this Schedule is a hearing for the purposes of section 13(4) and (5) of the Employment Relations Act 1999 (c. 26) (definition of "disciplinary hearing" and "grievance hearing" in relation to the right to be accompanied under section 10 of that Act)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-15_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in Grand Committee we discussed the case for including a reference to the right to be accompanied in the statutory procedures. That right was brought into being by the Employment Relations Act 1999. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, indicated that the Government were giving further consideration to the issue. We have done so and have come forward with this amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para13"></a>Its effect is to make it explicit that the right to be accompanied will apply to meetings held under the statutory procedures in the same way as the right applies now to hearings held under voluntary disciplinary and grievance procedures. In other words, it will remain the case that the right will apply where a meeting under the statutory dismissal and disciplinary procedures could result in the administration of a formal warning or some other formal action against the employee or the confirmation of such actions at an appeal. It will remain the case that the right will apply to meetings held under the statutory grievance procedures where the grievance concerns the performance of a duty by the employer in relation to the employee.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para14"></a>In our judgment, it is highly likely that the right to be accompanied would apply in this way even without the amendment. But we have listened to the debates on this issue and we recognise that some individuals, including eminent employment lawyers, have raised questions about these matters. We have therefore <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20611-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I cannot let this welcome government amendment pass without saying how glad we are that the obdurate opposition to putting this matter on the face of the Bill in another place and the keenness to deal with it in procedures and regulations in this place have been supplanted by the excellent principle of putting fundamental matters on the face of the Bill. We congratulate the Government on doing so and hope that they will follow their own precedent on other occasions.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will not mind if I raise one matter. By importing, as this amendment does, the welcome definition of meetings as hearings under Section 10 of the Employment Relations Act, which is specifically mentioned as part of Schedule 2 procedures, does it mean that the definition of "grievance hearing" in the Employment Relations Act applies to the meaning of "grievance"? I ask that especially in relation to "grievance"; otherwise there is no definition of "grievance" in the Bill. It is important to know what is a grievance or it will be when the matter is argued in a procedure. One will need to know whether an employee should use the first step in the grievance procedure. If he does not use the first step he will not be able to go to a tribunal, and if he does he cannot go to a tribunal for 28 days.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para16"></a>This amendment, in a most welcome manner, rightly applies the meaning of "grievance hearing" in Sections 10, 12 and 13 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 for the purposes of what is a meeting in this Bill. Of course, in doing so the question arises whether, for the first time, the Government are defining "grievance". If they are defining "grievance" in precisely the same way as it is defined in Sections 10, 12 and 13 of the 1999 Act, that has important consequences, not only for understanding generally, but also in relation to the amendments that they have moved today about what an employee has to do in regard to the grievance procedure. I believe that we are entitled to know how far this amendment imports the other parts of those sections that go with Section 10 in the 1999 Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have two immediate reactions to that. First, the word "grievance" is used widely in Schedule 2 and, secondly, as I understand it the amendment is tightly drawn. I believe the wisest course would be for me to write to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn on this matter in good time before Third Reading.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-15_para18"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>"Scope of grievance procedures</B></center><br>
 (1) The procedures set out in Part 2 are only applicable to matters raised by an employee with his employer as a grievance.
<br>
(2) Accordingly, those procedures are only applicable to the kind of disclosure dealt with in Part 4A of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (protected disclosures of information) if information is disclosed by an employee to his employer in circumstances where&#151;
<br>
(a) the information relates to a matter which the employee could raise as a grievance with his employer, and
<br>
(b) it is the intention of the employee that the disclosure should constitute the raising of the matter with his employer as a grievance."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-15_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, both at Second Reading and in Grand Committee, my noble friends Lord Borrie and Lord Gladwin discussed the interaction between the statutory procedures and the system for making and protecting public interest disclosures. That system was introduced by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which inserted new sections about public interest disclosures into the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para20"></a>My noble friends voiced concerns that the statutory grievance procedure may undermine, or be thought to cut across, the Act. It was felt in some quarters that employees may, rightly or wrongly, feel compelled to use the statutory grievance procedure when they wanted to make a public interest disclosure relating to their own personal treatment. In other words, they may feel constrained from raising their concern in a less formal way with their employer or via dedicated disclosure procedures. They may also think that they could not make the disclosure to third parties.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para21"></a>Ministers have stressed that we do not want the statutory procedures to undermine the Act. At Second Reading I said that the Bill and the regulations would secure that that was the case. But the doubts remained and in Grand Committee on 11th April my noble friend Lord Sainsbury announced that the Government intended to table an amendment that would remove any lingering uncertainty that the Bill would carry with it such unintended effects. He also indicated that officials would consult Public Concern at Work on the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para22"></a>We have therefore tabled this amendment to remove all doubt on the matter. We have consulted Public Concern at Work on drafts of the amendment. We are grateful for its helpful input and I want to place on public record our thanks for its support in this work and for the letter that Guy Dehn of Public Concern at Work sent to all noble Lords yesterday.
<P>

<a name="20611-15_para23"></a>His letter confirms my belief that our amendment satisfies its concerns. It makes it clear that employees are free to decide how they wish to pursue a concern which could be treated either as a public interest disclosure or as a grievance. If they wish to take up an issue as a grievance, they can do so. If they wish to disclose their concern in other ways consistent with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, then they are free <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to pursue that course of action either as an alternative to raising the matter as a grievance or, indeed, as an addition to raising it as a grievance.

<a name="20611-15_para24"></a>I hope that the amendment will satisfy all the concerns expressed and I commend it to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendment, particularly on behalf of Public Concern at Work, of which I am a patron. As my noble friend Lord McIntosh said, the amendment fulfils the assurances given in Grand Committee by my noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Turville in response to an amendment I moved. Public Concern at Work is grateful also for the consultation that followed the Minister's response to the suggestion made in Grand Committee by my noble friend Lord Gladwin of Clee.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para0"></a>The amendment makes it clear that the Bill's grievance procedure does not undermine the legislative framework for whistleblowing in the public interest contained in the Public Interest Disclosure Act. The Act encourages employees to raise public interest concerns internally, but it is important for obvious reasons that there should also be an option for employees to raise matters externally; for example, with appropriate regulators.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para1"></a>That option is preserved through the amendment, so long as it is not the employee's intention to raise the matter as a grievance. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton mentioned in another context the remaining deficiency that the Bill contains no definition of "grievance". I raise this point as a fact, not as an objection to the amendment, because consultations can take place before regulations are drafted to fill that deficiency and to define what is a grievance.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para2"></a>The view of Public Concern at Work is that the key element of a grievance procedure is that its purpose is to remedy or redress some harm or damage suffered by an employee. That differs from whistleblowing, where the purpose is to alert or to put on notice the employer or the relevant authority so that they can assess what action, if any, is needed. As the new statutory dispute regime is concerned only with grievances which may ground a tribunal claim, a definition of grievance that recognises the essential element of remedy for personal harm is appropriate. That is because the pre-eminent reason claims are brought to a tribunal is to seek a personal redress, especially, and usually, compensation for a detriment or harm the employee believes that he has suffered at the employer's hands.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para3"></a>We trust that Her Majesty's Government will confirm that there will now be full and open consultation on what is a grievance before regulations are introduced. We trust too that they will confirm that the key element of a grievance in the new regime will be that the employee is seeking a remedy or redress for harm or detriment.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para4"></a>When the Bill becomes an Act, the new statutory regime will be explained in various ways to employers and employees, who can all usefully be reminded of the <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nature and value of whistleblowing. If an employee is concerned about wrongdoing in his workplace, be it fraud, public danger, danger to public health or cover up of wrongdoing, he should feel able to raise that matter as a witness and be seen as such by managers and fellow employees rather than as a complainant who may have a personal interest in the outcome.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para5"></a>If, sadly, as we all know happens only too frequently, an employee is victimised as a result of blowing the whistle perfectly legitimately within the public interest disclosure regime and seeks a personal remedy, the grievance procedure set out in Schedule 2 will apply as it does to any other kind of grievance. I warmly welcome the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendment. The comments of my noble friend Lord Borrie are right. But I have a problem, and I want to help the Government in its solution. As my noble friend Lord Borrie said, it relates to what was said about the previous amendment. He suggested&#151;and I understand what he was saying&#151;that a grievance concerns harm, damage or detriment to the employee. If that is to be used as the definition or near-definition of "grievance", it will be different from the definition in the Employment Relations Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para6"></a>The Minister might pay some regard to the different definition in Section 13(5) of that Act, where a grievance hearing is defined as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a hearing which concerns the performance of a duty by an employer in relation to a worker".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-16_para7"></a>
If grievances relate only to the performance of a legal duty by the employer, that is rather narrower than the definition suggested by my noble friend Lord Borrie, where harm or detriment to the worker is the distinguishing point. It may seem a small point, but it would be critical in evaluating when whistleblowing is properly preserved by the amendment. Perhaps the Minister could indicate, if he is going to write to me, that he will write also to my noble friend Lord Borrie, and perhaps to all noble Lords concerned, telling us which of those definitions is likely to be adopted.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para8"></a>I suggest that the Minister should take seriously the definition in Section 13(5) of the Employment Relations Act and consider whether it should apply to both the Section 10 amendment we have just debated and the amendment under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Borrie and Lord Wedderburn for their support. I confirm that when I write to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn on the issue&#151;and my reply will be informed by his further helpful comments&#151;I shall write also to my noble friend Lord Borrie, to the other Front Benches and all other Members of my party who have taken part in the debate; my noble friend Lord Gladwin is particularly associated with Public Concern at Work.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-16_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to incorporate a clause dealing with interpretation. Both in the standard and modified procedures there is a requirement to set out grievances in writing and to send a copy to the employer. That effectively starts the procedure. The amendment ensures that there is as little delay as possible in commencing procedures. Therefore, if a party states that a statement or a copy of it has been sent to another party, it shall be presumed&#151;a word I emphasise&#151;that it has been sent. Surely this is sensible. Is the worker expected to prove that he has sent it? Why should proceedings be delayed by arguments about whether or not it has been sent?
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para13"></a>The legislation ought to be user-friendly. We have to remember that the workforce is becoming increasingly multi-ethnic&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned this and I am sure that it is agreed in all parts of the House&#151;and there may be language difficulties or cultural misunderstandings. Giving the employee the benefit of the doubt in such circumstances would appear to be eminently sensible. Employment tribunal proceedings are intended to be simple and easily accessible. Many of the people seeking to use the procedures will be relatively poor and it is the duty of politicians, as we have repeatedly said in the House, to be helpful to the vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn raised this issue in an earlier, differently worded, amendment in Grand Committee. Unfortunately, because my noble friends and I were not particularly happy with the response that we received from our noble and learned friend the Minister at that stage, we are bringing back the matter with slightly different wording.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para15"></a>The second part of the amendment provides that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-16_para16"></a>
The Government have repeatedly acknowledged that ACAS is the organisation with the relevant expertise. Undoubtedly it will be called upon to provide advice and assistance in what, for many, will be an entirely new field of operation. The intention of the Bill is to get employers with no procedures to adopt at least a minimal level. But they may well need assistance, and ACAS is the right place to go for it. Interpretation may be difficult for some. The amendment makes it clear that guidance must be available and taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME="20611-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree that the amendment is intended to be constructive. I can assure my noble friend Lady Turner that we did take away the amendment and that we did think about it again. But the result of that further thought is that we have not changed the view that we took when we debated a similar amendment in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para18"></a>As my noble friend said, there are two issues here. The first concerns disputes between parties about the sending of written communications under the statutory procedures&#151;Step 1 letters, for example. Of course disputes do arise in practice; letters get lost in the post and people pretend that letters have been sent when they have not been. This part of the amendment tries to cut through such disagreement by entering a presumption in the procedures that the sender is always right if he or she asserts that a communication has been sent. My noble friend is concerned about the implications of this kind of dispute for an employee's access to the tribunal system. We do not believe that these issues will cause problems for tribunals and therefore, by extension, for employees.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para19"></a>In our judgment, it would be extremely difficult for the employer to prove that a communication was never sent, especially if a dated copy was retained by the sender. So any disputes on these points would not detain the tribunals for long. However, there may be cases where the employer has valid evidence that a communication was not sent. For example, the employer's computer records may provide evidence about the alleged use of internal e-mail systems to send written communications. We should not discount the existence of that possibility by introducing a presumption of this kind. That would bring the procedures into disrepute.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para20"></a>The second point introduces a cross-reference to the guidance given by any relevant ACAS code or other statement of guidance when interpreting the schedule. We have discussed this matter on a number of occasions, both in Grand Committee and today. In particular, I responded to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lea, Amendment No. 44, on this point.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para21"></a>To repeat the issue, the ACAS code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures would of course be relevant to the use of statutory procedures. The only question is whether a specific reference to the code is necessary here. As I said before, I am confident that it is not. When considering "any question" to which an ACAS code may be relevant, tribunals must already take the code into account under Section 207 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992.
<P>

<a name="20611-16_para22"></a>The amendment also refers to other "statements of guidance" issued by ACAS. At present, statute does not require tribunals to take into account other such ACAS documents. Indeed, I am not quite sure what <P>


<a name="column_191"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other ACAS documents would be covered by the term. I am therefore reluctant to introduce a novel reference of this kind into the Bill.

<a name="20611-16_para23"></a>While confirming that the amendment is intended to be constructive, I would ask my noble friend Lady Turner not to press it.

However, I am rather disappointed that the Government have not found it possible to come back more sympathetically to the submissions that we made in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para0"></a>My noble friend said that the procedures could be brought into disrepute. That was one of the statements made on behalf of the Government in Grand Committee. We believe that if proceedings are delayed because of arguments about whether or not documents have been sent, that of itself is likely to bring the procedures into disrepute. It was to avoid that kind of incident that the amendment was drafted yet again for Report stage.

<a name="20611-17_para1"></a>As to the reference to ACAS, as I said earlier, ACAS undoubtedly will be asked to advise on these new procedures. It seems appropriate that it should be clearly stated on the face of the Bill that if any matter of interpretation is to be discussed or investigated, then the guidance from ACAS should be looked at. Undoubtedly ACAS will issue guidance. This is a new set of procedures and I am sure that ACAS will be asked to provide, if not a code, at least some notes of guidance for people operating procedures of this kind for the first time.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para2"></a>There is no point in proceeding any further with this issue at this stage. That being the case, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-17_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20611-17_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 31 deals with the non-completion of statutory procedures and specifies adjustment of awards where procedures have not been completed. Subsection (2) states that where there has been non-completion wholly or mainly due to failure by the employee, the ET must reduce any award to the employee by 10 per cent and, if it considers it just and equitable, it can reduce it by a further amount but not so as to make a total reduction of more than 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para6"></a>In subsection (3) it states that if the non-completion is wholly or mainly due to a failure by the employer, the ET must increase any award made to the employee by 10 per cent, or, if it believes it just and equitable, increase it by a further amount but not so as to make a total increase of more than 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para7"></a>However, subsection (4) allows the tribunal some flexibility. It states that in exceptional circumstances which would make a reduction or an increase unjust or <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>inequitable, the ET may make no reduction or increase. My amendment seeks to remove the word "exceptional" from this clause. I do not understand the need for it. If it is unjust or inequitable in the view of the tribunal not to make an increase or a reduction in an award, surely that is a matter for the employment tribunal. What is meant by the word "exceptional" in this context? It can simply add to uncertainty. The ET's view of what is just and equitable should be sufficient. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, this may seem to be a very small amendment, but it is rather important. There are places in the legislation on these matters where special circumstances are mentioned as regards, for example, the employer's duty to consult. That has given rise to a great deal of litigation. Exceptional circumstances will do the same. Either there are circumstances where it is unjust and inequitable to make no reduction or increase in the awards, or there are not.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para8"></a>Exceptional circumstances pose a question which the tribunals and the courts will have to answer. As we have seen with the interpretation of special circumstances, that can be a matter of very great difficulty. I cannot understand why the Government insist on introducing these words especially as the matter was dealt with in the 12th report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, dated 25th February, which commented on Clause 31(4). It states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In our view it would have been preferable had it been possible to draft clause 31(4) in a way which ensured that it would have operated proportionately without the need to resort to external aids to interpretation in the form of the Human Rights Act and a judicial decision in an unconnected area of the law. This might have been achieved, for example, by giving tribunals a single discretion in clause 31(4) to reduce or increase an amount of any enhancement or restriction of the award, allowing a tribunal to fix an amount of between zero and 50 per cent 'if it considers it just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so'. This would have reduced the complexity of clause 31, improved its transparency, and reduced the risk of tribunals behaving in a way which might be disproportionate. We draw this to the attention of each House".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-17_para9"></a>
Like some other passages in the 12th report, no one has drawn that passage to the attention of this House or any other House.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para10"></a>The comments on Clause 31(4) almost led us to move a much longer amendment to try to incorporate the precise proposal of the Joint Committee, but we did not do so because we thought that the removal of the word "exceptional" would go a long way in the direction of that proposal. I put it to the Minister that paragraph 16, which I have partially read, of the 12th report of the Joint Committee supports the simplification of Clause 31(4) in a way which it would not be very sensible of the Government to resist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the purpose of Clause 31 is to encourage the use of statutory procedures. It does that by providing that an employment tribunal must reduce or increase any award if the statutory procedures have not been completed according to whether the fault lies with the employee or the employer.
<P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para11"></a>Because of the importance that we attach to the completion of procedures, we have stipulated that the minimum adjustment for non-compliance must be 10 per cent although there may be an adjustment of up to 50 per cent if the tribunal considers it just and equitable in all the circumstances. However, we do recognise that there may be times when a 10 per cent penalty will be disproportionate, so subsection (4) provides that the duty to make an adjustment of 10 per cent does not apply if there are exceptional circumstances which would make such an adjustment unjust or inequitable. In that case the tribunal may make an adjustment of less than 10 per cent or even make no adjustment at all. It will be for the tribunal to decide when this discretion should be exercised. The amendment would remove the word "exceptional" and would therefore weaken the principle that there will be a 10 per cent minimum adjustment, and hence reduce the incentive to complete the procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has quite properly raised the issue of the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He has quoted the views of that committee. In her letter to it, the Secretary of State argued that even if Article 6(1) does impose requirements as to the way in which compensation is to be calculated, the obligations require no more than that any restrictions on compensation are imposed for a purpose which is in the public interest, that any restriction is proportionate and that it is in accordance with the law. She further argued that the restriction on compensation provided in Clause 31 is proportionate. In line with Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, Clause 31(4) would have to be read and given effect so far as is possible in a manner compatible with human rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para13"></a>I know, and the House has been told, that the committee would have preferred Clause 31(4) to have been drafted in a way which ensured that it would operate proportionately without the need to resort to external aid to interpretation such as the Human Rights Act 1998. But in conclusion, the committee found that the Government's approach was legitimate. It found that the approach was unlikely to give rise to incompatibility with Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore, from the point of view of the Joint Committee, there is no need to remove the word "exceptional". That word is included because we want to have the principle as strongly as possible that there will be an adjustment of an award in order to strengthen the encouragement to use the statutory procedures available.

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-17_para15"></a><P>

"( ) Where an award falls to be adjusted under this section and under section 38, the adjustment under this section shall be made before the adjustment under that section."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-17_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, there is a difficulty of presentation about this group of amendments, which includes Amendment No. 68 and Amendments Nos. 97 to 106. The difficulty is that the substantive amendments are Amendments Nos. 97 to 106 which refer to Clause 38. I have to include in the group Amendment No. 68 because the others do not make sense without it. In effect it is a paving amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 97 to 106 arise because of the huge difficulty that we all had in Grand Committee in understanding Clause 38: it was exceptionally complicated. It was generally felt in the Committee that something had to be done to simplify it. It is the penalty structure for non-compliance with the written statement of employment provisions in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para18"></a>During consideration of Clause 38, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, in particular drew attention to the complexity of the system of penalties set out. As currently drafted, where an employee brings a successful claim of one of the types listed in Schedule 5, and it is evident that the employer has failed to meet his obligations under the written statute provisions, the tribunal will increase the award between 5 per cent and 25 per cent. The award uplift will be subject to a floor of one or two weeks' pay depending on whether the statement was absent or just incomplete or inaccurate.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para19"></a>We are confident that the general principle behind this measure is right and that it will help employers to recognise how crucial is the written statement to clarity in the employment relationship and how important it is, therefore, that all employers should meet their obligations to provide the statement. The general principle of encouraging compliance in this way was welcomed by most respondents to the consultation. However, as I said in Grand Committee, on reflection we agree with those who have commented that the penalty regime is unnecessarily complex.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para20"></a>Therefore, we have introduced these amendments which have a fixed-rate penalty in place of the current percentage-based approach. We believe that this will do the job just as well and will be simpler for tribunals to administer. Taken together they will substitute an award of two or four weeks' pay for the current system of compensation. Just as in the current drafting, the award will be payable if the statement is incomplete, inaccurate or absent, or if a notification of any change to the particulars has not been given. The award will be a flat rate rather than a percentage uplift.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para21"></a>Perhaps it would help if I outlined how the amendments will work. Amendments Nos. 97 to 100 reword subsection (2) of Clause 38 to direct the tribunals that even where an employee has not received a financial reward they may make an award of two weeks' pay or, if the tribunal considers it just and <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>equitable, a higher amount of four weeks' pay. Amendments Nos. 101 to 104 make a similar change to subsection (3), so that the same regime applies where there is a financial award in the first place. Amendment No. 105 rewords subsections (4) to (6), effectively replacing the original awards structure with the more straightforward options of two or four weeks' pay. Finally, Amendment No. 106 removes the now unnecessary cap of 50 per cent on the combined increase in awards under Clauses 31 and 38.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para22"></a>Whether the tribunals make the higher or lower award will be at their discretion. It will not necessarily be tied to the type of failure. So, for example, tribunals will have discretion to decide that an employer's failure to issue a statement in certain circumstances is not as serious as its inaccuracy in others and hence give the lower award.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para23"></a>I hope that the House will agree that, taken together, these changes can only be for the good because the revised remedy will serve the intended purpose of putting employers on notice that they ignore their written statement obligations at their peril; and it is now a simpler and more readily understandable formula for calculating the penalty.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para24"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 68, which is a technical amendment. The change that we are making by substituting an award of two or four weeks' pay for the current system of compensation in Clause 38 would have the effect, without this amendment, that the overall amount awarded would vary according to whether the Clause 31 adjustment or the Clause 38 adjustment was made first. If I am forced to do so, I can illustrate that with an example, but I would much rather not. As Clause 38 is currently drafted, the order of adjustment does not matter because the increase in the overall amount awarded is the same in either case.
<P>

<a name="20611-17_para25"></a>Tribunals now need to know in what order the adjustments should be made. This amendment makes it clear that the Clause 31 adjustment should be made first. If it were not, the effect would be that the penalty for failure to supply a written statement would vary according to whether the Clause 31 adjustment or the Clause 38 adjustment was made first&#151;and that is not our intention. I beg to move.

<br>
(b) the requirement has not been complied with."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-18_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, having discussed Clauses 31 and 38, we now come to Clause 32. This is at the core and centre of the apparatus introduced <P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerning the procedures dealt with in Schedule 2. This clause is concerned, as we saw in Grand Committee, with the limitations on access to justice in the tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para2"></a>We had a rather unsatisfactory debate on a similar amendment in Grand Committee. That was partly because our amendment was too widely drawn. We have corrected that in order to aim at what I take to be an agreed central objective. In the regulations for employment tribunals in 2001, a new overriding principle was introduced in Rule 10. The rule states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The overriding objective of the Rules in Schedules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-18_para3"></a>
which are the relevant rules on employment tribunals&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is to enable tribunals to deal with cases justly".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-18_para4"></a>
In dealing with cases justly&#151;as those familiar with seminars on jurisprudence will perhaps accept&#151;dealing with equal situations equally, and being even-handed, is a fundamental manner of approaching a just administration.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para5"></a>Under subsections (2), (3) and (4) of Clause 32 the employee is obliged to take the first step under the grievance procedure if he is to be allowed admissibility to the tribunal. I deal with his wish to go to the tribunal&#151;which is how "access to justice" is defined. In the debate in Grand Committee all kinds of problems were introduced&#151;for example, that he might have a second chance to go. But principles on access to justice, as the discussions of the European convention make very clear, are not concerned with second chances; they are concerned with primary access to justice. Under Clause 32(2), the employee is prohibited, as I put it, from presenting his complaint to the employment tribunal. Government Ministers tend to say that he will find that his complaint is not admissible to the employment tribunal if,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it concerns a matter in relation to which the requirement in paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2 applies, and . . . the requirement has not been complied with".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-18_para6"></a>
So, if he has not complied with the first step under the grievance procedure, he cannot go to the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para7"></a>This amendment applies a rule to the employer which is as even-handed as that which is applied to the employee. If the employer has not complied with his first step in the grievance procedure, the amendment would say that he is not permitted to enter a notice of appearance, which in general terms would mean that he is under a precisely parallel limitation to justice as that applied to the employee. If he has not complied with the first steps that he is obliged to take before inviting the employee to a meeting and, in the modified procedure, setting out his written response&#151;the amendment would say that he is under precisely the same sanction as the employee who has failed in precisely the same way. It is a breach of the statute, and it is a breach of his contractual obligations by reason of the provisions of Clause 30.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para8"></a>If the Government really mean to be even-handed and to promote their own objectives, they must say something to the employer who fails in his obligations in a precisely parallel way to that in which the <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employee is spoken to when he fails to undertake his first obligation in the statutory procedures under Schedule 2. Without such a provision, there is no substance in the Government's claim that the provisions of Schedule 2 will promote dialogue and settlement at the place of work.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para9"></a>The employee must take his first steps, or he cannot go to the tribunal. Even if he does take the first steps his case is held up for 28 days. We have not included the second point, only the first. This is a most modest proposal; namely, that when the employer fails to take the first steps that he should take under his statutory and contractual obligations, he should be under precisely parallel sanctions to those on the employee. In that way, he would be encouraged to get on with the procedure, to do what he ought to do. He would have a sanction against him if he did not do that. At the moment, he has absolutely none so far as concerns access to justice&#151;presumably only the remedy of the employee, who can sue him for breach of contract. But the Government wish not to encourage litigation, so they could introduce an automatic penalty, just as they have done for the employer. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn pointed out, the admissibility regime in Clause 32 relates directly to employees. Where it applies, the regime ensures that the employees must at least initiate the statutory grievance procedure, and then wait 28 days before applying to a tribunal. My noble friend's amendment seeks to establish a parallel set of obligations on employers. In order to defend an application at a tribunal, the amendment would impose a requirement on employers to take certain acts under the grievance procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para10"></a>We debated a similar amendment in Grand Committee on 25th March. On that occasion, as my noble friend acknowledges, amendments were tabled that sought to require employers to complete all their obligations under the procedures as a pre-condition for defending cases at a tribunal. This latest amendment pares down that obligation to some extent; for example, under the standard grievance procedure, the pre-condition is limited to the obligation on the employer to invite the employee to a meeting.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para11"></a>The idea as advanced by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is to establish, as he would put it, an "even-handed" system. I believe that we have already done so. If one looks at Part 3 of the Bill in its entirety, it will be seen that Clauses 31 and 34 provide clear incentives to employers to use the procedures. If they do not, increased awards will be made against them, and there will be automatic findings of unfair dismissal. Clauses 31 and 32 provide the corresponding incentives to employees&#151;reduced awards and a procedural bar to bringing proceedings, until the procedure is satisfied. That is the parallel incentive and disincentive, depending on which way one looks at it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para12"></a>Therefore, when considering the Bill overall, we can see that obligations are placed upon both parties. It would seriously imbalance the position if fresh obligations were placed on employers under Clause 32, as proposed in my noble friend's amendment. On that basis, we are unable to accept the amendment. It would upset the balance of the Bill and unnecessarily restrict the ability of employers to defend themselves at tribunals. In the light of my explanation, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble and learned friend for his response. It proves that the Law Society was right in its view; namely, that Clause 32 (formerly Clause 33) should be struck out of the Bill. The Law Society says that Clause 31 is sufficient. The answer to this amendment from my noble and learned friend is to advise us to look at Clause 31. Very well, he is absolutely right to point out that Clause 31 imposes sanctions on both sides&#151;that is, on employees and on employers. Indeed, that is the sanction under the clause where the tribunal exercises it various powers and discretions to increase or decrease awards, and it applies to both sides.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para13"></a>The trouble with Clause 32 is that there is a sanction on workers but no sanction on employers. I hear someone muttering a reference to Clause 34. We shall deal with that clause later, although I am not sure at what time of night. My noble and learned friend need have no fear. We shall deal with that clause, which is even worse. Clause 34 will reverse a fundamental principle of procedural justice. Therefore, to rely on Clause 34 to justify Clause 32 when you have Clause 31, which the Law Society says is totally adequate for the Government's objectives, is most extraordinary.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para14"></a>My noble and learned friend does not take account of a very simple point. We all like to appear to be reasonable and not mention unfortunate possibilities. However, I have to tell my noble and learned friend that among working people and their representatives, especially recently, there is a belief that the Government have given in to the pressure of employers' organisations to make the procedures under Schedule 2 and Clause 32 unfair to working people. The imposition of a sanction upon workers under Clause 32 with no corresponding sanction upon employers when the Law Society has said that Clause 31 is adequate, coupled with the response by my noble and learned friend to the case that I put forward in which he cited Clause 31 as a justification, will give them good reason to conclude that that pressure has succeeded.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para15"></a>Before Third Reading, the Government must come forward with a further provision in relation to Schedule 2 and Clause 32 that will somehow make fairer the standard of modified procedures; otherwise, when the first cases reach the tribunals and the courts and this unfortunate set of principles applied to workers in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill comes to light, the Government will have to face an explosion of wrath because that will be seen as the price for gaining <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>acceptance by employers' organisations of union learning representatives and increased maternity and family rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-18_para16"></a>It just will not do to tell me that no sanction can be placed upon employers in Clause 32, simply because equal sanctions are placed on workers and employers in Clause 31. However, there is not much that we can do about the situation. The Bill was sent upstairs to a Grand Committee; it received little notice; and it is now being pushed through in an extraordinary Report stage. All we can do is ask the Government to put aside the pressures that have been placed upon them. They must reconsider the way in which Clause 32 operates before we reach Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-19_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Clause 32 deals with complaints about grievances, something about which we have, I suppose, the most criticism. The clause states that you cannot start to redress your grievance&#151;in other words, you cannot get on your journey to a hearing&#151;unless the statutory conditions are fulfilled. The worker must present the written grievance. He has then to wait for the employer to reply, after which he has to attend a meeting. Thereafter, if he so desires, he can take the matter to appeal. If he receives a reply to the appeal, he must wait for 28 days.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para2"></a>We discussed this issue at length in Grand Committee, but we have been unable to understand why this fifth restriction on access should be imposed. If there are four restrictions on access, why does there need to be a fifth? We are being extremely modest here, because we are only asking for 14 days. Indeed, we might as well ask, "Why not?" We put that question in Grand Committee and received a reply from my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. Unfortunately, we were perhaps a little provocative because we suggested that the Government had gleaned their information from the CBI. Alternatively, we thought that the Government had some reason for stipulating the 28-day period. We wondered whether there was something that we had not really appreciated which made the 28 days the most appropriate time-scale.

So 28 days turns out to be not too long, not too short, but just right; and it provides a window of opportunity. However, we are not told why the 28-day period will provide this "window of opportunity".

They may also take other steps, outside the statutory procedure, to try to clarify and unravel their problems. In our judgment, a 14-day period would be too short".&#151;[Official Report, 25/03/02; col. CWH 325.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-19_para8"></a>
This is a very strange type of defence. It is as though people cannot talk to each other once ACAS arrives. It is as though the parties separate once ACAS arrives. It also does not seem good enough to provide for an arrangement telling ACAS to come back. The Government seem to be saying that the parties can talk to each other only when no one is around.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para9"></a>So we have raised our various objections and said that we do not think the "window of opportunity" was a very good argument. What the Government have never dealt with is the delay affecting applicants after they fill in the ET1. The Government give the impression that those involved in running tribunals sit around waiting for work and fire off an ET3, ring up ACAS and start acting as soon as they receive an ET1. But that is not what happens. As I tried to say in Committee&#151;but I did not receive any further figures from the Government&#151;the tribunal system is extremely cagey about how long cases take. One cannot obtain that information. Those involved in the system say that they have a target of 26 weeks, and that 77 per cent of cases are heard within 26 weeks whereas the other 23 per cent take a bit longer. However, that is not what we want to know. We want to know the proportion of cases settled in one week, two weeks, three weeks and so on, but we have not been told. When one asks, one is simply told, "The information would just confuse you. You do not really want to know. Anyway, we do not like to look too closely into it; 77 per cent of cases get a hearing within 26 weeks. If we could get that up to 80 or 85 per cent, we would be cooking with gas". That does not really help.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para10"></a>On the hearsay evidence of those I know who work on tribunals or act as side-persons in tribunals and even chair tribunals, it seems that all sorts of cases take six weeks, seven weeks or eight weeks to go to tribunal after the case is lodged. Why the dickens do the Government want to impose an arbitrary 28 days on top of all that? That has never been explained. Of course the Government say that they will not necessarily apply this to everyone. However, we are not told for whom it will not work. We have therefore tabled subsequent amendments to address that issue.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para11"></a>We are making a very modest proposal. We are simply saying that if the Government cannot justify the 28-day proposal or accept that ACAS ceases its involvement as soon as it cannot proceed any further, after which the parties will again negotiate, we do not need that 28-day dead period in which nothing will happen. Other methods of facilitating a settlement should operate as and when they are required and <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>useful. If a poor worker has to wait five or six weeks before he gets to a tribunal, I fail to see why he should be subject to another 28 days of delay. So if the period cannot be eliminated entirely, let us make it 14 days. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20611-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I have a few brief remarks to support the case made by my noble friend Lord McCarthy for Amendment No. 71. This amendment interrelates with the problem to which we shall come in Schedule 4 as to the ambit of Clause 32. Clause 32 applies to a vast number of situations, as we shall see when we come to Schedule 4. There is much to be said about Schedule 4 and its interrelationship with Clause 32. For example, this 28-day period in which the worker has to return to work applies to sex discrimination cases, race discrimination cases and disability discrimination cases, during which time the worker has to go back to work and continue to suffer for 28 days if the employer does not deal with the matter in dialogue, as some employers will and others will not. What is the point of that? Why do the Government not say, "You must go back for 28 days, but that does not apply unless the employer gives a guarantee that he will negotiate"?
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para12"></a>The Government do not say that. They do not put any obligation on the employer during those 28 days. They just say, "It may happen that there is dialogue during those 28 days". It may happen and it may not. What kind of guarantee to workers is that? Do they not understand why workers are not satisfied with this structure, in which they are told to work and suffer discrimination before they can get anywhere near the doors of a tribunal? It really will not do. The list in Schedule 4, as we shall see, goes much further than that, listing cases in which workers have been victimised. Those workers will have to go back and be victimised again, for 28 days. It is a quite preposterous idea.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy is of course right that, in proposing 14 days, we are questioning why the period should exist at all. In Grand Committee, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ultimately, it is a matter of judgment. In considering the correct period, the Government and those advising them have sought to take a balanced view in relation to all sorts of cases . . . In some cases, the effect of promoting the use of the grievance procedure in this way will be to bring the detriment to an end more quickly than would otherwise have been the case".&#151;[Official Report, 25/03/02; col. CWH 326.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-19_para14"></a>
We accept that in some cases. But what about the other cases? The worker will have to suffer for 28 days more, and that is not reasonable.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para15"></a>My noble and learned friend really must face up to that fact. Whatever guarantees have been given about this limitation on access to justice really should be reviewed, and my noble friend's arguments for this amendment should be seriously considered before Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   We debated an identical amendment in Grand Committee. The arguments then <P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advanced were similar, and the Government's response is inevitably similar. The overriding objective of Part 3 is to encourage a dialogue between employer and employee. We consider that the existence of a tribunal application complicates that dialogue and in some cases completely sours it. That point largely deals with the point made by my noble friend Lord McCarthy that, after the application, there are inevitably delays before a case is heard.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para16"></a>In our judgment, a period of 28 days is needed to give time for the parties to consider the grievance and act upon it. It provides enough time for them to meet and communicate directly with one another without the extra pressures, complications and, in some cases, sourness imposed by a tribunal application. A shorter period would be insufficient. In our judgment, a longer period would be excessive and unnecessarily delay access to the tribunal. To our knowledge, there is no recent survey evidence showing how much time is taken up by grievance procedures. However, the ACAS code gives some guidance on the time that should be taken by the parties when undertaking parts of procedures. For example, employers should give their response to a grievance within five working days of meeting the employee to discuss the grievance. Likewise, after an appeal hearing, managers should communicate their final decision within 10 working days. When one factors in this advice by ACAS, a total period of 28 calendar days does not seem excessive.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn cited cases in which there was harassment and difficulty. As we have said, there will be some special cases, and the threat of violence or other forms of serious harassment fall into this category. Likewise, we do not want to force employees to raise a grievance as an individual complaint if it has already been addressed as a collective issue by a union on their behalf. We intend to cover these two main categories of exemptions in the regulations. There may be others which it would be sensible to add by consulting fully on the draft regulations. Interested parties can give us their own views on this key subject.
<P>

<a name="20611-19_para18"></a>In the light of what I have said, I hope that my noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lord Wedderburn will feel able to withdraw or not press their amendments.

<A NAME="20611-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, this is simply a dialogue with the deaf, is it not? We have tried to explain&#151;it has not been contradicted&#151;what goes on in disputes of this kind. It begins with action by the employer. The worker then reacts by taking out a grievance. He goes to see the employer and, from that moment on, they can, if they wish, negotiate. They can, if they wish, make a settlement. If there is no settlement, the worker may decide in desperation that he will make an application to a tribunal. This is the type of case to which I am referring; there may be others when a worker decides to go straight to a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para0"></a>The Government now insist that it cannot be as simple as that. The moment that a worker decides that he wants to apply to a tribunal, he must go through a new statutory procedure. The operation, or completion, of this procedure is not decided by the <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>worker; it depends on the employer replying. If, at that moment, the employer wants further negotiation to take place, there is nothing to stop that happening.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para1"></a>But then the employer may say, "All right, I'll send you back the form. We'll start a hearing and we'll let you complete the procedure". At that point, perhaps six or seven weeks will have passed. We do not know as no research has taken place. Then the Government say that a period of 28 days will be allowed.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para2"></a>In Grand Committee we moved an amendment relating to that point. In that amendment we sought to ask why ACAS should not be allowed to be brought in during the 28-day period. We asked why there should be absolutely no guarantee that anything was going on. The employer could very well say&#151;if I wanted to be nasty about it, I should say that the Government know this all too well&#151;"Ah, now we have a 28-day dead period. During that period, the chances are that he will give up. He might get another job. He might go away. But let's stick him in a bin for 28 days".
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para3"></a>As my noble friend said a moment ago, if the Government were genuine and wanted something to happen, they would make it happen. In Grand Committee the Government told us that, if it wished, ACAS could enter the procedure during the 28-day period because it has general provisions. We asked the Government how ACAS would know what was going on, but there was no reply. The only thing which, in the real world, can activate ACAS is the receipt of the necessary forms.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para4"></a>If the Government wished, they could legislate so that certain sanctions were placed on the employer during the 28-day period. However, they do not want to do that and we can come to only one conclusion. They believe that people will not be active during the 28-day period. Why should they be active? It is one more cue that the worker must observe. However, the Government will do nothing about the matter this evening. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

However, if the employer fails or prevaricates in relation to the procedures, nothing will happen. We are saying that some sanction should be imposed on the employer. If the employer has informed the employee within seven days of receipt of the written statement of the investigations, that is all right. But the employer must do something and, if he does nothing, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the worker will be free to go forward to a tribunal. This is another very small amendment which improves the situation a little. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I want to make one point before my noble and learned friend replies. I hope that nothing will be said here about investigations being uncertain. The employer must only say what investigations he has made, and therefore there is no question of uncertainty here. That point was raised previously.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para8"></a>The amendment concerns a simple matter of fairness. The employee must commence the procedure and then wait for 28 days. We say that if the Government insist that he waits for 28 days, at least he should be entitled to know what is going on. Therefore, in the first week, his disability or inadmissibility to present a case to the tribunal will not apply if the employer does not tell him what steps he is taking to investigate the matter. What is wrong with that? As my noble friend suggested, some obligation should be placed on the employer. This is a minimum obligation and it is surely just.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, this amendment takes us back to our earlier debate about investigations. I do not want to repeat the same arguments here that we dealt with in relation to that. Suffice it to say that we feel that our amendments to Schedule 2 deal effectively with that issue while avoiding the use of the term "investigation". I believe that that is at the heart of what my noble friend is submitting here.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para9"></a>As a separate issue, I believe that the amendment seeks to impose obligations on the employer as part of the admissibility regime. Both my noble friends are nodding in that respect. As I argued earlier, it is not our intention to use this section of Part 3 to impose obligations of this kind. Therefore, we oppose it on that ground.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para10"></a>However, the way in which the amendment is drafted puts up another barrier to an employee bringing a claim. If my reading is correct, the criterion imposes a limitation on an employee bringing a claim and that limitation is wholly dependent on the actions of the employer; namely, the employee could not access the tribunal unless the employer, within seven days of receipt of the Step 1 letter, had informed the employee of the results of an investigation into the issue. On the face of it, it would seem that an employee could never access the tribunal if the employer did nothing during that period. I cannot believe that that is the desired result. Therefore, even within its own terms, the amendment appears to be defective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend will remember that we experienced a problem in relation to one of our amendments in Grand Committee when he interpreted it as meaning the exact opposite of what it did mean. With the greatest respect to my noble and learned friend, he is now doing the same with this amendment. I may be wrong but I believe that that is the case.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para11"></a>In order to make the matter clear, perhaps I may read the subsection as it would read with our amendment:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal under a jurisdiction to which this section applies if&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-20_para12"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) it concerns a matter in relation to which the requirement in paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2 applies"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-20_para13"></a>
that is, the grievance procedure; and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the requirement has not been complied with",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-20_para14"></a>
and,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the employer has informed the employee within 7 days of receipt of the written statement of the investigations which he has made into the grievance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-20_para15"></a>
If the employer has informed the employee of his investigations, then the proposed new paragraph will apply. If the employer has failed to say what investigations he has made, the employee can go to a tribunal. That is what the amendment means and not what my noble and learned friend suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I obviously treat with great respect what my noble friend said. However, with regard to the wording, it is utterly clear that the consequence of not carrying out the action set out in proposed new paragraph (c) is, as my noble friend read out:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-20_para16"></a>
Therefore, the consequence of the amendment is that the employer must do something before the employee can present a complaint. I believe that the wording is fairly clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the Minister now understands what we intend to do. We could argue all night about whether the amendment contains the right words. But he is right; we do not want to do the reverse. We want to do that terrible thing, as he told us at one point: we want to benefit the worker by putting a little restriction on the employer. That is what we want to do. That is often what we want to do. If we have used the wrong words, there is a long tradition in this House in which the Government says, "We see what you want to do but it is not properly drafted. Take it away. We shall write a proper amendment and you will hear from us in due course". The Minister could say that, if that is what he wanted to say, but we are benefiting the worker, and he does not want to say that.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para17"></a>I shall ask the Minister again. Let us assume that the Minister or a member of his staff had drafted the amendment. Can he tell the House whether he is likely to accept a small amendment which puts some kind of pressure on the employer? That is what we want to do. We feel that this matter is so one-sided that the employer can sabotage the procedure by refusing to act. If he refuses to act, there should be some way in which the worker can say, "As I have not heard from you; as you were not present; as you had gone away, I take it that I can now go to the tribunal". That seems to us to be perfectly fair.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the points that I took. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn made such a tempting series of remarks about the meaning of the amendment that I responded vigorously. The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, is right. I should address the substance, which I did in my submissions.
<P>

<a name="20611-20_para18"></a>First, we feel that we have dealt with the investigations provision by way of amendment to Schedule 2.

I hope that she can give us a clear and straightforward answer.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para3"></a>The NHS Plan promised investments and reform to deliver a better health service. I am delighted to see that the Government have responded with the investment announced so dramatically in the Budget. I am also pleased about the structural reform. I welcome PCTs, which will focus on local issues. They are the right organisations to create a better health service for improvement. Those are necessary but insufficient conditions to achieve the Government's commitments and targets. The third element must be to direct resources to those parts of the NHS which so far have been neglected. My contention tonight will be that despite attempts by the Government to redistribute resources, such resources are still not being sufficiently targeted towards areas of greatest need.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para4"></a>The geography of health needs, both in terms of care and funding, is a real issue for this country. I hope that we can discuss that tonight. In illustrating points I <P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want to make, I make no apology for the fact that, as noble Lords might expect, examples will be from my own local area, Wigan. Perhaps I should remind noble Lords of my interest as leader of Wigan Council.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para5"></a>The conclusion I shall draw from some of the evidence in Wigan is valid for many other parts of the country which share similar social and economic backgrounds. The crux of the issue is perhaps to define health need. Although there may be some criteria which we think are objective, it is the way in which such factors are weighted which becomes the subjective part of the analysis.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para6"></a>Health data may be the obvious starting point when considering health need. In terms of raw data, Wigan has a standard mortality rate of 118, which is well above average. For potentially avoidable deaths it is 122; for the specific areas in which the Government are targeting reduction, lung cancer and coronary heart disease, the rates rise to 124 and 131 respectively. Life expectancy in Wigan stands at 73.6 for men, which is 1.6 years less than the average for England, and for women, 77.3 years, which is 1.8 years less than the average for England. That demonstrates real evidence of need.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para7"></a>We are all aware that health need may also rise with age. Obviously, elderly people need greater provision and have a greater dependency on health services. However, we need to be cautious in dealing with age as a factor in health. Many places, certainly my own area, would be an example of where life expectancy levels are lower than average, and levels of ill health and dependency rise earlier. In my area, many people who are under the age at which additional funding becomes available are having the same needs met as those for people over the age of 75, 80 and so forth. We need to remind ourselves that resources may be required for people of a younger age.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para8"></a>A further point arises in terms of social factors. The Acheson report recognised that it is necessary to address the social determinants that result in inequalities in the health of the population. With a current rate of 90 per cent of our wards in the worst 20 per cent in the country as regards social deprivation, there is high social need in my area. Poverty is not just a factor in terms of determining prevalence towards ill health. We need to remind ourselves that poverty means that people may well be unable to afford alternative private treatments, which may be available to people who are better off.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para9"></a>A further area, which is probably the least subjective, is that of historical factors. Perhaps I may demonstrate that. One factor would be the pattern of current provision, which is determined by past and current activities. In my area again, 70 per cent of general practice is carried out in single or double-handed practices. That is a high proportion. Many such practices are still housed in inadequate premises. Many are in terraced properties which have been in the doctors' hands for many years. The ability of those individuals to provide up-to-date treatment in the 21st century is some way off.

I think my noble friend would agree that in areas with mining or textile backgrounds, industrial diseases, caused by the hard labour in those particular industries, are still prevalent. One subjective factor is what I would call chronic disadvantage, where in terms of health the cumulative impact of a number of factors in an area creates a particular population need. A recent survey, conducted by the health authority in my area, and which had a high response, asked people about their level of health. The results were depressing: people feel they are unhealthy.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para11"></a>With my background I have always thought that local government finances were impenetrable, but health finances are even more mysterious. I still would not claim to understand much. It is difficult to compare the outcomes of the funding methods. The easiest way that I have found is to look at the weighted allocations per head of population to health authorities. Those, I remind your Lordships, were meant to take account of some of those health needs so that we ended up in a perfect world, with an equal amount to spend per head of population.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para12"></a>In the allocation for 2002-03, the average amount for England stands at £817 per head, but in my area, Wigan and Bolton, the health allocation is only £799 per head. That shortfall multiplied by the population means that the local health economy is short of at least £10 million, which is quite a significant amount. That gets translated down into other matters&#151;in my area the number of GPs per 100,000 of population is 42. Even Greater Manchester, which probably has fewer GPs than average, has more. If we had the same as the rest of Greater Manchester we would actually get 20 more GPs. If we had the same as the average for England we would get 50 more GPs.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para13"></a>This is an area where the figures show that there is a great deal of health need. One can imagine the extra workload on each of those doctors. They have a large patient list and a great deal of activity with which to deal. The quality of service must obviously emphasise cure rather than prevention. We also find that because people get frustrated waiting to see GPs there is a greater use of accident and emergency departments at local infirmaries because they can get treated relatively quickly.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para14"></a>The problems in my area, and I think nationally, are compounded by the rise in the prescribing budget. In the Wigan and Bolton Health Authority it has risen by 39 per cent over four years. It reflects the workload of the GPs and the health needs of the area. If it rose by the same rate this year as last year, it would cost the local primary care trust £8 million&#151;a huge amount of money.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para15"></a>I agree that money is not the only solution in health. When speaking on health matters in your Lordships' House I have consistently spoken of the need for partnerships. My authority has a good track record on that issue. We are one of the best authorities in terms <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of delayed discharges and we have the greatest use of the flexibilities under the Health Act in the North West of England.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para16"></a>The problem is that underfunding of health is compounded by underfunding in social services. These days, in relation to social services, the extreme pressure is on children's services. Those allied to the health authority are likely, if funding is difficult, to be most under threat.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para17"></a>My message to the Government in winding-up is twofold. First, while the Government have made some effort at redirection, it is not enough. They need to be much bolder. It is always easier to be bolder if there is more money in the pot. So if we have growth in health we can use it to redistribute. Secondly, I hope that the Government will change some of their methods in terms of penalising authorities which perform well and simply feeling that the money must go into those areas which do not perform well.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, on securing this debate focusing on health funding for areas of greatest health needs in England.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para18"></a>That focus is necessary because the implementation of the NHS Plan 2000 has so far not made significant impact in regions of great health needs defined by high death rates and increased morbidity of coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and mental illness in the local population. One reason put forward to explain this is the so-called inverse care law where people from lower socio-economic groups, including some ethnic minority communities, have less access to care facilities; they present at a later stage of disease development; and are less demanding of doctors.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para19"></a>Sir Donald Acheson's report, quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health, published by the Department of Health in 1998 identified possible steps to improve the health of the less well off. Three areas regarded by the report as crucial were the following. First, all policies likely to have an impact on health should be evaluated in terms of their impact on health inequalities; secondly, a high priority should be given to the health of families with children; and, thirdly, further steps should be taken to reduce income inequalities and improve the living standards of poor households.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para20"></a>Clearly, areas of greatest health needs should be identified by the broader definitions of the Acheson report rather than by the clinical yardstick currently used by the Department of Health on coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and mental illness.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para21"></a>I am not dismissing the impact of those major diseases on the lives of people. But to use them as the main indicators of health needs would ignore health inequalities associated with poverty in rural communities as well as the effect of poverty on children. Those diseases do not commonly affect children and young families. Unhealthy lifestyles of poverty, including heavy cigarette smoking, increased <P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fatty food intake and inadequate fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet will lead to those diseases in later life.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para22"></a>The way forward is to concentrate on local communities and local issues. Here I declare my interest as chairman of a local community association, the Wirral Multicultural Organisation based in Birkenhead. I am also a non-executive director and vice-chairman of the Birkenhead and Wallasey Primary Care Trust.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para23"></a>I begin with local statistics on death and disease used as indicators of health needs. They should be collected and analysed according to districts and local wards. Interventions can then be more effectively targeted to vulnerable people in local wards. Public health services delivered through primary care trusts would be more effectively targeted to people in local wards, with better chances of their benefits being identified, than to larger populations. Improvement in delivery of services is more likely to be achieved locally for specific groups of people than for the general population. Health funding for those wards is also more likely to be available for specific interventions.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para24"></a>The Government have shifted the balance of power and resources from the centre to local primary care trusts in order to improve their delivery of services according to the needs of local people. That change is an improvement in the way the NHS is funded and is welcomed by local people. But for the current financial year 2002-03, most primary care trusts in England have been asked to accept and to work with less funding than they need according to budgets worked out last year. That resource problem exists paradoxically when several sources of regeneration and community development funds from central government are becoming available in areas of deprivation particularly in metropolitan districts.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para25"></a>A plethora of funds exist for specific target groups such as Surestart for pre-school children, Pathways for deprived inner-city locations and, of course, the Community Fund. Those resources are targeted at community groups in the voluntary sector. But community groups need the help of public agencies as equal partners in order for these grants to make a difference in their lives and the lives of their children. Partnership working between voluntary community groups and public agencies such as the primary care trust and local authorities is still in need of development and support.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para26"></a>The NHS Plan has emphasised the need for patients to be represented in decision-making on delivery of care and monitoring of services. But community groups are equally important participants in order to improve standards. In that regard, the Government are to be congratulated on introducing the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 to cover all public bodies including the NHS. One result of that Act is the introduction of racial equality schemes for all NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para27"></a>Redistribution of health funding for areas of greatest health need is an issue to be considered at the local level of primary care trusts. To make a difference <P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>funding must be targeted at vulnerable people in local wards where a baseline of economic, health and social welfare indicators has been collected and analysed. The problem is that no additional resources are available for this year. Other sources of community funding should be allocated especially for the benefit of children and young families in deprived communities.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para28"></a>Partnership working is needed between local community groups, the voluntary sector, NHS trusts, local authorities and the private sector. Such partnership would encourage community development and the participation of local people in health promoting activities. Participation of local people with different needs and from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds should be encouraged and developed so that no minority group is marginalised. Finally, achievable health improvement targets must be set and monitored annually. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to those proposals.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Smith of Leigh for giving us the opportunity to debate health funding once again. I am especially pleased to be speaking in the first debate to which my noble friend Lady Andrews will reply.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para29"></a>As poor health is largely associated with poverty, we can chart where the pockets of poor health are likely to be by indices of deprivation, as my noble friend reminds us. Where we have poverty, poor housing, lack of employment and fewer people taking up educational opportunities, health needs are greatest.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para30"></a>Those areas are also associated with deaths from diseases resulting from poor diet, lack of exercise, lack of knowledge about what contributes to good health and so on. Of course, those include diseases that are high on the Government's targeted priority list: cancers, coronary heart disease and strokes. The Government are to be congratulated on making those targets of special attention, which will undoubtedly have the effect of redistributing some resources.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para31"></a>Nor should we forget that poverty is also associated with those diseases that are not killers but none the less have a devastating effect on families and communities, such as depression and other forms of mental illness. The establishment of health action zones by the Government shortly after they came to power was and is a major step forward in addressing inequalities in health.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para32"></a>However, we need most of all to spend more resources on prevention and public health. The modernisation agenda that the Government have set for the NHS, together with the vastly increased amount of funding now available, will have an effect on that in two ways. First, it will focus the main delivery of healthcare at the place where it really matters&#151;the primary care level, as the noble Lord, Lord Chan, reminded us; as near to the patient and his or her family as possible. Secondly, it will make public <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>health a more important focus for the NHS than it has thus far been. Of course, that will take time, but I travel hopefully.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para33"></a>But the most important change that we can bring about in that area is to educate patients and potential patients about how best to care for their own health. The importance of the patient's role in his or her care has hitherto never been fully recognised and I want to celebrate the Government's commitment to encouraging real patient and public involvement in health through their latest health reforms.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para34"></a>In that regard, I want to draw attention to an important programme run by the New Opportunities Fund, the lottery distributor of which I have been chair since 1998: our healthy living centres programme. Healthy living centres promote good health in the widest possible context. They target groups and areas that represent the most disadvantaged sections of the population. By the time the programme ends, we should have targeted the most disadvantaged 20 per cent of the population throughout the United Kingdom. Healthy living centres will reduce differences in the quality of health between individuals and improve the health of the worst-off in society.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para35"></a>There is no standard blueprint for the healthy living centres that we are funding. Priority areas were identified using deprivation indices relating to unemployment, low income health status and educational participation and attainment. We also ensured that rural areas and pockets of deprivation within affluent areas were identified.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para36"></a>The centres are developing innovative ways to provide solutions to the many challenges that we face when addressing healthcare needs. An important aspect of the programme is that it has been targeted at active local partnerships, including businesses, health authorities, local authorities and other lottery distributors. The voluntary sector, which has the advantage of being closely in touch with the needs of communities, has in many cases taken the lead in putting together those partnerships. The application process is now almost complete and by the time the programme is fully up and running, we anticipate that there will be about 400 healthy living centres throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para37"></a>To give your Lordships some specific examples, in Tooting, almost £1 million has been allocated to target health inequalities with a particular focus on the health of ethnic minorities. The incidence of health problems such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, stroke and mental illness is higher among those groups, as your Lordships will know. In East Yorkshire, £1 million has gone to a project that targets young people and rurally isolated and excluded people. The award will fund a driver for a bus to bring people to the healthy living centre, a community cafe, a youth project to combat homelessness, a rural advice worker, a credit union, the youth empowerment project and a learning activity project. The richness of the ideas and the variety of approaches taken are amazing, especially with regard to the local partnerships that had been established, <P>


<a name="column_213"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such as the one in Sheffield that will include the local library services in its provision with the full co-operation of the local authority.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para38"></a>Lest your Lordships imagine that I am using my time as a commercial for the New Opportunities Fund&#151;well, I am, but I hope that I am doing more than that. Lottery funding is by its nature time-limited, although in the case of healthy living centres, it can continue for five years. All of the programmes are most stringently evaluated and I am certain that some of the programmes that I have mentioned and others on which I have not had time to touch will provide exemplars for the Government&#151;and, indeed for future governments&#151;to show that the more resources that we devote to encouraging people to care for their own health, the better will be the health of our whole population.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para39"></a>Deprivation in health is largely the result of social and economic deprivation, as is well documented. Those are the issues that we must address&#151;promoting good health as well as treating sickness&#151;if real progress is to be made in improving the health of our nation.

<A NAME="20611-21_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, for allowing us this opportunity to debate health funding priorities. I am also delighted to be taking part in the first debate to which the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, will respond.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para40"></a>I will concentrate on child and adolescent mental health services, especially as they apply to looked-after children. I welcome the introduction of the child mental health service framework and the additional funds that it has brought with it. There is a great shortage of mental health professionals. I have been told by Mind, and we heard yesterday, that 66 per cent of foster children and 98 per cent of children in care have mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para41"></a>I am especially concerned about the problems faced by looked-after children, children in public care, when they are placed out of their local authority, out of county. Those children have complex needs, whatever placement they are given, whether fostering, residential care or an alternative to secure accommodation. My concern is, first, that they are not overlooked or neglected, as I hear that they occasionally are and, secondly, that they do not incur such expense on the child and adolescent mental health service of the locality that other children in need are overlooked as a consequence. I should appreciate some reassurance from the Minister about what steps are being taken to avoid that.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para42"></a>There is a great shortage of mental health professionals. To cite one example of what the mental health professions can achieve, several sources have told me that since the Government, under Quality Protects, have been supporting fostering, there has been a significant reduction in breakdowns of foster placements. We need more mental health professionals. I am advised that one important means <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of recruiting them is ensuring that medical students are well exposed to work with children and adolescents with mental health problems during their training and that that work is well mediated. As a consequence of that experience, more medical students are likely to choose to enter the field of psychiatry. However, those who choose not to do so will also have benefited from that experience, so that later in their career they can make more informed referrals for children and young people. Therefore, I would appreciate the Minister giving information on what steps are being taken to achieve that goal.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para43"></a>Perhaps I may return to the child national service framework. Does the Minister anticipate that the children's mental health and emotional well-being module will ensure that children and adolescents will be able to access appropriate developmentally trained, multi-disciplinary teams which will provide a timely, locally based and highly responsive service for acute psychiatric problems when they arise? Can the Minister assure the House that additional resources will be made available to enable those teams to carry out their work if they are likely to need greater resources than are currently available locally?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para44"></a>Those are detailed questions and if the Minister wants to write to me about them, I should be very grateful for her response.

<A NAME="20611-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for missing the opening speech of my noble friend and a number of other speakers too, owing to a solid traffic jam at King's Cross which kept me waiting for 25 minutes. I moved approximately 300 yards during that time. Anticipating my Whip, I shall say I should not have been out of the House, and that has shown me.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para45"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, deserves congratulations on raising a fundamental issue. As a former NHS GP with a special interest in public health, I recognise that reduction of health inequalities is the top priority in improving the nation's health. In fact, that was the topic for my maiden speech nearly 20 years ago in which&#151;disobeying the non-controversial rule&#151;I asked the government when and whether they were going to implement the recommendations of the Black report. Needless to say I got a fairly dusty answer which downgraded the importance of the report and said that its recommendations would be far too expensive.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para46"></a>We had to wait 15 years before that government even recognised that inequalities existed&#151;even then using the term "health variations". However, since 1977 the Government have been clear in their understanding of the link between health and socio-economic factors. The noble Lord in his Question speaks about the equitable distribution of health funding, but I am sure that he would be the first to recognise that the main determinants of health&#151;perhaps he said it in his speech, I apologise&#151;lie outside the health service, with genetic factors and the environment each playing a role.
<P>


<a name="column_215"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para47"></a>Genetically determined ill health is mainly "neutral" from a socio-economic point of view, but not so ill health which is due to environmental factors. From before conception to old age the dice are loaded against the poor, the less educated and the less skilled. The work of Professor David Barker and colleagues in Southampton has shown that poor maternal nutrition can lead to a greater likelihood of babies growing into adults who are more susceptible to diabetes or heart disease.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para48"></a>There a range of factors operating from childhood into adult life which can lead to worse health later; namely, faulty nutrition, poor housing, poor working conditions and stress. That is not the prerogative of the busy executive; it is actually much worse among less privileged people where money is short, housing overcrowded and work characterised by lack of control&#151;by having to conform to someone else's timetable and pace. The well-known study by Professor Michael Marmot in Whitehall has drawn attention to that. Perhaps it is not surprising that addiction to tobacco and drugs, which calm uncomfortable emotions, is higher among the less well off.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para49"></a>Dealing with all those factors will involve a long-term haul. I believe that some of us feel that the Chancellor could move a little faster in that. In the meantime, the National Health Service has to pick up the pieces. The Acheson independent inquiry of December 1998 into inequalities in health made it clear that not only premature death but chronic ill health preceding death were more common among the less privileged. That leads to additional work for the providers of both primary and secondary healthcare, particularly if the less privileged are to be cared for as well as they should be. Unfortunately, instead of having extra health facilities with more GPs, nurses and other care workers in the community and higher bed ratios in hospitals, too often the reverse is the case. Provision has improved since 1971 when Dr Julian Tudor Hart described the inverse care law, but Professor Acheson still found it necessary to recommend that:

<a name="20611-21_para50"></a>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para51"></a>
He further recommended:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"extending the remit of NICE to include equity of access to effective health care",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para52"></a>
and,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para53"></a>
I would like to ask my noble friend, in congratulating her on her elevation to the Front Bench, how far those recommendations have been implemented or what plans there are to implement them.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para54"></a>One of the problems with providing equitable care according to need is that those who need it do not always take it up and demand is strongest from those <P>


<a name="column_216"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who are articulate but generally in less need. I suggest that when funds are more available, as they are now, it is a good time to do both&#151;to expand services for those in real need, as well as going some way to meet the more politically demanding changes; namely, waiting lists, for instance. I would put that quite a lot lower down in the priority list than seeing to the needs of the underprivileged.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para55"></a>The two main mechanisms which the Department of Health uses to channel funds to less privileged populations are, first, the weighted capitation formula for allocating funds to health authorities, which is called ACRA&#151;the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation; and, secondly, deprivation payments to general practitioners. Could my noble friend give details on the various changes that have taken place or are proposed to the ACRA formula? Those are not only to take account of the shift to PCT funding of general medical services and GP deprivation payments, but could involve the formula itself, which may need to be adjusted so as more sensitively to allow for the increased overall care needs (rather than demands) of relatively deprived populations in the catchment areas of PCTs. Implementing the Acheson recommendations that I mentioned may require that.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para56"></a>I have two final points. Will my noble friend give any details of the formula which I gather is now being worked on in York to replace and improve the current system of determining deprivation payments to GPs which, though an excellent concept, has been subject to much criticism?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para57"></a>Finally, will my noble friend briefly describe the role of PMS pilot projects in bringing healthcare to hard to reach but needy sections of the population, and any other roles for PMS schemes in the provision of healthcare to those in greatest need that are now being considered? I recognise that my noble friend may have to write to me on some of those points because they are rather detailed.

<A NAME="20611-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Smith, on initiating this bite-sized debate&#151;alas too short&#151;and also welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, to the Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para58"></a>As a number of noble Lords have mentioned, the Acheson report remains at the core of the public health debate. It performed a valuable role in reminding us of the reasons for health inequalities and of what action should be taken. The public health White Paper published the following spring in 1999 said that the story of health inequality was clear&#151;the poorer a person is, the more likely he or she is to be ill and die younger. That is still starkly true.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para59"></a>Subsequently, the NHS Plan published targets on infant mortality and life expectancy and the child poverty target was adopted by the Government. Now we have the Government's consultation on a plan for delivery, Tackling Health Inequalities, published last year on the action needed to achieve the targets. It sets six priority areas related to childhood health; <P>


<a name="column_217"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity for children and young people; improving NHS primary care services; tackling coronary heart disease and cancer; strengthening communities; and tackling the wider determinants of health inequalities such as poverty and material disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para60"></a>That paper inevitably raises a great range of issues. There are problems with some of them, not least our doubts about the new structures, or lack of them, for public health services and whether the necessary resource will be available. In terms of major diseases, should we not be looking at diabetes too? We are all well aware of the knock-on effects of childhood obesity, too, and we have debated it often in this House.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para61"></a>In terms of rebuilding communities, how are we spreading best practice in the health field from health action zones and health improvement plans? Looking at the structures for partnership between local authorities, we have argued about the problems of shifting the balance of power proposals which were, and regrettably are, enshrined in the NHS reform Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para62"></a>We on these Benches would much prefer to have the health strategy created on an integrated region-by-region basis at the strategic level. That was recognised in recent government proposals for everything else but health. We welcome the creation of a health inequalities and public taskforce. But what does that consist of? Who sits on the body and what is its work programme?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para63"></a>A cost-cutting spending review on health inequalities is also mentioned in the paper and was recently reported on as indicating that the NHS could be saved £850 million if health gaps were reduced. But what is the status of that review? Has it yet been officially published? Moreover, how will PCTs and strategic health authorities fit with local strategic partnerships and align with local authority planning processes? In all of this, we have the overarching need for proper public participation in health policy and public health and the need to promote preventive health measures.

<a name="20611-21_para64"></a>Finally, we have the issue of indicators which arise from the paper. We also have the third annual report of the Social Exclusion Unit. One has only to weigh it to understand the seriousness of the intent, but how concrete are the indicators set out in it? I say that it describes the actions taken but it does not describe the outcomes in anything like sufficient detail.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para65"></a>Peter Mandelson recently said that we are all Thatcherites now. Your Lordships can take it for granted that I thoroughly disagree with him&#151;and I see nods from the other Benches. He does not even appear to understand the motives of his former colleagues in government, such as Frank Dobson, immediately on coming into office. The legacy of the Thatcher years may have been a more enterprising economy but a great many people were left by the wayside during the Conservatives' 18 years in power, particularly in terms of differences in life expectancy and in infant mortality.

<a name="20611-21_para66"></a>Some progress appears to be being made by this Government. It appears that differences in life expectancy between the top and bottom social classes has across the UK been reduced for both men and women. But a huge amount remains to be done, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, rightly claimed. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, published in December 2001, emphasises the scale of the continuing problems. Some health indicators have improved but the proportion of babies of low birth weight has not changed over the past five years and the rates of teenage conception remain much higher than elsewhere in western Europe. And, as we are all well aware, mental health is worse.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para67"></a>In September last year, the London Health Observatory pointed out that in London health inequalities in life expectancy and infant mortality are widening not narrowing. In fact, London's infant mortality rate compares badly with nearly all other EU capital cities.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para68"></a>It is quite clear that whatever the national spin on the initiatives being taken and the action plans being published, resources are not reaching the deprived areas. Last November, the very well respected chairman of the former east London and City Health Authority wrote to MPs, GLA members and others stating:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As you know last year we received no additional funding for health inequalities, despite the glaring needs locally".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para69"></a>
If they are not receiving the money, who is? If the resource allocation formula does not benefit deprived areas such as East London, then who will it benefit? Perhaps the noble Baroness will say whether the formula has changed for 2002-03 in order to benefit these deprived areas to a greater extent.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para70"></a>We recognise the good intentions of the Government but above all they need to be straight about the indicators, straight about what is happening on the ground, and redouble their efforts. In the words of the noble Lord, Lord Smith, they need to be bolder. Above all, they need to ensure that adequate resources are directed to areas of greatest need.

<A NAME="20611-21_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, I start by welcoming on behalf of these Benches the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, to the Dispatch Box for her first contribution in a health debate. We look forward to her response and hope that it will be the first of many. I think she will find that the natives are friendly on health matters!
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para71"></a>Secondly, I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, for initiating this important debate. There has been insufficient public debate about the mechanics and principles of resource distribution, which is why I in particular welcome this debate.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para72"></a>The distribution of NHS funding is one of the most arcane areas within the NHS&#151;and I say that bearing scars as a former director of finance for the NHS. I shall not go over the long history of funding mechanisms in the NHS. Suffice it to say that by 1976 the principle of equal opportunity of access for equal <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need became established in financial terms with weighted capitation formulae which embedded health need into resource allocation; and while the formulae have been improved over the years, that basic approach has stood the test of time for the past 25 years.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para73"></a>Those weighted capitation formulae are used to arrive at target allocations which show how much each health body, now PCTs, should get to allow it to meet the health needs of its population. But we have never actually achieved parity; that is, health bodies getting their fair shares&#151;and no more, no less.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para74"></a>Those distances from target are fundamentally unfair. Quite simply, some PCTs do not receive their fair share of the available funding to meet the health needs of their population. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, recently said that the current figures in relation to PCTs,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reveal a range from minus 14 per cent to plus 14 per cent".&#151;[Official Report, 18/3/02; col. 1210.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para75"></a>
That may not sound very much, but it means that the most advantaged PCT is 33 per cent better off than the least advantaged.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para76"></a>Every year there is a calculation called "pace of change", which is the amount that health bodies receive towards their target allocation. It is a highly subjective amount and it is never debated; and yet that is what determines how close allocations actually come to funding on the basis of health need.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para77"></a>About 17 per cent of PCTs are at least 5 per cent from their target&#151;and in health authority budgeting terms, 5 per cent is a lot of money. I should like to issue a call to arms for all PCTs to get both pace of change and fairness in funding out into the open.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para78"></a>The Secretary of State said that when next year's allocations are announced this autumn, they will be accompanied by a further two years of allocations to give three years of funding indication. Will the Minister say what approach the Government intend to take to pace of change within the three-year period? Will the distances from target be eliminated by the end of the period? If parity is not to be achieved with the extra resources being put in, will she say why not?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para79"></a>The allocation process has now started to move away from equal opportunity of access to healthcare on the basis of relative need. It has started to incorporate health inequalities more explicitly. In 1999, Mr John Denham, the then Minister of State for Health, told the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation to produce a new approach which should,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"support the Government's wider social agenda and in particular our policies on social exclusion, fairness and reducing health inequalities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para80"></a>
The objective of the new formula is to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"contribute to the reduction in avoidable health inequalities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-21_para81"></a><P>

<a name="20611-21_para82"></a>It is far from clear that producing a new allocation formula that has health money following health inequality will reduce health inequality. I see no such evidence or argumentation from the Government. The Government's belief in the power of money to solve the problems of the NHS is not one that we share. <P>


<a name="column_220"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>When will the report of the advisory committee be available? We look forward to debating how health inequality money will be calculated and whether it can be used to achieve better outcomes.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para83"></a>How will health action zones&#151;themselves targeted at health inequality&#151;fit into the new scheme? Will responsibility for reducing health inequality be with PCTs or health action zones? Who is to say whether health funding has reduced inequalities rather than other essential policy areas, such as housing and employment?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para84"></a>In the last two allocation rounds, some money was devoted specifically to remedying health inequality in certain authorities, including Wigan, thanks to a new bit of magic in the formulae&#151;the loss-of-life years adjustment. Do PCTs know what to do with the extra funding? Can the Minister be sure that when £70 million was handed out last year, it did not disappear into the black hole of NHS funding used to fend off deficits and reduce waiting lists? If it is too difficult to answer that question in respect of last year, perhaps the Minister will say what health inequality outcomes PCTs are expected to work towards with this year's allocation?
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para85"></a>We have expressed considerable reservations about the capacity of PCTs with regard to many of their functions&#151;including public health and the delivery of health improvement plans. Is the Minister sure that PCTs, even when funded, can and will contribute to the Government's health inequality agenda?

<A NAME="20611-21_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for your Lordships' warm welcome&#151;particularly in view of the expertise that is gathered around me. I am glad to know that the natives are friendly and particularly pleased that my first appearance at the Dispatch Box is to respond to a debate on such an important topic and one close to my heart. My noble friend Lord Smith of Leigh, in his excellent overview, described the geography of health in a way that is totally familiar to me, coming from Wales, and to many others in the Chamber.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para86"></a>I am grateful for all the contributions this evening. The biggest health improvement that our country can make is to be serious about tackling health inequality. I take the point made by the Rowntree Trust report to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para87"></a>There has been a consensus over many years that different parts of the country have different health needs, which have been reflected in the formula that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, described. The very young and the elderly are not evenly distributed. The age factor accounts for much of the weighting that makes a difference&#151;although I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Smith that it is not necessarily age that determines illness or immobility. The formula includes some reference to sickness levels, as well as to contextual factors such as unemployment, pensioners living alone and lone parents.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para88"></a>We recognised that the existing formula was not sufficient. It was criticised for failing to get health services to the greatest areas of need, so the <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government undertook a wide-ranging review of the allocation formula. By 2003, following a review of the existing weighted capitation formula used to distribute NHS funding, reducing avoidable inequalities will be a key criterion. I am glad that so many of your Lordships have welcomed the NHS Plan. I emphasise that it is not separate from inequality policy but is central to it.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para89"></a>Good progress is being made. A new formula will be ready for the next round of allocations which will be announced in the autumn. ACRA will report to the Secretary of State in September. The allocations will cover the three years from 2003-04. I have no information about second and third round funding levels. Perhaps we can keep in touch about that. Most significantly, subject to Parliament, allocations will be made direct to the new locally based primary care trusts instead of through health authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, mentioned the important new role of PCTs in delivering on highly local health needs. We are optimistic that that will work. The balance of power will be devolved to reflect local needs and funds will be managed locally, which will significantly assist the resource allocation process in achieving a fairer and more responsive outcome. That must be put against an increase in health authority allocations, which are £2.7 billion higher than last year.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para90"></a>My noble friend Lord Smith described the serious health needs of Wigan and Bolton and gave some striking statistics. The Government have been able to ensure that in the current financial year, Wigan and Bolton health authority will receive an increase of £45 million over last year&#151;a real terms increase of 7.48 per cent. That is the largest in the North West and means that Wigan and Bolton are near the top of the list in terms of extra cash this year. I hope that that improvement, together with the anticipated change of formula, will make a difference to the North West and to Wigan and Bolton in particular.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para91"></a>Under the pace of change policy to which the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred, local decisions are responsive and reflect NHS guidance. We remain committed to bringing health authorities and PCTs to their target fair shares as soon as practicable. However, we must be fair and consistent across the country. Those are difficult decisions. The Secretary of State takes a long time to consider them. It is a question of maintaining continuity and balance in targeting resources. I reiterate that our objective is securing faster health improvement among the poorest people in society. It is important to ensure that health cash goes to those in greatest need.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para92"></a>Apart from the review, we are making good progress. In the 2001-02 allocation, we introduced a health inequality adjustment based on the concept of years of life lost&#151;which itself reflects the greatest disparities in mortality rates and generates a ranking system. We have added an extension to infant mortality. It is not perfect but is a first step. The health inequalities adjustment targets resources at the most deprived areas in the North, Midlands and South of England. An additional £18 million was put in this year, which brought the target to £148 million.

<P>

<a name="20611-21_para93"></a>Turning to primary care, the noble Lord, Lord Rea, whom I am pleased to see arrived despite a horrific journey, was kind enough to give us warning of some of his questions. Even so, I cannot answer them in sufficient detail, but I shall be happy to write to him. He referred to how to attract doctors into deprived areas and how to create incentives. A £55 million package is being invested to improve primary care premises in deprived parts of the country. We are also giving golden hellos to doctors to encourage them to work in under-doctored areas. We are making progress; for example, there is the personal medical services pilot scheme that has been positively evaluated and which is designed to provide additional, flexible support in areas where we need more direct services to vulnerable groups such as the homeless and ethnic minorities. At the moment there are 26 PMS pilots out of 1,300 in Wigan and Bolton.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para94"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, and the noble Lord, Lord Chan, spoke tellingly of the importance of devolving healthcare to ensure that it is the responsibility of the individual. The healthy living centres will certainly promote that. It is essential also that we work in partnership with the local and voluntary communities. The example of libraries has been mentioned and much can be done there.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para95"></a>Health inequalities are avoidable and they are fundamentally unfair. The Government are committed to tackling them. In February 2001 the Secretary of State for Health announced two new health inequalities targets. The first gives a commitment to narrow the gap between a fifth of the areas with the lowest life expectancy and the population as a whole and the second most important is to narrow the gap in infant mortality across the social groups.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para96"></a>Many noble Lords mentioned the relationship between medical needs and environmental factors. When one considers the range of policies that have been introduced&#151;everything from Sure Start to our poverty targets for children, to environmental policies, and to the neighbourhood renewal schemes&#151;we are approaching the problem fully focused with a coherent set of policies. The Social Exclusion Unit's report plays its part in that. That is why the Government undertook a major national consultation exercise, which has prompted 600 written responses alone and has been positive in elucidating from people what they believe is the most important matter. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, referred to the voice of the people. We expect to publish the interim document on that consultation shortly. It will inform the cost-cutting review, which is of additional significance because it enables us to look across the policies. We expect the outcome of the cost-cutting review this year.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para97"></a>It is extremely important to put everything into the context of the additional funding that has gone into the NHS. It will make such a difference to the problems to which noble Lords have referred. In 2001-02 we have already seen an addition of £5 billion in the NHS. Those increases are having a major impact on waiting times. I recommend the annual report of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the chief executive of the NHS for an encouraging list of improvements and historic, real increases over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="20611-21_para98"></a>We want to build capacity. We would not invest in PCTs unless we believed that there was the capacity. We want to ensure that the many descriptions of need that have been identified stand a better chance of solution than they have had in the past. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, for raising the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 73:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 37, line 45, leave out "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20611-22_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 73, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 74. My noble friends and I do not much like Clause 32, nor does the Law Society, as we have heard. In fact, it has said that the clause should be deleted and the purpose of their recommendation is to prevent the exclusion of claims where applicants have failed to take specified steps under the statutory procedure. My noble friends and I have not gone that far. I hope the Minister will agree that we have tried to be constructive. We have tried to make the clause more user-friendly.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para3"></a>Amendment No. 73 is a simple amendment. It seeks to delete "may" and substitute "shall", thus committing the Secretary of State to specify by regulation that subsection (4) should not apply in a particular matter. Subsection (4) seeks to prevent claimants raising cases with a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para4"></a>Amendment No. 74 is extremely important. Subsections (2), (3) and (4) specify situations in which an employee may not present a complaint to a tribunal. The three subsections all relate to the requirements in paragraphs 6 and 9 of Schedule 2. They state that the employee must set out the grievance in writing and send a copy to the employer. Paragraph 6 relates to the standard procedure and paragraph 9 to the modified procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para5"></a>As we have heard in relation to previous amendments, other conditions relate to time limits, a matter that has already been dealt with by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. Those conditions appear absolute. Subsection (5) appears to give the Secretary of State the ability to make regulations that may stipulate that those conditions shall not apply in relation to a particular matter, but the employment tribunal itself appears to have no powers.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para6"></a>My amendment gives the employment tribunal power not to apply subsections (2), (3) or (4) if that appears just and equitable to it. It appears to me that <P>


<a name="column_224"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that is sensible. The employment tribunal is the specialist body concerned. It has experience of dealing with past cases. There may well be situations in which it is fair and reasonable not to insist precisely on the requirements of Schedule 2. The workforce in the UK, as we have known, is becoming increasingly multi-ethnic. Of course, we want such workers to become fully integrated, but there may well be problems of language and culture. Such people need assistance but it may not always be readily forthcoming. Therefore, it seems sensible to give the employment tribunal power to override some legislative requirements such as those in Schedule 2 where it seems fair for it to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 73 deals with the regulation-making powers in subsection (5) of the clause. Those powers are designed to give some discretion to the tribunals when applying the third admissibility criterion, which is defined in subsection (4). The third criterion deals with the case where an initial application has been made within the normal period for making applications but has failed one or both of the first two admissibility criteria. As we have stated repeatedly, we want to give such individuals another chance to make an admissible application. Such individuals will need extra time to carry out the necessary steps. In some cases, this will carry them beyond the three-month period for making applications to tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para7"></a>We intend to allow for that by using the powers in Clause 33 to extend the time limit for making applications to tribunals. However, we wish to place some modest pressure on applicants to start using the relevant grievance procedure at an early point; otherwise, memories of the circumstances surrounding a case fade and the chances of sorting out a problem diminish. We therefore specify at subsection (4) that the employee should have taken the step 1 action no later than one month following the normal period for making applications to tribunals. In most cases, that will mean four months.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para8"></a>Generally speaking, that should not be difficult for employees to achieve. However, there may be some circumstances where it would be unjust or unfair to apply the third criterion rigidly. For example, the tribunal may take some time to decide that the initial application was inadmissible. Indeed, that decision may not be taken within the four-month period. The regulation-making power at subsection (5) provides the flexibility which tribunals need to deal with such cases. The regulations would define the types of situation where the tribunals should consider waiving the third criterion.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para9"></a>Amendment No. 73 would make it a duty on the Secretary of State to introduce such regulations. We have inserted various order-making and regulation-making powers throughout Part 3 of the Bill. None places a duty on the Secretary of State to introduce orders or regulations. I cannot see any reason to depart from that approach in this case. It is highly likely that regulations would be introduced. But there is no need to pre-empt the outcome of consultations with <P>


<a name="column_225"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interested parties by imposing a requirement that regulations must be introduced. I hope that goes some way to satisfy my noble friend Lady Turner.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para10"></a>Amendment No. 74 gives a wide power to the tribunals not to apply the admissibility criteria in individual cases if they consider it "just and equitable" to do so. Such powers might be appropriate if we did not allow for special cases within the admissibility regime. But the clause already contains a variety of regulation-making powers allowing the Secretary of State to specify how the criteria could be applied to different cases.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para11"></a>We will use those regulation-making powers to identify the circumstances where the criteria can in effect be waived or modified to meet special circumstances. In devising the regulations, we will of course be trying to deal with special cases in a just and equitable way. For example, we can use the powers to deal with the position of disabled people who cannot write. Of course, it will be a matter for the tribunals to decide how the regulations apply to individual cases.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para12"></a>I should remind noble Lords that our proposed use of regulation-making powers has been accepted as justifiable by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. We therefore do not need a further over-arching power giving extra discretion to the tribunals to decide whether to apply the criteria. That would create extra uncertainty and undermine the purpose of our proposed regulations. I hope that in the light of my explanation my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to my noble and learned friend for his explanation, but I am not at all happy about it. I do not understand why the amendment should import extra uncertainty to the present situation. I do not understand why it should not be possible to give employment tribunals the powers to deal with the situation under subsections (2), (3) and (4). Those subsections are of great importance to the applicant because they provide the basis on which he will not be able to get the case to the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para13"></a>The tribunal is the appropriate body to say whether subsections (2), (3) or (4) should apply. I do not believe that our proposal would add extra uncertainty to what is not a happy situation anyway. I pointed out at the beginning that we do not particularly care for Clause 32 and we are not alone in that view. However, in the circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-22_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are still on complaints about grievances. This is a probing amendment in the sense that you probe where you do not believe you will gain any concessions but you would like to find out what the Government have to say.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para18"></a>No doubt we shall be told that we have done it before. It is another attempt to get the Government to define why they want to exclude certain types of grievance from the restrictions on access in Clause 32. We are hoping to discover some numbers. Seventy-five per cent of hearings are on grievances. It is a dominant part of the tribunals' work. Are the Government going to exclude 10, 20 or 30 per cent? They must know. How much exclusion will there be? Perhaps the Minister would say what proportion of the various types of grievances will be excluded.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para19"></a>Sometimes the Government talk as though when we see the regulations governing these provisions, a type of grievance will be totally excluded; it may not go anywhere near a tribunal. Sometimes they suggest that there may be an element of discretion, although where is left unclear.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para20"></a>Most of all, we are hoping for some principles on the logic of why the Government have put in barriers to access, then taken certain&#151;as yet not completely specified&#151;types of case out, or why they say that they will do so when the regulations are made. Why do they take some out and leave some in, and why have they not said a word about certain other types?
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para21"></a>We tried previously to obtain Government comment. We tried, in framing our amendment in Committee, to look at what people had said; for example, the Minister in the Commons made frequent references to certain possible types of grievance that might be excluded. He said that minimum wages and harassment grievances and routes to resolution might not be covered. He said that exclusions might come about on reasonable grounds, mentioning bullying or intimidation as reasonable grounds for not applying the limitations on access.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para22"></a>In Committee, we sought to collect everything that had been said on the Internet and by Ministers. We wrote it all down: violence and intimidation; race; unlawful wage statements; and collective grievances. So as not to make the amendment negative, at the end we added any other exclusions decided by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para23"></a>But in Committee, my noble friend Lord McIntosh did not help us much. He said on 25th March:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is our intention to be sparing in setting exemptions. As we have argued with other amendments, most employees should have little difficulty in fulfilling their obligations under this clause . . . we need to ask ourselves what special grounds may arise where it would be unreasonable to expect an employee to set out his complaint to the employer a little earlier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para24"></a>
Of course, that is just setting out his complaint, not the 28-day wait. He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We think that there will be some special cases"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para25"></a>
here comes another list&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The threat of violence or other forms of serious harassment fall into this category. We do not want to force employees to raise a grievance as an individual complaint, if it has already been addressed as a collective issue by a union"&#151;
<P>

<a name="column_227"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
so he takes on board what we say about unions. He continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That is the second broad category. We intend to cover these two main categories of exemption in the regulations. There may be others which it would be sensible to add. For example, the amendment about interim relief may raise the need to exempt a particular set of cases. However, we cannot accept that the scope of the exemptions should be drawn as widely as this amendment implies. If we followed this approach, an exemption could be claimed in a large proportion of cases"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para27"></a>
which is the nearest we get to figures.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would mean that the admissibility regime would never apply, for example"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para28"></a>
here are some specific exclusions from exclusions&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to any cases involving race or sex discrimination. It would seriously diminish the purpose of the clause".&#151;[Official Report, 25th March 2002; col. 351.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para29"></a>
That seems to suggest that you have to put the big ones in.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para30"></a>My noble friend Lord McIntosh seems to be saying, "Out violence, harassment, collective bargaining and interim relief"&#151;they will not be covered by the restrictions on access; no race and sex cases. Disability does not seem to be featured anywhere.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para31"></a>We are still asking for some sets of principles. The Minister has failed to say what other kinds of discrimination will be out or in, or why they will be out or in. Nothing has been said about disputes over terms and conditions, about failures to consult on redundancy, transfers and so on. But he did say something rather Delphic at the end&#151;at least, he could have said it in a Delphic manner but it could have been that Hansard was misbehaving at the time. It was not the fault of Hansard; there were problems with the machinery when we were upstairs. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If there is any opportunity to compare the matters which I have listed as being exemptions we are prepared to accept with the list in this amendment between now and Report stage"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para32"></a>
I could not quite follow that&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I should be very happy to do that".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para33"></a>
But I am not clear what it was.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If that means that we should be putting an agreed list"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para34"></a>
that sounds good&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or a list which is acceptable to the Government, on the face of the Bill in this form&#151;in other words, as a constraint on the regulation-making power&#151;I am prepared to consider that as well".&#151;[Official Report, 25/3/02; col. CWH 351.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para35"></a>
I should like to know whether that has been considered. We welcome the possibility of being asked to put forward a list; we welcome the possibility of discussing an agreed list.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para36"></a>At the end of the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, I asked him about principles. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One could explore the possibility of looking for principles, but looking at this list"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para37"></a>
that is the list in our amendment&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and looking at the things which the Government intend to put into the regulation&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para38"></a>
so somewhere they have got a list&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am not sure that I can see a principle behind them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para39"></a><P>


<a name="column_228"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
So the Government do not have any principles. Where do you get the ones you put in and the ones you take out if you have not got any principles?
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para40"></a>I said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Here we have a Bill with no principles. The Minister said that, not me".&#151;[Official Report, 25/3/02; CWH 352.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-22_para41"></a>
At that point I withdrew the amendment. We are putting a list in our amendments&#151;it may be the wrong list&#151;but the Minister seemed to be saying that.
<P>

<a name="20611-22_para42"></a>My final question is to ask desperately whether there is any logic to this; whether there is any kind of sense. I have looked at the main headings of grievances in the ES annual report. The Government seem to be saying that they are not going to apply the access procedures to violence, harassment, collective bargaining or interim relief. However, it seems that they will put in race and sex. They leave in a kind of limbo wages cases, breach of contract cases, redundancy pay, working time, equal pay, minimum wage, disability and discrimination cases. I ask again: what is the guiding set of factors, if not principles, that the Government will use to move matters in and out of the procedure? I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, in supporting the amendment I shall speak especially to the issue of collective grievances.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para0"></a>The Government earlier adopted the most welcome position of putting on the face of the Bill the general principles on which the right to be accompanied will be accorded. They are not leaving the issue&#151;as they previously insisted that they must&#151;to regulations. In my submission, that same principle applies, in particular, to what are sometimes referred to as "collective grievances".
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para1"></a>In terms purely of exposition of the subject of employment law, it is often convenient to divide individual rights from collective rights or collective grievances. But that is, in a sense, formalistic. Individual grievances relate very often to groups of workers and, although they are expressed in law as individual grievances, they frequently relate to grievances which are felt by a group of workers. Therefore it is a matter of basic principle when one introduces this fundamental division into an Act of Parliament to tell the House something at least about what it means. Of course the petty details may be dealt with in regulations, but not to tell us anything about how the division is envisaged borders on negligence or idleness.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para2"></a>In another place, my honourable friend Mr Alan Johnson repeated this on many occasions. He said, for example,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We also intend that in cases where fewer redundancies arise"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para3"></a>
that is, fewer than 20&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and the matter has been dealt with as a collective issue between the employer and the union"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para4"></a>
Schedule 2 shall not apply. The matter has been dealt with.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para5"></a>He then said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nor do we envisage that the statutory procedures should be used when the issue has been handled as a collective process".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_229"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
I take it that those words were carefully chosen; not "could be handled" but "has been handled".
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para7"></a>He then said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not want to duplicate the process and force employers to go through a procedure several times when the issue is collective".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Committee F, 18/12/01; col. 180.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para8"></a>
That is a different formulation. The issue is collective in concept; in a sense, it is a platonic idea of the collective process.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para9"></a>He went on at col. 181:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If there were a collective issue about the absence of a proper catering facility and the union was addressing that collectively with the employer, it would be unfair . . . to insist that the employer should deal with complaints"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para10"></a>
he meant individual complaints&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"about the absence of facilities individually as well".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20611-23_para12"></a>At col. 183, he then expanded the range&#151;this is very important&#151;and said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is unlikely to be possible to apply the statutory procedures to unfair dismissals arising out of industrial action because they arise out of a collective dispute".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-23_para13"></a><P>

<a name="20611-23_para14"></a>I ask my noble and learned friend whether he meant "lawful industrial action" or "industrial action". If he meant "lawful industrial action", do we have to await the result of an interlocutory injunction application by the employer to know whether it is lawful or not?
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para15"></a>In other words, some indication must be given as to what is meant by "collective issues" and "collective handling of grievances", especially in the light of the fact that at one point in the documents the Government have adopted the CBI notion that "exceptions must be narrowly drawn". What is the narrow drawing of a collective issue?
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para16"></a>I appreciate that my noble and learned friend will probably say that we will know all about this when we see the regulations. The regulations are an Alice-in-Wonderland provision that none of us will see until we see the drafts some days before they are introduced. There is an obligation on the Government to tell the House something at this stage about what they mean by "collective issues" and "individual issues". I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord McCarthy said that the purpose of the amendment was to probe what exemptions there would be. He asked what principles would be applied; what would be the width of the exemptions; would they cover the matters referred to in his amendment or would they cover other matters. He then read a long extract from the speech of my noble friend Lord McIntosh in Grand Committee, in which my noble friend set out what the approach would be. The noble Lord referred to my noble friend saying that it is the Government's intention to be sparing in setting exemptions. It is the fact that most employees should have very little difficulty in fulfilling their obligations under this clause. They just have to raise a grievance in writing and wait 28 days. Anyway, they would have to set out their grievance in writing when application is made to the tribunal. No one is suggesting that they <P>


<a name="column_230"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be exempt from meeting that requirement of the tribunal system. The employer would soon find out the grievance in any case.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para17"></a>Therefore, we need to ask ourselves what special grounds may arise where it would be unreasonable to expect an employee to set out his complaint to the employer a little earlier. That sets out a basic principle, but my noble friend Lord McIntosh went further and indicated that there would be some special cases. My noble friend Lord McCarthy has gone through what my noble friend said. He referred to the threat of violence or other forms of serious harassment falling into the category of special cases. Likewise, we do not want to force employees to raise a grievance as an individual complaint if it has already been addressed as a collective issue by a union on their behalf. That is the point dealt with by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. What is being referred to there is that if the matter has already been raised as a grievance collectively, and it is the same issue on which the individual is making a complaint, there is not much point in using the grievance procedure. That seems to me to be a perfectly clear principle. How it works in practice will depend on the individual case.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para18"></a>My noble friend Lord McIntosh also referred to interim relief. He made it clear that it is those kinds of things which would be referred to in the exemptions contained in the regulations. He also made it clear that there may be others which it would be sensible to add and by consulting fully on the draft regulations interested parties could give their views on this key subject.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para19"></a>My noble friend Lord McCarthy then asked whether we had considered putting them all into one list. The answer is that we do not want to set out a list until we have had a proper and full consultation on what should be in the exemptions. That appears to me to be extremely sensible and something which I know my noble friend Lord McCarthy, who throughout his career has emphasised the importance of consultation, would regard as a very important approach to these matters.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I ask the noble and learned Lord to give way. I did not ask for a list but for the principles by which it was decided to put in some measures, exclude others and deal with others which we could not be told about. That is not a list, but a set of logical constructions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am very sorry. At the end of the speech of my noble friend Lord McCarthy, he referred to what he described as the "delphic remarks" of my noble friend Lord McIntosh. I am sorry that I did not make the matter clear. As regards principle, my noble friend Lord McIntosh indicated the basis on which we would decide what the exemptions would be, but he made it clear that we would consult fully. My noble friend Lord McCarthy <P>


<a name="column_231"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shakes his head. I have failed, as ever, to satisfy him. But he should not get us wrong. We have made clear the basis on which we have approached the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord says that the principles and their basis have been set out. Would he tell us now what they are?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I could repeat for the third time the speech that was made by my noble friend Lord McIntosh, but I believe that other noble Lords would be wearied by it. We could not accept that the scope of the exemptions should be drawn as widely as my noble friend's amendment implies. If we followed that approach, exemption could be claimed in a large proportion of cases. For example, it would mean that the admissibility regime would never apply to any case involving sex or race discrimination. It would largely negate the purpose of the clause. For the reasons that I have given, I hope that my noble friend Lord McCarthy will now accept that we have set out the approach that we will take to the exemptions and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, I may say that perhaps I misheard. As I understand it, he said that a collective issue is one which has been handled collectively. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I said that we do not want to force employees to raise a grievance as an individual complaint if it has already been addressed as a collective issue by a union on their behalf.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, we are not getting anywhere again. I have just a few points. I do not know why the noble and learned Lord keeps saying that all one has to do and the only kind of disability that one suffers if one is caught by the access restriction procedure, is that one has to write a letter. If it were only that one could say that it is only those people who cannot write letters who will be excluded. But the noble and learned Lord has given me all kinds of other people who could write letters. Far more restrictions apply to this access procedure, as he knows very well. One has to wait 28 days as we keep on saying. It is nothing to do with writing letters.
<P>

<a name="20611-23_para20"></a>If I understand him correctly, he says that it is reasonable to ask people to write a little earlier. I do not know what that means. Is one to be excluded if one has to write a little early or left out if one writes earlier? And once again, what about the 28 days? Why should some people be left an additional 28 days when others are let in without the 28 days? What is the distinction which says that race and sex will be on one side of the divide, but other forms of discrimination will be on the other? We do not want lists and we do not want "blah", but principles and the Government never give <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>them to us. I suspect that that is because they have not the slightest idea themselves. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 77:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 38, line 13, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-24_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20611-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall also speak to Amendment No. 78. Amendment No. 77 relates to Clause 32(7) as set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para2"></a>Subsections (6) or (9) require the employee to take the first step in the grievance procedure. It is a provision of an Act of Parliament which states that before one can go to the tribunal one must take the required steps. As a matter of fact, it also states that even if one has taken the required steps one is still a disabled person because one cannot go to the tribunal for 28 days.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para3"></a>I take the first point. If an Act of Parliament says to me, as a citizen, "This is a step which you are required to take on pain of limited access to justice", that is very clear as long as the step is set out clearly. I fully accept that my noble and learned friend and my noble friend Lord McIntosh have said that they want to be clear. Now that they have cleared up the matter regarding a copy of the statement, they are clear that the employee must send the statement of the grievance, or a copy of it, to the employer. Nothing could be clearer than that.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para4"></a>So when an Act of Parliament says, "This is the step that you are required to take before you can get to the court", I expect that to be interpreted by those whose job it is to interpret it&#151;and those whose job it is to interpret, first, the legal meaning of a provision in an Act of Parliament and, secondly, whether or not the facts that are before them cause that provision to apply are the courts, or in this case the tribunals. In the old days&#151;and, theoretically, in a sense today&#151;the question of law is for the court and the question of fact is for the jury. Neither question is for the executive. Yet the Bill says that it is for the Minister to decide what constitutes compliance with the requirements.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para5"></a>In Grand Committee, we suggested that this provision had the tones of a Henry VIII clause. There are many definitions of a Henry VIII clause. I have looked them all up and will quote them if my noble and learned friend wishes, but that would be tedious. I shall simply say that if it is not like a Henry VIII clause in the old sense, it has distinctly Tudor overtones. It is the Minister insisting that he is going to decide what is compliance, not the courts&#151;not the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para6"></a>Indeed, the clause goes on to say that not only will the Minister introduce regulations stating what constitutes compliance with the requirement to send a letter, but he will make provision in relation to circumstances in which a person is treated as having complied&#151;that is, he has not really complied, but the Minister will set out the circumstances in which the <P>


<a name="column_233"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tribunal must deal with the person as if he had complied&#151;there is no other meaning to the phrase "treated as having complied".
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para7"></a>In Grand Committee, we understood that the Government may wish to comment on this provision. We said that we thought it proper, not that the executive should take over the functions of the courts, but that it should give guidance as to its views on compliance. But that was regarded as totally unacceptable on grounds which, without repeating the speeches made in Committee, were extremely arrogant. They verged on an insistence that the judicial functions of the court&#151;in this case the tribunal&#151;must be overridden by the views of the executive on what constitutes compliance in the first case or, in the second case, where there has not really been compliance but on what should be treated as compliance&#151;and, inferentially, what should not. "What constitutes compliance" obviously implies that certain things will not be treated as compliance.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para8"></a>I cannot understand why the Government want to take this step of trespassing on the judicial functions of the tribunals. I just do not understand it. We offered them the idea of a code of practice. Obviously, any government can introduce such a code, introducing their ideas on what should be taken into account by the tribunal, judicially, in deciding on whether there has been compliance, on the facts, with the rules of the statute. But to say that the Minister is to decide what is compliance, and, more particularly, what is to be treated as compliance or not treated as compliance really does offend principles which I thought were established following the Donoughmore committee on Ministers' powers in 1932. I thought that that report had been accepted by governments of both parties since that time. It is extraordinary to see such a provision in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Clause 32(7)&#151;which we suggest should be removed, and which the Government could easily replace on Third Reading in what might be termed a graceful acknowledgement of the judicial functions of the tribunals and the courts. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, these amendments seek to delete the regulation-making powers in subsection (7)(b) and (c) respectively. Both powers are most important. However, it is also important to emphasise that they do not relate to individual cases; they deal with categories of cases. They do not remotely seek to replace the view of the tribunal with the view of the executive.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para9"></a>Under the first power, we can make allowance for the case where English is not the language of the employee; under the second power, regulations can be used to exempt certain categories of grievance&#151;say, cases involving the threat of violence&#151;from the admissibility regime.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para10"></a>We have argued throughout all our discussions that we want to create as much certainty as we can in the application of the statutory procedures. We do not wish to leave too many questions to the discretion of the tribunals; that would create uncertainty. Hence <P>


<a name="column_234"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>our policy is to use regulations to define the detail of how the statutory procedures should be applied across different circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para11"></a>This does not trespass on the decision-making powers of the tribunal any more than any other regulations; for example, the tribunal rules. Therefore, we believe that the regulation-making powers provide a feasible, desirable and sensible means of providing certainty where it is appropriate to do so. I invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="20611-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble and learned friend the Minister for that reply, but I do not think that he will be very proud of it when he reads it in Hansard. Paragraph (b) does not say that the provisions in the regulations will set out what constitutes "compliance" in categories of cases; it spells out what constitutes "compliance". It can go as far as the Minister concerned likes. It is nothing to do with the exceptions for violence, intimidation, sex discrimination, and so on, because they were all dealt with under previous amendments; and, indeed, as my noble and learned friend knows perfectly well, they arise under different parts of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para12"></a>Similarly, it is nothing to do with certainty, except in so far as the Secretary of State wants certainty on his say so; nor is it anything to do with the discretion of the tribunals. Indeed, I have never previously heard the judicial function of courts described as "discretion". I thought that that was fundamental and not a matter of discretion. The courts apply what the law says: what the law says here will be what the Secretary of State says, not what the courts find.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para13"></a>However my noble and learned friend dresses it up, this is a trespass on the judicial function of the tribunals. It would be perfectly simple for the Government to avoid that trespass by inserting into the legislation a code of guidance as to what they believe should be taken into account in deciding what is "compliance"&#151;and, more particularly, what should be treated as compliance. I noticed that my noble and learned friend did not say much about the latter.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para14"></a>I am speaking to paragraph (c)&#151;Amendment No. 89&#151;as much as to paragraph (b) in this respect. Paragraph (c) is even more to be deplored in the structure of the clause: what is to be treated as compliance is an "as if" proposition. The Government are using the notion of certainty in order to take complete control of excluding workers from the tribunals. It is not concerned with certainty; it is concerned with the judicial function. Therefore, paragraphs (b) and (c) should be deleted. The Government should reconsider the position before we reach Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-24_para17"></a><P>

"( ) This section does not apply to cases of constructive dismissal."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-24_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we now turn to what I agree is a difficult issue; namely, constructive dismissal. We discussed the issue in Committee, but both I and my noble friends did say that we would return to it on Report.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para19"></a>Constructive dismissal occurs when work and working conditions are deliberately made so difficult for an employee that he feels there is no alternative but to resign. It is a device sometimes used by unscrupulous employers who wish to get rid of someone as cheaply as possible. It can take many forms. Demands may be made on a worker that he feels cannot possibly be met; for example, a series of demotions or transfers to unsuitable work. There can be bullying, possibly harassment&#151;even sexual harassment&#151;which management does nothing to prevent and perhaps even covertly encourages. There could be a failure to pay wages or deductions from wages. There may be health and safety issues, perhaps on a construction site where working conditions can be hazardous anyway and inadequate precautions are taken.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para20"></a>Of course, we do now have legislation in place that seeks to protect whistle-blowers in such circumstances. However, workers&#151;particularly in a non-union environment&#151;may feel too intimidated to use the protective legislation. There are industries where the presence of so-called "illegals", who are willing to work for low rates and to take risks, can act as a pressure on existing workforces.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para21"></a>If there is a union environment, then protection can normally be afforded to employees suffering in some of the ways that I have outlined. Sometimes the individual concerned, who may feel that he has no one to whom to turn, may feel so stressed that the only course open is to leave the job. I agree that such cases may be uncommon, but they do happen, often to very vulnerable people.
<P>

<a name="20611-24_para22"></a>The objective of my amendment is to ensure that constructive dismissal is treated differently and that an employee in such a situation should not be expected to go through the various procedures laid down in the Bill before the case can be heard by a tribunal. It would be unrealistic anyway since relationships have usually broken down in such circumstances. In Committee, my noble friend the Minister expressed some sympathy with the case I made. However, the Government's position, as I understood it then, was that it was a matter best dealt with via regulations concerning which there will in any event be consultation. Nevertheless, I do think that there is a strong case for having such provision on the face of the Bill. Constructive dismissal is a term that is already widely understood, and it should be made clear to all concerned that in the face of this type of behaviour by unscrupulous employers to vulnerable people, an <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the point which my noble friend Lady Turner raises is an important and difficult one, as she acknowledges. The underlying principle behind Part 3 of the Bill is to encourage some dialogue between employee and employer about serious workplace problems. It is our deeply held belief that dialogue is a good thing in itself. It can help to define issues and resolve misunderstandings before litigation is undertaken.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para0"></a>In some respects, constructive dismissals are unlike other cases. They follow from the resignation of the employee. Often, the employee does not give the true reason to their employer before resigning. The resignation issue can be hidden. Employers may think with some justification that the employee has resigned&#151;as hundreds of thousands do each year&#151;for reasons totally unconnected with their individual treatment at work; for example, because the former employee wants a change, to move on to full-time education or to start a career elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para1"></a>In some constructive dismissal cases, the employer may be totally unaware that there is a problem before they are sent a copy of the tribunal application. We want to avoid that outcome if we can. We want to give the parties a chance to exchange information first before going to a tribunal. We believe that that will be beneficial to both sides. It may even resolve the issue. We are therefore convinced that there is particularly good reason to apply the admissibility criteria to these cases.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para2"></a>Nevertheless, we know that the issue is complex, for precisely the reasons to which my noble friend has referred. We shall have to think hard about exempting certain categories of constructive dismissal case from the admissibility regime. Harassment and bullying at work, as my noble friend rightly said, are connected to significant numbers of constructive dismissal cases. People resign rather than suffer the continuing pain and humiliation of such cases. We need to look at the case for exempting people exposed to such serious ill-treatment from having to pursue the matter with the employer before going to a tribunal, even though the admissibility criteria do not require the parties to meet. Therefore, such cases, for precisely the reasons given by my noble friend, require special consideration. As I have said, however, they are not the only cases that give rise to constructive dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para3"></a>We shall also have to look at the interaction between the statutory disciplinary and grievance procedures in these cases. A person may resign and claim constructive dismissal where the employer has unfairly disciplined him or her. In such cases, it is usually obvious to both parties why the employee has resigned. They may even have discussed the possibility during a recent disciplinary hearing. It may be wasteful and unfair in such circumstances to require the employee in effect to initiate a grievance.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para4"></a>The Government cannot accept this amendment. However, we recognise the need to draft the regulations under Clause 32 with care to ensure that we exempt deserving cases from the application of the admissibility regime. We shall of course consult in full on the draft regulations. This should give all parties a good opportunity to help us to identify the exemptions required. In the light of what I have said, I hope that I have reassured my noble friend on the basic concerns she raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for that response. I am particularly glad to note that the Government clearly have some sympathy with the case that we have been making. As I said in my initial submissions, I still believe that there is a case for placing something on the face of the Bill. If a provision is put into the legislation, at least that will be a warning to employers who feel inclined to exercise power over vulnerable people that they may have to face a tribunal without the employee having to go through all the procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para5"></a>However, I accept that there is recognition that a very strong case exists here. Although I should much prefer something to be placed on the face of the Bill rather than in regulations, I am glad to note that the Government at least accept that we have a strong case. I am pleased that they accept that there are situations in which it is simply not reasonable for a worker in this type of situation to try to enter into a form of dialogue with an employer who may be victimising him or may be prepared to accept a situation in which the employee is harassed or bullied. However, in the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

"(11) The Secretary of State shall make provision by regulations to ensure that, where a complaint is communicated to an employment tribunal but falls within any of subsections (1) to (3), copies of the communication and notices relating to it shall be sent to a conciliation officer for the purpose of giving an opportunity for the complaint to be settled by way of conciliation."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-25_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am afraid that my noble and learned friend will find that, once again, we are going over the same ground. However, it is the last time that I shall be doing so tonight, and that may be some consolation.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para9"></a>This amendment concerns the activities of ACAS during the dead period&#151;that is, during the operation of the restriction of access in the statutory procedure for dealing with grievances. It is perfectly true that we tabled an amendment on this subject in Grand Committee. I argued that Routes to Resolution advanced the case for the statutory procedure because the Government wanted to promote non-legal settlements. Much was made of that.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para10"></a>We had some difficulty in understanding how the organisation with a great reputation for facilitating settlements&#151;indeed, it was created and founded in <P>


<a name="column_238"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order to facilitate settlements&#151;could be excluded for 28 days. We could not understand it then and we cannot understand it now. The object of our amendment was to create a situation in which ACAS could be active throughout the period. We said that the 28-day period should be left alone and asked why ACAS was being put into a box. To that, my noble friend Lord McIntosh replied in Grand Committee that the Government were wrong to say that; they were not keeping ACAS out. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ACAS can . . . provide conciliation . . . in advance of a tribunal application in certain circumstances . . . that facility will remain".&#151;[Official Report, 26/3/02; col. CWH 377.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-25_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20611-25_para12"></a>Subsequently, when challenged, my noble friend referred to Section 18(3) of the Employment Tribunals Act. We said that that was a general provision which applied only where the proceedings could be brought by the applicant. But it might be possible for someone to argue subsequently that the applicant could not bring a case before a tribunal now because he was excluded by the provisions of the statutory procedure. That was enacted before these restrictions were to be imposed in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para13"></a>We also put forward the idea that an applicant who could ask for ACAS to be brought in might not know that he was able to use ACAS. Most people in business and probably most people in this House know all about ACAS and perhaps avidly read its annual reports, but out there people do not know of it. My friends in ACAS tell me that, when they telephone people, they are asked, "Who are you?". Of course, that is the case. Therefore, how are people to know, in the middle of the 28 days of purdah, that they can use ACAS? I am assuming that they can, although that has not been made absolutely clear to us. Let us suppose that ACAS does not know. ACAS is structured in such a way that it will wait to receive the ETs. When it receives the forms, it starts the process. That is how it works. How can we know that ACAS will know? ACAS is not exactly looking for work; it is overworked. It does not go around saying, "Have you heard of some cases we can do?".
<P>

<a name="20611-25_para14"></a>We were not satisfied. We said, "Why not send the new form as soon as it is available? As soon as you get the completed form, do not wait for 28 days; send it round to ACAS". The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Because we want first to encourage settlements of the kind which nearly all settlements are&#151;that is, settlements between employer and employee&#151;and we want to do that first".&#151;[Official Report, 26/3/02; col. 381.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-25_para15"></a>
So, now we have this admission, as we have had subsequently. We have to ask yet again at this time of night, "What makes you think that ACAS will discourage the settlement of disputes between employers and employees?". What an insult to that great institution to say that, in order to make it more likely that there will be a settlement, ACAS cannot come in. If that were true, we could close down ACAS and then we would have more settlements. That is nonsense and the Government know that it is <P>


<a name="column_239"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nonsense. Therefore, I want to see what they can conceivably find to justify themselves tonight. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend's case is surely grounded on a most important reason in Clause 32, which must take account of Section 19 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. Section 19 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Employment tribunal procedure regulations shall include in relation to employment tribunal proceedings in the case of which any enactment makes provision for conciliation&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-25_para16"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) provisions requiring a copy of the application by which the proceedings are instituted, and a copy of any notice relating to it which is lodged by or on behalf of the person against whom the proceedings are brought, to be sent to a conciliation officer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-25_para17"></a>
That is how ACAS gets to know about the case. Every application is sent to an ACAS conciliation officer. If the employee is prevented from making an application, for which Clause 32(2) provides, if he has not completed the first step in a grievance procedure, or if he has completed even the first step in a grievance procedure after waiting 28 days, how does ACAS get to know about the case? It may read about it in the local newspaper or someone may send ACAS a letter. There is no automatic notification to ACAS. As my noble friend said, we want ACAS to know about cases even if they fall within Clause 32(2), (3) or (4). That is the point of the amendment, as my noble friend said. That is a case which I do not believe the Government can reasonably resist.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we fully share the high opinion of ACAS held by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. We also acknowledge his remarks about ACAS being overworked at present. ACAS conciliation is a finite resource. It is important that that resource is deployed in the best possible way to assist employers and employees when they most need it. In other words, we want to promote the effective use of conciliation.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para0"></a>Generally speaking, when parties are addressing issues through internal procedures, they are likely to sort out their problems between themselves without assistance. It is therefore relatively rare for ACAS to become involved when parties are actively discussing their concerns, even though they can intervene at this point under Section 18(3) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para1"></a>The Bill will ensure that all employees have access to procedures. That is a major advance. It follows that we want people to use those procedures to sort out their problems. Employees who fail to meet the admissibility criteria are individuals who have never raised and then pursued their complaint through internal procedures. No serious discussions have therefore occurred. Clause 32 will prompt employees and employers to use the procedures which the Bill provides. That is, in our view, unquestionably a good thing to do.
<P>


<a name="column_240"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para2"></a>The amendment would invite or even require ACAS to conciliate even though the admissibility criteria had not been met, even though procedures had not been instigated or used properly. That seems to us to be an unnecessary and inefficient arrangement. It is far better to concentrate ACAS's resources on cases where procedures have been used and have failed.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para3"></a>As I have mentioned, ACAS already has the power to provide conciliation to parties in advance of a tribunal application in some circumstances. ACAS therefore has the flexibility it needs to intervene at an earlier point, where necessary. That facility will remain in place. How will they find out, my noble friends ask in their speeches? It is up to the parties to approach ACAS. That is what happens now when ACAS intervenes before an application is made. It works well and ensures that ACAS's assistance is available where needed. As my noble friends know, the ACAS helpline receives three-quarters of a million calls per year from individuals and employers seeking advice. So ACAS is well sited on a large number of employment problems.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para4"></a>We think that that is the right approach. That is the approach that is set out in the Bill. In the light of what I have said, I hope that my noble friends feel able to withdraw their amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, we are all getting tired now. The Minister has just had four own goals in a row. He says that we cannot do it because ACAS is overworked. It does not have the resources. Everyone knows that it is much cheaper to have an ACAS settlement than it is to have a court settlement. If it were the case that ACAS could do constructive work and that it was being held up by not having enough money, it would be quite lunatic for a government to come along and say, "We are doing that so that we reduce the demands on the tribunal". It would not reduce the demands, it would increase them, and, settlement for settlement, a settlement using the courts or the tribunals is five or six times more expensive than a settlement by ACAS. So it is an own goal to tell me about an overworked ACAS.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para5"></a>Secondly, the Minister says that it is rare for ACAS to come in. There is no problem because it does not come in very much in the early stage. If it is rare for it to come in, why does one have to legislate to prevent it coming in?
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para6"></a>The Minister says that they do not require ACAS to conciliate. Why should we force ACAS to conciliate? When did we ever say that we would make it essential and necessary for ACAS to conciliate? We never said that. We say, "Give it a chance to conciliate". If it wants to conciliate, it can. That is another own goal.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para7"></a>The Minister says that it is up to the parties to decide whether to bring ACAS in. We made this point before: how is the average "irk", who has been unfairly dismissed&#151;I am sorry that the Minister cannot listen. I will speak a little louder. Perhaps he will listen then. I am sorry; I do not think that I have the Minister's attention. I do have the Minister's attention now.

<a name="20611-26_para8"></a>I was trying to say that the Minister says that it is up to the parties to bring in ACAS. The employer might know, but the worker will not know that, so it is another own goal. That is four own goals. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 32.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-26_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20611-26_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 80A standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Razzall seeks to leave out Clause 32.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para12"></a>We have spent between one and-a-half to two hours debating the perceived frailties of the clause in the eyes of the noble Lords opposite who are, unlike me, somewhat more expert in matters of employment law. If I needed any convincing that, as they said, the view of the Law Society that the clause is fundamentally flawed is right, the past one-and-a-half to two hours has provided it.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para13"></a>I should be remiss if I did not congratulate the Minister on his defence. He reminds me of Boycott at his worst: absolutely resolute; keeping out the bowling at all costs; and not scoring any runs. Nevertheless, I ask him to reconsider the clause. During the past hour-and-a-half to two hours, we on these Benches have felt that we have been intruding on the private grief between the Government and their supporters on the Back Benches. Please do something about it. Take the clause back to the drawing board; reconsider it. It is fundamentally flawed; it needs to be reconsidered. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in the debate, if only because his is a fresh voice.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para14"></a>This is an important clause of the Bill. Discussion of it took up a great deal of time in Grand Committee; it has taken up a great deal of time this afternoon and this evening; and I am sure that we shall discuss it for even longer. As a result of the Bill, all employees will have access to a reasonable dispute procedure. That should be seen as a major breakthrough in developing a modern and fair system of employment relations. Millions of people stand to benefit from it.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para15"></a>But procedures are of little use in themselves. They must be used. I hope that we can all agree to the proposition that dialogue is better than confrontation. We want to encourage reasoned and structured discussion at the workplace. Problems are resolved earlier and less acrimoniously as a result and relationships are preserved. We have therefore constructed a series of measures in Part 3 that provide incentives to employers and employees to use those procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para16"></a>Clause 32 sets a simple set of criteria&#151;I emphasise the word "simple"&#151;that employees must follow in order to access a tribunal. They have simply to convey their complaint in writing to the employer and wait for a month. Those are not onerous requirements; they are not cumbersome; and they are easily verifiable.
<P>


<a name="column_242"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para17"></a>First, the clause provides safeguards to deal with every difficulty that may arise when the admissibility criteria are applied. The criteria will apply only where the initiative rests with the employee. They will not apply to cases where the employer in fact initiates the complaint. We cannot make access to the tribunal contingent on the actions of the employer. Therefore, the admissibility criteria will not apply to unfair dismissal cases. That takes a large number of cases outside the admissibility regime.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para18"></a>Secondly, we believe that the criteria should not generally apply to ex-employees. Thirdly, we have ensured that employees will not lose their right of access to tribunals through ignorance. Fourthly, we recognise that in extreme cases it would be unacceptable to expect employees to raise a complaint with their employer before going to a tribunal. That use of regulation to deal with exceptional cases is proper. It allows us to consult on their detail. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee concluded that that represented an acceptable power for the Government to take.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para19"></a>Of course it is not unreasonable to attach some preconditions to accessing a legal system. We have long applied time limits to the bringing of complaints to tribunals. We now propose to add several admissibility criteria. They are proportionate, well targeted and serve a sound public purpose. The Joint Committee on Human Rights was therefore satisfied that the Bill can be implemented in a manner compatible with the Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para20"></a>Clause 32 has been wrongly depicted as intended to debar tribunal applications. That is certainly not our intention. Instead, we want to ensure that in a particular and limited set of circumstances, employees must meet a few simple tests before their applications can be accepted by the tribunals. That will encourage dialogue where dialogue can help. Where dialogue does not work, then those cases will move on to the tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para21"></a>The clause will reduce tribunal caseloads below the level that they would otherwise be. That effect is not achieved by deterring or prohibiting applications. It is achieved because parties will increasingly sort out their difficulties between themselves, removing the need to go to a tribunal. I believe that that is an extremely laudable aim and that it is an aim that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, would unquestionably share. In the light of that explanation I know that the noble Lord will feel obliged to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="20611-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, will he answer two questions? First, he has mentioned the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. He will know that the Joint Committee is again considering the matter of compatibility and various aspects of the Government's case on which it asked the Secretary of State a series of questions. Will he tell the House when he expects the second report of the Joint Committee to be before the House?

<a name="20611-26_para22"></a>Secondly, perhaps I may refer to a specific point. As I understand it&#151;I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;the Minister has said in the course of his reply that Clause 32 and Schedule 2 will not apply to former employees. In discussing the modified procedure, he explained that workers who had already been dismissed for misconduct would have the modified procedure of Schedule 2 applied to them. Therefore, Clause 32 would apply to them.
<P>

<a name="20611-26_para23"></a>Which is it? Are former employees all excluded, or are employees already dismissed for misconduct within the scope of Schedule 2 and Clause 32? I would be very grateful if he would answer both those questions.

<A NAME="20611-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, in relation to the first point, the Human Rights Joint Committee clerk has indicated that he would expect the report to be available next week. I do not know what the report will say. We will have to wait until then.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para0"></a>Secondly, in relation to whether the admissibility criteria under Clause 32 would apply to former employees, I said that it would not generally apply to former employees. For such people the maintenance of the relationship with the employer is not an issue. Therefore, there is less benefit in applying the admissibility regime to such situations. The one exception to that rule is constructive dismissal. We went into some detail with noble Lords when we were discussing the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner. We were debating the treatment of constructive dismissal at Amendment No. 79. Therefore, we need to consider precisely how it would apply in those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   My Lords, the Minister was right in two aspects of his response. First, Clause 32 is a critical and important clause of the Bill. I would not disagree with him on that. Secondly, I would not disagree with him as to the Government's aims in that matter. I believe that they are entirely laudable. The issue between us is whether Clause 32 achieves those aims. On that matter I would like to reserve my position until I have read fully what he said in Hansard. We may want to come back to this at Third Reading. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 81.
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20611-27_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am deeply disappointed that the Government and the usual channels have insisted that we take Amendment No. 81 tonight. With Amendment No. 81 I have to speak&#151;and I intend to do so because this is out last opportunity&#151;to Amendments Nos. 82, 84, 85, 86, 89 and 90. They are all about Schedule 4. I shall do so as briefly as I can. However, since it concerns the whole schedule which applies to the whole of Clause 32, it would be wrong of me not to put a case whereby <P>


<a name="column_244"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>workers are very unfairly treated in the conspectus of Schedule 4. As the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, must appreciate from what he has just been dealing with, it is a matter of primary importance.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para4"></a>Schedule 4 sets out the range of employment protection statutes under which the enforcement of certain rights will become conditionally inadmissible under the terms of Clause 32, either because they are not complied with or because they have been complied with and the applicant must wait 28 days.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para5"></a>The statutory rights in Schedule 4 which describe the ambit of Clause 32 fall into three groups. They are all covered in the various lines which we would challenge in Schedule 4. The first group are statutes dealing with sex, race and disability discrimination. The second group are provisions relating to workers who have been victimised for proposing or seeking to enforce their basic rights. The third group are provisions that derive from rights under European Union law.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para6"></a>Of course we appreciate that the Government's primary aim&#151;they say it is&#151;in these provisions is to encourage settlement at workplace level. There is no complaint about that and as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said, the question is whether the ambit and the method of their trying to do so is at all reasonable or proportionate. As to the third group&#151;the European Union rights&#151;I say no more today than that grave doubts have been raised in many quarters whether it is proper to limit the enforcement of these rights in a manner proposed when the directives require an adequate, effective and deterrent method of enforcement. That applies to the Equal Pay Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Working Time Regulations and the European Works Council Regulations. The Government have said that they believe that is nothing to which European law would object. I wish they would set out their reasons for that and I expect them to do so today.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para7"></a>As regards discrimination, the limitations are applied to two gender protections, unequal pay and sex discrimination; to race discrimination; and to disability discrimination. Is it reasonable or proportionate to the mischief to be avoided to say to a disabled worker against whom an employee has illegally discriminated, "Send the employer a letter. Oh, perhaps you have done that and you are still being discriminated against at work illegally. Well, wait 28 days and see what happens"? And is it so to say the same to a worker being discriminated against on grounds of race? Today I picked up in the Printed Paper Office a new code of practice on the duty to promote race equality. I found nothing in it that suggested that those suffering racial discrimination should be barred from the tribunals for 28 days even if they had sent the necessary letter to their employers.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para8"></a>Why should the Government's legislation say to a woman subjected to gender discrimination in pay or conditions, "Yes, you sent a copy of your statement to the manager who did this. Of course the record shows there is next to no prospect of his acting any differently in the future but you must go back to work for a month with the same manager, see what he says, put aside <P>


<a name="column_245"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>your dignity at work and suffer the illegal low pay or degrading discrimination for another month before you can get to a tribunal. If they dismiss you for your supposed misconduct, you can have all the advantages of the modified procedure and hear the employer's last word, but you cannot go to a tribunal for a month. Oh, and my goodness, if you wait another month you will never be able to go to a tribunal"? What kind of proportionate response is that to the aim of bringing down tribunal applications by 34,000 or to the aim of settling problems at work?
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para9"></a>What kind of proportionate response is that especially when the chief executive of ACAS said in April this year,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is still a significant rise in discrimination cases passed to ACAS. This is a very worrying trend in today's increasingly diverse labour market"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para10"></a>
The CBI has stated that the number of employment tribunal cases must be reduced to save costs in business and that therefore Clause 32 and its ambit in Schedule 4 is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"one of the most important clauses in the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20611-27_para12"></a>The logic of the final category of statutes in Schedule 4 is even more doubtful. These six enactments cover the right to complain to tribunals for workers who have been subjected by unscrupulous employers&#151;they are a minority but nevertheless exist as the cases illustrate very well&#151;to victimisation which has been imposed for no reason other than having dared to enforce or propose to enforce their rights in the tribunals. The grounds that relate to victimisation&#151;detriment in the statutes&#151;include being victimised for complaining about discrimination against them for being a trade union member; voting in a union recognition ballot or campaigning for or against union recognition; proposing to claim the minimum wage or tax credit; acting as a member of a European works council or standing as a candidate; carrying out the functions of a safety representative; or complaining to or taking action against the employer over serious imminent danger to life and limb at the workplace. That in a year when the number of deaths at work has increased for the first time in many years. The grounds include also acting as a workers' representative for consultation and taking proper time off for training, maternity or family reasons.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para13"></a>If a worker is victimised for any of those reasons and proposes action to enforce his rights, under Clause 32 as applied by Schedule 4, he cannot go to the tribunal. Even if a worker has been punished for proposing to enforce his rights and notified his grievance, he is barred from the doors of the tribunal for another 28 days. The Government say, "If you do what we want, you can have a second chance". What kind of protection does the worker have against non-payment of wages, victimisation or harassment at work during those 28 days? Why do not the Government pass a special protection during that period?
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para14"></a>Ministers said, in response to our propositions in regard to victimisation, that they will make an exception for bullying. Not all victimisation will count as bullying&#151;as my noble friend Lady Gibson will be the first to say under her Dignity at Work Bill. The <P>


<a name="column_246"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government say that the bully might be someone other than the manager. In every case where the worker is subjected to victimisation or detriment by the manager, he or she is being bullied or victimised just for proposing to enforce his or her rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para15"></a>I am astonished that the Official Opposition cannot even be bothered to take up the case of those vulnerable people. Although victimised, under Clause 32 and Schedule 4, they will not have the right to the tribunal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I certainly do not intend to sit here and be attacked in that way. The noble Lord says that he is surprised at the way in which the Official Opposition is behaving. He said exactly that in Committee. I thought that he had got that issue out of his system. It was unnecessary to repeat that comment tonight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, what is necessary in moving this amendment is not, with great respect, for the Opposition to judge. I am astonished that none of the Front Benchers&#151;perhaps other than the Liberal Democrats&#151;appears to think that it is disgraceful that people who are victimised at their place of work will be barred from the doors of the tribunal simply for proposing to enforce their rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para16"></a>It gets worse. The list in Schedule 4 produces extraordinary inconsistencies. I wonder whether my noble and learned friend can justify them. A worker who is victimised for saying that he will enforce his minimum wage and make the employer pay it is not allowed to go to the tribunal unless he begs the employer to set the matter right in a letter. Even then, the employee cannot go before the tribunal for a month. The Law Society and others pointed out long ago that under Section 20 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, an enforcement officer can go to the tribunal whether or not the worker has sent a letter and enforce the worker's rights to a minimum wage. What kind of consistency is that? The worker cannot go, but the enforcement officer can.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para17"></a>Similarly, my noble friend must take account of the fact that the list in Schedule 4 includes various cases of detriment or victimisation, but it does not include Section 12 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Section 12 is a case where a worker has been victimised on the ground that he has taken part in asking for a union representative to accompany him&#151;one has a right to be accompanied&#151;at a hearing. If that is his complaint he can go to the tribunal. But if he has been victimised because of an unfair dismissal complaint or because he has not received a proper wage, or even if he has complained about health and safety dereliction on the part of the employer, he cannot go to a tribunal. What kind of sense and consistency is that?
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para18"></a>The arrangements for Clause 32 and Schedule 4 are furthermore quite disproportionate to the problem identified by the Government. The Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 6, which prohibit disproportionate limitations on access to justice to enforce rights are very much at the centre of the 12th report of the Joint Committee on <P>


<a name="column_247"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Human Rights. I appreciate that its conclusion on that occasion was that the Government scraped by on Article 6. However, it is sitting again because, with great respect to the Secretary of State, she misled the Joint Committee by citing the SETA survey results as justification of the Government's case for Clause 32 as it now stands.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para19"></a>Indeed, that was the Government's position, although I appreciate that subsequently they have retreated from it to some extent. I quote from the Department of Trade and Industry press notice of the speech of the Minister of State in July 2001 to which I hope my noble and learned friend will pay attention. The Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government is convinced that many disagreements can be successfully resolved through better procedures in the workplace between an individual and their employer but equally a tribunal system designed to cope with increasing caseloads is essential".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para20"></a>
Then he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Over three in five of applications to tribunals come from applicants who have not attempted to resolve the problem directly with their employer in the first instance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para21"></a>
That is my honourable friend Mr Alan Johnson speaking in July 2001. That remained the basis of government policy while they drew up the Bill and throughout their case in Committee in another place. When we finally received the SETA survey, it showed nothing of the kind. The House of Commons was deprived of the information in the SETA survey, which was not published until deep in the Recess, two days before our Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para22"></a>Here I am in some difficulty. My noble friend Lord McIntosh gave a somewhat different account of that. I must quote my noble friend in extenso because the Secretary of State has alleged that the Joint Committee on Human Rights quoted him out of context. That is a serious accusation by the Secretary of State and as a labour law scholar I resent it very much. Therefore, I have to quote my noble friend Lord McIntosh completely, as I did at Second Reading, so that we do not have more of such nonsense about context.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para23"></a>On 26th February I put to him the question of whether workers had attempted to solve the problems of the workplace and whether there was a compensation culture, as has been alleged by the CBI and all other employers' organisations, and he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As regards the word 'attempted', I cannot tell from the wording of the survey whether such attempts took place or not. I imagine that in a large number of cases if a meeting had been attempted it would have been achieved, or certainly if written communication had been attempted it would have been achieved. I do not believe that significant numbers are involved in that regard ... Frankly, the issue of this survey has been taken as far as it can be taken. It has little significance in policy making terms and I do not think that we should spend any more time on it.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para24"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Of course, there are all kinds of reasons why there should be no communication between employees and employers. As Judge Prophet said, that could be because some people left employment before they had an opportunity to start any communication. That is a legitimate reason for not entering communication. I am not saying, and the Government are not saying, and never have said, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, claimed we had said, that 62 per cent of cases could have been resolved outside tribunals. That is not the case that we are making. We are making the case that communication between employees and employers is greatly <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para25"></a><P>

<a name="20611-27_para26"></a>I entirely agree with that, but it was not the case on which the Government built Clause 32&#151;as it now is&#151;and Schedule 4. I will quote further if the Minister believes it is out of context, but I have done enough&#151;especially at this time of night&#151;to sustain the fact that the Government have retreated from their explanation in July 2001 and have now not relied on the SETA survey for Clause 32 and Schedule 4.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para27"></a>When the Secretary of State wrote again to the Joint Committee&#151;I believe that the letter is in the Library; I was kindly sent a copy&#151;she did not rely on the research of Burgess and his colleagues, which is well known to be the explanation of why employment tribunal applications have increased regularly since 1972 from five social causes and also an increase in jurisdictions; she relied upon what she called the "admittedly imperfect" SETA&#151;the Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications&#151;which,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"did not ask a direct question on this subject".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para28"></a>
She said that SETA was just "one indicator" of pre-existing opinion and fact:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The way we have chosen to enforce the statutory procedures is through the adjustment to awards under clause 31 and restrictions on admissibility under clause 33",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para29"></a>
as it was, now Clause 32. This was simply part of a commonly-held view that it was necessary. But there is not a single piece of relevant specific evidence in the Secretary of State's second letter to justify that method of enforcement against the employees whose situation I described under Schedule 4.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para30"></a>The use of limiting employees' access to justice over the range of statutes set out in Schedule 4 is disproportionate and proportionality is, as the European Court of Human Rights insisted last year in the Fogarty case, essential to the enforcement of limitations on access to justice. It said that if the limitation,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-27_para31"></a>
then it is wrong.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para32"></a>Schedule 4 shows how many employees will be barred from access to justice in regard to Clause 32. It has three types of case. I say to my noble and learned friend that as you go through them they are less and less justifiable. They involve workers' European rights; workers who are sent back to work to suffer discrimination for 28 days on racial, disability, or sex grounds; and who are victimised by employers even for proposing to enforce their rights under existing statutes.
<P>

<a name="20611-27_para33"></a>I seek that Schedule 4 be amended by cutting out those categories in their entirety. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 83, 87, 88 and 90, which are in this group. These parts of Schedule 4 all deal with claims of detriment where an employee has claimed that he has <P>


<a name="column_249"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suffered a detriment already. This seems a simple issue of principle: where an employee is claiming a statutory right&#151;as there would be in this case&#151;it is difficult to see how one should prevent that employee from further pursuing a claim where the basis for the claim is that the employer has responded badly to the claim of that statutory right in the first place. It is a straightforward, simple principle. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I have listened very carefully to the arguments made in support of this large group of amendments. I agree with my noble friend on one point at least: this is a very important schedule. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that it raises very important points.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para0"></a>The admissibility policy and, to that extent, our whole dispute resolution policy, rests on getting this schedule right. So I will attempt, as I did in Grand Committee, to explain why the Government will resist any attempts to cut down the number of jurisdictions listed in it.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para1"></a>But first I must return to a point which has been made many times before by the Government. It bears any amount of repeating. Clause 32 simply does not have the drastic effects that my noble friends say that it has. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn said in Grand Committee that when one limits the right to the extent that Clause 33&#151;which has now become Clause 32&#151;limits it and prohibits any access to the tribunal, one is coming very close to destroying the right altogether.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para2"></a>Let me repeat, once again, for the whole House, what the admissibility criteria&#151;these limitations which we are told come very close to destroying the right altogether&#151;actually are. An employee with a grievance must write to his employer telling him what the grievance is. He must then wait 28 days to see if his employer responds. After that he is free to take the case to a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para3"></a>We want people in all the jurisdictions that my noble friend has listed to tell their employer about the problem before they take him to a tribunal. We are not ashamed of that requirement. My noble friend alerts the House to all the important employee rights which we are covering in the schedule. We agree. Of course these are important rights and, yes, we do want them to be covered.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para4"></a>In our view it is perfectly sensible&#151;indeed, it is right&#151;that any employee who thinks that his employer has breached one of these rights should be required to tell his employer of this grievance and ask for a response to that complaint. I know that my noble friends are not alone in disagreeing with our view. I have read the Law Society's brief just as they clearly have, but the opponents are in a minority. We have been out to consultation on this and we have talked to all sides of industry.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para5"></a>My noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, have brought to the attention of the House, in particular, the case of an employee who has suffered detriment at the hands of his employer. As the noble Lord and my noble friends will know, detriment can <P>


<a name="column_250"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take many forms. It can take the form of bullying and harassment; it can also take the form of being passed over for promotion, being given dirty and unpleasant tasks or not being given a good set of benefits and so on.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para6"></a>There seems to be an assumption in the arguments that we have heard that it is unreasonable to expect someone who has suffered from detrimental action to write to their employer. Why? You have a grievance. It may be legitimate or it may not, but why on earth should it not be brought to the employer's attention before he is taken to a tribunal? He might be able to resolve the problem at a stroke. It could be based on a misunderstanding.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para7"></a>Of course the grievance may be real and the employer a thoroughly bad one. He will not reply or will give a dismissive reply to the Step 1 letter, and the case may go to the tribunal and be resolved in that way; or ACAS may be able to conciliate. All these routes are important and remain open. But talking to the employer first has got to be worth a try.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para8"></a>The premise of those who oppose our policy seems to be that people who have suffered detriment at work are rendered incapable or should not be expected further to communicate with the person who employs them. It is a false premise. Of course&#151;and we have acknowledged this time and time again&#151;there will be cases where the detriment, harassment or discrimination which has been suffered is so extreme that it makes the employee fearful of any further contact with his employer&#151;and understandably and rightly so. As my noble friends acknowledged, the Government have promised complete exemptions in the regulations for those who have been subject to serious bullying, harassment and threats of violence. We will consult on the detail, but such exemptions will cut across all jurisdictions, not just those dependent on victimisation or detriment.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para9"></a>But exemptions from the statutory requirement will not be the norm and nor should they be. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn asked in Committee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Why on earth should special rules apply to a person's ability to go to a tribunal and say, 'That's not fair'? Some workers will say, 'I'm not going near that employer again. Look what he did to me last week'".&#151;[Official Report, 21/3/02; col. CWH 309.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-28_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20611-28_para11"></a>The question is revealing for it seems to assume that the employment relationship has already ended, but as the employee still works there, how can he possibly say that he is not going near that employer again? In most cases, but not in all&#151;and this we accept&#151;we believe that someone who is employed ought to be able to communicate their concerns to the employer, and that is all we are requiring them to do.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para12"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn raised a question on Europe. It is claimed that the Government are watering down rights which emanate from there. We heard in Committee that working time rights and other rights which stem from the EU directive should be taken out of the Schedule 4 list. We are accused of failing to provide effective and appropriate remedies because of the admissibility rule. But there are already rules about procedures for getting to a tribunal. All countries have them. There are time limits and forms <P>


<a name="column_251"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column 251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be filled in. Failure to meet the three-months' time limit in the United Kingdom means in most cases that the case cannot be heard. The worker would then be denied his day in court. I presume that that is accepted by my noble friend as not watering down European rights. We are adding another requirement, to raise the issue first with the employer in most cases. That is reasonable and proportionate. We have no reason to believe that we are in breach of any of our obligations in doing so.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para13"></a>Finally, my noble friend raised the human rights issue. He knows that the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has concluded that the provisions of the Bill serve legitimate public interest objectives. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn has raised particular concerns with the Joint Committee. My noble friend touched in some detail on those in the remarks he made this evening. I am sure that the right course is to wait to see what the committee says in relation to the particular points that he raised.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para14"></a>In the light of what I have said, I hope that my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<A NAME="20611-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I cannot say that I am very happy with that reply. It was more or less the one given in Grand Committee. Indeed, my noble and learned friend seemed to be quoting mainly from what I said at that stage and not what I said tonight.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para15"></a>As regards the exemptions in the regulations, we will see them when we see them. The CBI has said that the exemptions must be very limited. The Government seem to agree so I doubt very much whether they will deal with the issue. In respect of all other countries having the kind of provision which is in Clause 32 and Schedule 4, that is a travesty of comparative employment law. I do not know which examples my noble and learned friend would like to cite, but if he looks at the French, Italian or German procedures he will not find anything like Schedule 4 and Clause 32; indeed, that would apply to most other western countries.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para16"></a>As regards victimisation, the noble and learned Lord gave some very good examples. The worker comes home and he says to his wife, "I complained because I raised a question about health and safety as I thought someone was going to be killed. In reply the manager"&#151;the worker would add an epithet&#151;"put me on dirty tasks or he will pass me over for promotion". His wife says: "What are you going to do about that?". He says: "Oh, I can't do anything about that. I've got to spend another 28 days on dirty jobs".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para17"></a>What kind of justice and fairness do the Government think there is in that? Do they really think, sitting in comfortable offices, that workers who are put on dirty jobs as a response from unreasonable managers for daring to say that they wish to enforce their right to complain about derelections of duty in terms of health and safety will accept that without complaint? No wonder they say that they want to exclude collective issues&#151;because, if workers cannot take issues up in the tribunals, they will take them up as collective issues; and a new generation of trade union officers will encourage them to do so, because a new generation of trade union officers is concerned above all with the interests of their members and not with loyalty to this or that schedule or to the curious philosophy that tells us that being put on dirty jobs for 28 days does not matter.
<P>

<a name="20611-28_para18"></a>Schedule 4, plus Clause 32, is a disgrace. It is a disgrace for those who should know better. It is a disgrace for a Labour Government. It is very sad that we should have to debate this matter with some 15 or 20 people instead of the 400 who turn out to protect blood sports against animals rather than Schedule 4's blood sports against workers. But there is nothing I can do except beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Ampthill) in the Chair.]




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee stage. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in the Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para2"></a>I should explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber, which is likely this afternoon I understand, while we are sitting. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para3"></a>I understand that the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House would like to say a few words before I proceed with the business of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  I am grateful, my Lord Chairman. It is simply to indicate, I hope for the assistance of the Committee, that we have taken the view that this is an extremely important Bill. I have discussed matters with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General, and it has been agreed, therefore, that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, as the Minister from the Lord Chancellor's department, will deal with Part 1 and the Attorney-General will deal with Part 2. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para4"></a>Title postponed.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-29_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>"THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</B></center><center><b>Aims of the Criminal Justice System</B></center><br>
 AIMS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
<br>
(1) The principal aim of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland is to protect the public by reducing crime and the fear of crime.
<br>
(2) All persons and bodies exercising functions in relation to the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland must have regard to that principal aim in exercising their functions.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(3) With a view to promoting confidence in the administration of the criminal justice system, all such persons and bodies must also have regard to the need to operate a system which is independent, fair, accessible, open, inclusive, effective and protective of human rights.
<br>
(4) Each agency working in the criminal justice system shall publish statements of ethics covering all those employed or holding office in that agency."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-29_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move this amendment standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland. The reason for so doing is that there is some disappointment that the Bill does not put human rights at the centre of the reforms in the way in which the criminal justice review recommended.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para7"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 3.32 to 3.42 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   It is a disappointment that the Bill does not put human rights at the centre of the reforms in the way in which the criminal justice review recommended. The first 16 recommendations of that review, all on human rights, have not been reflected in the Bill at all. A glance at the index on page 151 of the implementation plan, which accompanied the publication of the Bill, makes that clear. The plan states, in relation to almost all of those recommendations, that their implementation is ongoing but, in nearly every instance, it provides no timetable, however imprecise. At several other points in the Bill, the opportunity has been missed to include references to relevant international standards on human rights.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para8"></a>Perhaps the most glaring omission in the Bill is the failure to include any statement of the aims of the criminal justice system. While the review did not actually recommend that those aims should be contained in the legislation, we see no good reason why they should not be. After all, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 already contains a section stating the functions of the police service and Clause 52 of the Bill sets out the aims of the youth justice system. We propose that the Bill as a whole be amended to set out clearly the aims of the adult criminal justice system. One of those aims should be at the forefront&#151;the promotion and protection of human rights. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I hope Members of the Committee will be pleased to know that we are publishing a revised implementation plan with more detail, especially on timetables after Royal Assent. Members of the Committee will know that the review did not recommend, as the noble Lord indicated, that the aims of the criminal justice system should be put in statute. We do not believe that the review group felt that that was necessary. While this Bill is extensive, it does not attempt to cover all areas of the criminal justice system; moreover, the Government are not convinced that there is a need to place those general aims on the face of the Bill. We are not convinced either that the amendment adequately covers all we would want to say, which does not mean that we do not have sympathy with the sentiments <P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expressed by the noble Lord. The review recommended that we publish a set of purpose and aims for the criminal justice system; that was published at the end of last year.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para9"></a>That publication states that our purpose is to support the administration of justice, to promote confidence in the criminal justice system and to contribute to the reduction of crime and the fear of crime. It also sets out the following aims: first, to provide an independent, fair and effective criminal justice system for the community; secondly, to work together to help reduce crime and the fear of crime; thirdly, to make the criminal justice system as open, inclusive and accessible as possible and to promote confidence in the administration of justice; and, fourthly, to improve service delivery by enhancing levels of effectiveness, efficiency and co-operation within the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para10"></a>As I said earlier, that publication demonstrates that we have sympathy with the sentiments expressed by Members of the Committee but the review also recommended that the Bill should include a clear statement of the aims and principles of the youth justice system. That is referred to in Clause 52. I hope that Members of the Committee will be comforted by what I have said and agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I start by welcoming the noble Baroness to Northern Ireland affairs. I believe that this is the first occasion in which she has taken part directly in that regard. I have previously been known to say that if there is one person whose side I always want to be on, with regard to advocates, it is that of the noble Baroness. Unfortunately, on this occasion, that is not the case.
<P>

<a name="20611-29_para11"></a>I have only one substantive point to make on the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Smith. It concerns subsection (4) of the amendment, which goes a little over the top. To publish aims is fine but to go to the extent that each agency working in the criminal justice system has to publish statements of ethics and so on is neither necessary nor appropriate in the Bill. Furthermore, so far as human rights are concerned, that is dealt with on the front page of the Bill anyway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I do not quarrel with the principal aim of the amendment but, as other provisions in the Bill tend to weaken the capacity of the judicial system, it is probably somewhat unrealistic to expect the judiciary to "protect the public". Nor is the new police service, in its much weakened position, capable of protecting the public, given that public protection is deteriorating with every day that passes. However, the intention is that the Bill will not be implemented for a year&#151;until after the Assembly elections next year. It may therefore be that the new proposed Army-based counter-terrorist Anglo-Irish task force&#151;whatever it is going to be&#151;may be <P>


<a name="column_CWH4"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>effective by that time in giving real protection to the public, provided that that new task force is not weakened.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   The noble Lord said that the Bill is not due for implementation until after the next election. As I understand the situation, from Clause 86, it will not be implemented until such time as the Government decide that the situation is such that it may be implemented. I seek clarification from the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is right when he expresses that view.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   I shall read carefully what the Minister has said in Hansard and may well come back to this on Report. For the moment, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para1"></a>Clause 1 [Guarantee of continued judicial independence]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Desai </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 6, leave out "continued"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-30_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20611-30_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 2 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 4 which is grouped with it. These amendments relate to the issue of independence. Amendment No. 4 derives from the definition of independence of the judiciary from the United Nations principles of independence of the judiciary. It is a straightforward quotation from that document and therefore is self-explanatory.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para4"></a>With Amendment No. 2 I seek to remove the word "continued" because it is not necessary when talking about independence. I apologise to the Committee because I did not speak on Second Reading, but during that debate many noble Lords paid tribute to all those who have worked in the justice system in Northern Ireland, and I join them in paying that tribute. But as the Criminal Justice Review Group made clear, there are some differences of opinion about the question of independence. It is not necessary to bring forward those problems here; the past is past and the word "continued" is not strictly necessary. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have no argument with Amendment No. 2, but Amendment No. 4 is perhaps unfortunate. The legal profession&#151;the judiciary&#151;is one element in Northern Ireland that has never been criticised&#151;never is probably too strong a word, but virtually never&#151;for its findings and performance over the past 30 years. To suggest that we need to include in the Bill a direction to the judiciary to decide matters before them impartially is, perhaps I may say, tactless&#151;without wishing in any way to be rude to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I part company in the most gentle way from my noble friend Lord Glentoran because I do believe Amendment No. 2 presents a problem. When speaking to the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Desai, justified it on the ground that the <P>


<a name="column_CWH5"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>word "continued" is unnecessary. I had thought, therefore, that the noble Lord would argue the point on the basis of drafting eloquence.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para5"></a>However, the substantial reason for the amendment became clear a moment later when the noble Lord said that there are some differences of opinion, or words to that effect, as to whether judges are independent in Northern Ireland. I have no doubt about that whatsoever. I had rather gathered from the noble Lord that he too had no doubts about that. To the extent that there may be some doubt, then it is all the more important that Parliament should dismiss it by expressing its confidence in the continued independence of the judiciary; that is, in expressing its confidence that judges in Northern Ireland are independent at the moment.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para6"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 4, I very much endorse what my noble friend has just said. This is the very stuff of the judicial function and it would be otiose and verging upon the odious should we see fit to set them out for a judiciary in whom we have such confidence. I hope very much that this amendment in turn will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I endorse many of the comments made by the noble Lord, and would say to my noble friend that it is right that this is a very sensitive issue. There is no doubt that, to date, the independence of the judiciary has stood Northern Ireland in very good stead. We certainly would do nothing and say nothing that could undermine or in any way detract from that. The purpose of the clause making specific reference to the "continued" independence of the judiciary is precisely because the judiciary is currently independent and must be seen to continue so to be. We respectfully suggest that in that context the word has some pertinence and added significance.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para7"></a>The clause already includes a duty on those responsible for the administration of justice to uphold the independence of the judiciary. The Bill also includes an oath in Clause 19 in which the judges promise to
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"do right to all manner of people without fear or favour".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-30_para8"></a>
The amendment seems to cover all that ground again, but in different and perhaps rather less precise language. I recognise that the wording comes from the UN principles on the independence of the judiciary, but these principles are just that&#151;they are not supposed to be binding legal wording. Of course, judges must act without bias or the appearance of bias. That is already the law and the amendment is not needed to ensure it, although I understand the reason why my noble friend Lord Desai tabled it. I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   I thank all the noble Lords who have spoken on the amendment. My purpose was to highlight one or two issues. It hardly needs to be said that these are all sensitive issues when we speak on Northern Ireland and I recognise the sensitivities. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 6, at end insert "and the legal profession"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-30_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20611-30_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: I tabled the amendment principally because of significant lobbying from the Law Society of Northern Ireland. The amendment simply affirms the importance of a genuinely independent legal profession as a whole. The existence of an independent legal profession is vital in the protection of human rights, not only in so far as this involves the framing of just laws and procedures, but also in the robust and independent application and defence of those laws and procedures.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para12"></a>This point has been made repeatedly by the Law Society of Northern Ireland and I have been struck by the strength of its case. It seems clear that an independent judiciary should be able to rely on an independent legal profession.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para13"></a>I am equally struck, reading Commons Hansard, by the flimsiness of the Government's case opposing this. I hope that I am correct in saying that the Government's principal objection to the amendment is that the implications for the regulation of a profession that is currently self-regulating are too far-reaching. On that basis they say that they will not give it serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para14"></a>I do not see in the amendment the pitfalls perceived by the Government. These pitfalls rest on the assumption that there is some kind of absolute independence&#151;that the legal profession is somehow independent from the law. Members of the legal profession in the UK are subject to the discipline of criminal law in the same way as any other profession.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para15"></a>The Bill includes a statutory guarantee of judicial and prosecutorial independence. The Government have rightly identified the independence of the judiciary and the prosecution process as a key issue in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice, but I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the legal profession has been excluded from this guarantee. Is there not a parallel need for the independence of the legal profession to be affirmed? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-30_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am more than happy to see if I can assist the noble Lord in relation to this matter. The Bill currently requires those with responsibility for the administration of justice to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary. This was recommended by the review because of the paramount importance of an independent judiciary. The idea of extending this provision beyond what the review recommended to include the legal professions has been debated in the other place, as noble Lords will know. The debate did not clarify what the effect of the amendment would be and the Government are reluctant to add provisions to the statute book when neither we nor anyone else are clear on what they will mean in practice. Perhaps I may explore a few of our potential concerns on the amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para16"></a>The first is the concept of independence, which the noble Lord has already touched on. The independence of the legal profession is different from the independence of the judiciary. We think it would be confusing to combine them. Secondly, a statutory provision could have unforeseen side-effects, possibly interfering with the profession's self-regulation by introducing a degree of government regulation. I am not clear how those responsible for the administration of justice would be able to protect independence in this case. If I might ask rhetorically, what does independence mean in the context, for example, of solicitors working on litigation between two private sector clients?
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para17"></a>I can understand, to some extent, the motivation for the amendment. The legal professions in Northern Ireland operate sometimes in very difficult circumstances. I can also see why noble Lords are suggesting that we offer some form of protection. However, we are wary about putting through Parliament legislation that commits us to an idea that has not been tested. One of the duties of government is critically to assess changes that are proposed by interested groups. In our view, the amendment does not pass that test.
<P>

<a name="20611-30_para18"></a>I would be grateful if noble Lords would bear in mind that this clause should be seen in the context of Part 1 of the Bill, which makes radical changes to the means of appointment and removal of judges. In that context, Clause 1 has special resonance and we make no comparable changes to the structure of the legal professions. We believe that, at the moment, the independence of both professions is properly guarded by their respective bodies. There is no basis at the moment for an indication that we should make a significant change in that regard and bring greater distinction between the professions in the other part of Great Britain.

The amendment seems a sensible precaution, because, hopefully, we may be able to reduce the hideous danger of what I call the contamination of the judiciary and subjecting the judiciary to unwarranted political interference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I do not know whether I can help a little further. Noble Lords will know that the legal profession at the moment is drawn from a wide pool both in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland&#151;a pool from which there is no restriction. The independence of the profession, therefore, is very much supported by the rules and regulations that are operated by the independent monitoring bodies for both parts of the profession&#151;solicitors and barristers. None of that is proposed to change, so their intrinsic independence will be maintained. At the moment, there seems no reason to change the status quo. I say "at the moment".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rogan </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 10, after "Appeal" insert "or judge of the High Court"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-31_para4"></a><P>

<a name="20611-31_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the first time I have spoken in a Grand Committee&#151;indeed, it is the first time I have been present in Grand Committee. If I should stray from the straight and narrow or fail to obey the rules and conventions, no doubt the Deputy Chairman will correct me so that I may do better in future.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para6"></a>The Bill seems to divide judicial appointments into two categories&#151;the list of judicial offices contained in Schedule 1 and what other parts of the Bill refer to as "most senior judicial offices". The amendment would remove the office of judge of the High Court from the list in Schedule 1 and place it with the other most senior judicial offices. The Bill seems rather confused on that issue. Bearing in mind that there are only seven judges of the High Court in Northern Ireland, one must ask whether such judges should be bracketed with Lords Justices of Appeal, or with magistrates and members of the Land Tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para7"></a>The implication for judges of the High Court of that relegation in status is that they will fall under the proposed Judicial Appointments Commission. Given recent events in relation to the appointment of the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland, those political appointment panels inevitably prove controversial. Members of the Committee should note that although the Judicial Appointments Commission will not involve Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly&#151;Members of the Assembly are appointed to the Policing Board&#151;nevertheless representatives to the Judicial Appointments Commission will be made by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para8"></a>Under the old Stormont regime, the appointment of High Court judges was reserved to Westminster. The line was drawn below the High Court level. The notion of the appointments procedure is accepted but I have described the way in which lines are drawn. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   In relation to the devolution process, it is intended that a greater number of matters will be devolved than was anticipated in 1972 because we are dealing with a fresh situation. The amendments were considered in another place and the intention is to give High Court judges the same appointment procedures and tenure as the Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal. We do not accept that that is a necessary amendment. The review makes it clear that the Judicial <P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Appointments Commission should appoint all judges, up to and including High Court judges. This is what the Bill provides for and that is what the noble Lord's amendment would remove.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para9"></a>The Government agree with the review that it is appropriate to differentiate at this level. We are very much in agreement with the line that was taken in relation to Scotland, where appointments and removal to the equivalent level are devolved. We do not see any basis at the moment to differentiate between the judgment made by the review and the position taken in relation to the Scottish model.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I support, perhaps tentatively, the arguments advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, who moved the amendment. At present, High Court judges are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. Becoming a High Court judge is always regarded as a significant step up in the hierarchy of seniority from being a county court judge. It is very important that that should be maintained and recognised&#151;a High Court judge, in his criminal jurisdiction, has, after all, jurisdiction to try the most serious criminal offences and to impose the most serious criminal sentences. In his civil jurisdiction, he has power under the judicial review procedure to make orders of the most far-reaching consequence. In his civil jurisdiction, there is no limit to the value of the cases that may be tried. The fact that there are only seven High Court judges in Northern Ireland seems to highlight the crucial importance of appointing judges by reference, explicitly and patently, to their merit. It is more important that they should be of such merit than that many of those who appear in the list in Schedule 1 should be of that merit, by reason of the fact that their jurisdiction is so much more important. The Government need to ask themselves&#151;and share with us the answer&#151;why a separate procedure is envisaged in the Bill for Court of Appeal judges. I suggest that the answer is because they have very much greater authority in the sense that with them lies&#151;subject to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords&#151;ultimate appeal within Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para10"></a>That is a question of balance and of hunch. I see the importance of following, where possible, the recommendations of the excellent review. That is a weighty matter. In this regard, there is a substantial case for excluding from the appointment of the Judicial Appointments Commission the appointments of the seven High Court judges. I do not wish to say more at the moment. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain why the break point should be between High Court judge and Court of Appeal judge rather than between county court judge and High Court judge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I entirely agree with the noble and learned Lord in relation to the importance of the role played by all High Court judges. He rightly said that the appointment of a High Court judge is an indication of the highest possible merit. If I may respectively say so, however, that is as true of England and Wales as it is of Northern Ireland. It has to be borne in mind that the seven High Court judges in <P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland are responsible for 1.5 million people. The judges in England and Wales&#151;they are equally important and equally discharging weighty matters&#151;are responsible for an equal if not greater number of citizens of our country.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para11"></a>The real reason&#151;the review recognises this&#151;is that the Lord Chief Justice and Lords Justices of Appeal are Privy Counsellors with wider UK responsibilities. At the level of a High Court judge, of course, the High Court judge's jurisdiction is in relation to Northern Ireland or England and Wales. At that stage, there is a separation. One has to look at a situation where devolution will mean that justice should properly be entrusted to the new devolved administration. It was, therefore, thought right and proper that the line should be drawn at the level below that at which the judges become Privy Counsellors with UK-wide responsibility. That was the line drawn in relation to Scotland. It was thought right that a similar line should be drawn in relation to Northern Ireland so that it will be given the same trust and confidence if in due course that all appears to be merited and may enable the devolution of justice matters to them to take place.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para12"></a>It is always going to be difficult to draw the line at the right place. Arguments will doubtless be made either way. Some would perhaps have urged that the line be drawn higher and some&#151;as they do today&#151;that it should be lower. The review got it about right and it should, therefore, be supported. There is some sense in the way in which the matter has been put forward. We would, therefore, respectfully adopt it and invite those Members of the Committee to be more comfortable with it than they have perhaps been hitherto.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   I am fearful of venturing into this debate because I am a lay person in judicial matters. However, I must own up to being a member of the Policing Board in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, referred to the Policing Board and the recent appointment of a Chief Constable for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para13"></a>As I understand it, the High Court Judges are the highest part of our internal judicial system in Northern Ireland. The Policing Board has appointed a new Chief Constable. I was not on the sub-committee that did it, but he was appointed by the board and ultimately by the Secretary of State. However, there is a tremendous row going on at the moment about that appointment.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para14"></a>We are all aware that the Policing Board consists of political and independent members. I am an independent member of it. I am as independent as the other independent members, but every one of them is labelled in the public's view as being on one side or the other, with the possible exception of one person from an ethnic minority in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the public perception of the make-up of the Policing Board or any committee of it. That is why we are having a row.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para15"></a>As a member of the board, I have no doubt about the integrity of the people who took part in that choice of Chief Constable. However, it is not what happened <P>


<a name="column_CWH11"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within the confidentiality of that meeting or series of meetings that is perhaps having a detrimental effect on the person who may be taking up that post and the people who were rejected; it is what the public perceive.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para16"></a>If that system works in Scotland, that is okay for Scotland. We are talking about justice within Northern Ireland. We are trying to do something far sooner than many of us would have expected four or five years ago or even last year. Therefore, the perception of this is going to be all-important. I honestly do not think it is the right time to do it at present.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para17"></a>Secondly, the Minister has twice already hidden behind this review and what the review says. Later on we will find that the Government will disagree with the review. I beg to suggest that the review is not a Bible on what is right and what is wrong. This could have very serious consequences in Northern Ireland if it is perceived by the public to be wrong. I have no doubt that when the commission is appointed it will be made up of people of the utmost integrity who will not permit their background&#151;whatever it may be&#151;to interfere with their decision.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   May I take advantage of the rules of this Grand Committee to come back again, I hope not at undue length? What we have just heard is very much from the noble horse's mouth, and I suggest that we should take it very much to heart. In the whole of my time dealing with Irish affairs&#151;which of course is minuscule compared with that of many who sit opposite, but it goes back ministerially for a period of nine or more years&#151;I have never heard it seriously suggested that the judges were other than completely impartial.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para18"></a>As it happens, it was a matter of felicity that in the High Court at least the judges from the main minority&#151;the Catholic community&#151;represented the demographic proportion of their religion, and sometimes a shade more. The point was that they were appointed not by machinery originating within Northern Ireland, but by the Lord Chancellor&#151;of course, by reference to the judges in Northern Ireland and other proper sources, I do not doubt. I hasten to add, however, that they never included the Executive, nor should they have done so.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para19"></a>We have just heard a cogent explanation of why it is important that that should not be disturbed and how readily foreseeable it is that suspicion will arise if it is disturbed. That should be taken very much to heart. From my standpoint, I certainly see it as soundly and realistically based.
<P>

<a name="20611-31_para20"></a>The Minister said that the distinction between a High Court judge and a Court of Appeal judge was that the latter was a member of the Privy Council. That, of course, is true&#151;it is a formal distinction. However, I would like the Minister to help the Committee&#151;if not now, perhaps at a later stage&#151;with such instances as are recorded of the extent to which, by virtue of being members of the Privy Council, Court <P>


<a name="column_CWH12"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Appeal judges in Northern Ireland have exercised UK responsibilities. It may be that they have, but I cannot call any instance to mind. It may be that they sit, not infrequently, in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but I do not think so. If that is to be the ground of the distinction, perhaps we could be told&#151;if not now, at a later stage&#151;how often the extra jurisdiction is exercised.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020611/text/20611-32.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am certainly willing to try to help the Committee on that matter. The importance, of course, is the ability or eligibility to exercise it on a UK-wide basis, as opposed to restricting it to a jurisdictional basis. The noble and learned Lord will fully understand that, whether it is discharged or not&#151;or exercised or not&#151;the distinction is that there is residual power or discretion to so exercise. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will accept that that is, indeed, a material distinction between the two.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para0"></a>The Government will devolve the powers only when we are confident that the structures will bear it and that the parties are ready. For example, there will need to be a cross-community vote in the Assembly in favour, so it will not happen before everyone is ready.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para1"></a>We must also bear in mind several further points. First, we do not treat the review as a Bible from which we cannot detract any jot; we take it seriously. Only if there is good cause to depart from the reasoning of the review do we think that it is right to do so. The Committee will know the amount of work, effort and commitment that brought the review into being. It would almost be an act of vandalism, if I may respectfully say so, to dismiss the recommendations made by the review body, without giving them the most careful and the most judicious consideration. We have made that balance in the way in which we have sought to respond to the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para2"></a>Members of the Committee will also be aware that Clause 5(8) provides that the selection of persons for appointment to the office must be done solely on the basis of merit. That merit-based test will continue to apply to High Court judges, and it is simply not right to say that the High Court judges in Northern Ireland, of whom there are in fact eight and not seven&#151;we do not want to displease the eighth member, who may think that they have somehow been neglected&#151;will in some way be the final point of recourse for the citizens of Northern Ireland. The citizens of Northern Ireland will continue to have access to the higher judiciary above the High Court judge, so it is not the end of the road, so far as the citizen in Northern Ireland is concerned.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para3"></a>The important thing is deciding where to draw the line. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, is absolutely right to say that there has never been a suggestion that those who discharge that onerous but honourable duty have done it in anything other than a totally honourable and independent way, without fear or favour for either or both parts of the community. There is no indication that the pool of talented lawyers from whom the High Court judiciary in Northern Ireland has traditionally been drawn has <P>


<a name="column_CWH13"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in any way shrunk. I am sure that Members of the Committee know better than I do the courage, determination and fortitude that it takes to be a really first-class professional lawyer in Northern Ireland. It is from that pool that we have taken our judges in the past, and it is from the same pool that we shall take them in the future. As the noble and learned Lord rightly says, we have had judges from both sides of the divide and all have discharged their duties in a way that we would commend.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para4"></a>I understand that this is difficult for noble Lords, but there comes a time when we have to invest a certain element of trust and confidence. If, in due course, we believe that the structures will bear it and the parties are ready, that will be the time when this matter will have to be handed over. Noble Lords know far better than I do that one can never guarantee when that time will be.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para5"></a>It may be important for me to clarify something that was said in response to an earlier question from the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. It is not correct to say that the Bill is not to be implemented until after the next Assembly elections. Many of the provisions will certainly be commenced before Assembly elections and others may be commenced before any Act or devolution of justice functions. The main target relates solely to the devolution of justice functions, on which some of the Bill's provisions are dependent. Some of those justice provisions may take a little longer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. Is her interpretation that the parts which will be implemented will be those that would result from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister being unable or unwilling to act jointly in terms of the wording of the Bill? Will that be the dividing factor timewise for the devolution of the most important powers in the Bill? As the Bill stands, decisions on the appointment or, believe it or not, the dismissal of judges have to be taken by the two Ministers acting jointly. The laws and the constitution of the Assembly require the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to be of different political parties and of different religions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Lord's contribution aptly demonstrates the complexity of this issue. The best I can do is to reply in the way I replied earlier, namely that we shall devolve only when we are confident that the structures will bear it and the parties are ready for it. That judgement will have to be made in due course, but we understand the importance and delicacy of that judgment and the need to be proportionate and balanced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have nothing much to add except to say that my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, have made strong and clear arguments as to why we believe that the Government have got it wrong on this occasion. That is my position as the spokesman for my party.

<A NAME="20611-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Could the Minister give me guidance on what criteria the Government would use in deciding that such functions could be transferred to Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I can do no better than quote what was said by my right honourable friend John Reid in relation to the Criminal Justice Review Implementation Plan. On page 2 he says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Once the devolved institutions are working effectively, the Government intend to devolve responsibility for policing and justice functions, as set out in the Belfast Agreement. We need first to take some major steps to implement the Criminal Justice Review and to make some more progress on detailed implementation of the Patten report. A final decision to devolve these functions can only be taken at the time taking account of security and other relevant considerations. But the Government's target is to devolve policing and justice after the Assembly elections scheduled for May 2003".

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   I would be very apprehensive of the involvement of any political figures in Northern Ireland with regard to judicial appointments. Throughout the debate in another place, we were told that the target date is after the Assembly elections of 2003&#151;next year. Again, we have been asked what criteria the Government will set down or abide by and whether or not to devolve the institutions. At the moment, the Assembly seems to have cross-community support. What happens, however, if the elections in Northern Ireland in 2003 throw up a different set of candidates, who will not have the support of the majority of Members in this House?
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para7"></a>Those Members who will be elected then, whether we like it or not, will have been elected by the democratic process of voting in Northern Ireland. We are putting ourselves in the position of saying, "We don't like the result of this election, we don't like what the electorate has tried to do so we will not devolve these powers". We are in fact overarching the decision that will have been taken by people in Northern Ireland. Unless we agree with the composition of the political Assembly which is going to be established, those powers will not be devolved.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para8"></a>Perhaps I have been around the House for longer than most. We are talking of political influence in the appointment of judges. Other judges, in this House and in another place, have said that there has never been any political influence. I do not believe that for one moment. There was and always has been political influence in the appointment of judges in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para9"></a>I shall illustrate the case. In the early 1970s I was approached by certain members of the legal profession in Northern Ireland to see what I could do to secure the appointment of a particular judge, who was then a QC. He had a fantastic war record in every respect but he had something against him: he was a Catholic. There was no way, in the opinion of the lawyers who approached me, that he was going to get the job. I took it upon myself to go to the then Lord Chancellor, Gerald Gardiner, and the Attorney-General, Elwyn Jones, and I gave the CV of the QC to them. They <P>


<a name="column_CWH15"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agreed wholeheartedly with me that he was a very suitable person for the appointment. They then told me on the Terrace of the House that they were having great difficulty with the Northern Ireland government, who wanted to appoint someone who had been a former Unionist MP as the judge. An argument waged between the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Northern Ireland government about whether the person should be appointed. The relatives of the judge could give their own evidence on that. At the end of the day, the Lord Chancellor said to me, "We cannot overcome all the objections that had been raised by the Northern Ireland government, who want to appoint this particular judge because he was a former Unionist MP. Do you know what we will do to find the easiest way out of this? We will appoint two judges".
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para10"></a>I put that case to Members of the Committee to illustrate the fact that there has always been political influence in Northern Ireland. As the noble Viscount said, the Policing Board had a tremendous row about the appointment of the new Chief Constable of Northern Ireland. The nationalists wanted a particular person whom the Unionists did not, and it finished up in an unmerciful row. It will be exactly the same if there is any political influence&#151;cross-community or otherwise&#151;in the appointment of senior judges in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20611-32_para11"></a>To the Minister, I pose again a question that has already been asked: what happens if the First Minister and his deputy cannot find agreement on a recommendation? Such appointments will be riddled with difficulties of all sorts if there is any political element in the appointment of members of the judiciary.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020611/text/20611-33.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand the noble Lord's concern about those matters. Of course, we are considering the difficulties that will arise if there is conflict between the two. We believe that the model outlined in the Bill will deal with the situation, and we must keep the issue in perspective. The Judicial Appointments Commission will have 13 members, including the Lord Chief Justice. It is only the five lay members&#151;a minority&#151;who will be appointed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and they must be appointed jointly.
<P>

<a name="20611-33_para0"></a>The way in which the commission has been structured creates the balance that should make sure that merit is put first and becomes the only criterion that will determine appointment. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the inclusion of the Lord Chief Justice as the chairperson of the commission will be a powerful instrument for independence and will ensure that the right importance is given to merit as the appropriate criterion for making that decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   The appointment of the Chief Constable was mentioned&#151;not, in the first place, by me&#151;and it has been emphasised by the Minister that the appointment of the judiciary will be <P>


<a name="column_CWH16"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by merit only. I can assure the Committee that the decision on the appointment of the new Chief Constable was based on merit only.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I cast no aspersions in relation to that matter. The only point that I sought to make was that the balance was different. Within that membership, there is an overwhelming independent element. We are not suggesting that the independent members are not independent but, as the noble Viscount said, it is perhaps easier to identify certain members of the community with a view, whether they hold it or not. The way in which this has been structured helps to mitigate any such concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   The independents are in the minority. There are 10 political appointments and nine independents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   What moves the Minister to think that, say, Mr Paisley and Mr Adams would have the same ideas about the merit of individuals as I or the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, or the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, or even the Minister herself might have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   That is an enticing thought for us to consider. There are some solutions for cases on which the First Minister and Deputy First Minister cannot agree. Clause 5(7) provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The First Minister and deputy First Minister must, on being informed by the Commission of the outcome of the reconsideration of its decision, appoint, or recommend for appointment, the person selected by the Commission after the reconsideration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-33_para1"></a>
So, although they can send it back, the second recommendation made by the commission must be accepted. I hope that that provides a means out of the conundrum that the noble Lord so delighted us by suggesting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   If I have understood the Minister correctly, she was arguing that the impartiality and fairness of the Judicial Appointments Commission will be guaranteed by its professional make-up, with those members from the legal profession. If that is the case and if that is what she meant, why bother having five or six lay persons at all?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It is all a question of balance. The decision will be made on the criterion of merit and merit alone, but it is right that those who come to make the decision should listen to all parts of the debate so that they can weigh it appropriately before coming to a well and properly informed decision, as opposed to one that may be seen to be influenced by prejudice or lack of balance. We think that the current balance of 13 members, five of whom are lay, is about right. It allows the commission to consider the issues that are important across the board, but it enables decisions to be based on the needs and qualities that will be of the utmost importance in appointing the right judicial officer for a post of this gravity.

<A NAME="20611-33_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Desai </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 2, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-33_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS: GENERAL PRINCIPLES
<br>
 Those responsible for making appointments under this Part shall as far as practicable ensure that the judiciary, as a group, are representative of the community in Northern Ireland."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-33_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment was in effect discussed when we debated the merits of the representativeness of these bodies. The principle of independence has been recognised, but the other important principle was the representativeness of this institution. Many of the institutions said that in consequence of the Belfast agreement this principle has been followed in the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Parades Commission and the Policing Board. It is important that we have representativeness in the Judicial Appointments Commission. Whatever else we may have a problem with, under-representation on the Judicial Appointments Commission would be very bad. I do not think that anybody can disagree with that. Although I recognise from the discussion that having a representative commission does not necessarily solve all political differences&#151;and I would be very surprised if the appointment of the chief of police was an uncontroversial decision in Northern Ireland in any case&#151;the important point is that communities are represented and have had their say and at the end of that we have a decision. Representativeness is an important principle and I therefore urge the Grand Committee to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   I hate to find myself in any sort of conflict with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, but I think that there is a problem with the amendment. The amendment itself has great merit, but Clause 5(8) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The selection of a person by the Commission to be appointed, or recommended for appointment, to an office . . . must be made solely on the basis of merit."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-33_para7"></a>
That seems to be in conflict with a requirement to take into account which community they represent. The new clause does not seem to be compatible with Clause 5(8).

<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. In other institutions, such as the Policing Board, where the same principle has been followed, no one has said that those who have been appointed are not people of merit. It will not appoint people who lack merit just because they are representative but, from the large pool of people of merit that we have available, we should look to the element of representation as an important principle.

<A NAME="20611-33_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   It is with some sadness that I find, in such debates, that I am never in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Desai. We can be good friends elsewhere, but we rarely seem to agree on Northern Ireland matters. Once again, I have to disagree with the noble Lord on his amendment.
<P>

<a name="20611-33_para8"></a>The business of being "representative of the community" has become such a loose, almost journalistic phrase that it would be inappropriate to incorporate it into a Bill as important and objective as this one must be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   While I have some sympathy with the concept behind the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. These are loose words. Let us take the example of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which is supposed to be representative of the entire community. Despite that, large sections of the community are left out.
<P>

<a name="20611-33_para9"></a>A further example, which I know well, is that there is no representative of the Unionist "No" community, no representative of the Evangelical community, and no representative of the Ulster-Scots community. This is an issue on which I, along with the human rights groups with which I am associated, am totally in synch with the Pat Finucane Centre in Londonderry. We have jointly made representations to the Northern Ireland Office to see whether we can achieve better representation. The phrase "representative of the community" means what anyone wants it to mean.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   I should like to speak to this amendment. While I am happy with the spirit behind it, there are difficulties with the word "representative". In Northern Ireland, if five people are together and the word "representative" is mentioned, there would be one from the DUP, one from Sinn Fein, one from the SDLP, one from the UUP and a person whose children go to an integrated school. If it is not, someone will say, "Our lot are not represented". That is the problem with the word "representative".
<P>

<a name="20611-33_para10"></a>If the word "reflective" rather than "representative" were to be used, that would be a far more acceptable amendment to the Bill. Perhaps what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, has suggested is this: if one stands back and considers that group of five people, do they look like a group who, by and large, are reflective of the community of Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-33_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, may perhaps have a point about the precise wording of this amendment. I am sure that Members of the Committee agree that appointments at this level should be made entirely on merit. Nevertheless, in the past there have been far too many instances of accused persons being brought before the court and then refusing to accept the jurisdiction of that court. That is probably what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is trying to counter. I believe that he seeks to make the judiciary <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I recognise the good intentions of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, but it is extremely difficult to incorporate this kind of language into the statute book.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para0"></a>In paragraph 6.87 of the report of the review, which I do not propose to quote, it is clear that while careful consideration was given to using the word "representative", the group actually preferred the word "reflective". However, in my view, it is not capable of meaning anything in practical terms&#151;in the real and practical interpretation that has been given to it in Northern Ireland&#151;other than that it is probably representative of the religious split. That is what is meant by the community. We have all tried to insist for years on referring to "the community". The reality is that there are two communities, and various sub-communities as well.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para1"></a>It is important that we do not give legislative encouragement to the notion that the principal division is always going to be by reference to religion. I cannot see any other criterion by reference to which representation of the community is going to be made in Ireland. How can it be made by reference to political allegiance? Judges are not expected to have any political allegiance. Certainly barristers or solicitors who are being considered for appointments to the Bench ought not to be considered by reference to their political allegiance, if any.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para2"></a>We should take advantage here of the consideration and advice given by the review body, and, while acknowledging that it would be very nice if nobody could ever say, "Well, of course, that chap who tried my case has nothing in common with me", the truth of the matter is that one will always get that. When people in the past refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the court, it had nothing to do with the religion of the judge or what part of the community he came from. There were other reasons for that, as we all know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Desai, for tabling the amendment, and for the comments that have been made by a number of noble Lords. In relation to the exercise of judicial office, it is right that we should all bear in mind that all judges represent the impartial rule of law as opposed to any particular community. The oath in Clause 19 that we are going to invite each of our judges to take makes it clear that they will do,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"right to all manner of people without fear of favour, affection or ill-will according to the laws and usages of this realm".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-34_para3"></a>
The idea of a statutory requirement to secure a reflective judiciary has been discussed in another place, where the notion was resisted because of the fears that appointing a judiciary with regard to reflectiveness could undermine the merit principle, which could lead to the undesirable criticism that judges were appointed to even up the numbers rather than on merit.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para4"></a>That is clearly not the intention of the review, which recommended that merit should remain paramount. Everyone present in the Committee today would agree with that sentiment.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para5"></a>It is also right for us to bear in mind the situation in Northern Ireland as it is today, not as it was 30 years ago. We all know that there is a very good pool of candidates from both communities and of both sexes who would be capable of being appointed to judicial office. Provided that people apply for these posts from both parts of the community, we are confident that the judiciary will reflect the wider community. We believe that strict application of the merit principle will ensure that that happens.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para6"></a>It is also right for us to emphasise that, whether we say "representative" or "reflective", this does not just cover the two religious communities in Northern Ireland; it also covers gender, ethnicity and community background, both when used in this context and elsewhere on the statute book.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para7"></a>Bearing in mind the sensitivity that exists around this issue, it would not be right to accept the amendment, even if it were amended to say "reflective", because it may then lead to the suggestion that we are inviting our judges to dispense justice in accordance with the precepts upon which their community is run. I know that no-one in this Committee would wish to do that. As we said, the judges have done a robust and brave job. To the best of my knowledge and belief&#151;I am sure that noble Lords will correct me if I am wrong&#151;all judges, irrespective of where they hail from, have, to date, dispensed justice in the cases that have come before them with the same degree of impartiality, regardless of whether they are Unionist or Catholic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   I thank everyone who has spoken. I see the dilemma: we do not want to think that the judges are, in some sense, delegates of the community. I did not suggest that they should be. I did not even set down what constituencies they would be representative of; I just suggested that they,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are representative of the community".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-34_para8"></a>
I recognise that there is a problem, and we must live with it. It seems that, by some mysterious process, those appointed will eventually be reflective&#151;or whatever word we use&#151;of the community without our putting down any stipulation to ensure it. No matter how good those people are, we shall have problems if the community does not consider that they reflect it. For the time being, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20611-34_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 10, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 11 and the others. The amendments concern the make-up of the appointments commission. The first two deal with the membership of the Judicial Appointments Commission and propose a re-balancing of the numbers. The others deal with the qualifications of the lay members.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para17"></a>I am rather loath to say what I am going to say, but I shall do so nonetheless. We are talking about the review as if it were the Bible, which it is not. The review did not recommend a precise figure for the membership of the commission. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In total the Commission might consist of around five judicial members, two from the professions and four or five lay members".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-34_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20611-34_para19"></a>My amendment would ensure that there was a majority on the commission of members of the judiciary. It seems to me, from the many discussions that I have had about the topic, that the appointments for which the commission is responsible are objectively judicial-legal. If we are to stay with the merit principle throughout&#151;I sincerely hope that we will&#151;we must have a majority of people on the appointments commission who are able to assess, balance and judge the merit of the various lawyers who will come before them for promotion and appointment.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para20"></a>It can be argued one way or another, but I am assured by my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden that a barrister is certainly not a member of the judiciary. If we examine the numbers, we will find that there are seven lay and six judiciary members, including the chairman. That balance is wrong, and there should be a clear majority of members of the judiciary on the appointments commission.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para21"></a>I propose to change the figures from five to six, in one case, and from five to four, in the lay case. That creates a clear balance. Our debate on the previous amendment is relevant. If we stand over the fact that these people will be independent human beings and will be there on merit, I believe that there would be a much better chance of maintaining the merit principle and of maintaining the exceptionally high standards of the judiciary in Northern Ireland, than if we were to allow the balance to drift. Whether it involved a 50:50 split or perhaps a barrister tying in with the Lord Chief Justice or the chairman to make a deal&#151;which is the way in Northern Ireland&#151;that potentially would lead us into difficulties of a serious order.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 relate to the qualification regarding the lay people. Here and throughout the Bill, the Minister will find that I have tabled amendments with only one clear objective; namely, that the judiciary, along with all those who have anything to do with the judiciary in Northern Ireland, should not only be seen, but be perceived to be totally whiter than white. At this point in our history we cannot have former terrorists, former con men, former criminals, former prisoners and the like involved in any part of our judicial system. That is the purpose of the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and, if it aids the speed of debate, to speak also to Amendment No. 19 standing in my name. The whole of Clause 3 provides for the Judicial Appointments Commission. There is widespread acceptance of a global shift towards the use of such commissions. One cannot oppose the concept of such a commission and I do not seek to do so. However, I am troubled by certain issues with respect to its make-up.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para23"></a>The use of lay members is questionable in itself, but at least the balance of the commission should favour more strongly the expert judicial members than any others. How could a lay member&#151;one who specifically should not have held and had never held a protected judicial office, who has never been trained as a barrister or a solicitor&#151;be competent to judge on the merits or otherwise of persons to be appointed? The only way I would be able to judge whether a judge was good or bad would be whether or not he found me guilty, should I be before him in a court.
<P>

<a name="20611-34_para24"></a>It must be remembered that lay members are to be restricted to those who have at no time qualified as lawyers or held judicial offices, excluding many academics and other professionals with a legal background. If we insist that lay members should be selected by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and if they are charged with making these appointments, perhaps I may suggest that appointing an even rather than an odd number would produce a better chance of agreement.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have already spoken to Amendment No. 14, as the Minister noticed rather sooner than I did. I did not intend to move Amendments Nos. 12 and 13.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   As noble Lords have rightly pointed out, Amendments Nos. 10 to 13 seek to restrict involvement in the new Judicial Appointments Commission. During the consultation exercise, the review struck a careful balance in its recommendation. Some argued that lay involvement went too far&#151;a view which may be reflected in our Committee&#151;while others felt that it did not go far enough. I believe that the provisions in the Bill are about right. One could almost assume that if no one is happy, then we must have got it right. Amendments Nos. 10 to 13 would amend the membership of the commission in favour of the judiciary and legal professions. They would increase the number of judicial members and decrease the lay membership, opening it to solicitors, barristers and former judges. We believe the review was right to identify the useful contribution that lay members could make to the appointment process. Noble Lords will be aware that a very similar process is well under way in Scotland. Lay members will bring a valuable perspective and alternative skills to this difficult process. I would be the last to suggest that lawyers lack omnificence, but I hear it rumoured elsewhere that this is in fact so. The lay involvement is important for public confidence. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw this amendment.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para0"></a>Similarly Amendment No. 18 would remove the lay magistrate representative of the Judicial Appointments Commission and replace this with a magistrate representative. I am not clear why that is preferable to the resident magistrate, as is already provided for.
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para1"></a>Amendment No. 19 would add a deputy county court judge to the judicial membership of the commission. That would go against the review, which recommended one judicial member from each tier of the judiciary and carefully balanced the number of legal representatives against the number of lay representatives. A deputy county court judge would come from the same tier as a full judge, so they should not be included.
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para2"></a>It may be helpful if I outline the way in which the total of 13 will be made up because I am not sure whether all Members of the Committee are aware of it. The Lord Chief Justice will be in the chair. There will also be one Lord Justice of Appeal, a High Court judge, a county court judge, a resident magistrate and a lay magistrate. Then there are five lay member representatives of the community, one barrister and one solicitor. We think we have the balance right. Looking at models that are being adopted across the board, not just in relation to judicial appointments, it is felt that those who do not come from that particular discipline but may be subject to the acts and omissions of that discipline should participate or have a contribution to make in the selection process, because it enriches the knowledge of those who come to make the selection. The five lay members may add something of real value. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-35_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I have a general point to raise under Clause 5(8), which runs through many of the clauses we have discussed. I would like clarification. This subsection appears to be unconditional and therefore, as I read it, does not permit any other subjective judgment such as reflectivity or representation. Let us consider the case of six candidates for three posts, three from party A and three from party B. The order of merit, as assessed by this clause, puts those from party A at positions one, two and three and those from party B at four, five and six. Is the Minister prepared to live with that situation if my interpretation of the clause is correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-35_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Merit would dictate that the best people should be appointed to the post. However, perhaps I should have drawn the Committee's attention to the Government's comments in the Criminal Justice Review Implementation Plan on recommendation 69, which deals with the judiciary being reflective of society. We said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government supports the principles of equal opportunity and outreach which seek to stimulate interest in judicial office from sectors that may have been historically under-represented, thus encouraging a greater number of applications from a broader range of candidates suitable for judicial office".

<P>

<a name="20611-35_para4"></a>The Judicial Appointments Commission in Northern Ireland, to be appointed in early 2002&#151;referring to recommendation 95&#151;will also have a monitoring role in this area and will be consulted as the systems and policies are developed further. The Government welcome the review's acknowledgement of the continued primacy of the merit principle.
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para5"></a>There will be an active engagement of all parts of the community to apply for these posts. Noble Lords will know that it is rare indeed for merit to be absolutely identical for each candidate. I shall say that there is an active recruitment policy across the board. As I said earlier in my remarks, there is today a pool of talented lawyers from both sides of the community available in Northern Ireland, which was not the case many years ago. It was said then that there was an imbalance in the talent available. We can reasonably anticipate that if there is an active recruitment policy across the board, and if one then applies the merit principle, it is difficult to see how the situation envisaged by the noble Viscount&#151;that of candidates from one group taking positions one, two or three&#151;could arise.
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para6"></a>There will be a monitoring role. However, noble Lords know that in relation to other parts of legislation, such as discrimination on the grounds of sex or race, by monitoring a system it is possible to see whether any systemic discrimination is in operation, to the disadvantage of one group or another. Of course we shall bear that in mind. However, we are confident that there is a sufficiently large pool of talented lawyers from which the selections can be made to ensure that the fear voiced by the noble Viscount is not grounded in fact, although I understand completely his concern.

There is a stipulation here because it does <P>

<A NAME="20611-35_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   In speaking to this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 38, which is preferable to the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has moved. There are cases of people who have been involved in violence and criminal activity redeeming themselves and making considerable contributions to the community and to the peace process. I agree that were they to continue in that violent vein, it would be inappropriate for them to be members of the commission, but past records must be expunged if there is evidence of subsequent redeeming conduct.
<P>

<a name="20611-35_para13"></a>My amendment requires people to make a commitment to peaceful and democratic processes, but it does not exclude those who may have previous convictions.

<A NAME="20611-35_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   It is entirely acceptable for people who have tried to expunge their past to serve the community again, and there are many ways in which they can. However, this is not an appropriate one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   I support the first amendment but not the second. We are talking about all sorts of crimes, not necessarily terrorist crimes. The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland&#151;of both the religious communities&#151;are law-abiding. The judiciary should support the law-abiding community.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   May I make a correction? I was speaking to Amendment No. 17, and not, of course, Amendment No. 38.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I am aware that there is a review going on of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. I apologise for not having given notice of my question, but I would like to ask the Minister to say something <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about how that review is going and how the Act might affect anything that would be done by the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   I hesitate to speak to the amendment. It is said outside the House that, once you become a Member, there is a danger of losing your memory. That must have affected me. I stand here as a convict. In 1969, I took part in a Civil Rights demonstration in Derry and, later on, in Newry. Those Civil Rights demonstrations were banned by the Northern Ireland Government. Anyone who took part in them was sentenced to a mandatory six months' imprisonment. I was part of it, so were John Hume and Seamus Mallon, and all the political figures who took part in the Civil Rights demonstrations. We did not go to gaol because there was an amnesty.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para0"></a>The proposed provision would disqualify me from being part of any of the political establishments in Northern Ireland. I was sentenced to six months, even if the sentence was later done away with by way of an amnesty. There are certain eminent people who have a past in that context but who, I am sure, are accepted as part of the peace process in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I point out to the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that my amendment says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in excess of six months".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-36_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20611-36_para2"></a>I support the thinking behind Amendment No. 17. I wonder whether it might not be a useful addendum to my amendment to ask the person selected to make a declaration to the effect of the principle set out in Amendment No. 17.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   It does not particularly matter whether the figure is in excess of six months&#151;that, as my noble friend says, has the merit of keeping Gerry Fitt on the side of justice and the angels, which is where he usually is, of course&#151;or whether the figure is less than that. It seems to me and to many others that it would be highly offensive if convicted terrorists, murderers, blackmailers, extortionists, bombers and the like were qualified to take up those offices and not to be disqualified from doing so. I speak for a very large number of people when I point out how grossly offensive it would be if people of that kind qualified under this legislation and if the Minister opposed the amendment that was moved by my noble friend. I would regard that as quite disgraceful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   If this is the correct procedure, I would like to speak to Amendment No. 38. It would have the same effect; that is, of excluding people from the commission and the committee who have criminal convictions.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para3"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and others, that this issue is a watershed. The Bill will either fall or stand in terms of its credibility in Northern Ireland. The importance of this issue cannot be over-emphasised. We have a heavy duty in this regard. We have a process that many people find unsatisfactory and most of us are working with it to the best of our ability. However, there is a stage at which the ordinary person in the street will not have any confidence in the <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Belfast agreement and all the other sundry items that have been introduced. I caution the Government in relation to this group of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   We have heard two powerful speeches that invite us to pay attention to what the ordinary person, if he exists&#151;the man in the street or however we describe them&#151;would think. It may be argued that there is no bar, with reference to criminal convictions, to being a Member of the legislature of Northern Ireland. However, there is a distinction to be made. Such persons, by definition, have had to be elected&#151;chosen&#151;in the full knowledge of their past. What are we speaking about here? Something very different&#151;the appointment by Ministers of the Crown to a body that will choose a commission that will choose the judges. That is a very different matter indeed.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para4"></a>I respectfully endorse what was first said by my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth and which was alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Laird; that is, that what we are after is confidence. When we were talking about the merits or demerits of the judiciary representing or reflecting the community, we were really talking about the judiciary having the confidence of the community. One cannot legislate for such confidence but one can legislate for certain criteria that will lead to confidence being enjoyed. Similarly, one can legislate for certain matters if one is misguided, which will ensure that confidence is withheld.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para5"></a>If we included in Clause 1&#151;perhaps along the lines of the amendment that we discussed at the start of our proceedings&#151;a statement that persons who have criminal convictions, notwithstanding the fact that they may extent to sentences of more than six months' imprisonment, shall none the less be entitled to be members of this commission, that would be a fairly unattractive beginning to the Bill. That is what one would hope the Government and anyone else with sense would have thought. However, if we resist the amendment of my noble friend, we should secure exactly that result. We should not lose sight of what everyday people think. We should not lose sight of the distinction between persons who, notwithstanding their record, are elected to a position in the legislature and those who are appointed on behalf of the Crown to choose the judges. My noble friend's amendment should be supported by the Government. I greatly hope that it will be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-36_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It is with the greatest concern that I say that I am not able to fulfil that expectation because the Government do not feel able to support these amendments.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 seek to prevent those with prison sentences of more than six months or those who have been members of proscribed organisations from becoming members of the Judicial Appointments Commission. It was important when the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said that in effect he would be disqualified. If the period had been for more than six months he <P>


<a name="column_CWH28"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would have been disqualified. A number of people may not be in quite as fortunate a position as he found himself.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para7"></a>Amendment No. 14 would impose a more stringent test for members of the commission than for MPs or MLAs. I of course hear what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said in relation to the distinction that should properly be drawn between those who are elected and those who are appointed. However, it is important to recognise that that difference in approach has been part of the experience of Northern Ireland, which has had to rehabilitate itself as a result of emerging from the troubled times that it has experienced.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para8"></a>Amendment No. 15 appears to apply not only to those convicted of membership but to anyone who has ever been a member of a proscribed organisation. It is not quite clear how that would be demonstrated.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para9"></a>Amendment No. 17 seeks to exclude any person who is not committed to non-violence and democratic means. Again, if I may respectfully say so, this is not entirely necessary. The matter boils down to a situation of trust. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the professional bodies and the Lord Chief Justice are going to take considerable care in making these important appointments. It is almost inconceivable that they are going to agree on disreputable candidates with criminal records because confidence is what Northern Ireland desperately needs. If any Members of the Committee have any doubts about that, they have only to look at the history. Everyone is fully aware that if this experiment&#151;I stress that it is an experiment&#151;is going to succeed, everyone is going to have to discharge their duty in relation to the choices that they make responsibly and robustly. Therefore, the issue boils down to whether we are going to trust the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, the Lord Chief Justice and others to make the choice and to do so judiciously.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para10"></a>The Government are prepared to trust the devolved institutions to act responsibly in relation to these important matters. The Government are confident that the devolved institutions will perform their duties diligently. If we were not so confident, we could not go down this path. I therefore urge the Committee to think carefully about what we are saying about the confidence, integrity and good judgment and about the ability of the devolved institutions and the arrangements that we are making. We either decide to trust them or we do not. I should also emphasise that, again, in relation to these issues, they will not be devolved unless and until we are confident that the institutions are sufficiently robust to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para11"></a>I anticipate that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, may regale us once more with the different personalities of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. However, we need to look to the future, it is hoped with a degree of confidence, and with a degree of trust. The Government are willing to do that.

<A NAME="20611-36_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I am grateful for the care with which the noble Baroness has responded. I see that the amendment dealing with membership of a proscribed organisation has difficulties that are all its own&#151; relating to proof of membership and so forth. That is why there have been so few prosecutions. We cannot get the evidence. Perhaps that point should be put to one side.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para12"></a>Can the Minister say a word about the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Glentoran at the conclusion of his speech; that is, at least for a declaration to be made by those who are selected stating that they are wholly committed to non-violent methods and so forth? The wording is already in place.
<P>

<a name="20611-36_para13"></a>That would chime with rather a successful requirement for participation in the all-party talks that took place a few years ago under the chairmanship of Senator Mitchell. All participants had to sign up by way of a declaration. That was very good for the purpose of instilling confidence in those outside in the bona fides of those taking part and in the propriety of their participation. That suggestion might meet many of the anxieties which have been expressed in various speeches in support of this group of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I should like to put a further question. She talked about the need to show trust, but throughout we have been showing trust at the expense of ordinary people who have not been able to convince us that sometimes that trust has been misplaced. What would be wrong about giving the First and Deputy First Ministers the security that would be afforded by including in the Bill an express statement to the effect that the people named under Amendment No. 14&#151;I do not refer to Amendment No. 15&#151;should be automatically excluded from consideration?
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para0"></a>If the noble Baroness believes that the First and Deputy First Ministers will secure and keep the trust of the people, they would never appoint people like that. Nevertheless, pressure will be brought to bear on them to do so&#151;very great pressure, as we all know. What would be wrong with safeguarding the position and sending a signal to the public that this issue has been thought about and provided against?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   All legislation concerning Northern Ireland is about taking it forward. We are trying to produce something that is acceptable but, at the same time, will ensure that it does not go off the rails through perception or anything else. By leaving in the possibility&#151;when the Minister states that she does not like the requirement to be committed to non-violence, that automatically accepts that it is possible for somebody who is committed to violence to be acceptable within the law&#151;if the occasion should arise, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has mentioned, with various personalities&#151;unmentionable or otherwise&#151;being split between the Deputy First Minister and the First Minister, then that, plus the perception as it could be seen by the public, is just what might push the Assembly apart.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para1"></a>If it is not an option at all, and because of the general feeling among nationalists and Unionists that they want to take it forward&#151;other than those who are at the moment actively involved in terrorist offences&#151;&#151;they will not question the fact that this provision has been put in. I say that from my experience of what goes on in Northern Ireland. It is simply not true that they would expect anything other than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I urge the Government to reflect on the emerging consensus around Amendment No. 17. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said&#151;and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, reinforced the point&#151;a declaration that embodied those sentiments would give some reassurance if the Government feel that they cannot accept the other amendments. I ask her to consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   This has been a very interesting and important debate and it would be wrong for me to say that the Government will not reflect on what has been said. We believe that it is very important to retain a degree of flexibility. Perhaps I should touch on Amendment No. 38, which I have not dealt with. It would disqualify anyone convicted of a criminal offence from being appointed a lay member of the commission. I understand the noble Lord's position on this issue, but such an amendment would remove the flexibility that is required to set aside relatively minor or outdated criminal convictions held by an otherwise excellent candidate.
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made a point about the rehabilitation of offenders. As those provisions currently operate, many who committed minor offences as juveniles now have the right to have those in effect expunged, so that they are treated once again as reputable and decent members of the community. One has to bear that in mind.
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para3"></a>We understand the anxieties that Members of the Committee have expressed, but we have to be realistic in our approach. Professional rules in the appointments procedures for the judiciary and the legal profession already debar people who have committed certain serious offences that have been mentioned in the debate from any appointment. The pool of people who can be appointed to judicial office is already automatically restricted, because a person has to hold a valid certificate.
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para4"></a>The position for the commission is different. I understand that noble Lords are concerned that some of the five lay members, who may not have that probity and integrity, may participate in the choice. There does have to be some flexibility and trust on those matters and the appointments that are made. Of course, we will think very carefully about what has been said in the debate, not least in relation to the issue of a declaration. However, as currently advised, our position is that the flexibility that we need is contained in the way in which we have currently phrased the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   I thought the noble Baroness understood that we understand that the Government want flexibility, but a number of us do not wish the <P>


<a name="column_CWH31"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government to have that flexibility, and for very good reason. It is no good the noble Baroness talking about people who in their youth have committed some minor offence&#151;I do not know what she has in mind; perhaps shoplifting in Woolworth's&#151;and then gone on to lead a blameless life. We are not talking about people who were shoplifting in Woolworth's; we are talking about people who were murdering, bombing and wounding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I certainly understand that that is the intent and the import of the amendments, but the current technical language includes many people who do not fall into the category that the noble Lord has just described, but would fall quite easily into the category of more minor and less serious offences. The amendment would cut them all out.
<P>

<a name="20611-37_para5"></a>Of course, we have listened to everything that has been said. We will reflect on it and we will return to the issue on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   Does the Minister agree that, for the reason that she gave&#151;namely that the persons who will put themselves forward for positions will have been well vetted and will have exemplary backgrounds&#151;it will, in fact, be demeaning and offensive to them to be judged on their merit by people who, we know, come from less than proper backgrounds?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   That is where the divide is. The Government would argue that, if we put trust in the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and those who will be entrusted with the devolved administration, it would be highly unlikely&#151;indeed incredible&#151;that they should choose persons with that type of history to fulfil the role. There is, of course, a division between us about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   With respect to the Minister, I must say that it is very much on the cards that either the Deputy First Minister or the First Minister will be a murderer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-37_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I will spare the Minister the responsibility of answering that point immediately by asking whether she would be kind enough to tell the Committee what conceivable objection there could be to requiring a lay person to make the declaration with which we have been dealing? In what respect could flexibility be diminished, were that to be a requirement? After all, the judges, in whose appointment such a person will play a part, must take the oath, which embraces what would be included in the declaration, by definition. If a judge is to be required&#151;at the expense of flexibility&#151;to take an oath to do justly and so forth and, by implication, to avoid injustice and violence, what is wrong with requiring a person who will play a part in his or her appointment merely to declare, when notified of the First Minister's intention to appoint them, that they are opposed to violence?

<a name="20611-37_para6"></a>The declaration is the key to the Government's thinking. We all understand the concept of flexibility, and, in our time, we have all taken refuge in it. What does it actually mean here that justifies declining to write into the Bill a requirement for a declaration?

<A NAME="20611-37_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We have had an interesting debate. The matter has arisen as a result of our discussion, and we will take it back.

I will consider the matter quietly, having gone through the issues and come back with a more cogent and well argued position.

It is not something that we should get excited about, given that the whole subsection and its meaning will be deleted after the Assembly election.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand that the premise of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on Amendment No. 22 is that there should not be lay members, and if there are lay members, they should not be appointed by the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister. The proposal is that there should be such lay members and an important part of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements is that they should be representative of the community. Therefore, it is important that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister should secure that the lay members are representative of the community.
<P>

<a name="20611-38_para5"></a>To do otherwise would run contrary to the review recommendation, which requires the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to secure such representativeness. The review even specified that this should be achieved through legislative provision. That is why we have incorporated it in this way. A representative lay membership on the commission is central to securing public confidence in its procedures. The amendment would undermine the recommendation of the review and the foundation of that public confidence. I invite noble Lords to think again.

<P>

<a name="20611-38_para13"></a>I do not need to repeat what I said earlier about the word "representative", which has certain connotations in Northern Ireland. I think that "reflective" would be a far better word. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-38_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We have canvassed this issue. The review drew a clear distinction between the judiciary, which it said should be reflective of the community, and the lay members of the JAC, which it said should be representative. In this context, the word "representative" has been used for numerous public bodies, including the Human Rights Commission and the Parades Commission. "Representative" does not mean that members will represent specific constituent parts of the community, but it means that an element there will represent each part.
<P>

<a name="20611-38_para14"></a>We say that it would be preferable to retain the current definition of "representative", because it provides clarity on what we are talking about. Changing the language may cause greater confusion.

<FONT SIZE=3>will have confidence. We cannot legislate for that and say that nobody should be appointed unless they have confidence. The Government are striving for a word.
<P>

<a name="20611-38_para15"></a>To distinguish between "representative" and "reflective" and say that one is more serviceable than the other does not hold water. If I hold up a mirror, I get a reflection. If I hold it in the right place, I get a reflection of the Minister, and very nice it is too, but it is an accurate reflection that permits of no flexibility or adjustment. "Representative" has the disadvantages that we have already discussed. If we are to rely on either of these words, will the Minister tell us what each of them is intended to mean and why one is better or worse than the other?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-38_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am inclined to say&#151;I speak entirely for myself at the moment&#151;that "reflective" and "representative" are absolutely interchangeable. The review separated the two out. It used "reflective" in relation to the judiciary probably because it would be anathema to suggest that judges would represent certain parts of the community. Because of the confusion in that regard, I judge that it is likely that it used "reflective" and is more comfortable in relating to "reflective" than to "representative".
<P>

<a name="20611-38_para16"></a>The reason why "representative" is preferred is because that word has been used elsewhere and become a term of art. If we now start introducing a different term, there is likely to be a semantic debate about when something is reflective or representative. In view of our earlier discussion, I understand why we were talking of the judiciary being reflective of a community&#151;that is a more sensitive word to use when describing where a judicial officer may come from but not what he will in fact do. We say that "representative" should remain because there is a degree of clarity about the way in which that word has been interpreted and we would like to avoid semantics if at all possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-38_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   Semantics is largely what Northern Ireland is all about! Moreover, "representative" across the Irish Sea means something rather different from what it means in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20611-38_para17"></a>I would like to speak to Amendments Nos. 26 and 27, which are similar although there is a slight difference. The amendment standing in my name adds "and ethnicity" whereas that standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, says "and religion". While we agree on the inclusion of "agenda" in this context, it is important to remind people&#151;not just those appointing the lay members&#151;that there is much more to Northern Irish society than religious groupings. It is all too easy to leave out significant sections of the population. While it is good that we and the Ulster Unionist Party agree that lay members should be reflected in terms of gender, we would not agree to the addition of the word "religion" because <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the whole point of the amendment we are putting forward is to demonstrate that there is more to Northern Irish society than religion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-38_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Lord rightly highlights the distinction between Amendments No. 26 and 27. The review recommended a provision similar to that used by the Human Rights Commission; that is what the Government have implemented in the Bill. The Government have always been clear that representativeness covered all of those issues, although there is a limit to how much can be achieved by a group of only five people. The comments that I made earlier about "representative" being an inclusive term relate directly to this amendment as well.

<P>

<a name="20611-39_para0"></a>The importance of having a lay element is to bring into the equation those who do not necessarily have an in-depth understanding of legal issues but who bring different perspectives. In the appointment procedures that are adopted in many other fields, many eminent people are invited to become lay members who do not have an expertise in that field but they are able to ask some fundamental questions, such as, "Why?". Those of us who have been subject to that piercing, "Why?" have often found it a salutary question to be asked. Therefore, we believe that lay members who do not have a particular expertise have a valuable contribution to make.

<P>

<a name="20611-39_para6"></a>Amendment No. 29 removes the discretion of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to terminate a judicial appointee's membership on the recommendation of the Lord Chief Justice. The issue is whether the Lord Chief Justice should make a recommendation to terminate or whether it would be inappropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para7"></a>This matter involves an issue that we shall discuss in more detail when we consider acting jointly. As the Bill is currently drafted, either the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister has a veto on removal even if the Lord Chief Justice recommends that removal action should be taken. That is plainly ludicrous.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para8"></a>Amendment No. 30 makes a similar change in respect of lay members. In particular, I am concerned with paragraph 2(4)(b), which is the criminal offence clause. As the Bill stands, either the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister may veto the removal of a person who has been convicted of a serious offence. I do not believe that that is what was intended.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para9"></a>Further, questions arise in relation to the provision in paragraph 2(4)(a) relating to a person "without reasonable excuse". If such a person has,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-39_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   As the noble Lord indicated, Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 seek to remove any discretion from the First and Deputy First Ministers in the case of dismissing lay or judicial members of the Judicial Appointments Commission.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para11"></a>With regard to judicial members, the Bill provides that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister may remove a member on the recommendation of the Lord Chief Justice. With regard to lay members, the Bill provides for a dismissal in certain cases. Government policy is clear. In these cases we would expect the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to act, but we need to trust them and not to tie their hands by compelling them to dismiss a member automatically.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para12"></a>There are a number of reasons for dismissal of lay members, which could differ in their seriousness. For instance, if a lay member had been convicted of a serious offence, no doubt everyone would agree that he <P>

However, being convicted of a minor driving offence&#151;for instance a defective headlamp&#151;would be unlikely to merit a removal from the commission. We should leave the First Minister and Deputy First Minister some discretion in such matters. I hope that explains why some limited flexibility is necessary in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-39_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   I support the amendments because retaining the current situation means accepting that perhaps the Lord Chief Justice will be the most extraordinary person who, as a chairman of a committee and holding the post he has, has not good reason for trying to run the commission, and he will only suggest that if the running of that commission is really unworkable. For the First Minister or Deputy First Minister not to support him would be plainly ludicrous and, should the Chief Justice put it forward, I think he must do it.

<P>

<a name="20611-39_para21"></a>Amendment No. 33 is aimed at curtailing the rather extensive powers to delegate by the commission. It seems extraordinary to me that sub-committees made up of non-members may in effect circumvent the appointments commission. What is the purpose of the commission if its members may be uninvolved in selection? Who would be involved in that selection? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I rise to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, and to speak to Amendment No. 34, tabled in my name. I am puzzled as to why the Government feel the need to give any delegation authority to the commission. It does not have a particularly big task; not that many judges and people are to be appointed. We have demonstrated our concern about the members of the commission in our debates this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para22"></a>If those debates, and whatever ultimately is legislated for in this Bill, can be thrown over by the Commission, by dint of the authority to delegate functions conferred on it by this Schedule, I wonder what the Government are doing. I had not given this matter sufficient thought ahead of our deliberations, but I am extremely concerned about the whole matter of delegation. I shall return to it on Report.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para23"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 34, I can see no logic at all in Clause 12 and I do not understand what it is doing in the Bill. Why is there a duty to have a lay member of a committee or sub-committee, but no parallel duty to have a judicial member, or someone who is eligible to be a member? Frankly, and with due respect to the department and the draftsman, I think that Clauses 11 and 12&#151;Clause 12 in particular&#151;are a nonsense. They should not be a part of the Bill because there is no need for them. I shall be interested in the Minister's explanation as to why Clause 12 is so worded and what it is intended to mean.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-39_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   As a matter of clarification, what do these sub-committees do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-39_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The provision to provide the sub-committees is permissive; it does not demand that such sub-committees should be set up. It is important to note that the system will not deal simply with a small number of judicial appointments. It will also deal with the appointment of tribunal and other chairmen; those are quasi-judicial tribunals. Therefore if we are seeking to construct a system which, in due course, will undertake the appointment of the whole of the judicial system below the level of High Court judge, then we have to build in a degree of flexibility to enable the commission, if it so chooses, to establish committees or sub-committees to deal with specific issues.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para24"></a>It also enables specialists in matters of employment, appointments or other specialist provisions, to be invited on to the Judicial Appointments Commission in order to help them by giving advice in relation to a specialist area. That will not necessarily be drawn upon, but it creates a capacity for them so to do. The <P>


<a name="column_CWH40"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill provides a permissive provision that the commission may establish committees or sub-committees which may include persons who are not members of the commission.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para25"></a>The Bill also states that where committees deal with appointments, they must include a member of the commission and, unless the person is a lay member, a person who is eligible to be a lay member as well. This latter amendment was made in the light of Members' views that it was appropriate for there to be a member of the commission on all committees dealing with appointments.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para26"></a>Amendment No. 32 appears to go considerably further in that it requires committees of the Judicial Appointments Commission to operate the same membership criteria as that of the full commission. In practice, however, the only persons who would be prevented from membership of committees would seem to be retired judges, barristers or solicitors. I am not sure why such lengths have been pursued to achieve that aim. Given that we have already sought to put in place an appropriate relationship between the full commission and its committees, I would invite noble Lords to consider that the amendments should be withdrawn because they are not necessary.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para27"></a>Perhaps I may turn to Amendment No. 33. The amendment would prevent the commission from delegating any of its functions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless approved by the majority of the judicial members of the Commission".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-39_para28"></a>
Other amendments sought to increase the judicial membership of the commission and, in this amendment, noble Lords are, perhaps, displaying a similar wariness about the role played by lay members. I do not want to go back to the review, but it is important to remember that the review went into some detail in striking the right balance between lay and judicial members of the commission and was clear about the benefit that lay people could bring to the appointments process. Those benefits apply across all the functions of the commission, and we are not convinced that lay members should play a lesser role in deciding what functions the commission should delegate. I ask that this amendment should also be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para29"></a>We are a little surprised that noble Lords should seek to remove paragraph 12 with Amendment No. 34. In Committee in another place, honourable Members expressed concern about the fact that sub-committees of the Judicial Appointments Commission could be made up entirely of persons who were not members of the commission. We sought to address that issue. The schedule was originally drafted without a requirement for commission members to sit on committees and sub-committees, as it was felt that that could be an unfair imposition on their time. We are now in a better position to assess the likely workload of the commission and accept that the degree of flexibility envisaged in the original drafting may not now be required. As a result, we took on board the view of the other place and amended paragraph 12 to make it clear that, when the commission delegated the power to select or recommend a person for appointment to a <P>


<a name="column_CWH41"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committee or sub-committee, such committees must always include a member of the commission, unless he or she is a lay member or a person eligible to be a lay member.
<P>

<a name="20611-39_para30"></a>In many selection processes, sub-committees do the first sift, and the full committee or commission makes the decision. We hope that there will be a large number of applications to the commission for the posts, that there will be a deal of competition and that it will not be just a narrow selection process. If that happens&#151;particularly as a result of the work that we hope that the commission will do on outreach to make sure that there is gender and community balance&#151;it may be that the working practices of the commission will demand that certain sifting and certain preliminary work is undertaken by committees, as opposed to the full commission sitting together. It was only for that reason that we felt it might be necessary. If we consider the appointment of tribunal chairpersons and all the more minor&#151;that is not meant to be derogatory&#151;judicial appointments, we can see that there will be a considerable body of work for the commission.

<A NAME="20611-40_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Of course, I hear what the noble Lord says about it being odd, but we respectfully suggest that it would be rather odd if MPs were to sit. The amendment would allow members of the Judicial Appointments Commission to sit as MPs, which is unprecedented for lay members of public bodies. Furthermore, of all the areas to bring into politics, the judicial appointments process looks one of the least likely. Of course, we appreciate the view articulated in another place that once we devolve justice matters to Stormont, there is no conflict of interest for Westminster MPs, but we must respectfully say that we do not agree.

<a name="20611-40_para4"></a>The review states specifically that there is a greater need than ever to insulate the appointments process from any possible suspicion of political influence. Creating an independent Judicial Appointments Commission is one way of doing that. The amendment would remove the independence that the review sought to create, leading to all sorts of potential forms of political mischief and questionable appointments. I am sad to disagree with the noble Lord on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-40_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20611-40_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I will speak to Amendments Nos. 40, 41, 44, 45, 46 and 47. These amendments come to the nub of the unease that we feel about aspects of the Bill. This whole aspect of Clause 4 is concerned with the appointment of the most senior judicial officers, including the judges of the High Court, which we debated at length earlier. The amendments would remove the role for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the appointments procedure either as consultees or as persons making recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para10"></a>As has been mentioned several times this evening, there is a real concern in Northern Ireland about the politicisation of the judicial appointments process. It seems excessive and unnecessary for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to make a recommendation to the Prime Minister. What real advice could those politicians provide to the Prime Minister on appointing the Lord Chief Justice or Lord Justice of Appeal, other than their perceived political opinion or religious background? Given the numerous legal challenges to decisions made in the light of the agreement already, including the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the process of selection poses obvious problems.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para11"></a>The review said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the Northern Ireland context it is important to keep any hint of political input out of the appointments process."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-40_para12"></a>
Devolution does not necessitate the devolution of the judicial appointments process. One does not follow the other. Devolution relates to the legislature, the Executive and the Government, which is quite a separate branch of the state.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para13"></a>Again I refer to subsection (5), which provides that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister must act jointly in making their recommendations. That provides either of those two MLAs with a power of veto over any individual appointment.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para14"></a>The Belfast agreement itself does not indicate or dictate that all decisions that are to be made by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister must be joint ones. Such language crept in and was the creation of the draftsmen of the Northern Ireland Act.

<a name="20611-40_para15"></a>Our proposition involves opposition to the devolution of judicial appointment functions, as distinct from the functions of criminal justice to which we look forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-40_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that Members of the Committee are content with taking this rather large group of amendments together; I thank them for so doing. Overall, the effect seems to be turn over the roles of the First Minister and the Deputy First Ministers in the process of appointing judges to the Lord Chancellor. In the Bill, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister have the role recommended for them in the review, which recognised the importance of a carefully managed degree of political accountability. The importance of the role was discussed at length in another place. In the devolved scenario, the Government feel that we must give the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Belfast the same trust that we extend to the Lord Chancellor in Westminster.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para16"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee agree that devolving justice matters, including judicial appointments, to the Northern Ireland Assembly would be a positive and welcome development, which would help to underpin the stability of that institution.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para17"></a>Amendment No. 41 seeks to remove the duty to consult the Lord Chief Justice in making senior judicial appointments. If I may respectfully say so, that seems odd. As the senior judicial figure in Northern Ireland, the Lord Chief Justice is bound to have a valuable insight into the candidates. It would surely be unheard of for him not to be consulted. We seek to be transparent about his role by placing it in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para18"></a>We invite the noble Lord to consider withdrawing the amendment because it will do violence to the import of what we seek to do in terms of devolving appropriate responsibilities to the First Minister and First Deputy Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   A few weeks ago, when I started working on this matter, I went through the same process as did the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, and his Ulster Unionist colleagues, and I considered tabling similar amendments. However, I later came to the conclusion that if we were to devolve, we had to do so. I scratched out those amendments and never tabled them.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para19"></a>I am afraid that I am now going to be party political. The fact that the amendments have been tabled by the Ulster Unionist Party and the fact that a considerable number of those amendments are of significant import, shows the confidence&#151;or lack of confidence&#151;in the Government's handling of the Northern Ireland situation and the peace agreement. Steadily over the past few years, the Government have lost the confidence of the Unionist party. I hope and believe that they realise that and I hope that they will attempt to find ways of recovering it&#151;perhaps they have been doing so during the past few months. I hope <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, and his colleagues will forgive me, but this is a clear demonstration of where we are in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-40_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that there is an important distinction between the appointing Minister in the present situation&#151;the Lord Chancellor&#151;and the appointing Ministers under what is proposed by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para20"></a>The Lord Chancellor wears three hats as we know. In his capacity as minister for justice, he is required to separate himself entirely from partisan considerations. By reason of his background&#151;not to mention the momentum of many centuries of precedent&#151;he has the training to do that. It is asking a great deal more of politicians, who will become the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, to take that on. That is why I understand what lies behind these amendments and why I hope that the Minister will express some sympathy with them, particularly in light of the significance that is attached in the review to the overriding importance of avoiding any imputation of political taint or bias in this procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para21"></a>If one has experience of the Northern Ireland scene, it is all too easy to foresee that some quarters in Northern Ireland will perceive it to be an impossible task for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to be able to achieve that separation from partisan concerns. That is what lies behind the proposal, with which I have a good deal of sympathy. I have just enough enthusiasm for demonstrating confidence in the whole process to go along with what is proposed in this regard but I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that there is an important distinction to be made between the two sets of Ministers. That is what gives rise to the anxiety that lies behind the amendments.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-40_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that we recognise those sensitivities and the anxiety. It would be easy to say that the Lord Chancellor should simply retain the responsibility that he currently has and that there should be no change. One sees the temptation in that argument.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para22"></a>We face a challenging choice about whether or not to put confidence in the devolution process. We have to resist an understandable temptation to take a path that would not enable the process to be successful; I know that all Members of the Committee desire that very much.
<P>

<a name="20611-40_para23"></a>Therefore, the position that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will be put in is significantly different from that which the Lord Chancellor enjoys in relation to England and Wales. It is for that reason that we believe that it is important that the role of the Lord Chief Justice should be transparent, open and clearly stated, and that the commission should play a role in the appointment process. Members of the Committee will know that that is a clear difference between what is proposed for Northern Ireland and what is proposed to be retained in England and Wales.

Appropriate safeguards are provided elsewhere by the commission and the Lord Chief Justice. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20611-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I very well remember the period when the legislature was broadly under the remit and influence of Stormont. I was serving at that time as a magistrate. There was a general perception on both sides of the community that the judiciary at all levels was somehow or other manipulated by the Unionist government. We did our best to point out that that was not really the case, but it was difficult entirely to refute the allegation that, even at my humble level, I was not somehow or other under pressure. It may horrify some of my former colleagues if I say that there was a degree of subtle pressure, which I resisted all along. I simply said, "I am sorry. I am not responsible to you. I was appointed by the Lord Chancellor". That made me unpopular.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para0"></a>The problem was that, rightly or wrongly, there built up a kind of perception, belief or understanding&#151;or misunderstanding&#151;that the operation of the judiciary was under the control of the then Stormont Government. It was one of the main causes of the downfall of Stormont. I would not want to see that happen again. I was taught a lesson in that period and would not willingly advocate or support the return of judicial functions to any Northern Ireland politician, whether at Stormont or Westminster.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   What is desirable about the proposition is that two people&#151;the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister&#151;whom no one expects to agree must take part in the procedure. That is the double-lock system that satisfies me, at least, that it may be a bipartisan process, rather than simply a partisan process.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para1"></a>Someone said earlier that Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams would never agree on anything. What if they did? This way, we can be sure that, if politics plays a part in the procedure, it will do so across party lines. The fear is that a single party will dominate, rather than that there will be agreement across parties. That is why there is something to be said for the double-lock of involving the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   In speaking to the amendment, I must say that it is clear that the process in Northern Ireland is fragile. One is either an optimist or a pessimist. If the process is to carry on, one must be an optimist&#151;almost against the odds. Therefore, I agree with what was said by the noble Lords, Lord Desai and Lord Glentoran, by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden&#151;who is aware of the sensitivities&#151;and by the Minister.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20611-41_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment goes the other way. Basically, it makes sure of things, like a belt and suspenders. Although it is true that the Judicial Appointments Commission will recommend to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the amendment asks for a separate and independent role for the Judicial Appointments Commission to be consulted by the Prime Minister. Basically, this is another cautionary provision to be added to the process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-41_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   As my noble friend Lord Desai has said, Amendment No. 42 seeks to place a duty on the Prime Minister when making recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the office of Lord Chief Justice or Lord Justice of Appeal to consult with the Judicial Appointments Commission, in addition to the First and Deputy First Ministers and Lord Chief Justice. Earlier in Committee we covered in detail the reasons why there should be a distinction between those appointments made up to the level of the High Court and those made above.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para7"></a>The review made it clear that the commission's direct involvement in appointments should cease at the level of High Court judge. The review further recommended that it would be appropriate to retain a role for Westminster in the appointment of the most senior judicial officers. The Government agreed with the rationale proposed by the review, as well as with the proposal. The Bill adheres faithfully to those recommendations.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para8"></a>As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, the arrangements also reflect the procedures for such appointments in the devolved administration in Scotland. However, the Bill does provide a role for the Judicial Appointments Commission. It will be consulted on the procedures to be adopted when making recommendations at the most senior level. We are satisfied that this will ensure that best practice on appointment procedures at this judicial level will be observed, while making sure that we are implementing the review recommendation in full. I hope that that explanation will satisfy my noble friend that we have addressed this issue.

<a name="20611-41_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20611-41_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 43, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 48 and 49. Amendments Nos. 43 and 49 come together under a general, collective description; we feel that the provisions are all too cumbersome. These amendments would strike out new Section 12(4) and (5) of the 1978 Act so as to remove the duty on the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to determine the procedure&#151;as yet unknown&#151;that they are to adopt for the consultation process.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para12"></a>The appointment will be made by the Queen. We believe that it is far too prescriptive to place a duty on the Prime Minister to consult and then to tell the Judicial Appointments Commission to advise the consultees on the procedure to adopt. That is extremely prescriptive and cumbersome and we feel that there is room for considerable improvement. This is a probing amendment and seeks to make suggestions.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para13"></a>Amendment No. 48&#151;tabled on the assumption that the clause is not removed by the Government, but may be improved to a considerable extent&#151;seeks to involve the government of Northern Ireland; namely,

<A NAME="20611-41_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The review specifically recommended that the commission should be involved in the procedure, which is in line with international best practice. The Bill as drafted accurately reflects the role described by the review. It is consistent with what should be expected. Amendment No. 48 proposes that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister should clear the procedures for making senior judicial appointments with the Assembly. Given that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are the head of the Northern Ireland Executive and represent the major parties in the Assembly, this would be an unnecessary procedure. It would be unusual in Westminster terms <P>

<a name="20611-41_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 58 to 65. Clause 5 makes provision for the appointment of the listed judicial officers by virtue of the Judicial Appointments Commission making recommendations to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Schedule 3 is concerned with the transfer of functions in respect of these appointments from the Lord Chancellor to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. As I have said before, that does not have to take place as part of the process of devolution or the devolution of the criminal justice functions.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para21"></a>The judicial appointments functions are and should remain quite separate. Further to that, there is the consequence of the perceived politicisation of the appointments process. I submit that Clause 5 is flawed. The point at which the selection process for listed judicial officers is initiated is governed by Clause 5(3), by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly in serving notice on the commission to select a person for a vacancy. It is not inconceivable that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will in future exercise a de facto veto over the process. Think for a moment of the consequences of Northern Ireland being short of one or even two High Court judges and no appointment or appointments being made.
<P>

<a name="20611-41_para22"></a>When this matter was debated in another place, the Government said that they were not planning for failure in relation to this obvious potential problem. Frankly, that is an inadequate response. I beg to move.

 "CRITERIA FOR JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT

<A NAME="20611-42_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The Government do not take issue with the criteria specified.

<P>

<a name="20611-42_para6"></a>However, the review did not recommend that these criteria should be made statutory, presumably for the good reason that such matters are normally dealt with administratively. We believe that they should continue to be dealt with in that way. Including these criteria in statute would remove the element of flexibility which is essential to the successful operation of any appointments procedure.
<P>

<a name="20611-42_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a purely technical and consequential amendment. The report of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee accepted that 16 powers to amend the Bill or other legislation were appropriate. The Committee, however, recommended four changes in favour of the affirmative procedure. As always, I am grateful for the sterling work which is carried out by the committee. It has almost become the norm that we pay careful attention to its recommendations.

<a name="20611-42_para12"></a>Government Amendment No. 250&#151;as it will become&#151;to Clause 89 will bring about the changes that were recommended. This means the introduction of a new Clause 89.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 28, after "office" insert "for a maximum of three months"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-42_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20611-42_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment concerns the potential happenings should the Lord Chief Justice be suspended. As I understand the Bill, if the tribunal recommends that the Lord Chief Justice should be suspended, he could be suspended and parked for the rest of his life without anything further happening. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that, were a tribunal to recommend the suspension of the Lord Chief Justice, somebody would have to do something about it within three months. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-42_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Clause 6 provides for the removal of judges from the most senior judicial offices. Amendment No. 73 would place a time limit of three months on the suspension of the Lord Chief Justice while the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor consider making motions for the presentation of an address to Her Majesty for his removal.
<P>

<a name="20611-42_para20"></a>We expect action under this clause to be extremely rare. If it were ever taken, we hope it would be over quickly, but we cannot know for sure how much time a tribunal might take to report. For this reason, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-42_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I support the amendment. Of course, it is virtually inconceivable that the provision will ever be acted upon, but if it is, everybody concerned will jolly well have to get on with it. It is essential that confidence be restored to the administration in those circumstances. In my view, which I respectfully urge on my colleagues, three months is a reasonable limit to impose and to ensure that people do not put this in some pigeonhole totally inappropriately in such desperate circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-42_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Of course I hear what the noble and learned Lord says, but one can think of many scenarios that would involve adherence to the human rights provisions which would enable one to say that a longer period may be necessary. For example, if the judge were accused of a most heinous offence, such as paedophilia, it may be of the utmost importance that he or she be removed swiftly, but the investigation of those issues may well require longer than three months.
<P>

<a name="20611-42_para21"></a>We know that if such circumstances arose, time and speed would be of the essence, but it would be wholly impossible to prescribe that all that should be done in order to meet the obligations under the Human Rights Act could be done within that timetable. Of course it should be done as speedily as reasonably practicable. I fully understand the importance of a decision being made. In the old-fashioned way, many people facing that situation would simply resign without prejudice, and we would not be left in the situation of having to impose time limits. However, it would be foolish in the <P>


<a name="column_CWH52"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extreme to prescribe in the Bill a time limit for suspension to which we could not adhere without transgressing other pieces of legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-42_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I may find that, not for the first time or the last, I have completely misunderstood the point. Surely, a tribunal that has recommended that a motion be presented will not have made that recommendation without having carried out the most scrupulous investigation to secure it. Is that not the case?
<P>

<a name="20611-42_time0"></a><H5>7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-42_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   As I understand the provision, it enables there to be a suspension. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor are considering the making of motions for the presentation of an address to Her Majesty in relation to the Lord Chief Justice, the Prime Minister may suspend him from office; and if they are considering the making of such motions in relation to a Lord Justice of Appeal or a judge of the High Court the Prime Minister may suspend him from office with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-42_para22"></a>
The Prime Minister has that ability before hearing the recommendations from the tribunal. The case may relate to bribery and corruption in public office: there is a plethora of possibilities. There are two possible situations. The Prime Minister may wish to suspend, pending receipt of the recommendation. We do not know whether the recommendation will come back within or without a three-month or other period, and it is for that reason that no time has been specified.
<P>

<a name="20611-42_para23"></a>Members of the Committee are absolutely right in saying that the need for speed is clear. However, one would have to exercise that discretion in accordance with the law as currently enunciated and take into account the Human Rights Act 1998 and other provisions that may have an impact upon such matters. One knows the consequences of acting to the detriment of an individual who may be accused of the most heinous act. It is right to say that, bearing in mind the unusual nature of the court, it is likely to be only the most dire sort of issues that would cause us to activate the provisions in any event.

<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I thank the Minister, but I am not satisfied. I do not say that three months is the right prescription in any way, but the Minister made the point herself when she read the clause. It starts with the words "If the Prime Minister". While many other things are happening, the Prime Minister may suspend the Lord Chief Justice. Nobody in our constitutional system can put any pressure on the government of the day to take further action if they choose not to for various reasons. It is not beyond the wit of man to insert some form of phraseology that allows the government of the day to be called to account for their actions, even if it is only to oblige them to come to the House, explain what they are doing and satisfy the system.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para0"></a>Clause 8 as it stands, with no pressure on anybody other than that in the Human Rights Act&#151;goodness knows what might happen to that in years to come&#151;is not good legislation and will not give confidence.

<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Privy Seal, who is working with her, to give the matter further consideration and see whether some redrafting can achieve what we are trying to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We shall certainly take the matter back and consider it. I would of course pray in aid the fact that, as sub-paragraph (8) makes clear, the Prime Minister has the power to suspend from office with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice. There are already provisions in the Bill for that but we will certainly take the matter away and consider whether there is anything further that we can do to allay the concerns of noble Lords. However, I issue a caution in that regard because of the extreme difficulty that we may find in prescribing precise time limits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-43_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 78 to 81.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para8"></a>Clause 7 is concerned with the removal of persons from listed judicial offices. As the Bill is currently drafted, that includes the downgraded office of judge of the High Court. The power to remove or suspend, however, is retained by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, who again act jointly with the approval of the Lord Chief Justice. That provides a measure of protection but it does not protect from the scenario in which the Lord Chief Justice believes a person should be removed. The tribunal, under Clause 8, recommends removal if either the First Minister or Deputy First Minister desires removal. The holder of the office of either the First Minister or Deputy First Minister again has a de facto veto on removal.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para9"></a>The amendments place the power in the hands of the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of the tribunal, but without parliamentary oversight. That reflects the different status of the listed judicial offices. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Amendments Nos. 77 and 79 place the power to remove or suspend a person from a listed judicial office in the hands of the Lord Chief Justice, rather than those of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I understand that that amendment is very much in line with the general thrust of the amendments that have been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan. However, the Bill currently provides for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to perform that function only on the basis of a recommendation from a judicial tribunal and with the agreement&#151;I stress "with the agreement"&#151;of the Lord Chief Justice. That role reflects the position held by the First Minister in Scotland.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para10"></a>We expect action under the clause to be a rare event. The process of removal from judicial office is very much linked to the process of appointment. The review recommended a role for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in appointments to provide political accountability, as we said earlier this afternoon. The same holds true for the removal procedure. Amendments Nos. 77 and 79 merely achieve the removal of the element of political accountability that was advocated by the review. Members of the Committee should be reassured that the Bill also provides the safeguard that any removal&#151;I stress that&#151;can take place only on the recommendation of the tribunal and with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice. We therefore have a safety net in relation to removal.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para11"></a>None the less, we consider it appropriate that the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice, in his capacity as head of the judiciary in Northern Ireland, to the removal of the holder of a listed judicial office, should be sought. We are content that the provisions, as drafted, achieve an appropriate balance. We therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-43_para16"></a><P>

<a name="20611-43_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 84 and 85. Clause 8 deals with tribunals for removal from judicial offices. There are two types of tribunal in terms of composition, the distinction being made below the level of judge of the High Court. It seems somewhat perverse to place High Court judges within listed judicial offices in Clause 7 rather than Clause 8, yet within Clause 8(4) rather than Clause 8(5). Our amendments are consistent with removing the veto of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para18"></a>As the Bill stands, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister must act jointly in convening a tribunal for removing the Lord Chief Justice. Again it is only this office who may convene a tribunal and at no point are they obliged to do so, thus again enabling either the First Minister or Deputy First Minister to stifle the removal process at the outset. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 83, which would simply add, "with the agreement of the Prime Minister" to Clause 8(1). The tribunal to consider the removal of the Lord Chief Justice may be <P>


<a name="column_CWH55"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>convened by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. As I understand it, the Prime Minister has considerable input into the appointment of the Lord Chief Justice. It seems to me that he or she should be kept in the loop for the firing of the same Lord Chief Justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   It may be helpful if I include my Amendments Nos. 87 to 90, which are on the same clause, because in a sense my worry is exactly the opposite of that of other noble Lords. The committee on the administration of justice drew my attention to the issue. In setting up the tribunal, there is a great dominance of the judicial element, judging itself, more or less. I would like a greater lay element. I am going in the opposite direction to other noble Lords. I want to make sure that these tribunals do not seem like a closed shop judging itself. There should be a greater element of ordinary solicitors and barristers or more of a lay element in deciding these matters. It may be helpful for the Committee to consider all of these amendments together.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   There may be some misunderstanding as to how the system would operate, so I shall go through my understanding of what the amendments would do and how I think it plays in. It may be important for us to take some of this slowly. Amendment No. 82 would remove the power of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to convene a tribunal to consider the removal of the Lord Chief Justice and would place that power in the hands of the Lord Chancellor. Amendments Nos. 83 and 86 would alter the procedures for the removal of judges. Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 would remove the role of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in convening tribunals to consider the removal of any other judicial post holder.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   Amendment No. 83 refers to page 6, line 19, which is about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A tribunal to consider the removal of the Lord Chief Justice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-43_para19"></a>
The noble Baroness said "judges".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-43_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Amendments Nos. 83 and 86 would alter the removal of judges. I understand, therefore, that the noble Lord seeks simply to relate this to the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para20"></a>If we look at how the system will work, as we understand it, the review recommends that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The removal from office of a judge or lay magistrate should only be possible on the basis of a finding of a judicial tribunal constituted under statutory authority and convened by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister or the Lord Chief Justice, that a magistrate or judge was unfit for office by reason of incapacity or misbehaviour".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-43_para21"></a>
That is to be found in paragraph 6.136.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para22"></a>By removing the role envisaged for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister from this process, these amendments are directly contrary to the review. They also remove the local political accountability which the review was careful to inject into both the appointment and the removal process.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH56"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para23"></a>From other amendments tabled to Clauses 4 and 5, both in this Committee and by others in another place, it is clear that noble Lords are wary of the role to be played by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the appointment and removal process. Perhaps noble Lords would prefer these powers to remain in the hands of the Lord Chancellor at Westminster with an equal role for the Lord Chief Justice as a nod to devolution. All the comments that I made earlier about trust and truly taking on board that we are moving forward apply equally here. I have to say that, if we were to move along this line, it would be a backward step.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para24"></a>More important, Amendment No. 83, taken with Clause 8(3), requires the Prime Minister to give his agreement and to be consulted before a tribunal can be convened to consider the removal of the Lord Chief Justice. In addition to that, although the First Minister and Deputy First Minister can convene a tribunal to consider the removal of the Lord Chief Justice in this clause, Clause 6 makes it clear that they cannot in fact remove a Lord Chief Justice on the basis of this tribunal. Only the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor can do that under Clause 6 by making a Motion for the presentation of an Address to Her Majesty. Therefore, what the noble Lord seeks is already in place in Clause 6.
<P>

<a name="20611-43_para25"></a>I hope that that reassures the noble Lord. While it is sensible for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to consult the Prime Minister when considering convening a tribunal to remove a senior judge in Northern Ireland, it is unnecessary to require his approval at this stage as well as when a Motion is made, because one would be double-banking it, to use the colloquial expression. As I pointed out earlier, we must have a little faith in the new institution and give every opportunity for devolution to work. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20611-44_para7"></a>The three amendments aim to address the weak provisions on eligibility. As the Bill stands, the Lord Chancellor may, by virtue of subsection (4), relegate eligibility.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para8"></a>Amendment No. 93 seeks to remove subsection (5)(d), which suggests that an order may list prescribed offences whereby a person, if convicted, may be ineligible. "Prescribed" in that context, however, by subsection (6) means, "prescribed in the order". That permits an exclusory role for persons convicted of theft but the inclusion of those convicted of terrorist offences.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 would replace that provision with a strict prohibition of persons convicted of criminal offences and dictates that persons convicted whilst lay magistrates must be removed. Just as we do not wish to have criminals involved in judicial appointments, we similarly do not wish criminals to be appointed lay magistrates&#151;such persons will have an important role dealing with youth justice and reprimanding offending juveniles. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-44_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   These important amendments deal with the issue of qualification for lay magistrates. Amendment No. 93 seeks to remove from the list of disqualification provision for lay magistrates&#151;which can be waived by the Lord Chancellor&#151;the subsection which states that candidates who have been convicted of a prescribed offence are disqualified.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para10"></a>The review recommended that the criminal justice functions of justices of the peace should be undertaken by a new office of lay magistrate. The Bill accordingly sets out the likely qualification requirements for that post.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para11"></a>Amendment No. 94 seeks to remove the Lord Chancellor's discretion in applying those qualifications. The Lord Chancellor has that discretion in making justice of the peace appointments in England and Wales. If the amendment were agreed to, the Lord Chancellor would not, for example, be able to appoint candidates who depart even in the smallest way from the eligibility criteria. That would exclude a candidate, for example, who lived just five miles beyond the prescribed distance. The Government believe that such flexibility is essential and we therefore hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para12"></a>Amendment No. 95 seeks to reinstate the prescribed offence disqualification provision, but it inserts it in a new subsection without the caveat that it may be waived by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para13"></a>Amendment No. 96 requires the Lord Chancellor to remove a lay magistrate if he is convicted of a criminal offence. The effect of the provisions would be to remove any discretion the Lord Chancellor had to set aside convictions for certain prescribed offences and to decide to appoint such an individual as a lay magistrate anyway.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para14"></a>I understand where the noble Lord is coming from in relation to the amendments. However, we do not think that the Bill is wrong. We think that the right <P>


<a name="column_CWH58"></a>

<B>11 Jun 2002 : Column CWH58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>balance has been struck. Lay magistrates play a relatively modest, if important, role in the justice system and it would be regrettable if there were no flexibility to set aside relatively minor criminal convictions if the case for appointing an individual were otherwise overwhelming.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para15"></a>The Leader of the Opposition in the other place noted that just because a person has a past, it does not mean that he cannot play a role in the future. We support that sentiment and disagree with the amendments, which seek to remove that possibility. Members of the Committee said earlier that redemption should not be ruled out. I respectfully agree with that sentiment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I was interested to hear what the Minister said. It is strange that we have a seriously thought-out prescription&#151;paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection 5 are seriously prescriptive&#151;but that they can be made as nothing by the Lord Chancellor. The Bill is a serious mixture of over-prescription and under-prescription.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-44_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We would say that this would be appropriate prescription where the need arose. The functions, which are currently discharged by the Lord Chancellor, would, after devolution, be exercised by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, as provided for by Schedule 3, paragraphs 40 to 42. That discretion has been judiciously used in the past, and we anticipate that it would be judiciously used in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-44_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   Before we return to the matter, would the Minister consider a slight variation of the amendment with which we are dealing? The purpose of this section of the Bill is to secure public confidence in the justice system. I agree with the Minister's description of the role of lay magistrates as modest but important, and it is plain that there is an important need for subsections 5(a) to (d).
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para16"></a>The problem about the reference to "a prescribed offence" in paragraph (d), in which "prescribed" means prescribed in the order, is that it is difficult to draw up a satisfactory list of offences and to prescribe them in an order about which one can be confident that it is sufficiently comprehensive but not too comprehensive.
<P>

<a name="20611-44_para17"></a>Would it not be better if paragraph (d) were to read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if he has been convicted of a criminal offence"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-44_para18"></a>
We should then leave the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless the Lord Chancellor otherwise determines in the case of a particular person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-44_para19"></a>
to provide the necessary flexibility". There is an infinite variety of culpabilities in criminal offences, and I know that the Minister recognises that. One may have an offence on the prescribed list that is not particularly culpable and something which is outside the prescribed list which is culpable to a degree warranting exclusion from appointment.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20611-44_para20"></a>If the Minister sees merit in what I suggest, perhaps she will think about it and adopt the first part of the amendment, relying upon the flexibility conferred by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"unless the Lord Chancellor otherwise determines in the case of a particular person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20611-44_para21"></a>
Perhaps the Minister will think there is some merit in that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611-44_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We will certainly consider that. I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, for that suggestion. I would say, in addition, that if someone has committed an offence that is not on the prescribed list, <P>

<A NAME="20611w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the legal status of the European Union flag; and whether in order to fly it on public or other buildings it is necessary to have a local authority licence or other authority.[HL4326]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  The flying of the EU flag in the UK is controlled under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992 and for this purpose the flag is classified as an "outdoor advertisement".
<P>

<a name="20611w01_para0"></a>Government buildings benefit from Crown immunity. In order to fly the EU flag from other buildings the express consent of the local planning authority is required.

<P>
<UL>Whether, in the context of the South-East Europe Stability Pact and the Prime Minister's recent remarks on migration in Europe, they can report progress on improving land communications between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, or on an oil bypass for the Bosphorus and Dardanelles; and when they expect improvements to come into use.[HL4480]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  Land communications between the Black Sea and the Adriatic are being improved largely through the Corridor VIII road and rail project to link Burgas (Bulgaria) and Durres (Albania). Some work on the various elements of the corridor is under way but we understand that there are differences between some states of the region over rail routes and prioritisation of component projects. We hope that the parties involved will soon approve a memorandum of understanding to enable the work to accelerate.
<P>

<a name="20611w01_para1"></a>A number of projects involving oil pipelines which would bypass the Bosphorus are under consideration. The two most advanced proposals are (a) a pipeline from Burgas via Macedonia to Vlore (Albania) on the Adriatic coast and (b) a pipeline from Burgas with Alexandropoulis (Greece) on the Aegean Sea coast. We understand that no firm decision has been made with regard to construction of either.<P>

<P>
<UL>Whether they can confirm reports from France and Germany that heavily armed Turkish military forces crossed the frontier into Iraq on 16 May, killed and wounded some civilians and arrested others, who were then subjected to torture; whether NATO was informed of any such operations; and, in any case, what is their response.[HL4506]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   We cannot confirm the reports cited by the noble Lord; nor have we received other reports suggesting a major incident of that kind. We continue to monitor the situation closely and to raise our concerns where appropriate.

<A NAME="20611w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to set up fora within the United Kingdom to engender and encourage discussion relating to the Convention on the Future of Europe as envisaged and recommended on page 33 of the first progress report from the United Kingdom representatives to the convention; if so, what form these fora will take; and, if not, why not.[HL4545]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The convention recommends that member states organise forums for civil society to discuss the future of Europe. In line with the Government's efforts to bring Europe closer to the people, we are encouraging local and regional governments, think tanks and other public organisations to engage in this debate. There will also be a web-based discussion and direct contact with citizens during ministerial visits across the country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The UK has provided substantial financial assistance of &#163;525,000 and an expert to work with the talks facilitator, former President of Botswana, Sir Ketumile Masire. As a result of the dialogue, for the first time in almost 30 years a large representation of Congolese society have come together to discuss arrangements for a democratic government in the DRC. We welcome the progress that was made during these discussions and continue to work with all the parties to conclude arrangements for an inclusive transitional government which will lead to peace in the country for the first time for many years.

<P>
<A NAME="20611w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  In addition to political and financial support, the UK is providing six military personnel to the United Nations Mission in the DRC. The mandated strength of the UN force is 5,537, of which 3,633 are deployed in theatre. There have been six fatalities since the mission was established in November 1999. The force can only be expanded on the recommendation of the Secretary General and with the agreement of the Security Council. There are no plans to do so at present.

<P>

<A NAME="20611w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Government are considering their response in light of the comments received and will make an announcement in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w02_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Ludford </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action they have taken to prevent child pornography appearing on the Internet.[HL4388]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Government are determined to tackle child pornography whether on or off line and the criminal law applies equally to both.
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para6"></a>The majority of child pornography is placed on servers outside the United Kingdom. However, there are effective measures to deal with it when it appears within our jurisdiction. Since its formation in 1996, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has operated a hotline to enable users to report the presence of child pornography in a newsgroup or website. If the IWF assesses the material as likely to be illegal and it is hosted on a UK server, the internet service provider (ISP) is notified by the IWF and must remove it or risk breaking the law. Over 40,000 items of child <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>pornography have been removed in this way. Details of the site are sent to the police or, if the originator is abroad, to the enforcement agency of the country concerned via the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para7"></a>In January 2001, we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years (from three years) and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months).
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para8"></a>In November 2000 the then Home Secretary announced a &#163;25 million investment in the police over three years specifically to fight hi-tech crime and to enhance the capability of the police at national and local level to investigate computer based offences, including the possession and distribution of illegal pornography.
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para9"></a>In March 2001, the then Home Secretary established a Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The task force began work in May. It is a partnership of representatives from the Internet service and communication providers; the Internet Watch Foundation; PC and software retailers and manufacturers; child welfare organisations; the main Opposition parties; law enforcement agencies and academics.
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para10"></a>The task force is looking at proposals for legislation to tackle paedophile "grooming" activity on and off line and best practice models for providers of chat and other Internet services and computer awareness training for the police and child protection practitioners.
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para11"></a>Internationally, the Government are supporting efforts within the European Union and more widely to combat child pornography on the Internet. In November 2001, we signed the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime which will underpin co-operative action between signatory states in respect of computer-related crimes, including the making, distribution and possession of child pornography.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w02_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will provide a table showing how many hours each week are allocated to purposeful activity in each of HM prisons and young offender centres for (a) remand prisoners and (b) sentenced offenders; and what improvements are planned for the coming year. [HL4444]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Prison Service does not collect centrally information to distinguish time spent in purposeful activity by sentenced prisoners and those on remand. The average weekly purposeful activity time for all prisoners in 2001&#150;02 in each establishment in England and Wales is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="20611w02_para12"></a>Targets agreed with establishments for 2002&#150;03 aim to increase the overall average purposeful activity <P>

We have kept this authorisation under close review in the light of intelligence assessments from the Immigration Service. After a year's experience of operating the authorisations, the Immigration Service has found it sufficient to rely on the authorisation made on 27 March 2001 which permits it to prioritise certain passengers for additional examination on the basis of their nationality. We will keep under review the possible need for further authorisations permitting discrimination on grounds of ethnic or national origin where necessary in respect of specific targeted operations.

<P>
<A NAME="20611w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  The Government believe the answer to problems such as gazumping lies in increasing transparency, certainty and speed in the home buying and selling process. That is why we are committed to making it easier for people buying and selling homes through the introduction of the seller's pack. The seller's pack will provide at the very start of the transaction process key information required to enable the transaction to proceed smoothly and quickly. This should reduce significantly the period between offer acceptance to exchange of contracts, thereby reducing the window of opportunity during which problems like gazumping can occur. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.

The occupational backgrounds of its members are too numerous to list but range from peers of the realm, through every grade of management and employee in the public and private sector, to the self-employed and unemployed.

<UL>How many new recruits they estimated the Territorial Army would have for each of the past five years; how many new recruits there were for each of those years; how many they estimate for the year 2002; and how many there have been for the year 2002 so far. [HL4550]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We do not hold records that show the estimated figures for new recruits into the Territorial Army for previous years; however, the estimate for 2002 is 7,750 for soldiers. A review of officer recruiting is currently being carried out which will review the estimate for potential officers. The number of new recruits for the last five calendar years and for this year so far is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w03_wqn12"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the target of 35 per cent of National Health Service trusts introducing level 3 electronic patient records by April 2002 will not be met; and whether they intend to take account to ensure that all NHS trusts introduce level 3 electronic patient records by the target date of 2005. [HL3566]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w03_spmin5"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  A recent survey of progress towards level 3 EPRs presents a variable picture At present six trusts have complete hospital-wide EPR systems that meet the functionality described under level 3. However many more have some applications in place, for example results reporting and order communications. In addition, some trusts have implemented elements of EPR beyond level 3 with functionality around decision support and knowledge management of picture archiving and communications systems to support improved patient care.
<P>

<a name="20611w03_para2"></a>That is why we are taking action by introducing a new national programme and implementation plan for IT in the NHS. This will significantly step up the pace of getting modern IT in place to support frontline patient care and also ensure that IT both drives change and gets the best from the extra resources the NHS is now getting.

<a name="20611w03_para3"></a>The key points from the programme are: a new national IT programme director who will be responsible for the implementation of this programme; stringent national standards for data and IT in the NHS; an improved partnership with the IT industry and healthcare IT suppliers to increase the IT capacity for the NHS; a new procurement strategy to accelerate the impact of IT across the NHS; better central management which will include a ministerial task force chaired by Lord Hunt to ensure the advice and involvement of key healthcare professional and representative groups.
<P>

<a name="20611w03_para4"></a>The intention has always been to have a first generation of electronic records in use across the NHS from 2005. This will be the starting point from which the NHS can begin to apply electronic records as a clinical tool in diagnosis, treatment, interventions and healthcare. By 2008, as indicated in Delivering the NHS Plan, we will expect to see all the advanced applications and functionality of electronic patient records in all PCTs and trusts.

<A NAME="20611w04_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their estimate of the total amount of revenue raised in the United Kingdom from sport in the financial years (a) 2000&#150;01 and (b) 2001&#150;02.[HL4539]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20611w04_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  This information is not available. Central government revenue raised from sport includes receipts from VAT, PAYE and other income taxes, corporation tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty and national insurance contributions. Local government receipts are primarily in the form of business rates, reduced where appropriate by discretionary reliefs. Receipts from these sources would need to be reduced for tax and other reliefs accorded to sports organisations by the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise to arrive at meaningful estimates of net receipts. Detailed estimates of the annual totals of these receipts and reliefs in respect of sporting organisations are not maintained.
