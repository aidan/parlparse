I congratulate the British and Irish Governments on commissioning this joint report 84 years after independence. Is he aware that ships entering British ports are still making a contribution of about &#163;8.5 million a year in maintaining Irish Lights? Notwithstanding the information he has given about that very welcome first meeting, when will there be a decision so that this inequitable contribution can finally stop?</p>

It is difficult to predict when the negotiations will finish. They will have to consider the running costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and items such as the funding of ships and other large assets, redundancy, trading between the three GLAs and commercial income.</p>

There are confusing figures about how much the UK might be subsidising Irish lighthouses, but if it is near &#163;8 million a year and has been going on, I am told, for something like 20 years, that amounts to &#163;160 million.

There is no provision whatever from the UK Exchequer. In the best possible tradition of our Government and the generality of UK government, the users pay. The contribution is paid for by users at

Is it not a fact that the three general lighthouse authorities provide an integrated service for the safety of navigation and operate a system whereby ships can be used by one another as and when required?</p>

Many ships coming to British ports pass through Irish waters. It is important that they are protected in an integrated way. Having entirely separate systems in the Republic and the UK would be likely to cost more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08051462000019"></a>It should be noted that the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which has existed for more than 200 years in one form or another, is a great example of a whole-Ireland body that has served both countries well from the creation of the Republic of Ireland and right through the Troubles.</p>

The Minister may recall that I have asked several times when negotiations with the Irish Government over the repeated breaches in road-safety law in north Wales will be concluded. Will he confirm that there is some sense of urgency, because British ships and hauliers are put at a significant competitive disadvantage by the present arrangements?</p>

In fact, the impact of any negotiation would be at best 10 per cent of light charges. I am not seized of the argument that there is a significant competitive disadvantage.</p>

We fully support the high-level Arab League mission that arrived in Lebanon today. The UN Security Council, under British presidency, addressed the situation last Thursday.

There will be the first independent qualifications system to guarantee to parents the highest standards and there will be more power for parents to receive regular information on their children's progress. We are expanding academies and strengthening reform to the accountability of schools to parents, giving them a bigger say on how to raise standards and whether new schools are needed in an area. It is also unfair&#151;and a threat to our country's future prosperity&#151;that many qualified young people are still denied access to an apprenticeship. By deciding to legislate, for the first time, for the statutory right of every suitably qualified young person to obtain an apprenticeship, we expect the numbers of people starting apprenticeships&#151;just 65,000 a year 10 years ago&#151;to rise by 2011 to over 200,000, three times as many.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Every adult should have the right to a second chance in education&#151;to have the chance to make the most of their potential. It is not only a threat to prosperity but unfair that adults in work or looking for work are denied the opportunity to get the training they need to advance their careers, or even the time needed to do a course. So my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Skills is proposing today, for the first time, a major new change in workplace rights that will benefit both employees and employers, giving every worker the right to request time to train. We will also offer every adult a personal skills account so that they can access the training they need, with resources tailored to the individual.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Leaving the unemployed without the skills they need to obtain work is costly for our prosperity and unfair to both benefit claimants and those who pay taxes. As part of the next stage of welfare reform, emphasising obligations as well as rights, the Secretary of State for Work will legislate in the coming Session for a duty on the unemployed to have their skill needs assessed and to acquire skills. We will consult on further radical reforms to ensure that no one with the ability to work is trapped on benefits for life. Those who can work should work, so new and existing incapacity benefit claimants will be required to go through a medical assessment and will be given a personalised programme to help them back into work.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Fair treatment also means respecting that people need flexible arrangements to care for their children, especially as evidence now shows that flexible work is no obstacle to business success, so fairness and efficiency can advance together. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business will announce tomorrow that we will take forward the recommendations of the Walsh report

We will consult on the details of implementation with the aim of introducing the new rights from next April.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Since last year we have secured cleaner hospitals in the NHS, better access to GPs and progress on waiting times. It is right, as we celebrate 60 years of the NHS next month, to introduce a new NHS reform Bill to continue the change and renewal of the NHS, equip it to offer a higher standard of care, focus it on prevention as well as treatment and make it more accountable to local people, giving patients real power and control over the service that they receive. We will establish a constitution of the NHS that sets out what patients can expect to get from the health service, including entitlements to minimum standards of access, quality and safety. For the first time, payments to NHS hospitals will be adjusted according to patient satisfaction and health outcomes, deepening our commitment to a patient-focused NHS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the same way as we are tackling underperforming schools, we will take new powers, as part of a comprehensive NHS performance regime, to ensure that no healthcare provider falls below minimum standards. Just as we will consult in education on giving more rights to parents, we will bring forward radical proposals in health to put more power in the hands of patients, including new rights to information about their care, control of their own personal budgets and having more say over the decisions of their local primary care trust.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Just as we will give both parents and patients more control, so we will give social housing tenants more say&#151;greater choice over where they live and new rights to independent information on landlords&#146; performance. We will look at ways of rewarding good tenants and hold to account those who do not meet their responsibilities, as we crack down further on anti-social behaviour on our estates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Protecting the safety of the British people is paramount for any Government. Since 1997, we have significantly increased the numbers of police men and women, and introduced new community support officers and new powers for police and the courts to target anti-social behaviour, burglary, car crime and street crime. We have also taken action against terrorism.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Our aim is not just a reduction in crime but that people feel safe in their homes and neighbourhoods. One way forward, as with education and health, is to empower citizens, giving them more direct say on how crime is tackled in their areas.</p>

We will legislate so that neighbourhood police teams have to meet tougher national standards to ensure the high visibility and responsiveness of local police and community support officers. Legislation will give the victims of crime more legal rights, including protection for vulnerable victims and witnesses of gun- and gang-related crime during investigations

She will announce new measures to improve police performance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Organised crime, particularly in the areas where there are serious problems with drugs and illegal immigration, must be dealt with severely. It is right to close every loophole to prevent criminals retaining the proceeds of their crimes. The policing and crime reduction Bill will legislate to speed up the recovery and seizure of assets obtained through criminal acts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;If our crime policy is to punish and prevent, our migration policy is to ensure for Britain the benefits that migration brings while managing it securely and ensuring that expectations for newcomers are clear. We have already introduced the new Australian-style points system to ensure that only those who contribute can come into Britain, and integrated the vital work of the Border and Immigration Agency, Customs and UK Visas into a single border agency.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;After a consultation which finished this week, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will legislate to put in place our new and tougher test for permanent residence or British citizenship. The requirements in law will be that newcomers learn English, play by the rules and show they are making an economic contribution to the UK. Only full citizens will get access to benefits or social housing. Newcomers will be required to pay into a migration impact fund to help local communities deal with changes in population.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We will also take new powers in legislation to enhance airport security and protect against terrorist acts at sea.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We will take further steps in the next Session of Parliament to safeguard and enhance our heritage and environment. For the first time in 30 years there will be legislation to increase protection of our historic sites and buildings. This will include reforms to the planning system to improve the protection of old buildings, and new rules to make it an offence to deal in cultural property illegally exported from occupied territory.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We will consult in draft on the legislation necessary to implement the recommendations of the Pitt review into the 2007 floods and so better protect vulnerable communities in the future.</p>

But we will go further and consult on a major shift of power directly to citizens themselves. My right honourable friend the Communities Secretary will set out proposals, to be taken forward through a new community empowerment Bill, to give people greater power to influence local decisions&#151;local spending decisions, local council agendas and the use of local assets&#151;that affect them.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We are committed to both flexibility and to fairness in the workplace and will do nothing that jeopardises jobs and businesses taking on workers. But most people agree that it is not fair that, even after months in the job, agency workers can currently be paid less than the staff they work alongside and, as a result, permanent staff can feel they are being unfairly undercut. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform plans to bring forward legislation, subject to an agreement between employers and employees, and in Europe, that will for the first time ensure new rules for fair treatment of agency workers here in Britain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Discrimination anywhere is unacceptable and a new equality Bill will compel public bodies to take seriously the needs and requirements of both their workforce and the communities they serve, sending a clear message that in 21st-century Britain prejudice is no longer acceptable anywhere.</p>

Perhaps I should congratulate her as well on ploughing her way through it. It was well briefed to the media last night, of course. It is called &#147;Building a more prosperous Britain&#148;. You just have to tell that to the housewife who has just come home from shopping, the small businessman who has just filled up his car or the home owners terrified yesterday by the Housing Minister&#146;s forecasts on house prices. You do wonder whether government spin doctors ever meet anyone who lives in the real world.

I am not even sure that Parliament should be used as a stage prop for it.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08051462000081"></a>I said last year&#151;and I feel even more so this year&#151;that this exercise is just a simple gimmick. I happen to believe that anything that detracts from the gracious Speech or the prerogative of Her Majesty to set out Her Government&#146;s programme, when your Lordships' House is at the centre of the nation&#146;s affairs, is a very great pity. That may be an old-fashioned view, but it is one that I know, from speaking to noble Lords in all parts of the House, is widely shared. As I listened to this verbose utterance today and watched eyes glazing over all around the House, how I longed for the brevity of the gracious Speech. Of course, consultation on future policy programmes is sensible, but that is why we have Green Papers, White Papers and draft Bills. This exercise is a party-political media ploy that adds nothing.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08051462000082"></a>To say that we need it to improve consultation is, at best, a red herring and, at worst, misleading. Announcing future legislation in this way makes it harder, not easier, to listen to representations that mistaken ideas should be dropped. We all know why it happened last year. The Prime Minister planned an election and wanted to pre-empt a gracious Speech that would have had to await his campaign, but he has no reason to do so this year. Last year, we had the pre-Queen&#146;s Speech in July; this year it is in May. At this rate, next year it will be in March&#151;and, no doubt, in election year of 2010, in January. It has nothing to do with good, orderly legislation. If only a fraction of this attention were given to post-legislative scrutiny, we would be far better off. Last year, we were told that citizens&#146; juries would judge this Statement. Can the noble Baroness tell the House the verdict of those juries last year? I wonder if it coincided with the verdict of the millions of people who voted on 1 May. </p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08051462000083"></a>There was mention in this Statement of a subject dear to all of us: reform of your Lordships&#146; House. The White Paper was mentioned, implying that publication has now been agreed by the Cabinet. Can the noble Baroness say if that is in fact so, and how long your Lordships&#146; House will be kept waiting to see that White Paper? If the Government have ruled out legislation in this Parliament, that will be welcome news to very many of your Lordships.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08051462000084"></a>Of course, this Statement has some worthwhile ideas. After all, I recognise some of them. We have highlighted the shocking failure of this Government to tackle deep, underlying issues of poverty and deprivation, so talk of welfare reform is, yet again, good. Yet where are the policies to fight family breakdown, or to break open the monopoly of poor state education and allow new schools to open? Where are the policies to release the vitality of the voluntary sector? Where are the policies that unlock opportunity? Where are the benefit and tax changes that reward talent and hard work, and advance social mobility, instead of yet more top-down, bureaucratic tax credits that half of the population cannot understand?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08051462000085"></a>Where are the policies to allow GPs to make the right choices for their patients, instead of closing their surgeries and frogmarching them into super-centres

Where are the policies to stop the early release of prisoners, or to tackle the tragedy of gun and knife crime among youngsters? It has been left to a Conservative Mayor of London to take an overdue initiative? Where are the policies to heal communities that are hurting, and to halt the destruction of Post Offices that is breaking the heart of communities across Britain?</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08051462000086"></a>I heard none of those things, although I heard feeble attempts to copy Conservative policies on immigration, flexible working and exam regulation. It is hardly surprising that noble Lords opposite keep on asking us for more policy detail; next year, why does the noble Baroness not come over on this side, and let the real Conservative Party announce the ideas that are setting the agenda in modern politics?</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08051462000087"></a>Incidentally, I did not hear any announcement of the idea that came from the leader of the Liberal Democrats in another place in response to the Queen&#146;s Speech last year. He asked for a Bill to provide for a referendum on our membership of the EU&#151;the same issue that sent Mr Clegg storming out of the House of Commons. I look forward to hearing the noble Lord, Lord McNally, press the noble Baroness for that. Perhaps he has changed his mind, or perhaps she will confirm that the Liberal Democrats could lay an amendment to the Bill before the House for exactly what they wanted then.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08051462000088"></a>That brings me to the glaring inadequacy of this Statement: the one thing that will be recognised in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;with its unique role in revising legislation&#151;more than anywhere else. It is that the Prime Minister is announcing next year&#146;s legislation before he has sorted out this year&#146;s. Would we not all be far better off if, instead of promising more Bills, we get Bills right in the first place? We are promised&#151;this is no joke although it is, surely, unbelievable&#151;another criminal justice Bill. Yet this year&#146;s Bill was written and rewritten as it went along, with whole chunks devoted to repealing legislation passed in 2003 that had never even been put into effect. This country desperately needs not more government and more legislation, but better government and less legislation.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08051462000089"></a>If I heard the noble Baroness correctly, the draft Queen&#146;s Speech promised a major Bill on education, but we have not even seen this year&#146;s Education and Skills Bill yet; after all, it arrived in this House just a few minutes ago. The Prime Minister promised a major Bill on housing; if that is so urgent, why do we not halt the existing Housing Bill, which has only just started its Committee stage, and look at recommitting it to include some of these bold new ideas? Or, are they just sound-bites rather than worked-out ideas? We are also promised some minor changes on planning law. Why are they not included in this Session&#146;s Planning Bill, which is still to reach your Lordships' House? Heaven knows, we could save parliamentary time by abandoning the absurd battle over 42 days&#146; detention without trial.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08051462000090"></a>The picture is of a Government in chaos not only making it up as they go along, but unmaking it, too, as they go along.

We stand ready&#151;I am sure the noble Lord, Lord McNally, does too&#151;to agree a more orderly programme for dealing with legislation and any properly thought-out and urgent matters that are truly needed, but we should not and will not facilitate charades designed to boost a Prime Minister who has simply lost control, lost a sense of direction and lost the plot.</p>

I understand that this year we are to be spared an expensive government glossy, but perhaps the Lord President can tell us whether we will have the same as last year at public expense. It really is quite odd. I am glad to see that one question has someone scurrying to the Box&#151;perhaps I should not give them ideas.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08051462000092"></a>I took the time to watch the Prime Minister delivering this Statement. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is quite right: you do not have to look at the name on it to know that this is a Gordon Brown Statement. It is overlong and overdetailed. Like one of those Heath Robinson machines with wheels, pistons and hammers going, you wonder what it represents. We know that the timing of the Statement is highly political&#151;it has been rushed out 24 hours after yesterday&#146;s mini-Budget and is within days of a crucial by-election. But beyond all that, listening to the Prime Minister and looking at the Labour Party, one has to recall one of the two memorable phrases used by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont: &#147;A Government in office, but not in power&#148;. It is worrying to see this. We had the Statement yesterday, and these two things have to be taken together. I wonder where the golden rule is now as the Government embark on an emergency economic policy that the <I>Guardian</I> today described as a crude and costly brand of economic populism which will build up more and more debt. The Chief Whip has just said, &#147;You should read the <I>Mail</I>&#148;. So we know the paper of choice on that side of the House these days.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08051462000093"></a>The other thing that comes to mind is the old remark that Disraeli caught the Whigs bathing and stole their clothes. I think that the Conservatives should have one of those Metropolitan Police notices on all their offices to be on guard about their policies. Watching Mr Cameron presenting his case, I thought he had the Government banged to rights as he listed the items in this draft Queen's Speech and cross-referenced them with previous statements by the Conservative Party. It really is that much of a shambles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08051462000094"></a>Does the Lord President agree that in spite of the increase in public spending on health and education, which we on these Benches supported when it was brought forward over the last few years, people feel no closer to being able to influence the decisions that affect their lives and families?</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08051462000095"></a>The Prime Minister himself said that he had no intention of going back to the record housing repossessions that took place under the Tories, but

This is still a programme which emphasises that the man in Whitehall knows best. It is still a programme which believes that yet another piece of legislation will increase our security, rather than using existing powers and directing resources to effective policing and security services. It still lacks any sense of urgency about the need to modernise and make fit for purpose our system of government by devolving power and reinvigorating our democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08051462000096"></a>I look at some of the faces on the Labour Benches. If the Lord President wants to know why Labour is in such a mess, I quote two headlines from today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I>. On page 22 it says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08051462000239"></a>&#147;TUC wants pay deal to match 3% rise in inflation&#148;.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000098"></a>Working people believe that Labour has failed to stand up to corporate greed. It does not see any evidence that there will be any proper burden-sharing in the face of global economic difficulties. The people who took multi-million pound bonuses are the same people who come running to the taxpayer for bail-out when their chickens come home to roost. There is no confidence among Labour voters that Labour will hold corporate greed to proper account. Unless Labour recaptures some sense of social justice in what it does, and not simply in what it says, it is doomed, and deservedly so. Are we going to have a debate on this Statement?</p>

I am thrilled that my colleagues on both Benches enjoyed the Statement so much. I will try to answer some of the questions and issues that were raised. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that I was a bit worried about the &#147;housewife&#148; bit. Traditionalism is one thing, but in my house I am very rarely the person who goes out to do the shopping. The most fascinating part was the idea that, somehow, the Statement had been rushed out with the programme to allow for the fact that we have a by-election next week. My noble friend the Chief Whip and I smiled at each other wryly. Noble Lords who have been in government know very well how long it takes to develop and design a programme in draft form in the way that we have done. It takes many weeks and months.

Noble Lords will recall&#151;as I certainly can&#151;how many times over the summer months, when we have been building up to a Queen&#146;s Speech, people in your Lordships&#146; House and outside say that they want to know what we are doing. What are the proposals? What kinds of things might we do? How do they know that we have taken on board the kind of consultations that we have  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1014"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1014</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been doing over the past few months? This is the response to that. It affords us the opportunity to build on the work that we have been doing, to build on the consultations that we have already had, and offers the opportunity to do more. The citizens&#146; juries of last year formed part of the publication that we made towards the end of the year about the responses that we had had. Indeed, through our regional Ministers, we will be carrying out more consultations this time.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08051462000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, said that we may have stolen these ideas from the Conservatives. I do not recognise them. I recognise echoes, from the occasions when we have had any policy from the Conservative Party, of issues that concern us both. Of course, if we have lifted the proposals, we can all look forward to early nights with no Whips because the Conservative Party, I presume, will vote with the Government on all the proposals. After all, according to Mr Cameron&#151;less so, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, who I presume has read them all in great detail, we will have some form of consensus, which is often a very good thing. I wait with great interest to see whether I am right in my prediction.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08051462000102"></a>I have already indicated that we want to take these issues forward and debate them. We want to do that through the right consultation. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, asked whether there would be a debate. That is a subject for the usual channels. He can make his views known and I know that other noble Lords will. I will await the outcome. In a sense, I am the servant of the House and will do whatever noble Lords wish.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08051462000103"></a>On the specifics, we have to be clear. For example, what the accusation about GPs and surgeries stems from is the subject of the review of my noble friend Lord Darzi. We are looking at a process that has to be transparent, clinically evidenced, locally led and for the benefit of patients. As we celebrate 60 years of the National Health Service, we are seeking to go back to the principles of making sure that, through its new constitution, the NHS provides for our citizens and ensures that their expectations are met and they are clear about what is going to happen.</p>

<a name="80514-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08051462000104"></a>I shall end by remembering. A lot is being said about doom and gloom. I thought that it was time to think about why I stand on this side of your Lordships' House. Many years ago, a cartoon in, I think, the <I>Independent</I>, was of the then Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher&#151;now the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher&#151;standing on a derelict landscape. Underneath, it said, &#147;If you seek a monument, look around&#148;. In the time of the Conservative Government we had long waiting lists and waiting times for operations. People who were in pain were going into MPs&#146; surgeries and asking why they had to wait two to three years for their operation. I remember something called youth unemployment, and it was raging. The streets of London, where I live, were dirty. People were begging at every tube station. I remember high inflation and interest rates, and sitting with my baby on my knee watching the inflation rate go through the roof to 15 per cent. I said then, &#147;Never again&#148;.</p>

As an illustration, does she agree that this applies very precisely to the commitment to legislate on the rights of temporary and agency workers? These workers, along with fixed-term contract workers and part-time workers, who we have also helped with some assistance from Brussels, are now mainstream workers in our labour force in a modern economy. Is it not the case that, in committing ourselves to helping to protect those workers, they will add to good quality employment in this country and not to the raising of unemployment, which has been incorrectly predicted for the minimum wage for part-time workers and fixed-term contract workers in the past?</p>

Why are our economic difficulties and rising inflation attributed by the Government to rising world prices, energy costs and other costs, whereas when we benefited from falling prices from Chinese imports and so on, and the economy was benefiting from deflation, that was due to the brilliance of the Chancellor? Surely we cannot have it both ways.</p>

As to the brilliance of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, yes, he is brilliant. He was a brilliant Chancellor and he is a brilliant Prime Minister.

Can the Minister confirm that the success or failure of a school will be decided upon by the value added that it gives to children and not only absolute exam results? Will the Government consider reviewing the Ofsted system to ensure that it is inspecting those aspects of a school&#146;s work which help to develop the whole child, its well-being and welfare, and enable the child to learn to its full potential?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08051462000115"></a>The noble Baroness and I have debated schools many times and she knows that I agree completely with her about value added. It is essential for all children in all circumstances but especially for children who sometimes struggle for all kinds of reasons. One is able to see significant progress often outside the general framework of school activity. Ofsted does a lot of work on continuous review. I do not know whether there is a specific review within the proposals or what it evaluates, but I know that it is looking all the time&#151;not least because, as the noble Baroness will recognise, a child&#146;s well-being plays an incredibly important part in their ability to learn and therefore influences their life chances.</p>

That was certainly true in education in my experience. A lot of work has been done with the police to look at the day-to-day experiences of police officers on the beat, what they have to do, and the bureaucracy that applies to them in different parts of the country. As a consequence of that, we will be able to work through what we can do centrally to relieve the burden, while making sure that burdens are not imposed for other reasons further down the chain. That will be the focus of the work. The noble Lord is right that we should make sure that the core job of our police service is done effectively.</p>

I know that discussions will go on between now and any proposal becoming legislation. We will ensure that we take on board the comments of the noble Baroness and look at ways in which we can deal with the issues and problems that local people recognise.

Cannot the Government leave the criminal justice system alone for a while in order to allow the reforms that they constantly introduce to be absorbed and put into practice? So many parts of previous Bills have not been brought into practice at all. In addition, we had the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: we now have another immigration Bill.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08051462000242"></a> Clause 2, page 1, line 12, after &#147;excluding&#148; insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;(i) Article 2, paragraph 147, inserted Article 176A TEC (TFEU), relating to energy; and(ii) &#148;
<a name="80514-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08051462000145"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment concerns a new article that can be found by a diligent search in the current treaty&#151;difficult though it is to find these headings. I call it new but it is an almost identical copy, with one small addition to what was in the previous draft of the rejected constitutional treaty. Almost all the text of the treaty is embodied in this Bill. In no area is more nonsense talked about the technicalities of an issue than in energy policy. There is a great deal of enthusiasm, lobbying and favourite causes being promoted and rather more smoke&#151;possibly heat&#151;than light, in this area.</p>

<a name="80514-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08051462000146"></a>Behind the arrival of this new clause in this treaty and in the previous constitutional treaty is the aspiration for what is called a common EU energy policy. The treaty provisions that introduce a new energy competence and allow the introduction of legislation in this area by qualified majority voting refer to all sorts of attractive sounding things, such as solidarity, security of supply, energy efficiency, interconnection of networks&#151;a real benefit&#151;and other admirable objectives, such as reduced carbon emissions. It is a classic example of a clause being paved with good intentions. We know, of course, where they often lead. The interesting thing is that the Government fought very hard to keep energy out of the treaty altogether and to prevent it coming into the convention. The Minister at the time, Mr Hain, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08051462000243"></a>&#147;This provision is unnecessary as all aspects of energy policy are effectively covered elsewhere in the Treaty. For example, the single market environment etc&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08051462000244"></a>&#147;We have detailed concerns on the text&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000232"></a>We, too, have detailed concerns and would like them answered. My overall concern is that the rhetoric of this article and the realities of energy security and problems are miles&#151;perhaps I should have said kilometres&#151;apart.</p>

<a name="80514-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08051462000147"></a>I would not dispute for a moment the fact that some extremely dangerous energy supply and security issues lie just ahead. Some of us would say that they are already here. Crude oil prices are at staggering levels&#151;in real terms, they are above those reached in the early 1980s&#151;and rising to $126 and $130. As we discovered two winters ago, we have unreliable gas supplies but a heavy dependence&#151;about 40 per cent&#151;on gas for our electricity. When I had some responsibility for these things a quarter of a century ago, it was 1 per cent but now 40 per cent of our daily electricity supply is gas-fired. We have concerns about the storage of gas and why we have fewer days for storage than our continental neighbours. We have concerns about the wild oscillation in gas prices. We have endless dithering over the need to resume our nuclear power programme. We still have not made the right decisions, but when we do, it will take us nine or 10 years to get new plants up and running. We have the prospect of power shortages between 2010 and 2016, as an increasing number of experts are pointing out. We have the over-zealotry of some of the perfectly proper enthusiasts for a greener, more sustainable planet, which seems to lead to the excessive piling on of fuel and energy taxes, charges and subsidies, regardless of the fuel poverty that they create. Inevitably, that makes environmental policies unpopular and threatens economic growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08051462000148"></a>We also have the biofuels errors, which the government scientist described as insane policies, and the consequent rise in food prices and the starving of the poor which are caused by those energy-related programmes. I cannot understand why some EU leaders or our own Foreign Secretary seem to be in denial about the relationship between the biofuels commitment element in European energy policy and the enormous increase in food prices in the past two or three years, which has led to unrest and riots in 33 countries. The Washington Institute of Food Research, which is very authoritative and respected, calculated that crop switching accounts for between one-quarter and one-third of the food price rise worldwide.</p>

Is not the European Community therefore adding to the situation?</p>

<a name="08051462000152"></a><a name="80514-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80514-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051462000402"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> There is, of course, the renewable fuels obligation, which we ourselves have in place. Beyond that there is a declared objective of  20 per cent renewables in our energy by 2020 in which it is implicit that there has to be a massive switch from mineral oil to plant-based oil. That is why European farmers, as well as American farmers, have been moving towards these oil-based crops. That is happening, and unless the policy is changed it will continue and cause more misery and starvation. That is absolutely so.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08051462000153"></a>I have already mentioned the question of renewables&#151;20 per cent by 2020&#151;and whether they are profitable or being subsidised in the right way. We need to watch those matters very carefully. As we all know, the insatiable demand for oil from China and India is driving up prices. Nationalism all around the world is driving out the international oil companies and asserting a degree of nationalism in access to oil. There is the lack of investment in oil and gas resources; and there are all sorts of scams and oddities around, like the carbon offset rackets and possibly the wrongly phased subsidies to wind farms which newspapers such as the <I>Financial Times</I> have very bravely exposed, although nothing much seems to have been done about them. I am simply saying that there is a whole string of energy problems which we urgently need to face. But how will more EU powers, as in this treaty, really help? Is it that they are concerned about security of supply? Frankly, that is bound to be a matter primarily for national Governments, as every Government in Europe knows perfectly well.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08051462000154"></a>Here on this island we would do much better to rely on our friend Norway, which has plenty of gas and oil for years to come, and on importing liquid natural gas&#151;as we are planning to do to some extent&#151;rather than on the continental grid supplied by Russian gas, which has proved to be quite a tricky system to rely on, particularly in the coldest hours of the coldest days of the coldest years.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08051462000155"></a>We all want to reduce dependence on oil. The United States has probably done better than others in this regard, although Europe has done pretty well also, as has the UK within Europe. But, again, do we need new laws to do that? We all want to get our policy on the support of renewables right and support the ones that are really going to make a contribution, but is the EU guidance towards biofuels, which has helped cause the global food price rise, the right way forward? I am not sure. If we are concerned with carbon reduction, which is related to energy policy, is the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme the right system? Many people say that it has made zero impact in reducing carbon but has plenty of bad side-effects. And so on.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08051462000156"></a>As for sharing stocks, the International Energy Agency, which I chaired many years ago, has a very elaborate scheme for sharing stocks in an emergency. It is quite ready to implement it. That is not always popular, but we have to do it. As for revival of nuclear  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1023"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1023</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power, that really is a global issue. It has very little to do with Europe alone. Once we get our programmes going, we will probably rely on French industry, maybe South African expertise and maybe USA expertise. Even the Chinese might help us because we have been so slow in getting back into nuclear power. But, again, what have these things to do with new powers in Europe?</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08051462000157"></a>The truth is that EU policies of the kind proposed, namely more centralisation and more involvement, are not only unnecessary but in many instances wrong for our country, leading to bad strategic stances and decisions. The Government were right first time to resist them. They should have resisted them much harder. Mr Hain was right in his initial stance and we should have stuck to common sense rather than to the common energy dreams and dangers. That is why I beg to move this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="08051462000158"></a><a name="80514-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80514-0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051462000403"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I am prompted to intervene by a column I read a while ago in <I>Time </I>magazine by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. It was entitled &#147;Darkness Looms&#148;. He reminded readers that he had been energy Secretary 25 years before when there was a Department of Energy. I think that the noble Lord who has just spoken from the Front Bench also was an energy Minister in one capacity or another a considerable time ago. It prompted me to remember that I was the shadow spokesman 25 years ago, and a very enjoyable experience it was, too, to mark the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, who was great fun to debate with among other things. The experience prompted him, and it prompts me, to reflect on the changes that have taken place in the last 25 years.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08051462000159"></a>Our energy debates 25 years ago were primarily domestic. They centred around whether we should privatise and how we should allocate the enormous energy resources we had. We had an abundance of coal, we had oil, we had gas and we had nuclear power&#151;a diverse range. In 25 years that scene has been transformed. I recall debating the importance of gas as the &#147;premium fuel&#148; and not burning it in power stations. The speed with which we have depleted our gas reserves has led to a problem of energy security. It is therefore not surprising that energy security has now come to the fore. I am not surprised that for the first time in a European treaty there is an energy chapter, though like the noble Lord I shall have some questions about it. We will also have an Energy Bill in the next week or two. Energy security has come to the centre stage.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08051462000160"></a>I should like to know the answers to the following questions, which in some ways the noble Lord, Lord Howell, also posed. What exactly will this energy chapter do? What is it all about? What is in it that was not in previous treaties or arrangements? For example, does it increase areas of qualified majority voting on energy? It appears that it does, but to what extent?</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08051462000161"></a>I turn to what, for me, is the most authoritative assessment that we have&#151;the European Union Select Committee&#146;s report, which I found extremely useful. However, I found the paragraphs relating to energy rather less than full and the committee&#146;s conclusion at paragraph 9.33 rather enigmatic:</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1024"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1024</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08051462000245"></a>&#147;The new provisions in the Lisbon Treaty may raise the profile of the issue of energy but they do not constitute a major innovation. However the extension of QMV may be seen as significant&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000233"></a>When my noble friend replies to this debate, I hope that he will be able to spell out rather more  clearly how far qualified majority voting will be extended in the field of energy. What illustrative examples can he give us to show the impact of this new energy chapter in terms of an extension of QMV? Unfortunately, in this case, and in this case only, the EU Committee did not provide us with that invaluable information.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08051462000162"></a>Secondly, I want to find out what the Commission&#146;s involvement will be in issues of energy security. If one reads the debates in the other place, one can see that there were a lot of hares running with regard to how the Commission would be able to take over our supplies and reallocate them in an emergency or crisis. I should be grateful if my noble friend could clarify whether this chapter in any way adds to or develops the Commission&#146;s or Council&#146;s powers and whether it allows them, through the ordinary procedure, to extend and expand their role in the issue of emergency energy supplies.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08051462000163"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that we have a very fine track record of dealing with crises in international energy, and it does not seem to me that there is any need for the Commission or anyone else to cut across the basic and fundamental responsibility and obligation placed on all of us under the terms of the energy agency. Again, I should be grateful if my noble friend could confirm the character and nature of the Commission&#146;s responsibilities, if it has any in this regard, and say whether this treaty is in some cases promoting these areas. There was a debate in the other place about whether the Commission would have the power to propose, under ordinary procedure, a statutory increase in oil reserve stocks. Apparently, that was a hard-won concession. However, my recollection is that qualified majority voting in that area may have been introduced in the treaty of Nice. Again, I should be very grateful if my noble friend could clarify that.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08051462000164"></a>Finally, like the noble Lord, Lord Howell, I should like to know what the new role of the Commission and Council will be, through ordinary procedure, in attaining security of energy supplies. I thought that he was disingenuous in the case that he made&#151;but it is a case that I shall make too. National Governments are ultimately responsible for the security of their energy supplies. However, despite our connections with Norway, if something relating to the security of energy supplies happened in Europe, no one could believe that that would not reverberate throughout our country as well. There is no longer a drawbridge in such issues, and therefore we have a profound interest in revising the complex relationships that exist between European countries and those in the East. After all the unbundling that might occur and all the competition that there might be in the European energy market, there is one inescapable fact&#151;at least in relation to gas, for a very long period Europe will be dependent for its supplies on the East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08051462000165"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, occasionally reads Select Committee reports. He chaired the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs with distinction while I also had the privilege of serving on it. It recently produced a report entitled <I>Global Security</I><I>:</I><I> Russia </I>which spells out the incredibly complex, difficult and dangerous diplomatic moves that are interlocked with gas pipeline diplomacy. This diplomacy could have a considerable effect on Russian-Turkish and Russian-Turkish-EU relationships, let alone relationships between Russia and its neighbouring states. I therefore also wonder what further role the European Commission will play in this capacity.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08051462000166"></a>We had the G8 meeting in St Petersburg and the establishment of an energy charter treaty. We have a UK-Russian forum. We also have an EU-Russian energy forum. It seems that lots of processes are in place. The problem is not the processes, it is people&#146;s definition of what their national interests are. In the case of the Russians, they apparently do not want to ratify that treaty or agree to a transit protocol of the kind that we and our European partners would like. All of these are profoundly serious matters. I am not sure what additional power and role the Commission will have in energy security, despite its reference  in the chapter.</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08051462000167"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Howell, I will end on this note. I agree that there should be a European dimension to our energy policy&#151;unlike some of the amendments, which would make it impossible to have any kind of a European Union energy policy. Everybody knows, in every nation state, that the citizens of the nation state hold their national Governments responsible for heat and light. I can recall at least two Governments of the past 30 years, in my parliamentary lifetime, where that lesson was learnt. In February 1974, the Government of the day learnt a very painful lesson&#151;that if they could not keep the lights on then there would be considerable political as well as social and economic consequences. Ten years later, in 1984, we found a Government who had learnt that lesson and were prepared to avoid such a situation. In the last resort, however much we should endeavour to develop the desirable idea of a common European energy policy, it will always remain the national Government&#146;s responsibility to ensure that our nation is warm  and lit.</p>

Article 2C of the Lisbon treaty moves energy into this new category of shared competences, where

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08051462000246"></a>&#147;Such measures shall not affect a Member State's right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000234"></a>But what does it mean to say that the European Union shall take whatever measures are necessary to ensure security of energy supply? What role does that give the European Union in taking control of our energy resources? What control does it give the European Union in directing the way in which our energy priorities are set?</p>

<a name="80514-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08051462000170"></a>This uncertainty is added to by Article 84 in the Lisbon treaty, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08051462000247"></a>&#147;Without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in the Treaties, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, upon the measures appropriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products, notably in the area of energy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000235"></a>I know that much of that statement was in the previous treaty, but energy has notably been added to it. What measures may the Commission and the Council, without prejudice to any other procedures in the treaties, decide to impose in a spirit of solidarity to deal with issues of energy shortage? Exactly what powers are we handing over to the European Union? Will the Commission and Council be able to control our reserves if they so wish? Will they be able to direct the way in which energy resources move within the Community?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08051462000171"></a>These provisions in the treaty are completely unclear. In a measure that is so important, for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, has spelt out, we need to be very clear about the exact delineation. My amendment is clear. It would not affect the words of the treaty. It would simply add to the Bill the following clarification:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08051462000248"></a>&#147;Nothing in this Act or the Treaty of Lisbon shall be taken as limiting the sole right of the United Kingdom government to take decisions regarding the control and management of the United Kingdom&#146;s energy supply&#148;.</p>

Those noble Lords who make these criticisms seem to want it both ways. They do not want Europe to do anything, yet they criticise the weakness of the European Union in enabling Russia, OPEC or anyone else to play countries off against one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08051462000179"></a>Take the question of emissions trading. In effect, we are moving inexorably towards a carbon-taxing Europe. I welcome that, but other people want to walk backwards towards Christmas, as far as I can see. They want to deny that it is happening and still keep on walking. They know very well that we are moving towards an agreed $50 or $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide. They know that we will have to have a carbon tax in this country. We know that that carbon tax will have to be the same carbon tax per tonne as in every other European country, otherwise how are we going to avoid the contradictions which other noble Lords have drawn attention to?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08051462000180"></a>If I had to make a criticism of the Lisbon treaty on this question, it is that it does not go far enough. We might all agree that it is not explicit enough, but how can you be explicit about what is going to happen in the accelerating pace of change in the modern world? There has been criticism that the Emissions Trading Scheme and the degree to which we have to fiscalise in this country, or pay out through private enterprise into purchase of units in Africa and elsewhere, is not a matter for the European Union. Yet about a month ago, the European Union announced that it is making provision that by 2020 Europe will be handing over to developing countries &#8364;50 billion per year. Of that amount, we would pay &#8364;7 billion or &#8364;8 billion which we would have to fiscalise within Britain as well as put into our overseas trading account in some way. That will have to be agreed in Europe, if for no reason other than the fact that we have arguments about competitive advantage within Europe unless we do it on a common European basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08051462000182"></a>There is certainly a question of the man and woman in the street in Burton upon Trent paying what they might be encouraged to believe by the Conservative Party are stealth taxes putting up petrol and home oil prices. Choking off demand has to be done somehow. It can be done through either prices or taxation in some other way. Logically, from a fiscal point of view, there is no reason why we cannot have fiscal neutrality as well as a degree of hypothecation, putting up the tax for some people and putting it down for others. But all this will have to be done on a European basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08051462000183"></a>One could go on, in terms of the rules about power stations et cetera.

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08051462000185"></a>My noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 70 simply removes the new energy article which gives the EU more powers, subject to QMV. My noble friend Lord Blackwell&#146;s amendment simply highlights the significance of the move to QMV on aspects of energy policy. I do not, for the life of me, understand why the noble Lord, Lord Lea, should be concerned about that. I much prefer the view put by his noble friend Lord Rowlands, who warned us of the importance of security of supply and of Governments being able to protect their national interest. If energy is unable to be supplied, that has a fundamental and damaging effect on our quality of life and economy. Many wars and conflicts have been fought on those very issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08051462000186"></a>If the noble Lord wants to bring Alice in Wonderland into the debate, I give him one example. Not a fortnight ago I asked the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in Question Time about the effects of the European Community&#146;s requirement to have a proportion of biofuels included in petrol, which has resulted in the increase in the prices of food throughout the world, to which my noble friend referred. It has caused great damage&#151;indeed, it has killed people because of starvation and their inability to afford those food prices. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that the relationship between biofuels and those problems was at yet unproven and that the Government were looking at this matter and had it under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08051462000187"></a>I turned on the radio this morning, not a matter of weeks later, to hear the Chancellor telling us that he is this very day going to Brussels to argue that we should

The fact is that there is nothing that we can do about it, unless we get agreement&#151;and it is very damaging to the world as a whole. That is one example of a European policy that has proved foolish, although no doubt it was well intentioned; its consequences have been severe, and we have great difficulty in reversing it.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08051462000188"></a>I shall give the noble Lord another example, for which perhaps the Government of whom I was a member bear some responsibility. Those people who are in favour of green taxes should look at what happened to the previous Conservative Government when they introduced VAT on fuel. It was extremely unpopular. If you read the columns of the national press, you can see lots of people pointing out that the heating allowances that they get from the state are less than the VAT that they have to pay on the fuel. A sensible policy might be to consider lifting that, but we do not have freedom to remove VAT once it has been imposed.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08051462000189"></a>The noble Lord is a little cavalier in suggesting that we should risk giving up our ability to determine our policies according to our national interests. He mentioned Russia, which we know is quite capable of using energy as a political tool. We have seen that already. We also know that there is a diversity of interests within the European Community and according to the position of the various member states and their dependence on a particular energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08051462000193"></a>Several speeches have contained remarks that I believe to be totally fallacious, so I want to make one point for the other side. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, was a very notable member of the Government who in effect more or less closed down the coal industry. Many of us at that time said that the dash for gas would result in problems of security of supply. Now he says that we are ignoring security of supply. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Rowlands and I are on exactly the same side of that argument.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08051462000194"></a>Finally, on the notion of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, being against green taxes, his party is in favour of the targets for a 70 per cent reduction in CO2 by 2050 in the Climate Change Bill. The Conservatives voted for it. How are we going to get to that without choking off some demand in this country? They are being totally dishonest about this. I very rarely make political points&#151;but mark my words that in due course, whether they become the Government or not, they will have to take responsibility for dealing with this green taxation question.</p>

International regulation has to imply very clear rules. The argument about the IEA versus the European Union is also about how far one lets the Americans set the rules or how far one co-operates with others to design the rules within the European market. That is an argument we had in 1973-74, as I am sure the noble Lord will remember, over the setting up of the IEA, and it is an argument that continues. I, like many of us, start from the assumption that it makes sense to co-operate most closely with our neighbours with whom we share a regional energy market. International regulation is, of course, a limitation of absolute national sovereignty. A global world economy is an invasion of national sovereignty. Foreign companies owning British energy suppliers is a limitation of national sovereignty. I recognise that, and we have to manage it.</p>

They are nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty. Reversing, let us say, the biofuels commitment would be more difficult if there was not a provision that enabled it to be done by qualified majority and it had to be done by unanimity. I do not particularly want to reverse it anyway immediately because I think the debate has got a little overheated at the moment, as illustrated by claims that virtually single-handedly the European Union has forced up food prices worldwide when in fact the biggest push factor has been the enormous increase in consumption of certain foods by the more prosperous populations of China, India and south-east Asia. But let us leave that on one side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08051462000209"></a>The question is whether it makes sense to have it in the Lisbon treaty that decisions on energy matters are to be taken by qualified majority. I believe it does. There are plenty of safeguards in the treaty. The question of Britain&#146;s ownership of its resources and right to take decisions over their depletion is carefully excluded from any rights for the European Union. On the International Energy Agency and the sharing of stocks, the reason I asked the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, the question I did was because he stated categorically in his amendment that we have absolute control over these matters. We do not. We signed a treaty that set up the International Energy Agency and committed us to pooling our resources in certain circumstances, so the amendment is incompatible with our international obligations, not our European ones.</p>

We can do that, but once we have joined, and jointly taken a decision to share our oil stocks, I do not notice any difference whatever, except that the method of making decisions about those stocks is different.

We may have been foolish virgins with our oil and gas reserves, but I underline the question of my noble friend Lord Forsyth, if he does not mind my describing him so. Why do we not simply establish our national independence by building enough nuclear power stations as soon as possible, and so avoid having to be dependent on energy from Russia and elsewhere, coming to us courtesy of the French, and overseen by, of all things, Brussels? You could not make it up. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answer.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, for moving his amendment and pay tribute to his experience and expertise in this particular field, having been a previous Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08051462000214"></a>The appearance of a separate energy article reflects the growing importance of energy as a political and economic issue in the European Union, and the need for more effective action at Union level to achieve our energy and climate security objectives. The Stern report states that 65 per cent of global emissions come from energy. Meanwhile, the world&#146;s demand for energy rises inexorably. The dilemma facing us is how to meet our energy needs and, at the same time, stabilise our climate. This is very much a 21st century security and prosperity challenge.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08051462000215"></a>The new article will help to ensure that policies on energy markets, energy security and energy efficiency are coherent and mutually reinforcing. This is vital if we in the UK are to achieve our own energy and climate change priorities, and to successfully drive the transition to a high-growth, low-carbon economy in Europe. The creation of a separate energy article has the advantage of providing a transparent means of enacting energy policy at the EU level. It is not new EU action on energy, but in the past we had to rely, in particular, on other, more general articles in existing treaties. Examples include Article 175 for the environment or Article 195 for internal market measures. A separate energy article provides better governance and better regulation. It brings clarity to what the EU intends to do and how it will achieve it.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08051462000216"></a>EU action on energy is not a new invention. The Maastricht treaty listed energy as an activity of the Community, although the Community had acted on energy before. As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, reminded us, European-level action on energy goes back to the inception of the coal and steel community and EURATOM more than 50 years ago.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08051462000217"></a>Today, the EU has already implemented a wide range of measures on energy policy under existing legal bases of the EC treaty. Although the Lisbon treaty provides a dedicated legal base for EU action on specific areas of energy policy for the first time, the Committee should not be under any illusions that the Union has been taking action for some years to open energy markets. We support that liberalising action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08051462000218"></a>The Lisbon treaty confirms that qualified majority voting will continue to apply to the majority of future decisions made on energy policy at the EU level. My noble friend Lord Rowlands, who I am very glad is taking part in this debate, asked some questions about QMV. I emphasise that, in the past, energy measures were taken under qualified majority voting. As I understand it, there will be nothing specific under QMV that was not there before, but, of course, it was not under the energy legal base. It was under the other provisions that I have tried to describe.</p>

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="08051462000219"></a><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="08051462000425"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> Is my noble friend describing this chapter or article as a purely consolidation measure and not one that will extend QMV to new areas of energy policy?</p>

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="08051462000220"></a><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew30"></a><b><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="08051462000426"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am cautious in how I reply, but my understanding is that that is the position. There are no proposals to be taken under the new energy article, but the Lisbon treaty provides what I continue to describe as a legal base for future action on energy security and promoting renewable energy, as well as further action on what the Committee will want to see&#151;energy market liberalisation.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08051462000221"></a>My noble friend asked also about the Commission&#146;s role. The treaty makes it clear that its member states will maintain the right,</p>
<ul><a name="08051462000252"></a>&#147;to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000236"></a>I shall come back to that important point, which was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Blackwell and Lord Forsyth. The Commission will be able to propose legislation, as it has in the past. This time it will be under the energy legal basis.</p>

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="08051462000222"></a><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew32"></a><b><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew33"></a><a name="08051462000427"></a>Lord Forsyth of Drumlean:</b> Perhaps I am confused and muddled; the noble Lord is, as always, making a very reasonable case for the treaty&#146;s provisions on energy. But if they are so reasonable, why did the Government work so hard to prevent them being included? Was it not one of their objectives not to have these provisions in the treaty? He makes it sound terribly unthreatening. What were the Government worried about when they were fighting so hard, or am I missing something here?</p>

<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="08051462000223"></a><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80514-0006.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="08051462000428"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The noble Lord misses very little. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, could not resist raising that point in moving the amendment, for which I do not blame him. Perhaps I may come to that point later. I hope that I have explained the point raised by my noble friend Lord Rowlands on QMV and the significance of having a separate energy article. To repeat myself, it reflects the growing importance of energy as a major issue in the EU and the connected policy areas of climate change.</p>

<a name="80514-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08051462000224"></a>As I say, the treaty confirms that QMV will continue to apply to the majority of future decisions&#151;not fiscal decisions; I make that clear&#151;made on energy policy. This is in our interests as a country. We are leading the push for greater liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets across the continent which, if implemented fully, could save EU consumers tens of billions of euros a year. Frankly, without QMV we would have made very little progress in liberalising energy markets  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1035"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1035</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and we would not have any chance of securing the package of further liberalisation currently being negotiated. Indeed, without qualified majority voting, it is arguable that the Commission would not have proposed the measures in the first place. But, I repeat, the treaty retains unanimity for fiscal measures, as argued for by us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08051462000225"></a>Amendment No. 119 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, and the linked Amendment No. 120 relate to the control of our energy supplies. The Lisbon treaty does not allow the EU to take control of our oil stocks or reserves. It clearly states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08051462000249"></a>&#147;Such measures shall not affect a Member State&#146;s right to determine the condition for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000237"></a>Declaration 35 to the Lisbon treaty goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051462000253"></a>&#147;Article 176A does not affect the right of the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure their energy supply&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051462000238"></a>So, in answer to noble Lords who posed this crucial question, we are not passing over the power to protect the security of our energy supply&#151;no nation would.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08051462000226"></a>Paragraph 9.34 of the EU Select Committee report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08051462000250"></a>&#147;The insertion of Article 194(2) is important as it helps to define the boundaries between EU and Member States&#146; competence by making clear that Member States retain sovereignty over national energy resources and have the right to determine their energy mix and the structure of their energy supply&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08051462000227"></a>I was asked why we had initially opposed putting an energy article into the treaty. We could not accept in the draft treaty in the convention of 2003&#151;which prepared the now-defunct constitutional treaty&#151;an energy article which we did not think at the time was in our interests. We were concerned that a new article should not restrict what was already possible using other articles&#151;which, as I say, is the way we have done it in the past&#151;but we also wanted to protect our rights over natural oil and gas reserves and make sure that we could act to ensure security of supply in emergencies. We believe that we have secured this in the final text and I have quoted from that part of the treaty. In particular treaty language, it makes it clear that, first, member states determine their own energy mix; secondly, that member states retain control over their own energy resources; and thirdly&#151;and very significantly&#151;all tax issues are decided by unanimity. These safeguards did not exist in the draft treaty that was part of the 2003 convention. That is why we could not accept it.</p>

Does that not provide an ability for the European Union to override all those reassurances if it determines that there is a situation of supply difficulties?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08051475000008"></a>I heard the noble Lords, Lord Wallace and Lord Hannay, assert the virtues of the regional energy market. There is no regional energy market. It is pure imagination to assume that our neighbours, whatever they may say in their rhetoric, are pursuing the free energy market policies required to create such an entity. We know the realities. While the continental champions E.ON, EDF, Iberdola and others are supplying us and taking over our concerns, nobody asks how many French consumers or German consumers are being supplied by British concerns. The answer is none at all. The whole thing is lopsided. Our neighbours in Europe, while talking about common energy policies and drafting them to put into this treaty, are getting on with their own energy policies in quite different ways and doing separate deals with the Russians, as in the case of the Germans, and so on. That is the reality.</p>

If we talk about energy markets while others pursue completely different targets in completely different directions, we will find&#151;as we found with the gas market&#151;that it is impossible to be the liberal island in a larger area that is not liberal and which is governed by completely different principles.

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08051475000011"></a>I was going on to say how much I enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands. He and I served together and had many adventures in the international scene in the distant past. The question that he pressed was, &#147;What do these provisions do?&#148;. That is a true and accurate question indeed. As my noble friend Lord Blackwell said, the treaty provisions&#151;quite aside from whether they do anything; we are still not clear what they do&#151;are extremely vague.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08051475000012"></a>As for the International Energy Agency, we signed up to it and gave certain undertakings. I suppose that we could have walked out on it at any time. I have a personal experience to share with your Lordships. In 1979 I went to Paris and chaired a meeting at which I signed up to various production, output and stock-sharing agreements with our neighbours in Europe in a spirit of solidarity. When I got back to London the then Prime Minister, my noble friend Lady Thatcher, was not at all pleased. In fact she glared at me and said, &#147;David, you are giving away our oil&#148;. These are arrangements that we could have rescinded at any time, but the question in the future is whether our freedom to share our oil resources is in any way further restricted than it is already. Frankly, the IEA is not troubled at all by anything that my noble friend Lord Blackwell is saying. In fact, it provides perfectly adequately for good stock sharing. I do not understand why we need these extra provisions.</p>

In fact, the curious situation is that the British Government, through the mouths of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are urging that the European Union should look at its biofuels policy again. The noble Baroness indicates that some second thoughts might be starting to develop, but the EU Commissioner concerned has said very bluntly that he does not see any connection at all between biofuels policy and rising prices. A number of other quite blunt assertions have been made that if this policy changes at all, it will not be by much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08051475000017"></a>It is therefore not wise for the Government of this country or the government of Europe to commit to an elaborate new legal base to confer further restraints or further centralisation on these vastly complex areas. We need the co-operation of our neighbours through the interconnector, and the enlargement of the French electrical interconnector was one of the things that I authorised in the early 1980s. However, we do not need a lot of further rules and regulations of the kind proposed in the Bill.</p>

If we do not have the strength and the freedom to see that others are on the wrong track and to develop our own pattern and perhaps encourage others to develop theirs, if we bind ourselves by these new regulations and provisions, we are making a grave mistake for the future. We will look back in your Lordships&#146; House and see that that is what we have done.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08051475000024"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments is probing in nature. It tries to tease out the Government&#146;s attitude to the unfortunate situation with the accounts of the European Union and what they think of the role and composition of the Court of Auditors.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08051475000025"></a>In November last year, the EU audit committee refused to sign off the EU accounts for the 13th year in succession. Its 2006 report issued a qualified opinion on EU expenditure, saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000067"></a>&#147;errors of legality and regularity still persist in the majority of EU expenditure due to weaknesses in internal control systems both at the Commission and in Member States&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000048"></a>Please note the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000068"></a>&#147;the majority of EU expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08051475000026"></a>The areas of expenditure on which the court has given an adverse opinion account for something like 57 per cent of the EU budget&#151;nearly &#8364;50 billion. As I think we are still the second biggest contributor to the EU budget, that means that something like  &#8364;5 billion or &#8364;6 billion of the British taxpayer&#146;s contribution is open to fraud.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08051475000027"></a>Just to put a little flesh on that, I should say that agriculture is one of the areas most prone to this abuse. The EU spent &#8364;50 billion funding agriculture in 2006 but, according to the Court of Auditors, &#8364;15 billion was not subject to proper checks. The court found that one-quarter of the payments tested at final beneficiary level revealed overpayments. Nearly a quarter of olive growers in Italy, Spain and Greece have declared at least 5 per cent more olive trees than they owned, in some cases netting significant EU funds. Greece, in particular, came in for severe criticism. Again according to Court of Auditors, something like &#8364;850 million was paid to Greek farmers under what it called &#147;unsatisfactory control conditions&#148;. It also found that 50 per cent of Greek sultana producers should not have qualified for the payments that they received at all. There were high levels of error in the rural development budgets which are supposed to deal with environmental matters. They were aimed mostly at developments for farmers. In seven of the eight cases that the European Court of Auditors investigated, the farmers had not met the necessary commitments to qualify for these grants.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08051475000028"></a>The court also criticised the Commission's oversight of national agencies, such as the Rural Payments Agency, that make the payments to farmers. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, who is not in his  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1040"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1040</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>place at the moment, will recall that example rather painfully. It further found that 1998, 10 years ago, was the last time the Commission updated its records on how much money member states owed the EU budget. The report stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08051475000059"></a>&#147;These involve significant sums of money being repaid to the Community budget ... It should be emphasised that these recoveries to the Community budget are funded by national taxpayers, rather than the beneficiaries who have received Community funds irregularly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08051475000029"></a>Structural funding was another example. The court noticed little improvement in the &#8364;32 billion budget and said that the situation remained similar to previous years&#151;that is, entirely unsatisfactory. Of the projects that the court audited, only 31 per cent were found free from error. It warned that there was a high risk that the project costs were overstated and that there were large numbers of claims for ineligible expenditure. The report states that there is generally a lack of evidence to support the calculation of overheads or the staff costs involved. As well as criticising the member states on the control of these funds, the court also criticised the Commission&#146;s supervision of how the funding was spent. It said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000069"></a>&#147;the Court again found a material level of error in the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, mainly due to reimbursements to beneficiaries who had overstated the costs for projects&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08051475000030"></a>There are a number of really worrying developments there. It is not as if it was just one or two years; this is the 13th year in which the accounts have failed to be passed. The Commission has always tried to say that it is not its problem but is due to the member states not being able to control the budgets or the money that it gives them. It has always said that the responsibility for the fraud is at national level and not with itself. The Court of Auditors comes down quite severely on the Commission on this point. It criticises the Commission for attempting to spin its findings and blame member states.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08051475000031"></a>Article 274 of the Maastricht treaty reminds us of the situation. It is the Commission's direct responsibility to uphold a &#147;sound financial management&#148;. The European Court repeats that by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08051475000060"></a>&#147;Regardless of the method of implementation applied, the Commission bears the ultimate responsibility for the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the European Communities (Article 274 of the Treaty)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000049"></a>The Commission tried to put a positive spin on the report by saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000070"></a>&#147;in significant parts of the EU budget, the Directors-General give a more positive account of the legality and regularity of EU spending than is consistent with the Court&#146;s audit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000050"></a>Coming from one of the European Union&#146;s own bodies, that is quite a damning verdict. I believe that Europe's taxpayers deserve better.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08051475000032"></a>I now turn to the useful report of the European Union Select Committee of 2006. I am very pleased to see the noble Lords, Lord Grenfell and Lord Radice, in the Committee. Of the two reports, I refer to the second one&#151;the committee&#146;s response to the government response to its recommendations; that is, the Government and other bodies mentioned. I want to see whether there is any improvement following the suggestions and recommendations made in this useful  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1041"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1041</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report. It made some good recommendations, as did the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, who sadly is not in his usual place this afternoon. He is a swivel-eyed Europhile, keeping an eye on swivel-eyed Europhobes. He is normally only too pleased to do that. For example&#151;this issue is covered in one of the amendments I am speaking to&#151;he suggested:</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000061"></a>=&#147;We must look once again at the structure of the Court of Auditors itself. With a Court of Auditors for six member states, having one from each member state was okay. It still worked when it was nine, and 10, 12 and 15; but to have a member of the Court of Auditors from each member state in a court of 25, and then 27, each with their own cabinet, creates a top-heavy structure. I hope that Sub-Committee A can at some time return to its excellent work in looking at the Court of Auditors and come up with new ideas on the structure for the audit court itself.&#148; [<I>O</I><I>fficial Report</I>, 5/3/07; col. 93]</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000051"></a>I note that in the treaty there is still a provision for one member of the Court of Auditors from every member state. I do not know whether there is any further thought on that or whether that is slightly arcane and rather like moving the deck chairs around on the &#147;Titanic&#148;&#151;however many members the Court of Auditors has does not seem to make much difference to the EU accounts.</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08051475000033"></a>I want to raise three more points with the Minister, although I do not expect her to answer them this afternoon. She has an enormous brief which she carries out&#151;if I may say so without sounding too smarmy&#151;with great charm and patience. My raise my first point by noting that the committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08051475000062"></a>&#147;We support calls for the European Court of Auditors to produce a list of those Member States demonstrating poor management of European funds&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000052"></a>The Government replied to that by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08051475000063"></a>&#147;The Government would welcome this recommendation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000053"></a>Has this happened? Is there a list of member states demonstrating poor management of European funds? If there is such a list, is the United Kingdom on it?</p>

<a name="80514-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08051475000034"></a>The second recommendation in this report is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08051475000064"></a>&#147;We are strongly in favour of a national Statement of Assurance on the monies disbursed in each Member State.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000054"></a>It goes on to say that the Dutch do this and that we should follow that. The Government reply to that recommendation was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08051475000065"></a>&#147;The Government agrees and announced on 20 November its intention to provide an annual consolidated statement of the UK&#146;s use of EU funds, which would then be audited to international standards by the National Audit Office. Both the consolidated statement and audit opinion would be presented to Parliament and made available to the European Court of Auditors and European Commission&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000055"></a>Again, has this happened? I have not seen such a report presented to Parliament but I stand corrected if it has.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08051475000035"></a>Finally, the committee recommended very sensibly that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000066"></a>&#147;we consider that there is a clear role for national parliaments: not least because in the UK, for example, there is considerable misunderstanding of the real position&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000056"></a>It goes on to say that there is misreporting in the newspapers about the whole thing and that the problem is not really with the accounts but with   


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1042"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1042</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the way it is reported in the Murdoch-ite press so beloved by the Liberal Democrats. The committee said:</p>
<ul><a name="08051475000071"></a>&#147;The Government welcomes this recommendation. It is important to discuss these issues in Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051475000057"></a>Again, has this happened or is it going to happen? I repeat that I do not expect the Minister to reply in detail to these questions this afternoon but perhaps if she cannot do that she could write to me and put a copy of that letter in the House.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08051475000036"></a>Is this not still a rather unsatisfactory position? We have had 13 years of qualified accounts and there does not seem to be any real progress on this. We are told it does not really matter, that it is just a formality and that the EU accounts are absolutely satisfactory but that is not the case. It is a huge amount of money and it is not satisfactorily accounted for by the EU&#146;s own Court of Auditors. I wonder whether the Government have any ideas on how to improve this situation. Perhaps an international firm of accountants could be asked to run an eye over the EU accounts to see what the problem is or perhaps methodological means should be used. Perhaps, in the future, Europe Day could be not 9 May but the day when the European Union accounts are finally approved by the Court of Auditors. I beg to move.</p>

However, perhaps I may first ask him a question. I noticed that he did not say what the purpose of his amendment was&#151;that is, apart from the fact that it gives him the opportunity to speak. I certainly do not understand the amendment. Is he proposing to remove the Court of Auditors or is he proposing ways of improving the Court of Auditors?

That may be an improvement, but I also have a question for the Government. Might there be a better way than using the Court of Auditors? At the moment, European accounts are a very grey area, notwithstanding all the reports that we have had and the questions that have been raised over the years. I repeat: these accounts have failed to be passed for 13 years in succession. There must be a better way of doing things.</p>

I am not certain and that is why I asked the noble Lord to explain the purpose of his amendment. He is right to say that it is a matter of regret that the European Court of Auditors has not been able to give a positive statement of assurance, although he might have mentioned that that does not necessarily indicate that high levels of fraudulent or corrupt transactions have taken place. In addition, Sir John Bourn, who was the head of our National Audit Office, told us that, were he required to do so, he would be unable to give a positive statement of assurance for the UK accounts similar to one that would be issued by the European Court of Auditors. I am not suggesting that this is not a matter of concern but I am suggesting that it should be put in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08051475000042"></a>The noble Lord is also right to say that we were strongly in favour of the introduction of national statements of assurance signed by a Minister and senior civil servants, and, like him, I should like to know what is happening on that front and what the Government are doing about it. Of course, as more than 80 per cent of European funds are dispersed within member states, the Commission alone cannot be held responsible for the irregularity of these transactions. The national Governments have to take responsibility as well.</p>

I recall being told on that occasion that I was the first president of the Budget Council who had ever visited the Court of Auditors; that is a little alarming since 1986 was some 29 years after the foundation of the Community.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08051475000047"></a>The question I want to ask relates to the second unit, for which I was responsible, in relation to procurement and purchasing. As we set that up, we recruited able people from the private sector to come and look at how government entities were handling the ordinary efficiencies of their job. One young man had taken an interest in the costs that were being incurred by the storage of commodities under the CAP and related matters. He realised that the storage was being charged and costed at a rate which was rising in line with the retail price index. He took the trouble to go down and visit the various storage contractors around the country and was very struck by the ubiquity of BMWs in their car parks. As a consequence, he made further inquiries into what the ordinary movement of costs in the storage industry were and discovered that we were going through a happy technological period where the costs were going vertically downward. I am not going to go any further into that issue. I have made the important points about it. What interests me&#151;it embarrasses me that I did not ask the question at the time&#151; is how far there is a system for communication and collation within the Union, either at the level of the Commission, or at the level of the Court of Auditors under which good practice in individual countries is reported on and thereby reflected in other countries within the Union.</p>

It is to probe the arrangements that the EU has to control fraud within its finances. It is very relevant for that matter to be discussed in this Parliament because we contribute about &#163;12 billion a year towards the finances of the European Union. That is taxpayers&#146; money which should be taken proper care of and should not be converted to fraudulent use. So this is an excellent opportunity to discuss this matter, although not at great length.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08051481000002"></a>I remember&#151;as most of us in this Chamber will&#151;the late Lord Bruce of Donington, who spent half his life in investigating the fraud in the EU and the role of the Court of Auditors and how we could improve matters so that fraud did not exist or was at least reduced. Prime Ministers have got involved in this because they are so concerned about it. Margaret Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister, was very concerned; I think she actually mentioned a figure of &#163;6 billion which was converted fraudulently. Various other people, including the Government, are concerned about it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer sees that a lot of the fraud is caused through the CAP, which is one of the reasons he wants to get rid of it.</p>

I do not believe that fraud was involved in the introduction of the poll tax, so I do not see its relevance to our present debate. In any event, that was nothing to do with the EU&#151;it was everything to do with a mistake by a Tory Government, which we all resent, and which the Tory Party has always regretted. That is a diversion from this debate, which is important. A very good Prime Minister who was with it, who understood finance and was very well qualified was concerned about this &#163;6 billion worth of fraud, so we ought to be concerned about it too.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08051481000005"></a>The objective of the amendment is to get the Government involved in finding a different and better means of controlling fraud within the European Union. Our own Public Accounts Committee does quite a good job, but that is not relevant to the EU.</p>

<a name="08051481000006"></a><a name="80514-0008.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80514-0008.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08051481000123"></a>Baroness Ludford:</b> I was rather surprised at what the noble Lord has just said. I agree that member states should be more involved in countering fraud, but the other amendment, which is part of this group, seeks to remove the obligations on the EU institutions in member states to counter fraud. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, asked the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, the reason for the amendment, which appears to seek to abolish the Court of Auditors, and was told that it was just a probing amendment so that we could discuss the matter. Surely that does not justify the other amendment which wants to take out the obligations on the EU institutions of the member states to counter fraud. The new Article 325 in the treaty says that the Union and the member states shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the Union&#146;s financial interests and that member states shall take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the Union&#146;s financial interests as they take to counter fraud affecting their own financial interests. This is a very important part of the treaty. The noble Lord said that we want member states to get more involved in countering fraud, yet the amendment wants to take out the fraud-busting provisions in the treaty, so I am quite puzzled.</p>

They will certainly not be any better unless the Government can tell us exactly how they would proceed under them. What ideas do they have to improve them? I hope that the Leader of the House will be able to tell us exactly what the Government&#146;s view is. We can then perhaps be satisfied and the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, may well want to withdraw his amendment, although that is a matter for him.</p>

To be fair to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, I recognise that he said that this is a probing amendment, tabled to reiterate some of the discussions that have been held before. However, he rather repeated all the points. A feature of the UKIP contributions is the constant, inexorable and relentless repetition of points, even when they are not necessarily accurate. I accept that there is a serious problem with fraud in the EU member states, which has to be tackled.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, said, if we give way all the time&#151;much as I would love to for the purposes of the debate and the exchanges&#151;we just get, at excessive length, the propaganda from UKIP, of which there are two Members, with the independent Labour Member sometimes supporting them. Other colleagues genuinely wish to make progress with the Bill. I feel that a majority of Members&#151;without our being oppressive of the minority views&#151;is in favour of beginning to accelerate the progress of the Committee, albeit in a way that is not undemocratic and does not deprive people of the opportunity of saying a few words. The realistic appraisal is that there is a strong majority in your Lordships&#146; House for the treaty and therefore for passing this Bill. A lot of patience has been shown to the UKIP Members, which I feel they should acknowledge by making shorter speeches. Indeed, I am sorry for the length of my remarks in dealing with that matter.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08051481000013"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, had correctly answered the question that he was asked, he would have said, &#147;I&#146;ll withdraw the amendment and will support the provision in the treaty&#148;. I believe that everyone agrees that the Court of Auditors needs substantially to increase resources. It is now dealing with 27 member states and needs, without going too far overboard and being too expensive, to be a much more powerful body in terms of personnel. The problem of having one person from each member state also needs to be solved, although the main problem relates to the detailed administration travelling down through the member states to the ground.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08051481000014"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, was referring to examples in the United Kingdom when he mentioned the young man, which gives me the opportunity to remind colleagues that there have been cases of fraud in the UK, too, although I mean no disgrace to redound on any British Government. Indeed, the UK

That is partly because of the sad reality that there were certain dodgy people in the City a few years ago who were very good at devising equally dodgy agricultural investment schemes. The combination of our strength in agricultural management as an industry&#151;unlike in Germany, where industry is strong but agriculture has always been weak and fragmented&#151;and the City spivs to whom I referred, although obviously without mentioning any names, was powerful and explosive in creating some interesting and ingenious schemes some 10 to 12 years ago. The reality must be that we should support the Court of Auditors in its work.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08051481000015"></a>Because of time, I will not refer to Amendments Nos. 80A and 85, except to say that they are part of the same picture. The European Court of Auditors has done a good job and the sovereign member states have their own responsibility to respond to the central responsibility of the Commission and the Court of Auditors to ensure that money is managed properly. Putting 27 national public finance and financial management cultures together in the increasingly enlarged European Union is a difficult task for both the Commission and the Court of Auditors. In many ways, they have done a marvellous job. As a Member of the other place, I made various visits to the Court of Auditors; one could only be struck by its efficiency and expertise in dealing with these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08051481000017"></a>Now that I am on my feet, perhaps I may put an idea to the Government. I have put it to them before in these proceedings, but I did not get an answer. My idea is based on our agreement that the Court of Auditors is the least malign of the institutions of the European Union. None the less, it is still part of the EU; it is the EU&#146;s internal auditor. There is  no external auditor as anyone understands that expression for these vast amounts of money that we pour down the throat of this octopus in Brussels. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, there is no equivalent even of our Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<a name="80514-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08051481000018"></a>My idea is that, as a major contributor to this budget, we should simply withhold our contributions until Brussels appoints a major firm of international auditors, chosen by the donor nations, to oversee the accounts of the European Union. If that means standing down the Court of Auditors, so what? As noble Lords will know, we in the UK Independence Party do not mind if the whole thing collapses. However, surely a firm of international auditors appointed to work either alongside the Court of Auditors or in the nation states might take us some way forward. I fear that nothing else will, despite the blandishments of the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and his Europhile friends.</p>

If anything, I thought that he erred on the side of euphemism. He referred to a number of &#147;worrying developments&#148; and said that he found the situation &#147;rather unsatisfactory&#148;. I believe that the situation that we have been discussing is unacceptable and must be resolved as quickly as possible. As he reminded us, the Court of Auditors has not been able to sign off the EU&#146;s accounts for 13 years. One would have thought that, by now, we would have sorted it out.</p>

It is quite clear to me that Amendment No. 79 gives us the opportunity to examine the membership of the Court of Auditors. Should it consist of one national of each member state? Should there be independent members? Is this the right provision? Amendment No. 80A, which we are taking in this group, enables us to examine whether the right words are used. Should they refer only to examining,</p>
<ul><a name="08051481000113"></a>&#147;fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051481000099"></a>or should other areas be included in the terms of reference? Finally, Amendment No. 85 gives us the opportunity to examine the reports of the Court of Auditors. I thought that all the diversion, which took about 10 to 15 minutes, was a little irrelevant. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, does not mind my saying this, as I believe that the committee of which he is a member has done a good job in raising a number of key questions, to which we still await answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08051481000021"></a>The European Commission tends to blame national Governments for why the accounts are not signed off. But the Court of Auditors says it is the Commission, so we really have to examine who is right.</p>

What progress has there been on implementing the action plan? How close do the Government feel that the Commission is to meeting its target of getting the Court of Auditors to sign off a budget by next year?</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08051481000024"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, on what further consideration the Government have given to the recommendation of, among others, the noble Lords, Lord Grenfell and Lord Radice, that there should be annual debates on audit and financial matters? In the report, it was discovered that Spain and the UK account for more than half of the quantifiable errors in structural policies in the 2006 annual report. What have we done to improve that?</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08051481000025"></a>These are really important issues because this is one of the areas where, outside this House, our vision of Europe is always attacked&#151;particularly by some of the press&#151;for what has happened.

I am aware that we had quite a lengthy debate earlier in Committee and I will therefore not repeat all the things that I said before. I will take those as read for the purpose of this debate, but will try to deal with the questions that have been raised. I love the idea that I might be able to satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, on an issue to do with Europe. I fear that that will never ever happen&#151;if it does, the drinks are on me.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08051481000027"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, very eloquently said in his support of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, and his amendment, this is an important issue and one that concerns the UK Government. I know that noble Lords will also not mind if I make clear that we have to make a very important distinction between fraudulent activity and activity of errors. In his references to the UK and Spain, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, described errors. That does not mean that errors should not be put right, but I would not want noble Lords to think that the position held by the European Union in the main is to do with fraud. That is not to diminish the issue of fraud in people&#146;s minds, but to be absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08051481000028"></a>It is clear that most of the irregularities and errors are resolved after the reports come out. In other words, these issues are not about finances going astray but are rather issues of not complying strictly with the rules and regulations that apply, and therefore are dealt with. None the less, I do not think the figure is 31 per cent as the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, said&#151;only 40 per cent is able to be signed off at present. I am not trying to suggest that these are not important issues, but a lot of the ways in which they can be dealt with are by making sure that member states and the Commission take responsibility for ensuring that they fulfil their obligations properly, rather than making assumptions about fraud, although that plays its part.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, asked about the production of a list. He asked me three questions and I will try to answer him as fully as possible. First, there is not yet a list, as such. I will let him know if I can find out any more information about whether there are any plans for such a list. I will copy that letter to any of your Lordships who participated in the debate and to the Library as well, but as far as I am concerned there is not a list.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08051481000030"></a>We want to make sure that we continue to press for these issues to be dealt with properly and appropriately. The UK has played an important role&#151;for example, in setting up the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF. It is a very active anti-fraud office and has had successes. It has looked at complaints where, for example, more than &#8364;20 million has been wrongly claimed and has been able to reclaim that money, at flax producers in 2001 where there had been a false declaration that straw was unsuitable for processing, and at all aspects of fisheries and so on. It has been able to deal with examples of fraud very effectively. We were instrumental in making sure that we had an EU anti-fraud office.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08051481000031"></a>I have already said that we are concerned to make sure that we play our part. We will be publishing a consolidated statement on the use of EU funds in the UK. That will be audited by the National Audit Office and will give Parliament a greater role in scrutinising it. The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, asked whether that had yet been published. It will be published soon, but we are waiting for the National Audit Office to finalise its work; once that is ready the statement will be published&#151;but it rests with the NAO, not the Government at present.</p>

A progress report has been produced and most of its points have now been dealt with. The Commission was going to produce a further report on the implementation later this year. As the noble Lord indicated, Mr Balls said in another place that it is the Commission&#146;s objective to try to strive for a positive statement of assurance by 2009 as well. There is clearly an impetus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08051481000033"></a>In our negotiations on the reform treaty and the constitution which preceded them, the UK has been keen to make as much progress as possible and we have put forward positive suggestions. I do not accept the proposal made by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, that we should simply withhold the money. That is not the right approach. I can understand why he would feel that even the most dire consequences of so doing would not matter, but that is not the way that we should try to ensure that we get a better outcome and more satisfactory progress.</p>

It is a very important question and I mouthed as much to him, because if we can get more progress in spreading good practice that would be a better proposition. The

Sweden has also announced that it too will be doing so, or something similar in any event. We hope that other areas will follow suit and that being able to see what is being done across member states will be a good way of demonstrating good practice.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08051481000035"></a>We also have various working groups. There is a working group on Article 280 which is trying to look at co-operation and the prevention of fraud where good practice and best practice across member states plays its part. Good practice is beginning to be seen as a way of combating at least the irregularities of the issues before the European Court of Auditors and the European Union.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08051481000036"></a>The scrutiny committees of both Houses have commented on the report of the Court of Auditors. The Commission recently issued a report of member states&#146; responses made to it in the 2006 ECA report, which was considered in the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee in March 2008. The committee recommended a general debate. I agree with noble Lords that it is very important to make sure that Parliament is able to debate, not just through this treaty but in more general terms, what is happening on these important issues. I hope that the work of the National Audit Office, when we get it, will provide another opportunity for the committees to consider the matter and perhaps recommend to the House through the usual channels whether we need to debate those matters further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08051481000037"></a>The UK has been very keen to push forward proposals and think about how we might reform the European Court of Auditors. Perhaps, as noble Lords have said, a committee that was set up originally for nine member states now doing the same thing for 27 has a large task. Perhaps there is a better way in which to do that, with an executive board of auditors-general and a more strategic approach. We will continue to press on that. It is clear from the discussions that I have had and from looking through the detail, not least in response to thinking about these amendments, that a lot of work is under way. While it is difficult to see how we can get 100 per cent certainty from the European Court of Auditors, with 27 member states and a Commission&#151;not because of fraud but because of irregularities&#151;the more that we can spread good practice, the more we can push to ensure that the auditing position is the best that it can be. The more that member states and the Commission take responsibility for ensuring the best possible practice and the best way in which to root out any fraudulent activity, then so much the better.</p>

He did not contribute anything to the debate. He said that he wanted to get on with the debate and then spoke for longer than I took on my introductory remarks. I cannot think that that added to the debate at all. Why I wanted to intervene was because he accused me of saying things that were not accurate; I believe that that was his gist. I refute that utterly. Everything that I said came either from the report from the European sub-committee of this House, or from the report of the European Court of Auditors, so what I said was entirely factual and absolutely nothing to do with any propaganda, as he may have feared. I fear that it is the true state of European Union finances at the moment, and nothing fanciful.</p>

I should like to deal with the matter in more depth.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08051481000055"></a>Our concerns with the possibility of financial penalties being imposed on the UK are, of course, inextricably linked with our concerns over just how feasible it will be to exercise our right not to opt-in. The amendment would give us the opportunity to examine the financial penalties consequent on the UK opting in or out of any of the Lisbon treaty provisions. These concerns are entirely shared by the European Scrutiny Committee, which has of course on several occasions reported on the uncertain consequences of exercising this right, and on our ability to safeguard the interests of the UK.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08051481000056"></a>These financial penalties will be levied on the UK if our refusal to opt into an amended measure makes the existing measure inoperable, so the whole package has to be disregarded. The Government will no doubt respond that the provisions allow for only &#147;necessary and unavoidable&#148; financial consequences to be charged to the UK, in what I know they regard as the highly unlikely event of the provisions being implemented. But how can the Minister and her colleagues know this? There is no consensus on what future provisions for integration in this area may look like, so how can we predict whether we will wish to opt in or not? To add to this, the decisions on the inoperability of an existing measure, and on what the &#147;necessary and unavoidable&#148; financial consequences are, are both to be made by QMV&#151;so again, we have no control over exactly what our European neighbours might choose to make us do.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08051481000057"></a>The chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, Michael Connarty, was utterly clear in his opinion of these provisions when questioning the Foreign Secretary on the matter. He said,</p>
<ul><a name="08051481000114"></a>&#147;do not pretend that this is not a bullying tactic by whoever proposed it to pressurise the UK ... These are bullying clauses and I am shocked that you try to defend them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051481000102"></a>I await the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08051481000058"></a>It is unlikely that the Government will be persuaded by me when they were not necessarily persuaded by one of their own colleagues, but I would like to hear them at least attempt to explain why these provisions were allowed to remain in. I beg to move.</p>

Noble Lords will know that we already have the capacity in some areas to exercise the opt-in and that I exercised or declined to exercise the opt-in when I was a Minister in what is now the Ministry of Justice. I am, then, quite familiar with the process involved here. I am also well aware that, in securing this big and important change, the UK Government expanded our ability to opt into the entire justice and home affairs arena. I believe that is important for the

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08051481000061"></a>Having got that security, it is important to recognise that there are implications for the European Union&#146;s entire operation. Personally, I think it quite reasonable that the implications of getting such security are considered by the whole Union. In so doing, it is reasonable to say that if a member state is actively engaged in a European Union operation and decides that, as a consequence of changes having been made in the collapse of the Third Pillar and the move to the First, it no longer wishes to participate, should that operation become inoperable then there will be consequences facing the other 26 member states if a process&#151;an IT system, perhaps&#151;no longer functions at all.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08051481000062"></a>Those consequences would, clearly, result from the UK&#146;s decision. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, might well agree that it is difficult to think of real examples of that. I cannot think of any where that would currently be the case, yet just as one is always trying to think strategically about the consequence of the UK&#146;s involvement, so it is quite reasonable to think strategically about the UK taking a decision not to participate in something.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08051481000063"></a>These are measured proposals within the treaty. To be clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, elegantly laid out, where the test is &#147;inoperable&#148;, could that be defended in court and could we argue against it? Yes, it could be defended but the decision would have to be that it was inoperable. It would then be decided by qualified majority voting whether, as the noble Lord says, we needed to bear the financial costs in consequence. Before the European Union could demand anything of the UK, there are those very high tests, so I disagree with my honourable friend Mr Connarty, as I am sure that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary did in responding to him. I cannot remember his exact response, but I am sure he did that.</p>

<a name="80514-0009.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08051481000064"></a>I am clear that this is about not bullying but ensuring that, if we and the European Union were in that position, we are all clear that there are consequences for us all. I have no difficulty with what is proposed, and I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied with that response and feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The Minister says that it is difficult to work out the situations that might occur, but I am sure that a particular Minister, before agreeing to these provisions, would have received a brief that contained all sorts of possibilities.

It would be quite reasonable, then, to argue that the UK should cover the costs of taking its own staff away or of settling their contracts, which would disappear, et cetera. I do not believe that there are any more, but if I find any then I will certainly send them to the noble Lord. He would expect me to say that, and I would do so.</p>

I fully accept&#151;although I may not like it&#151;that, where the UK agrees to opt in to a measure on freedom, security and justice and then passes a law to apply that measure here, we will be signing up to the jurisdiction of the European Court on any measure in that area.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08051481000081"></a>Indeed, as we noted during the week, the European Court can take the UK Government to task if it believes that they have not implemented a measure effectively in the UK. The question that follows is: if there is a dispute, who decides which law applies in the UK? Can someone apply to the UK courts for a court interpretation of the will of the UK Parliament, or is the UK court system trumped by the European Court of Justice, which has a superior position in interpreting that will?</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08051481000082"></a>Moreover, if the UK Parliament responded to an ECJ judgment by passing a new law that made explicit what the provisions of that law were meant to be in the United Kingdom, would the UK court system uphold the will of this Parliament, or would it regard itself as having to uphold decisions by the European Court of Justice? It is important that we are clear on these issues at this point.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08051481000083"></a>In the area of freedom, security and justice, where we may not have opted in, judgments will be made and precedents developed within the rest of the European Community and it is quite possible, following precedent, that those judgments may be taken as setting precedents. Then we have the situation that, even in an area where we have not opted in, our legal system may start to define UK law based on judgments elsewhere in the European community. Much of that is normal process, but if our UK courts are asked to interpret a law according to a law passed by the UK Parliament, can we be clear that the UK Parliament&#146;s law will take precedence over the importation of precedents from the European legal system? Will judgments in the area of security, freedom and justice&#151;where we have opted in&#151;to do with cross-border disputes, as all measures under that area are supposed to be, nevertheless become precedents that become a determining factor in the UK legal system?</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08051481000084"></a>Then we come on to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights which, as we know, has the same effect in the UK as elsewhere, despite our protocol, and is binding in its consequences. The question arises of whether it can be used as an appeal mechanism to appeal against UK laws on the basis that a UK law passed by the UK Parliament offends, in the eyes of the European Court of Justice at least, against some of the measures in it. If so, will the European Court of Justice have the final say on the matter or will it be the UK courts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08051481000085"></a>I am not a lawyer, and I confess that many of these issues puzzle me. I have listened to many lawyers arguing them without coming to a clear resolution. My amendment attempts to put this matter beyond doubt by stating:</p>

This amendment is as direct, clear and, I respectfully suggest, potentially destructive as any of the other amendments before your Lordships today. There is no way that a regional system of justice can avoid accepting the principle of uniformity. It is essential in the European Union that there should be a court that will give a final interpretation and a final determination on questions of European law. Those decisions must be applicable in every member state of the European Union. That principle of law has been applied for 50 years. It is a principle that, until this amendment, I had not heard challenged with quite such directness. The noble Lord is, of course, perfectly entitled to do so, and I respect his view, but it would mean that in future&#151;leaving aside the areas that he says he would accept as being within the remit of the European court&#151;there can be no area in which any decision of the European court can lay down a principle that must be followed by the national courts. If the principle in this amendment is to apply in the United Kingdom, it should also apply in the member states, and we should now have not six, not 15, not even 25, but 27 and perhaps more judgments and definitions given by the courts of all the countries. The chaos would be absolute. I respectfully submit that this amendment is not one that the Committee should contemplate for a moment accepting or giving  effect to.</p>

I remember with great affection that it is half a century since, sitting on the bed of Queen Victoria at Trinity College, Cambridge, he attempted to teach me the history of the law of assumpsit. For the past 50 years, ever since being his pupil, I have sat at his feet. There is no greater living authority than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, when it comes to the relationship between European Union law and this country&#146;s domestic law. I shall therefore be extremely brief and shall not repeat anything he said.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1058"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1058</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08051481000089"></a>Ever since 1972, when we joined the Common Market, it has been quite clear in the European Communities Act, which was crafted principally by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, that Section 2 requires all three branches of government in this country, where European law reigns supreme, to give full effect to that law whether passing laws, interpreting laws or giving effect to those laws. It was clear at the time, it was made clear in a case I once argued before Lord Denning called McCarthy&#146;s v Smith, it was later made absolutely clear in the Factortame case by the Law Lords and made clearer yet again in the case involving the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Secretary of State for Employment. In all those cases, a provision in an Act of Parliament was in conflict with the paramount law of the European Community. For example, in the Factortame case, as everyone knows, a provision in the Merchant Shipping Act discriminated on grounds of nationality in the area of fisheries. That case went to Luxembourg and came back again&#151;it went several times&#151;but it was made quite clear by Lord Bridge that the Merchant Shipping Act&#146;s discriminatory provisions had to be displaced in favour of the binding European rule of equal treatment without nationality discrimination. To take quickly another example, in the EOC case, the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 stated that people had to work so many hours a week in order to get employment benefits. That was in conflict with the European equality directive which requires equality for women without discrimination as it hit disproportionately at women who could not work full time, and the Law Lords again decided that the domestic provision had to be read and given effect so as to remove the sex discrimination against women. There is no doubt whatever about the relationship. The sovereign Parliament can decide to repeal the 1972 Act, but could do so only if we were to leave the European Union. Unless it did so, the position is as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, has stated, far more eloquently than I can. That is the first main point: parliamentary supremacy gives way, because we exercised parliamentary sovereignty in 1972, to the paramount law of the European Union, only where that paramount law reigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08051481000090"></a>As far as the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concerned, the report of the Select Committee of this House, to which I was privileged to contribute, made it clear beyond argument, article by article, that the charter posed no threat whatever to our internal legal system. No one has pointed to any provision where that could arise. It does not give rise to a problem.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08051481000091"></a>Finally, I will speak briefly to Amendment No. 127 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Owen. That will save my doing so again later. I will explain briefly why&#151;with great respect&#151;it is, for similar reasons, misconceived. Amendment No. 127 seeks to allow anyone living in the United Kingdom to apply to the High Court for a declaration on any question of interpretation of the Lisbon treaty, even though there is no need to determine the rights or liabilities of the applicant. On that first point, that is entirely a matter for our own courts at present. I have no doubt that, in  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a proper case, they would think it right to grant a declaration on matters of interpretation.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08051481000092"></a>The second point is that a Minister or others can apply. That is otiose&#151; unnecessary&#151;because they could already do so under our well-known principles of administrative law. The third point, which is the nub of the amendment, is the suggestion that an interpretation of the treaty, made on an application brought under this section, must be consistent with the interpretation given to the treaty by the UK Parliament at the time the Act was passed. That is unlawful under the law of the European Union because it would seek to make this Parliament master of the interpretation to be given of the treaty, rather than the European Court of Justice, which is the final court on questions of that kind. In other words, it would be another way of seeking to invoke parliamentary sovereignty in a way that was unlawful under European law.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08051481000093"></a>Sub-paragraphs (4), (5) and (6), which I will not bore the Chamber by reading, are all well-recognised in existing administrative law and procedure, and would be unnecessary. The vice of Amendment No. 127, like that of the amendment we are now concentrating on, is that it seeks to elevate Parliament into a position contrary to the European Communities Act 1972, and contrary to the supreme law of the European Union.</p>

<a name="08051481000094"></a><a name="80514-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80514-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051481000143"></a>Lord Owen:</b> I hesitate to intervene, particularly after two speeches by a noble Lord and a noble and learned Lord whose views I respect and who, I am fully aware, know a great deal more about this subject than I do. I have been studying this legislation for a long time, every bit as long as the noble Lord and the noble and learned Lord. At one time I had the resources of a major department of state behind me. I must say that I do not think the noble Lord and the noble and learned Lord are correct. I do not disagree with the law of this land and their interpretation of the 1972 Act, but the law of the land in other EU member states is different. There is nothing that can be said to be against the treaty of Rome, or any subsequent amendments, that can prevent this country harmonising its laws with those of other countries.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08051481000095"></a>I refer specifically to the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany. It is true that that court preceded the Federal Republic of Germany&#146;s accession to the treaty of Rome. That is a fact. Nevertheless, it was open to the German Parliaments at the time of accession to the treaty of Rome to rule that there was an inherent conflict between the continuation of the Federal Constitutional Court, the principles of the treaty of Rome and the creation of the International Court of Justice. They did not do so. I could cite other member states, which have constitutional courts. By far the pre-eminent, and the one that is most respected in the European Union, is the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, so I will confine my arguments entirely to that existing court.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08051481000096"></a>I ask the Minister to confirm that there is already a case before the German Constitutional Court relating to the treaty of Lisbon. A Member of Parliament, Peter Gauweiler of the Christian Social Union, part of the governing coalition, moved that the treaty of Lisbon weakened democracy in European politics, especially  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1060"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1060</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>national parliaments&#146; right to a say, and brought a case before the Constitutional Court. As I understand it, although I am not sure because I found it difficult to trace, the case is still before that Constitutional Court. Technically speaking, it may delay German ratification of the treaty of Lisbon. It is open to the Federal German President, Horst Kohler, to sign off the treaty if it is ratified by the German Parliament, despite not yet having had a judgment from  the Constitutional Court, but it would be unusual to do so.</p>

<a name="80514-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08051481000097"></a>A similar case was made before the German Constitutional Court at the time of the ratification of the European Union constitution. It was widely felt that it would not be wise, or necessarily accepted by the then German President, for the German Parliament to ratify while that case lay before the Constitutional Court. In the event, because of the French and Dutch votes on the referendum, it was put to one side and no final decision was taken. I also understand that the president of the German Constitutional Court, Hans-J1/4rgen Papier, has called the provisions in the Lisbon treaty intended to strengthen the role of national Parliaments &#147;ineffective&#148; and &#147;impractical&#148;. He has therefore given, I presume, an indication that there is at least a case to be considered before the German Constitutional Court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08051481000098"></a>The absolute nature of the way the noble Lord presented his case, in terms of the European Union as a whole, is not correct. I accept that the way the British Parliament considered the 1972 treaty excludes it. Therefore, it can be changed only by an Act of Parliament.</p>

As he rightly says, it is not the first time that challenges of that kind have arisen in the German constitutional court. The same applies, for example, in the Irish Supreme Court where there have been similar challenges. In this country, there have been attempts also in litigation before our courts to challenge, for example, the treaty of Maastricht, the treaty of Nice and others. Is the noble Lord aware that all those attempts, which in the main have been unsuccessful, have been subject to the paramount law of the European Union, as interpreted and applied by the supreme constitutional court of the European Union&#151;the Luxembourg court? It is beside the point whether there is satellite litigation attempting in Germany or Ireland or here or anywhere else to make challenges. The main point is that the only court that can interpret and apply the supreme law of the European Union is the Court of Justice.</p>

I think that the noble Lord has allowed his personal views to sway him on the actual interpretation of the German constitutional court.

It is put there to uphold the German constitution at all stages. If they interpret it

They take it into account and they are particularly careful about it. Indeed, it has been made clear. The Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said that in some circumstances she is contemplating making a specific amendment to federal law to take account of this case. I do not want to go on too much on this. I have conceded to any noble Lord the basic fundamentals that our 1972 Act gave complete supremacy to European law.</p>

There are very few absolutes. It is a fact of life, although many people do not like to accept it, that the Luxembourg compromise is still accepted by many member states as existing. There are other purists who argue that the Luxembourg compromise has no legal standing and does not exist. As recently as the treaty of Maastricht, it was necessary for the French Prime Minister to assure the French Assembly that the Luxembourg compromise still existed in terms of the French Government. There are number of other inconsistencies like this. It is not quite as clear cut as the lawyers in this Committee seem to wish to think.</p>

No one in any member state that I know of or any British Government has ever said that the Luxembourg compromise was part of European Union law. They said that it was part of European Union practise and part of the policy of the Governments who supported it. In any case, the Luxembourg compromise is not a compromise. It is an agreement to disagree between those member states who take one view and those who take another. It really is not relevant to the discussion on this group of amendments, which is about the application of European Union law.</p>

The French Prime Minister came down to the Assembly and gave a very clear, legal interpretation that it had not been changed by the Maastricht treaty and that it was still perfectly legal for the French Government to invoke the Luxembourg compromise. If the noble Lord reads the debate, he may like to come back on the issue. Perhaps, because of my views on these issues, I may have studied it more than he has in this instance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08051488000017"></a>Everyone likes to try to believe that the European Union is a tightly constructed and perfectly legal system. It is not. It is, above all, a negotiation between member states, which is why I would urge the Committee to have a look at the new clause. I know that I cannot possibly push this through with the resources that I have available. All I can ask is for the major parties to have a look at it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08051488000018"></a>Turning to points of detail, this new clause is drafted to make it clear. It is an educative exercise and subsections (2), (4), (5) and (6) of the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 127 may not be necessary. The noble Lord is right to say that the essence lies in subsection (3). But behind it lies a very important question. Experience since 1972 has made many of us realise that while we may pass a treaty amendment in the British Parliament, and genuinely believe at the time that we do so that it means one thing, we have seen cases&#151;the classic example is the health and safety directive&#151;where the interpretation of the words of the treaty as understood by both Houses of the UK Parliament were later changed by the European Court of Justice in defiance of what almost everyone believed was the correct interpretation. It is because of that that many of us worry about having no way of challenging the interpretation of the European Court of Justice.</p>

<a name="80514-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08051488000019"></a>Whether we like it or not, our law is founded on the basis that the clarification of law by the courts, which goes on in many different ways, relates back to what is said in this House about the law of the land. It may not be perfect but it means that we have some control over the lawyers.</p>

When judges in this country have to decide what is the intention of legislation, they do not do so on the basis of what is said in this House or the other House&#151;that is neither here nor there. They do it on the basis of interpreting and applying the objects and purpose of the legislation and the language of the legislation read by them as independent courts. It is a mistake to think that anything that is said by Ministers or anyone else about what they think the law is becomes what the law means. Separation of powers means that it is up to the judges to decide that and not up to us as lawmakers. We make the law but the judges interpret and apply it.

But in regard to the framing of those words and the way that they are put&#151;as the noble Lord knows perfectly well because he has been on the other side in government&#151;parliamentary draftsmen take Ministers through with extreme care what the words are meant to mean. The interpretation and explanation of the words by Ministers is taken very seriously because it is thought to have implications for how a future judge and court will interpret those words. But if what the noble Lord is saying is right, then we might as well give up having debates, go home and let the judges and the lawyers decide everything.</p>

<a name="80514-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08051488000022"></a>Fortunately, we have a system in this country where there is an input from the normal, average person about what words mean. This is one reason why I have always thought that you could go to a court and argue that the words mean a certain thing. But, of course, the judges will decide. They will not be bound by Parliament&#151;nor should they be&#151;but, equally, I do not think that they ignore Parliament. This is obviously touching some sensitive nerves but I still come back to the fact that legislation has been passed as treaty amendments and interpreted by the European Court of Justice in a way that we did not consider the words meant at the time.</p>

<a name="80514-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08051488000023"></a>I considered whether or not to try to create a constitutional court and I came out against it. We now have the Supreme Court&#151;in name but with hardly any considerable change in judgment&#151;and, having taken on this well-respected name with all the authority it incurs, it would not be unreasonable for the British Parliament to consider, in the light of experience since 1972, whether we need some further safeguarding of the terms of the wording of treaty amendments. If the Supreme Court made a judgment that the interpretation of the European Court of Justice did not correspond with the intention of and the explanation to the British Parliament, there would be a clash. Such a situation would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08051488000024"></a>I return to the question of the double heading of the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council, an issue that I have raised before in this House and which I still see as a potentially great danger. I wrote to the noble Baroness explaining why the Dutch Government, in March 2004, took the view on the European constitution&#151;this is my own translation&#151;that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08051488000078"></a>&#147;The Government also shares the opinion [of parliamentary factions] that the possibility should be kept that in future the President of the Commission can also be the President of the European Council&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000068"></a>They went on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="08051488000089"></a>&#147;The texts before us leave this possibility open&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08051488000025"></a>In addition, the Dutch Government&#146;s internal legal advice was that Article 21(3) of the then European constitution stipulated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051488000090"></a>&#147;The President of the European Council may not hold a national mandate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000069"></a>and should be read explicitly as only excluding national mandates and not other&#151;read European&#151;mandates. Since then there have been further wording changes  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1065"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1065</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduced, predominantly by the British Government with, I think, the understanding of the Dutch Government. I asked the noble Baroness to see whether she could, through bilateral talks with the Dutch Government, reach some understanding and a common interpretation of this. We have good and friendly relations with the Dutch Government. They are now much more attuned to our view about the nature of the European Union&#151;they are not the federalists they once were&#151;and it is not unreasonable that we should get some explanation from the British Government of the Dutch Government&#146;s view. In international law the Dutch Government is extremely well respected, and I would find it much easier to live with the present treaty if I thought that the Dutch Government shared the British Government&#146;s interpretation of double heading.</p>

<a name="80514-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08051488000026"></a>But double heading is another example of where, despite constant promises by the noble Baroness&#151;I know she has gone into this very carefully&#151;and genuine assurances by the British Government that it is impossible, there are still at this moment campaigners in Brussels who are arguing that this is the next step, and they believe that it is possible to do it within the treaty. That is a fact. You can go on to the blogs of the people who believe it and read the speeches made about it by serious European politicians. Every statement that the noble Baroness makes is helpful to this House, but it is not sufficient. We could still have an interpretation put on the wording in the treaty which is diametrically opposed to the assurances that we have received from the present Government. It may not come in 10 years&#146; time or in 20 years&#146; time, but this challenge will come. For that reason and for many others, one of the ways to deal with it would be through the amendment that I have tabled.</p>

My opponent for the prosecution had raised the issue that the clear words of the statute did not represent the intention of Parliament and I quoted to the judge the words of the Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, which made absolutely clear what the Government had in mind in passing that legislation. The Lord Justice presiding said to me that that was very interesting, but that there was no obvious difficulty in interpreting the clear words of the statute, that various things had been said in Parliament on all sides and that if the courts started to take notice of what was said in Parliament in that sense, they would be completely confused. I was surprised, because I thought that, on the Pepper v Hart principle, the words of the Attorney-General would be accepted as definitive. But there was no difficulty in interpreting the statute, notwithstanding the arguments of my opponent, who sought to put a gloss on it that the Court of Appeal did not accept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08051488000030"></a>My noble friend who explained this was absolutely right that it is with the words of the statute that we are concerned. As early as 1964, long before we entered the European Union, the European Court ruled in the case of Costa that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051488000091"></a>&#147;in contrast with ordinary international treaties, the EEC Treaty has created its own legal system which, on the entry into force of the Treaty, became an integral part of the legal system of the member States and which their courts are bound to apply&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000070"></a>That applies to Germany as to any other country. The court continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08051488000079"></a>&#147;The transfer by the States from their domestic legal systems to the Community legal systems of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights, against which a subsequent unilateral act incompatible with the concept of the Community cannot prevail&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000071"></a>They were clear statements. With those in mind, we entered into the 1972 agreement and passed the European Communities Act 1972, which contained precisely that principle. Shortly afterwards, in 1974, Lord Denning, in the case of Bulmer v Bollinger, said about it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08051488000080"></a>&#147;When we come to matters with a European element, the Treaty is like an incoming tide. It flows into the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back. Parliament has decreed that the Treaty is henceforward to be part of our law ... The governing provision is section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 ... The statute is expressed in forthright terms which are absolute and all embracing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000072"></a>That was a statement of principle two years after the European Communities Act. The rationale for giving primacy to European law, as decided by the European Court of Justice, was expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in his High Court judge days in 1983, in the case of Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Samex. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051488000092"></a>&#147;the Court has a panoramic view of the Community and its institutions, a detailed knowledge of the treaties and of much subordinate legislation made under them, and an intimate familiarity with the functioning of the Community market which no national judge denied the collective experience of the [European] Court of Justice could hope to achieve ... The interpretation of Community instruments involves very often not the process familiar to common lawyers of laboriously extracting the meaning from words used, but the more creative process of supplying flesh to a spare and loosely constructed skeleton. The choice between alternative submissions may turn not on purely legal considerations, but on a broader view of what the orderly development of the Community requires. These are matters which the [European] Court of Justice is very much better placed to assess and determine than a national court&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08051488000031"></a>Those are the views of Lord Denning and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham. They are clear; the legislation is clear. There is no doubt about what it said in 1972, and it incorporated principles that had been expressed by the European Court years earlier in 1964. I am amazed that in 2008 we are still questioning the primacy of the European Court of Justice.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Owen, spoke about the German federal court, but that court made no specific declaration in respect of the primacy of European law, because it is wholly fundamental&#151;there was no need for the German federal court to accept it. The hole in the noble Lord&#146;s argument was that, try as he might, he could not cite a single case&#151;he noble Lord, Lord Lester, cited an array of cases&#151;where the German federal court has overridden the European Court; all he could do, at the high watermark of his submission, was say that there is currently a case before the German federal court&#151;I am surprised that that has not been struck down <I>in limine</I>, as it probably would have been in our own jurisdiction. There was a potential case, too, in respect of Maastricht. But the truth is that the Community law is paramount; indeed, our own courts would make references to the European Court of Justice for preliminary rulings in respect of that interpretation.</p>

I know that she will say that we debated this before but will she again explain the effectiveness of the protocol in the light of the noble and learned Lord&#146;s statement and the particular point raised by my noble friend Lord Kingsland? What happens when a judgment is made in a country outside the UK&#151;another country where the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a different effect? How can we avoid law made in other countries having to be applied in that sense and in the light of a judgment made in this country? What the noble and learned Lord has said might be interpreted as strongly supportive of the point made earlier by my noble friend Lord Kingsland about the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

If the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, were put to the vote and carried, and the House of Commons agreed to it, we would have to leave the European Union, which from my point of view would be desirable. But I do not believe that people understand how far we have become subject to European law. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, made it clear that matters European are becoming greater and greater. With every treaty that we pass, their powers become greater. European law becomes greater. Therefore, the position of our courts and of this Parliament is consequently weakened.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08051488000081"></a>&#147;Acts of Parliament and decisions of our courts have been set aside and rendered invalid by decisions of the European Court, which is superior in all matters of EEC law not only to British Courts, including the House of Lords, but also to Parliament where their Acts past, present or future have been, can be and will be declared illegal by an overweening court sitting in a foreign capital&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/7/86; cols.1055-1060.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000073"></a>Nothing can be clearer than that.</p>

He said that we agree not only to laws passed by Parliament; we also agree to treaty law in Parliament. That is why we are discussing the Lisbon treaty. It goes through the Commons, comes to this House, we debate it and eventually agree the various provisions. It is agreed by the Government and that is that. That is the position as the Government understand it. However, the noble Lord was right to say that that is no longer the case. When we agree these laws, they are then liable to be changed by the European Court of Justice without recourse to the agreement of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08051488000043"></a>I have a quick example from when Mr Major was Prime Minister. He was shocked. He went to Maastricht and returned, notoriously saying, &#147;game, set and match&#148;. He then found that things were changed not by Parliament, the Commission or the European Parliament, but by the European Court of Justice. He wrote to Mr Santer, the then President of the Commission saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08051488000083"></a>My intention in agreeing to the Protocol on Social Policy at Maastricht was to ensure that social legislation which placed unnecessary burdens on businesses and damaged competitiveness could not be imposed on the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08051488000084"></a>&#147;The other Heads of State and Government also agreed that arrangement, without which there would have been no agreement at all at Maastricht&#148;.</p>

This appears to mean that legislation that the United Kingdom had expected would be dealt with under the Protocol can in fact be adopted under Article 118a.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08051488000086"></a>This is contrary to the clear and express wish of the United Kingdom Government, and goes directly counter to the spirit of what we agreed at Maastricht&#148;.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08051488000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, was quite right to highlight this. Regardless of what Parliament agrees, what the electors elected Parliament for and what the European legislature or the Commission say, the European Court of Justice can, unilaterally, change agreed European arrangements. That is very important. I would be interested to hear what the noble Lord has to say about that in his response, and, indeed, what the Minister will say now.</p>

If a former Foreign Secretary does not today understand the extent of the trap that we are in with our European Union membership, then how can ordinary members of the public? I will spare your Lordships the quote from Section 3 of our European Communities  Act 1972 because I have already put it on the record in these proceedings. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Owen, that I support his amendment. I fear that the lawyers in this House are absolutely right. I put it to the noble Lord that the only way out is the door.</p>

This has been a fascinating debate. I thank my noble friend Lord Blackwell and the noble Lord, Lord Owen, for having stimulated a most useful occasion, highlighting some of the constitutional aspects of the issue that we face. </p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08051488000047"></a>My noble friend Lord Lamont went straight to the point. As a result of what has been said in this debate, the Minister needs to tell us exactly what the protocol&#146;s effect is. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, stated very clearly that it is essential to have a court to give final interpretation on European law. The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, highlighted that the paramount law of the European Union must prevail where it reigns. Where it does, Luxembourg is supreme. My noble friend Lord Blackwell has done us all a great service by highlighting the issue. We profoundly object to the extended jurisdiction that will be given to the European Court of Justice in relation to the police, judicial co-operation and criminal law. I will just say to him that we would like to give further consideration as to whether his amendment is the best way forward in providing a safeguard for our criminal justice system in this area.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08051488000048"></a>The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, was hugely helpful in reflecting on a sort of paramount, panoramic picture of European law; it also particularly came across from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, gave us all a fascinating insight into the internal workings of not only the German federal constitutional court, but proceedings in France.</p>

Therefore, under this treaty and arrangements for it here&#151;the amendment against it has been withdrawn so we cannot debate it&#151;the democratically elected Chamber and this House will together, with the Government, for the first time, be able to challenge a measure for overreach.</p>

<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="08051488000050"></a><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051488000121"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> Yes, the European Court has the final word&#151;I am not quite sure what point the noble Lord was trying to make. However, I know that we want to move on, so let me just say that the implications of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, are sufficiently far-reaching to require additional examination before we can consider such a potentially profound overhaul of our legal arrangements.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08051488000051"></a>I have to say to my noble friend Lord Lamont that I am a lawyer&#151;a real one, as many colleagues in the solicitor&#146;s profession would say&#151;one of the few practising solicitors in this House. Of course, we always have to consider the arguments put forward from barristers on one side and the other&#151;not, I hasten to add, in a judicial way but in a reflective way&#151;when we are seeking to explain the legal position to our clients. Therefore, as a lawyer, I found that the noble Lord, Lord Owen, made a positive contribution on which we would like to reflect.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08051488000052"></a>However, my Amendment No. 159 calls for an annual report to be laid before Parliament on the impact of any preceding rulings of the European Court of Justice on the United Kingdom. This report was called for by our Constitution Committee. I hope that the Government will give that recommendation the respect that it deserves. In giving evidence to the Constitution Committee, the Government laid out all the ways in which the European Court of Justice&#146;s jurisdiction will be expanded by this treaty. The list relates closely to debates we have had in this House on various parts of this treaty. For instance, the charter, the impact of the common foreign and security policy and the increased co-operation on home and judicial affairs are all areas that we have mentioned several times. No doubt we will return to those issues in the future.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08051488000053"></a>It has been made perfectly clear in the contributions that we have been listening to that much of the opposition to these provisions is driven by uncertainty about the impacts of future ECJ judgments. We simply cannot tell whether their powers will be used to drive the European Union towards eventual federation&#151;is that fear unfounded?&#151;or instead whether the European Union will develop with complete agreement between all the participants about their role within it.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08051488000054"></a>The Government, in promoting this Bill, have sought to downplay their inability to predict the future. They confidently proclaim that only positive results will come from the increased remit of the European Court of Justice. However, their optimism has failed to convince many.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08051488000055"></a>This report in Amendment No. 159 will allow the Government to proclaim in future just how wrong we all were in getting so concerned, but it will give Parliament a chance to identify and protect against the undue interference and perceived loss of national independence that may follow. I sense that the general public are very confused about the situation. They are hungry for knowledge about what the EU does and would enjoy the opportunity coming from a debate on that report to learn about the treaty&#146;s effects.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08051488000056"></a>Finally, in this place we have frequently opposed the gold-plating of EU directives&#151;a practice that allows the Government to push unpopular Labour policies through Parliament while refusing responsibility for their impact. As a result, the European Union always bears the blame, in many cases unfairly, for what were Labour additions to a relatively harmless directive. Resentment also builds up because of the perception that it is only the United Kingdom that obeys and pays the full cost. That is a well known myth, but to some extent a very damaging one for those who believe so passionately in Europe.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08051488000057"></a>The Government have frequently claimed that our concerns and those of the public are unfounded because we do not understand the real situation, but they bear a great deal of the blame for any misunderstanding we might have. They have consistently rejected any of the various reporting or clarifying measures that we have proposed. I can only hope that the arguments of the Constitution Committee will be more successful and that Amendment No. 159 will at least meet with a positive response.</p>

I thank all Members of the Committee who have participated, not least those who have tabled amendments in this group. I am conscious that I am all that stands between noble Lords and dinner so I shall try to deal with matters expeditiously, although I intend to cover as much as I can in the full and certain knowledge that this is an issue to which we shall return and continue to debate. Although there have been many contributions, for many noble Lords there has been much food for thought as well, which I sense they will go away and deliberate on. I shall set out as clearly as I can the current position.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08051488000059"></a>I go back to the beginning and to something that I said at Second Reading. Noble Lords need to have this clearly in their minds when considering the European Court of Justice, a much maligned organisation in many of the contributions. Whether noble Lords like it or not, the European Union is an organisation which needs rules; if you have rules you have to be able to enforce them. The European Court of Justice is the mechanism, put crudely, which enforces the rules. Making it effective as a court is in our interests. It ensures that member states respect the European Union rules&#151;that there is a level playing field, particularly for our businesses in the single market, and protection for our citizens in the rights that they have as members of the European Union. I think it helps to destroy, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said, the myth  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that somehow we implement and other nation states do not&#151;that we do it properly and other member states do not.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08051488000060"></a>When member states interpret and apply European treaties, the court&#146;s role is to ensure that European law is observed. The member states make the law. The European Court of Justice does not make the law; that is not its job. Its job is to interpret the law. We will have fully participated in any law that is made in Europe. The European Union in its competences is able to make laws on subjects only with the approval of the member states. We are not absent players; we are part and parcel of the system. That is really important because it is suggested that somehow the European Court of Justice operates on its own, outside the law and outside the European Council of Ministers, as though it were a body that made law. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, said, on a previous day in Committee, although the court has spoken and interpreted the law, that law is binding. The Council can change the law and practice. It may not do so very often but it can do so; that is not beyond it.</p>

<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="08051488000061"></a><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08051488000123"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> Does the Minister agree that in the debate to which she referred, she had to confess that the Council of Ministers had never repealed a law and that, for it to do that, unanimity in it would be required? It is unrealistic; it has never happened and it will not happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="08051488000062"></a><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80514-0012.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08051488000124"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> When I said it might not do it very often, I was referring to the future. It might not do it; it might not do it very often; and it has not done it; but that does not mean that it cannot do it. We just have to be clear what we are describing, but it has the power and the capacity to do that. Unanimity is argued for by most noble Lords opposite as being of great import, so I do not see that as a problem; I see that as a positive, if what the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, usually says about unanimity is right. The European Court of Justice interprets the law. If the Council, in its wisdom, decided that it did not like that interpretation, it has the power and the capacity to change it. That principle is important. It is the same with this Parliament and national courts.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08051488000063"></a>When we joined the European Union, the principle of primacy was already there. It is not new; it has not been invented by this treaty or by Maastricht. It is a fundamental part of having a European Union, where you are trying to apply rules that you have made across the Union. That is very important. If you make rules, you need a mechanism to enforce them, but it is not open to a member state to decide that it does not fancy a certain rule one day and, therefore, will ignore it and change it. There is no point in being part of a Union on that basis.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08051488000064"></a>The Lords Constitution Committee report is often quoted and I shall quote the implications that it has described on this. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="08051488000087"></a>&#147;We conclude that the Lisbon Treaty<I></I>would make no alteration to the current relationship between the principles of primacy of European Union law and parliamentary sovereignty. The introduction of a provision explicitly confirming Member States&#146; right to withdraw from the European Union underlines the point that the United Kingdom only remains bound by European Union law as long as Parliament chooses to remain in the Union&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08051488000076"></a>So the ultimate ability to leave the European Union is there. On a previous day in Committee we debated the withdrawal article in the treaty. If noble Lords do not wish to be bound by European law, that is the way to address the matter. As I have said, it is in our interests and it has been a fundamental principle. In 1972, the then Solicitor&#151;General, now the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe&#151;I hope he will not mind me repeating his words&#151;said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08051488000088"></a>&#147;It would make a nonsense of the necessity for Community law to have the same effect in every member State if the United Kingdom, any more than any other member State, could choose by national law to override what it did not like. The principle of Community law having precedence throughout the Community is one that operates for the mutual benefit of all member States&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/6/72; col. 1317.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051488000077"></a>That is the principle. The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty remains a cornerstone of our constitutional arrangements and is unaffected by ratification of the Lisbon treaty. That, in a nutshell, sets out in our involvement in the European Union.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08051488000065"></a>Let me try to deal with some of the issues that have been raised by noble Lords. In moving the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, raised two examples. The first was whether, if we did not opt in, the UK courts could be influenced by EU law. If we do not opt into a measure in the area of justice and home affairs, it will not form part of our law and, therefore, our courts would not apply it. It is as simple as that. Noble Lords also asked about the European Court of Justice and the charter. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, referred to what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, had said and much has been made of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, raised. I shall try to be as clear and succinct as I can on that.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08051488000066"></a>The charter sets out existing rights. In our previous discussions, we described the backdrop to the charter. The different articles in the charter come from different places: the European Court of Human Rights, EU law or principles in the operation of EU law, and so forth. I shall not go back through all that. The European Court of Justice can apply the charter only to the same extent that it applies the existing rights. That is a critical point. As the UK protocol makes clear, no court&#151;European Court of Justice or other&#151;can use the charter to extend its jurisdiction to attack UK law. I think that is clear and I hope that noble Lords will reflect on that.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08051488000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, made a very interesting contribution. I am glad to hear he has regained his voice. In speaking to Amendment No. 127, he spoke much about other jurisdictions and particularly about the German constitutional court. I hope the noble Lord will not be surprised that I, too, looked at the German constitutional court and at the French courts&#151;the Cour de Cassation and the Conseil d&#146;tat, which are the two courts that have had an interest in EU legislation as well.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="0805153000002"></a>Let me back up a lot of what has been said. I will not enter the lawyers&#146; debate that surrounded that, for obvious reasons&#151;I am not a lawyer and I would not pretend to intervene in that way. I recognise that the German Constitutional Court plays a very particular role. What it does is test legislation and government  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>action against the national written constitution. It therefore has a specific focus. That focus is on the national constitution. This is an important backdrop to understanding what the court does. The Court considers that in principle it can decide on the compatibility of Community law with the German constitution but it has never challenged European Community law.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="0805153000003"></a>Let me give two examples quoted by noble Lords. The court questioned the compatibility of EC law with human rights. The European Court of Justice confirmed that it applied human rights as part of EC law. The German court accepted that, as long as EC law was compatible with its own constitutional safeguards, it would respect the primacy of EC law. That case&#151;the Solange case&#151;was a case that was referred to by a noble Lord on the Liberal Democrat Benches.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="0805153000004"></a>The other example was the question that the noble Lord, Lord Owen, referred to&#151;the Brunner case. The court made clear it could review the compatibility of EU treaties with the German constitution but found no incompatibility. There is a case before the German Constitutional Court at present. There is nothing new in that. These cases have never resulted in a member state being prevented from ratifying a treaty but I am not going to comment on it because it is before the court and I am advised that I should therefore not make any further comment on that.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="0805153000005"></a>Tomorrow I will be going to Peru with Chancellor Merkel. While I am there I will approach her officials to see if I can get any more information about the German Constitutional Court and the current activities. If I do, I will either write to noble Lords or make sure that we have an opportunity to come back to this.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="0805153000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, talked about the Luxembourg compromise. As far as I am concerned, that is well outside the treaty. It is a political determination. It involves, as I understand it&#151;I am sure that noble Lords will leap up to correct me if I am wrong&#151;the situation where a member state feels that there is something so fundamental going on that they ask for a pause or stay in the discussions in order to examine that properly. It is a political commitment&#151;it has no legal status, as I understand it. As far as we are concerned, it still exists. It has not been used, as far as I know, for a while&#151;certainly not by us&#151;but it exists because it is about the politics of nation states working together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="0805153000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, asked about the Dutch position. He is much exercised that I had not yet made contact with the Dutch in order to discuss the double-hatting of the High Representative or the Commission President. I have not done that&#151;like the noble Lord I have huge respect for the Dutch courts and for courts across the European Union&#151;because it is the responsibility of the UK Government, working with its own legal advice, to look at the treaty and to interpret what we believe to be the correct position. When I was in Brussels recently, I discussed this position with officials in order to make sure that the interpretation was right. Actually it is spelled out in the treaty. Noble Lords can go to Article 17 of the European Union Treaty and find references to Article  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1076"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1076</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>245 on the functioning of the European Union. To put it in a nutshell, if you are President of the Commission or if you are the High Representative and therefore a Vice-President of the Commission, you are part of the Commission. Article 245 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="0805153000039"></a>&#147;The members of the Commission may not, during their term of office, engage in any other occupation, whether gainful or not.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000033"></a>If that were amended, the treaty would need to be amended so it is impossible for the President of the Commission and the High Representative, who is Vice-President of the Commission, and the Council President to double-hat because the two people in the Commission are not allowed to hold any other role. In order to double-hat you need two out of three to be involved but two out of the three cannot do it. I have not used government resources and therefore taxpayers&#146; money to talk to the Dutch about this because in my view the position is crystal clear.</p>

<a name="80514-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="0805153000008"></a>As I said, we are clear about the primacy of European Union law and we are very clear on the role of Parliament. We believe that this position is exactly the same as it has been before the treaty. It is an important position. If this Parliament decides it does not wish to be part of the European Union that is within its gift. While it is part of the European Union, however, laws that we have participated in making fall to the European Court of Justice to interpret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="0805153000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, talked about Amendment No. 159. It was interesting that the noble Lord made it clear that he is unhappy about pillar collapse. The preamble to this was his worry about what is now part of the JHA opt-in; essentially, that involves pillar collapse from pillar 3 to pillar 1. I would be very interested to know what the noble Lord would wish to do on behalf of his party about trying to change that if this treaty were not to be ratified. Would he want to keep the Third Pillar as it currently is? I will wait for another occasion to discuss this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0805153000019"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this Question is about the rights of way provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and Section 53 in particular. It introduces a 25-year cut-off date for historic claims which runs from 1 January 2001 and expires on 1 January 2026. It means that rights of way that existed before 1949 that are not recorded on the definitive map will be extinguished. This refers to footpaths and bridleways and it can also refer to higher rights on recorded footpaths. There are two broad areas of concern on this. One relates to the rural, mainly recreational rights of way and the other relates to the very different urban rights of way, and the two obviously run together.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0805153000020"></a>I should declare an interest as a member of the British Mountaineering Council and of its access and conservation working group. I am also a member of the Open Spaces Society and, more generally, I am a walker and cyclist. I have also been known to sit on a horse but that does not happen very often. I particularly want to thank the Ramblers&#146; Association, Sue Hogg, chair of the National Federation of Bridleway Associations, Alan Ibbotson, president of the Institute of Public Rights of Way Management, or IPROW, and my colleague Trevor Jones, who is a councillor in Dorchester and a member of Dorset County Council. I also thank some of the Dorset County Council staff for helping to research this subject. It is an important matter and, in the three or four months since I first tabled this Question, it has become very much more topical.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="0805153000021"></a>Section 53 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act was an attempt to bring certainty to the definitive map and, in many ways, it was a sop to landowners, who were up in arms about the provisions of the Act  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1078"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1078</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that referred to access&#151;the so-called &#147;right to roam&#148;. As a result of the discussions, some further concessions were made to ramblers, users of bridleways and so on, with a possible five-year extension to 2031. In particular, the Discovering Lost Ways project was introduced, in which it was hoped that there would be a mechanism for discovering rights of way which had been lost or not recorded. There were also promises of funding to volunteer groups to assist in the process.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="0805153000022"></a>Where are we now? Discovering Lost Ways has lost its way and is being closed down. Some &#163;4.5 million spent in two counties&#151;Cheshire and Shropshire&#151;have resulted in a grand total of no additions to the definitive map. Therefore, it has been a complete flop. It was based on library research, and local volunteers were not really involved. It was a case of looking at ancient maps and documents, inclosure awards, tithe maps and even the land surveys which Lloyd George instituted for his land tax in 1910. However, the promises of funding and support for volunteer groups never really came to fruition, including a promise of &#163;2 million per annum. On 23 July 2001 the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in a Written Answer to me said, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="0805153000040"></a>&#147;The agency invited consultants to advise on the most effective way of involving voluntary groups in research on unrecorded rights of way ... The contract was offered on 12 July and, if accepted, we expect work to begin in August with a view to having a scheme to support voluntary work in place by spring 2002&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/7/01; col. <I>WA 190-91</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000034"></a>Unfortunately, so far as I can see, that never happened. It certainly did not produce anything on the ground.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="0805153000023"></a>In the mean time, the existing system for claims grinds on. There are long backlogs and, in 2005, a Countryside Agency report said that the backlog was increasing. It is slow and cumbersome, very legalistic and lawyers earn lots of money. I quote from a May 2006 document from the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust on the Discovering Lost Ways project:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="0805153000041"></a>&#147;The main obstacle to reinstating the historical network is the definitive map process itself: it is long-winded, increasingly debased, increasingly partial, increasingly costly, and often leaves members of the public disillusioned, depressed, and feeling that their efforts have been wasted and that they themselves have been cheated. Today few sensible people are prepared to research and submit dmmo&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000035"></a>definitive map modification order&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0805153000043"></a>&#147;applications, and even fewer are prepared to attend public inquiries. And the longer the time taken to complete the definitive record, the more difficult the task becomes, as communities increasingly become severed from their roots&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="0805153000024"></a>The question is: is the present system broken? A lot of people say that it is. Organisations such as the Ramblers&#146; Association and IPROW say no; they say that funding is the key. It will be interesting to know the Government&#146;s view on this. Can the process of definitive map modification orders be simplified? Can the process, procedure and paperwork be reduced and simplified? Can common sense be introduced into the process? At the moment, it is extremely legalistic, and common sense often does not seem to prevail at all. One thing on which I think everyone agrees is that maintaining the definitive map is essential; it is at the core of the whole system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="0805153000025"></a>Then there are rights of way improvement plans, most of which have now been completed, the deadline having been, I think, last November. Alan Ibbotson, president of IPROW, suggested that they are &#147;hanging there&#148;. The improvement plans may be there but in very many cases the resources are not there to implement them or to do very much about them.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="0805153000026"></a>I now want to talk about urban rights of way. I was originally provoked into tabling this Question for Short Debate by my colleague Trevor Jones in Dorchester, Dorset. He is a member of the town council and I shall quote from a letter that he wrote to me last July:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="0805153000042"></a>&#147;About two years ago, Dorchester Town Council learned that unless they were &#145;formerly recorded as Rights of Way by 2026&#146;, all our innumerable walkways and back alleys would cease to be protected for public use after that date&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000036"></a>He is referring to paths in urban areas. He continued:</p>
<ul><a name="0805153000044"></a>&#147;Accordingly, they agreed with County Council staff that they would make a start on the procedures&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000037"></a>that is, for recording them on the definitive map. He went on:</p>
<ul><a name="0805153000045"></a>&#147;After not many months, they chucked the towel in because the procedures are simply a nightmare&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805153000038"></a>The town council found that they were just too costly and it could not continue with them.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="0805153000027"></a>How many urban rights of way exist? Very often they are unrecorded but they are used, not lost. No one knows how many there are but they total many thousands, and there may well be hundreds of thousands in the country. There are a vast number of active paths which are often well used but rarely on the map. There is a proliferation of local names for them, which shows how local but important they are. They include alleys, ginnels, snickets, drongs, vennels, twittens, twitchels or lonnies, and no doubt there are many more. I was brought up in the land of the snicket and I now live in the land of the ginnel. My noble friend Lord Shutt would, if noble Lords wished, produce a map that he has researched showing the boundary in the Pennines between the land of snickets and the land of ginnels. They are all important and are all used, but if they are no longer rights of way, there is a real chance that the people who own the land will block them.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="0805153000028"></a>Ipswich apparently has only four recorded rights of way and no definitive map. I have no idea what they call them in Ipswich but they must be there and they must be important.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="0805153000029"></a>It has been suggested that the exception provisions in Section 54 of the CROW Act could be used to define urban paths in this way as an exception to Section 53 and so avoid ending their status as rights of way in 2026. Do the Government intend to make regulations under Section 54? Do they think that this is a way forward or is more fundamental legislative change needed?</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="0805153000030"></a>People see a major crisis looming. That crisis is 17 years away but the process is slow. What is happening now? Natural England has decided not to go ahead with the Discovering Lost Ways project because it is not working. It made a report to its board in February, which suggested that there should be a fundamental review. At a meeting in March, it produced a very interesting report called <I>Discovering Lost Way</I><I>s</I>, covering  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1080"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1080</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the outcome of the review and recommendations on the way forward. I understand that it has been forwarded to the Government. I have concentrated on setting out the problems but I hope that the Minister will concentrate on some of the possible solutions and indicate the Government&#146;s thinking in response to this interesting report from Natural England.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="0805153000031"></a>I understand that it has been proposed that a stakeholder working group should be set up. I thought that perhaps it was intended to create some more fences but apparently that is not the case; it is a working group of all the people involved in this matter. Have the Government decided what the terms of reference should be? Will the process be transparent? Will they get an agreed agenda with all the different groups from landowners through to ramblers and so on? Do they agree that the review needs to encompass all aspects of the rights of way system or will it simply replace Discovering Lost Ways? Do they agree that the membership of the stakeholder working group must reflect all the main user groups? Finally, do they believe that the answer is to repeal and abolish Section 53 and not have this sword of Damocles hanging over the whole process? If not, what is the answer?</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="0805153000032"></a>When we were&#151;a long time ago it seems&#151;in your Lordships&#146; House discussing the Rights of Way Bill going through the House, there were concerns that Section 53 would be a problem when it came up and that has proved to be the case. The answer that the Government came up with&#151;Discovering Lost Ways and the funding of voluntary groups&#151;has not happened or has not worked and we need something else. I very much look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

It is a very important issue that touches on many areas of government policy, including obesity, the state of the nation&#146;s health, and so on. There is a sort of mantra that goes round: let us encourage more sport, more recreation. Then you go down and realise which groups are which and which ones are more appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="0805154000003"></a>There is no more appropriate form of mass exercise than pleasant or useful walking. If you can make it a pleasant walk to the shops, people will walk to the shops, provided that the distance is reasonable and they are not going for a huge weekly shop. If you have to clamber into a car and drive to the shops, people are not going to take the exercise. They will increase the number of journeys and make it more unpleasant for people who are walking round the streets. As my noble friend pointed out, if you encourage those urban walkways, many of which are unofficial, you will help many other government directives and areas of activity that we want to encourage.</p>

Shall we give them guidance on how to help people to find out what areas where you can walk are available? Either one of the two noble Lords on the Front Bench could have this question quite fairly put to them. What is the cross-reference between the two? How does it work? The historic and ancient walkways, especially in and around towns, allow greater access to those walkways outside which are probably the most pleasant. Unless you establish a walkway system that allows you to get on and off it on foot, you cannot achieve what you intend. I now live in Berkshire, which has the great walk of the Ridgeway running through it. One of the great disappointments with that is that people drive to get on to it. More often, they should be encouraged to walk on to it. That is a part of the country which is not that badly served by walkways.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0805154000005"></a>You should encourage people to find out what is there and the cutways through it. Whenever I go for a walk, I try to stay on the paths, but occasionally I will go off them on to the short tracks&#151;often a farm track&#151;that link up two paths. I think everybody does it. Are we going to encourage their usage? Are we going to try to get some feel of what is going on? What is seen to be the right amount of support in identifying pathways, historic or otherwise? It is fair enough to extend this down&#151;even to the creation of one or two new ones&#151;to make sure older paths are used. What is being done here?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0805154000006"></a>We can go round this a thousand times, but unless the Government take on some real commitment here to encourage this usage, much of what was done on the CROW Bill&#151;I remember the very late night sittings as if it were yesterday&#151;</p>

I do not think there has been any dispute about the fact that we should be encouraging recreational walking and walking as a form of local transport at dozens of different levels. The Government can probably help themselves in many other fields if they at least say what they are going to do here; what other departments are encouraging them is the correct thing. We are at least entitled to know that. If the Government have decided it is all too difficult, at least we should know. If we do not, we are going to carry on doing this again and again.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1082"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1082</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because it brings to our notice a good idea that has got bogged down. I have to declare an interest. We are farmers and in horticulture and we own and occupy land with rights of way. None are known to be lost ways, but we have been talking to Lincolnshire County Council about diverting a path to provide both a more practical field shape and a more engaging walk.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0805154000012"></a>My wife is a Lincolnshire county councillor and I have used her as a researcher. I have had the opportunity to talk to Chris Miller who is the principal rights of way and access officer on Lincolnshire County Council. He gave me some interesting information on how a typical county council is dealing with these things. Lincolnshire has a total of 159 cases, of which 138 are from direct applications from the public. Others were initiated by the county council following the discovery of evidence by the authority. The oldest of these cases date back to 1983. In 2007-08, the authority completed just 23 cases but received 10 new claims. The backlog is clearing only slowly. The process is slow and not working particularly well.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0805154000013"></a>Timescales for resolution vary depending on whether objections are received. As a rough estimate, it takes about a year for a case to be resolved. However, the authority has some old cases that have not significantly progressed for a number of years. It receives approximately 50 requests a year. Many people who make a request are put off by the fee or their request does not meet the statutory or local criteria for acceptance.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0805154000014"></a>The briefing, for which I am grateful to Chris Miller, paints a picture of a process that is not working well. That is not because the department is badly funded. Obviously, all local authority departments are finding things tight when they want to be generous with funds, but this department is relatively well funded. Lincolnshire is a rural county and has probably more than its fair share of rural footpaths.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0805154000015"></a>The picture that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has presented to us shows that the task is complex and burdensome. That is not likely to be resolved in the absence of primary legislation to simplify the process. However, knowing the Government&#146;s position on legislative timetables, I think that it is unlikely that we will see any such legislation. I would be interested to know what the Minister proposes to do in the interim to make the project much less bureaucratic. Amanda Earnshaw, a project manager for the Discovering Lost Ways scheme, which was set up by Natural England, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="0805154000095"></a>&#147;What should have been a sensible process has got itself mired in bureaucracy and as yet we haven&#146;t got any more rights of way on the map&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805154000089"></a>The project found that even a systematic research approach could not remove the requirement for further detailed research into cases by the highway authority and for a public inquiry to be held whenever the recording of such a right was opposed. The costs of advertising are a factor, too. Local newspapers are not cheap places in which to advertise. The Government may need to find other ways of making details available to the public. As we know, Natural England has decided, given the budget pressures that

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0805154000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to the stakeholder working group. The Government have said that they will not bring Section 53 into effect until they hear the outcome of the working group, so it would be useful to know from the Minister when he expects the group to report back to him.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0805154000017"></a>It was interesting to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, talk about urban paths, because in many ways these are more used than rural paths. Rural paths are used largely, although not exclusively, for recreation purposes, but urban paths, too, are important in local communities. Often, what started with people nipping through a gap in the hedge has become a well tracked alleyway through to the shops and people have become used to it. The establishment of rights of way by precedent means that new paths are being created all the time in urban environments.</p>

<a name="80514-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="0805154000018"></a>I hope that the Minister will present us with some positive solutions to what I see as a difficult problem. No one can deny the delight of walking in the British countryside, which, at present, looks absolutely magnificent. Whether it is the Cumbrian hills or the Lincolnshire fens, we are all privileged to be able to enjoy it. I hope that the Minister will say that he supports the continuing development and maintenance of the definitive map. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, we must approach that in a practical way.</p>

I do not have many interests to declare, but in the past couple of weeks I have walked both in the Cotswolds and in the Lake District, so that is where I am coming from.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="0805154000020"></a>Let me give the House a few facts. I am not criticising the noble Lord, Lord Addington, but anyone listening to him would think that we are closing down walking in the countryside. It is worth putting on record that in England there are 94,000 miles of footpaths, 20,000 miles of bridleways, 38,500 miles of restricted byways and 2,500 miles of byways open to all traffic. A 1 per cent reduction in the sedentary population in the UK could provide almost a &#163;500 million saving in averted healthcare costs. That is a big cost. Perhaps we ought to be doing the debate standing up rather than sitting down. That is where we are coming from&#151;there is a great benefit to walking and, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, says, the countryside looks quite magnificent at present.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0805154000021"></a>I have some comments but I certainly have not got all the answers. The Government&#146;s position has been clearly set out in answer to Questions in both this House and the other. The latest that I have in my notes is a fairly substantial Answer in the other place from 8 May.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0805154000022"></a>We recognise the importance and value of the rights of way network. The health and quality-of-life benefits of walking, cycling and horse riding are well known. I could give the House the figures on the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1084"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1084</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>substantial percentage of the population who visit the countryside. There are enormous economic as well as health benefits, so the gains are not only recreational. </p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0805154000023"></a>The rights of way provide important social and economic benefits. They can be functional journeys as well. But they are not all necessarily in the countryside. My former constituency was about  16 square miles in a very urban part of Birmingham, but it was littered with rights of way. They are usually not very well lit, so people are always campaigning for reassurance from the council that they are safe to use. That is the issue in urban areas. Traditionally they are away for other forms of traffic, so they can play a significant part in reducing accidents, particularly in urban areas.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0805154000024"></a>There is a big issue of rights of way being a key ingredient for tackling congestion and reducing dependency on private car use, particularly for short journeys. As the noble Lord said, short-cuts to the shops are very important. But we need to have a rights of way network that is relevant to people&#146;s everyday lives, otherwise the rights of way would not be fully utilised and we would lose the benefits. I was not involved in the passing of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, because I was in another department. The CROW Act introduced the rights of way improvement plans. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the way network we integrated these with local transport planning.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0805154000025"></a>The rights of way improvement plans are only a part of the process of developing a rights of way network that serves current and future needs. The 25-year time limit on making claims to changes to the definitive map and statement that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to was introduced to assist this process. The date is there for a reason. But this time limit, introduced by Sections 53 to 56 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, applies only to historic rights of way; that is, those that were in existence before 1949 when the definitive map and statement were introduced by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. These provisions would not prevent the recording of rights of way created after 1949. As the noble Lord said, rights of way are being created regularly.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0805154000026"></a>The provisions in Sections 53 to 56 have not yet been implemented and we would not seek to implement them without undertaking a full consultation. The 25-year limit&#151;that is the 2026 cut-off point&#151;had two principal aims. The first was to give landowners and occupiers more certainty about whether public rights of way existed over their land. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to this but not in such technical phrasing. The second was to provide an impetus to getting the definitive map and statement completed within a foreseeable time frame. In looking to provide a network that meets the current and future trend, rights of way that already exist but are unrecorded represent a significant resource on which to draw.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0805154000027"></a>Finding the legal evidence necessary to add these unrecorded rights of way to the definitive map and statement under the current legislative framework is by no means an easy task. All three noble Lords who have spoken have made that quite clear from practical  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experience. It requires considerable expertise and resource. It was originally envisaged that the work needed to find and record the rights of way would be undertaken by volunteers with government funding. Natural England&#146;s predecessor, the Countryside Agency, was charged with administering the process. The agency examined the possibility of funding volunteers to undertake the work and found that, although there are people out there who are very proficient at this, there are not enough of them in the right places to be able to complete the task by the 2026 deadline.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0805154000028"></a>The agency and its successor body, Natural England, has also tried a systematic approach&#151;a trawl through all the archives by professional researchers. While local authorities have appreciated the benefits that this approach brought, it did not produce rights of way claims that could be processed without significant further investigation by the local authority. Moreover, the establishment and recording of rights of way is&#151;and this is a very polite and technical way of putting it&#151;an emotive, contentious and increasingly litigious area, and a very exacting standard of legal evidence is required to see through a successful application, hence the delay on all the inquiries, as noble Lords have mentioned. It now therefore seems that, under the current procedures for recording rights of way, many local authorities would not be able to cope with the number of claims that would be generated.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0805154000029"></a>Research into rights of way has not been attempted on that scale. Much has been learned, however&#151;and the three counties have been referred to. For example, we now know that many rights of way are not lost; they are actually in daily use but they are simply not recorded. That is quite an important point. We are talking only about rights of way from before 1949. But we also recognise the real risk that, where lost rights of way are discovered, they may now run through dwellings and other properties and be quite incompatible with the current use of the land. That can happen. It is no excuse for not looking for them&#151;I make that absolutely clear&#151;but the current mechanism for dealing with these issues may not be adequate because of that point.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0805154000030"></a>We recognise, too, a risk that systematic research generates a lot of inconclusive evidence that can add uncertainty about what rights exist&#151;hence nothing has been added to the map, although there are half a dozen claims in one council ready to go forward as well as another hundred or more that could possibly go forward. Because of these potential difficulties, Natural England undertook a review of the work and concluded that it should withdraw from active research and instead try to develop consensus among stakeholders about the best way forward, through an independently chaired stakeholder working group. This is in the process of being set up. It will consist of 15 members&#151;five from local authorities, five from user groups and five from land managers, with an independent chair. It will be tasked to report at some time in 2009, although I do not have a precise date on that. It will not be a rush job; it will probably be towards the latter part of next year.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1086"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1086</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0805154000031"></a>In the light of this, the Government have given an undertaking that the implementation of the relevant Sections 53 to 56 of the CROW Act, which are the provisions that would extinguish any historic rights of way not shown on the definitive map and statement by 2026, will not be pursued at least until the stakeholder group proposed by Natural England has reported its conclusions. So there is no prospect of any jumping the gun. We are not at this stage committing to any further legislative reform, which includes any changes to Sections 53 to 56 of the Act. We value the rights of way network and recognise the need to ensure that it is protected and enhanced.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0805154000032"></a>I have a small tag here on my speaking note which I call tick-tock. The natural question that would be asked about this by those outside is whether we are genuine about the stakeholder group. We will not move on the issue until we get the results from the stakeholder group. I understand that the three parties that will come together in the stakeholder group are very happy with the process and the way forward. There is a degree of consensus that, if the present system does not work, we will find another way to do it. But the clock is ticking on the 25-year limit, as was implied in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. It is now less than 20 years away and, as the legislation stands, the cut-off date prescribed by Section 56 is 1 January 2026. That can be extended by regulations, but only for the five-year limit up to  1 January 2031. Therefore, unless the provisions are amended by further primary legislation, the clock will continue to tick. However, the provisions that introduce the cut-off date are yet to be implemented and, as I have said, we have undertaken not to pursue implementation until there is a proposed stakeholder group.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0805154000033"></a>There is a degree of uncertainty, but we still have a long way to go. The fact is that the stakeholder group will have the parties who are central to making these decisions as members. I know the groups, but not the individuals, and they know that the clock is ticking. In a way, that may give them an incentive to get cracking. If the cut-off has to be extended, an order that runs for five years would make up for the delay that we have just suffered in the last period, which is a bit more than five years. However, primary legislation would be required to knock that out.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0805154000034"></a>As the years tick by, this issue will have to be addressed and the next stopping-off point to get it checked over is when the stakeholder group reports. It will be fully transparent and disclosed&#151;there is no reason for it not to be&#151;and then properly consulted. As I have said, there would have to be a full consultation anyway before the Government moved on Sections 53 to 56, even if they were minded to implement or use regulations.</p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0805154000035"></a>This thing is not going away. The chances are&#151;and I am thinking aloud now, because of the issue of legislation&#151;that, if the stakeholder group reports, let us say, at some time next year with a decision on how to proceed on consulting on Sections 53 to 56, within a couple of years we are going to get a solution to the way forward. That may or may not require primary legislation, but we need a certain date in the first place

A bit of uncertainty is being introduced at present, so it is important to clear that up. I hope that it can be done with the good will borne out by the fact that there is a good consensus on the stakeholder group.</p>

In this case, the decision to start the research was there but enough evidence came out of it to say, &#147;Hang on a minute, this is not the way forward&#148;. We have to find another way.</p>

<p><a name="0805154000046"></a>There are other passages in the Thoburn judgment which make one wonder whether this will always be the view of our courts. It therefore seems that if we do not soon assert that our Parliament can still pass laws inconsistent with our obligations under the treaties&#151;and if we do not, in fact, pass any such laws&#151;we will sooner or later lose the right to do so. It is a matter of great regret.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0805154000054"></a>Whatever Lord Denning said in this House as a parliamentarian is not the law. The law is what is stated in the Appellate Committee by the Law Lords. As I attempted to say briefly, it is absolutely clear beyond argument, not only in Lord Denning&#146;s Court of Appeal in the case of McCarthys v Wendy Smith, he made the supremacy of European law absolutely plain, but he also set aside in that case the part of the Equal Pay Act that conflicted with an equality directive, and explained why. In Factortame, Lord Bridge for a unanimous House of Lords displaced the discriminatory provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act and explained why. In the EOC case, another Appellate Committee displaced the provisions of an old employment protection Act as being inconsistent. </p>

<a name="80514-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0805154000055"></a>In all those cases, they explained the relationship, not in this House as parliamentarians, but as our final court. All that they said echoed similar judgments by the European Court of Justice. If Lord Denning in advanced years began to say political things here, they are not of the same judicial weight as when he acted as a judge. When he acted as a judge in the Court of Appeal, he made it absolutely clear. I suggest that one should focus on what he and the House of Lords said as a court, and the European Court of Justice. All of them said exactly the same thing. With respect, it is hopeless to suggest that there is any lack of clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0805154000056"></a>The position is that our sovereign Parliament has agreed, exercising its sovereignty, that so long as we remain members of the European Community/Union where European Community law reigns, in the sense that it applies in a particular area, any inconsistency in legislation or judicial decision or administrative action must give way. It is also clear that no member state can reply on its own constitutional order as an excuse for doing anything inconsistent with the paramount law of the European Community, now the European Union. Perhaps I may say that all that is now in any law school regarded as absolutely straightforward for any law student.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0805154000058"></a>It is a matter of enormous regret that with every day that passes it looks less and less likely that this House will do its duty and insist on the Members of the other place honouring the promises they all made to their constituents that there would be a referendum on the matters originally in the constitutional treaty and now in the treaty of Lisbon. If people are going to break their promises to their constituents&#151;and are encouraged to do so by Members of this House&#151;there should be some kind of safety valve to deal with the situation which will then arise.</p>

We would be in a very powerful negotiating position if by then we had secured the passage through Parliament of legislation removing from British law the obligation of which we and the British people believe we should be free. We would be in a much weaker negotiating position if no such legislation had been passed by our Parliament; and we would be in a still weaker position if legislation had been passed which our courts had found of no effect.</p>

Secondly, now that the Lisbon treaty will contain a provision for withdrawal, would it not be dishonest and dishonourable for a Government to legislate unilaterally when there was a perfectly good procedure in the treaty under which they could get into the position the noble Lord wishes by notifying their partners that they wished to withdraw from their legal obligations and cease to be a member of the European Union? If you were not prepared to do that, then you really would be in a weak negotiating position.</p>

There are times when it is a very good thing to get this out of the system and to allow people to let off steam. If we had had a referendum on Maastricht it would have avoided many of the problems which followed thereafter. But it is quite ridiculous to compare the situation over Maastricht with the situation today. I cannot remember the Conservative Government promising the people a referendum and then ratting on it. The point here is that this Government promised a referendum and are ratting on that obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0805154000063"></a>That is the answer to the points made by the noble Lord except to say that I am not advocating now leaving the European Union. I am merely stating certain things which it would be wise to do to make sure that if we were to enter into renegotiations we would be in a much stronger position than if we had not been able to legislate to undo that which has been done in this treaty without the consent of the British people and with the collusion of Members such as the noble Lord who has just spoken.</p>

That is the issue before this Committee. I am rather ashamed by people&#146;s denial that that plain obligation should be carried out.</p>

How does the noble Lord see that going? I presume that the renegotiation would be of some of the terms of the treaty of Maastricht, to which he and his friends have objected. At the first European Council, the new British Prime Minister would say, &#147;The chair should please get out, because we don&#146;t agree that there should be a permanent chair. It would be helpful, therefore, if we looked back in the alphabet and decided who, on the rotation of the chairs, should now be in the chair of this European Council&#148;. Let us suppose that the others do not agree. One of the distinguishing marks of a treaty renegotiation is that, although anybody can ask for one, it takes unanimity to open it. Does the noble Lord think that all the other members of the European Union, having ratified the treaty&#151;presumably because they think that it contains some quite good things&#151;would agree that the treaty should be reopened because the British Prime Minister, in the situation described, asked for it?</p>

It was not me who opened up all the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay; he raised the matters and I responded to them. I have an awful feeling that if I am too generous in my reply to him, I will be very unpopular, so let us get on with the proposition that I am advancing, which is simply this: if there is no referendum, it makes it that much more likely that there will be returned to Parliament a party with a clear mandate to renegotiate parts of the treaty, and that in office there will be a Government in a position to secure the passage through Parliament of legislation which reflects the people&#146;s wishes. If a party had a clear mandate to renegotiate, it would be pretty fruitless to enter a renegotiation unless we had put down a few markers and said, &#147;This is the part of the treaty to which we objected. This is the part of the treaty which was never put to the people. We have passed legislation in the English Parliament making sure that the social chapter is to be repealed&#148;. The consequence of that process might be success or failure, but that is entirely irrelevant so far as the amendment is concerned. Quite simply, this amendment, which I would have moved in far shorter terms had I not been so generous to all those who have intervened, is designed to make sure that, in the circumstances that I have mentioned, our courts would accept the right of Parliament to legislate even when the legislation was in conflict with the 1972 Act. They certainly would not treat the legislation as being other than of no effect if there had not been a clear statement of the intention of Parliament that such legislation should override the 1972 Act. That is the simple purpose of the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I have no doubt that I will be hearing from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, about how many discriminatory observations I have made by even referring to the title. It was an almost unbelievable class system. The gentlemen came down the central staircase at Lord&#146;s from the Long Room on to the cricket pitch when they came out to bat.

I was one of those who considered the proposed constitutional treaty, and we spent a lot of time on that. But I was not a member of any committee that considered the current Bill. In Sub-Committee E we had a succession of extremely able Law Lords. I hope that it will not be a feature of the move across the road to the Supreme Court that we lose for ever that wisdom.

<ul><a name="0805154000106"></a>&#147;if European institutions or agencies were to treat or develop the Union Treaty in a way that was no longer covered by the Treaty in the form that is the basis for the Act of Accession, the resultant legislative instruments would not be legally binding within the sphere of German sovereignty. The German state organs would be prevented for constitutional reasons from applying them in Germany. Accordingly the Federal Constitutional Court will review legal instruments of European institutions and agencies to see whether they remain within the limits of the sovereign rights conferred on them or transgress them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805154000092"></a>That is an interesting statement on a jurisdiction. The court will watch to see whether the activities of the ECJ, or indeed of any other institution within the Community, go beyond the remit of the treaties, because that is the basis on which it acceded. I believe that is the current position in Germany law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0805154000083"></a>In Denmark, there was a case of Carlsen against the then Prime Minister, Mr Rasmussen, which was decided in 1999 by its supreme court. It, too, has a written constitution, section 20 of which provides that powers may be delegated to an authority,</p>
<ul><a name="0805154000107"></a>&#147;to an extent specified by statute&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805154000093"></a>In the context of the Maastricht treaty, the claimants argued that the powers delegated to the Community under the treaty on European Union were too ill defined to satisfy the statute&#146;s&#151;the local constitution&#146;s&#151;requirements. They made two points, the first of which was that Article 308&#151;which we all remember&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0805154000108"></a>&#147;of the EC Treaty gave the Council an open-ended power to legislate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805154000094"></a>Secondly, it said,</p>
<ul><a name="0805154000109"></a>&#147;that the ECJ indulged in what the claimants called &#145;law-making activities&#146;&#148;.</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="0805154000102"></a>&#147;The fact that the ECJ in its interpretation of the Treaty also attaches importance to factors of interpretation other than the wording of the provisions, including the objectives of the Treaty,

The same applies to the law-making activities of the ECJ within the scope of the Treaty&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0805154000085"></a>The words,</p>

<p><a name="0805154000086"></a>are exactly the German point. So long as they are giving a judgment within the four corners of the treaty, we recognise that and that is it.</p>

<a name="80514-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0805154000087"></a>On the wider question of what the position would be if it were later to be alleged in Denmark that an EC institution had exceeded the powers conferred on it by the treaties, the Danish supreme court said that, first, there would have to be a reference to the ECJ to rule on whether it was compatible or not with the constitution. Then it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="0805154000103"></a>&#147;Danish courts of law can generally base their decision on decisions by the Court of Justice on such questions being within the limits of the surrender of sovereignty&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0805154000088"></a>However, the courts of law in Denmark cannot be deprived of their right to try questions of whether an EC act of law exceeds the limits or the surrender of sovereignty made by the Act of Accession. The court continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="0805154000104"></a>&#147;Therefore Danish courts must rule that an E.C. act is inapplicable in Denmark if the extraordinary situation should arise that with the required certainty it can be established that an E.C. act which has been upheld by the European Court of Justice is based on an application of the Treaty which lies beyond the surrender of sovereignty according to the Act of Accession. Similar interpretations apply with regard to Community law rules and legal principles which are based on the practice of the European Court of Justice&#148;.</p>

I shall not respond to a great deal of what the noble Lord is saying because I already have on the previous group.

Essentially the Poles have said that the national law is supreme, that there is a limitation on the powers of the EU&#151;exactly the same point as the Germans&#151;and that they reserve the right to consider the clash that might arise if some provision in the constitution was in conflict with Community law or a Community decision. They look at the possibilities that might be persuading the EU to alter their ruling, amending their own constitution or leaving the EU. None of this is challenging the basic position, which we were discussing before dinner, of the sovereignty of the EU court in so far as it decides things within its remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0805157000007"></a>If we look at the position in English law, the general conventional wisdom is that the 1972 Act could be repealed by a straightforward Act saying that that was the will of Parliament. It is a little less clear what the position would be in relation to some particular doctrine or part of European law. Could we single that out and do so in clear language that was not to form part of English law? Lord Denning looked at that in the passage cited by Lord Waddington, in which he discussed what would happen if the time comes when Parliament passes an Act repudiating the treaty or any provision in it. He went on:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0805157000010"></a>We have had a lot of discussion about the Lisbon treaty. I have referred to the foreign policy borderline&#151;details are in paragraph 4.176 of the committee&#146;s impact report. Other problems are referred to in part 7 in paragraph 7.50, where there is a reference to Article 39 and the fact that the ECJ has no jurisdiction whatever in that area. I am putting into your Lordships&#146; minds the thought that we could get situations where it was unclear and there could be a debate whether a law, regulation or directive made by one of the organs of the EU, or whether a judgment of the ECJ, was within the limits of its jurisdiction. In that case, I think that it would be open to challenge in this Parliament and an Act could be passed expressly disclaiming part of the new instrument or the decision by the court. The nuclear option, of course, is to give notice, as has been suggested, under the provisions in the Act.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0805157000011"></a>I support the amendment on the basis that it would be important to the public to know that the Lisbon treaty had been incorporated; otherwise, they will know nothing. The earlier debate this evening has shown the level of knowledge about EU law. Almost nothing is known by the general public about what is being done in their name, but there would be some satisfaction in having a clause which said that Parliament retained its full sovereignty to repeal  the Act.</p>

It seems to me that, after getting on for three hours of debate on these issues, it is absolutely clear. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill suggested that a first-year law student would know the answer&#151;that the UK Parliament is indeed supreme. It can repeal the European Communities Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, pointed out, there is now a specific provision in the treaty on withdrawal. Therefore, it is utterly clear that the UK Parliament is supreme. It can decide to repeal the European Communities Act, but that would mean that we would no longer be in the EU. There is no third way.</p>

The point is whether the European Communities Act could be disapplied in a particular case. That is what we are arguing about. It may be right or it may be wrong, but that is the point that we are arguing about. If in a statute we said in clear words that we wanted to do a particular thing, notwithstanding the European Communities Act, would that be good law? That is what we are talking about, but the noble Baroness is labouring on about an entirely different point.</p>

You are either in the European Union or you are not. If you are in the European Union, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, said earlier, you have to apply the rules of the club; otherwise, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, said earlier, there will be chaos and anarchy. This is a club in which there is the rule of law. Of course, we can defy the European Court of Justice but that would be incompatible with membership. Ultimately, we would be found to be in infringement of the EU treaties, and either by our courts or the ECJ incompatible legislation would be struck down. Therefore, while we are in the European Union we have to respect the primacy of EU law. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said that he was not advocating leaving the EU but&#151;I am sorry but I have to repeat this&#151;there is no third option. You are in and respect the rules&#151;and ultimately can be found in breach either by our courts or the Luxembourg court&#151;or you exercise the absolute right of Parliament, which is supreme, to leave the EU by repealing the European Communities Act and then we are no longer subject to the rules of the EU. After several hours of debate, the attempt to try and find some other option simply is not there. It is clutching at straws. It does not exist.</p>

Again, I think it is important to be clear about it. Ever since the nineteenth century and Professor Dicey, it has been absolutely clear that under the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, Parliament cannot bind its successors, in the sense&#151;as Dicey pointed out&#151;that even the Act of Union with Scotland could be trumped by a subsequent Dentist&#146;s Act if that Act were to contain something that was clearly inconsistent.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1099"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column 1099</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0805157000019"></a>Therefore, it is clear that under the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, as stated by the courts&#151;because the whole thing depends upon the common law recognition of parliamentary sovereignty by the courts&#151;if a Westminster Parliament were to decide to pass legislation overriding the 1972 Act, it could do so, in so far as English domestic constitutional law was concerned. However, it could not do so in a way that would be legally valid. If we are members of the European Union, to pass legislation that was incompatible with the supreme law of the European Union would mean English courts would be compelled to hold the subsequent statute inconsistent with Community law and to disapply it. This is because English courts are under an obligation in the 1972 Act&#151;and under a directly binding European law&#151;to read and give effect to every British statute in a way that is compatible with binding Community law. With this problem, there is a difference when it is looked at as an isolated English constitutional problem and when it is looked at in terms of our membership of the EU. So long as we are within the European Union, there is no possibility whatever of a subsequent statute breaching Community law, being struck down or disapplied by our own courts and, ultimately, by the Court of Justice. That is the fundamental principle on which our membership of the European Community is based. It is for that reason that amendments of this kind, were they to be carried, would be necessarily held to be invalid.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0805157000020"></a>Lord Justice Laws, a fine judge, floated in one of his judgments in the Court of Appeal&#151;to take Dicey&#146;s example&#151;the supposition that Parliament were to be dotty enough, or the European institutions were dotty enough, to enact legislation requiring that all red-headed people should be boiled alive at birth. The question of parliamentary sovereignty and European Community law, in that kind of extreme hypothetical flat-earth case, could then arise. John Laws was indicating that, in that extreme case, there might be some possibility of litigation on that subject. Frankly, it is not really sensible to spend time on examples of that kind, floated by a distinguished Court of Appeal judge in a hypothetical way.</p>

I say to the noble Baroness that it is inevitable&#151;I know that your Lordships want to move on as quickly as possible&#151;that there is some overlap between the last debate on the scope, jurisdiction and power of the European Court of Justice&#151;which more or less put down firmly to a subordinate position the supremacy of Parliament in relation to laws already passed&#151;and the question of the supremacy of Parliament now and to what extent it is affected by any future areas of expansion in the scope of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

It is paramount. As Lord Justice Bingham said, it has a panoramic view and, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, it is a supreme constitutional court. There is no doubt about that. Although I know that some of my noble and honourable friends and many people in this country would like it not to be so, it is so. The fact of the matter is that, in the areas where the European Court of Justice prevails and reigns&#151;where its writ runs&#151;it is supreme and parliamentary sovereignty has been subordinated to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0805157000023"></a>Also relevant to this debate is the argument that we had earlier about whether that writ can be extended and whether it applies to matters where there appears to be a constitutional conflict between the Court of Justice and what we believe to be our own constitutional rights and values. We look to other countries, as the noble Lord, Lord Neill, rightly did, and see that they have constitutional safeguards in their courts and so on, whereas we have our own safeguards, which are of a different kind. Sometimes we wonder whether, at the parliamentary level, they could be reinforced. Perhaps in the future they can be.

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0805157000024"></a>A perfectly legitimate question remains hanging in the air. Although my noble friend Lord Waddington may not want to be at the centre of the debate, the question is this: if we agree to this Lisbon treaty Bill, to what extent are we extending the areas in which the writ runs and the ECJ&#146;s law is supreme? That is a legitimate area of debate. We have established that the Court of Justice has supreme authority over a large area, but to what extent do we want to extend that? Extend it the Bill does and extend it the treaty does. No one denies the fact that the ECJ acquires, by the collapse of the Third Pillar and the movement of judicial and home affairs and even some aspects of foreign policy into the Union proper, new areas in which to reign. We have an absolutely legitimate query about the extent to which its writ should be extended.</p>

I will supply those to the noble Lord, but I will not go through them again now, as I know that there is tremendous pressure on time. Perhaps not all these areas will be directly affected, but the influence will certainly be there. The question also arises whether an individual case brought to the European Court of Justice arising from CFSP provisions is justiciable. The Government tried under the convention to have that clarified, but failed to do so. We have discussed that in great detail. I greatly respect the noble Lord, but we have a time constraint and I must push on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08051512000004"></a>The noble Baroness said that the member states make laws. It is the Council that makes the laws&#151;sometimes unanimously, sometimes without the veto. We are left with the fact that the principle of ECJ supremacy is there; the principle of non-supremacy of the Parliament of this nation is there, but the question is, how far does the ECJ&#146;s writ extend? How far does the principle extend and how far do we want it to extend? Now that the proposition of the Bill is that Pillar 3 be collapsed into the Union, the extension&#151;the purview&#151;of the ECJ would be extended further and the scope would be extended further. Is that what we want? I think not.</p>

Constitutional safeguards similar to those in other countries are needed to ensure that in the future we do not find ourselves dragged further and further into a pattern of law and supremacy for which nobody in this country voted; many people do not want it and it is not healthy for the future of this nation or for Europe. </p>

I hope he did not take offence at what I said. With such an interesting debate led by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, on the role of the German constitutional court, which I found so fascinating, I would have loved it to have ranged further and taken in other countries such as Denmark and Poland to which the noble Lord referred. I believe that I referred to France. It was in that spirit that I made my point. It is often frustrating when you wish to be brief from the Front Bench if you can see the opportunity to reiterate much of what you have said before for the benefit of noble Lords who had not participated. I apologise if I caused any offence&#151;it was not meant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08051512000007"></a>In a way this is a simple proposition which relies on the position that noble Lords take on Europe and the current treaty. Those noble Lords who believe we should not be in Europe at all&#151;and their view is perfectly formed&#151;will take great exception to the suggestion that some court outside the UK should have jurisdiction. Those who wish us to have a kind of halfway house in our relationship with Europe will equally wish to put in caveats to make sure that if there is a bit of law that they do not quite fancy on day two, they can prevent the UK being subject to it. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08051512000008"></a>I go back to what I have said during all our deliberations.

But that is where we are and I will not hide behind dancing on the head of a pin as to what is what.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08051512000009"></a>The Council of Ministers is made up of the member states. It is no good saying that the Council and not the member states makes the law, because the Council is made up of the member states. I have sat on the Council of Justice Ministers. I was there with a badge which said, &#147;UK Government&#148;. I gave my contributions, voted and made my decisions on that basis. I represented this Government, this country and its best interests throughout, as did all of the other colleagues around the table, representing the  27 member states.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08051512000010"></a>I am under no illusion about what I was doing. I was a representative of a member state moving to make better law. I believed that what I was doing was in the best interests of the citizens of this country. I have described civil justice as an important element. If people are to live, work, study, travel, buy or sell in the European Union they need a civil law backdrop that makes sure they are well protected in those transactions, whatever they be. That is fundamental.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08051512000011"></a>In the determination of that civil law, where we have made the law, the European Union Court of Justice interprets for all of us to make sure that each member state does what it says on the tin. Each of them enacts the law as it has been written. I am also under no illusion that that comes from the supremacy of this Parliament in signing up to the 1972 Act and all that went with it.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08051512000012"></a>At the end of the day, this Parliament will decide whether we repeal that Act or stay within the European Union. That is the fundamental point of this amendment and for me a very simple point. While we are part of the European Union, the European Court of Justice has a role and responsibility. The noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord Hunt of Wirral, have made it perfectly clear that they do not like the Third Pillar collapsing into the First Pillar. They do not seem to recognise the importance and relevance of the opt-ins that have been proposed. We will debate this further&#151;and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, will be able to put forward his case.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08051512000013"></a>In the context of the negotiations that have gone on around the Lisbon treaty, the UK is in a strong and good position&#151;we want to be part of the European Union. In justice and home affairs, collaboration with our European partners is central to many of the things that we want to achieve&#151;on serious and organised crime, terrorism, asylum and all sorts of issues and matters to do with collaboration and co-operation. We must look at the rub between what we are doing in Europe and in a domestic scenario and ensure that, when we sign up to it and opt in, it is in our best interests. Noble Lords will know that on some occasions on civil justice I opted in and on some occasions I did not. All those decisions were made on the basis of what I believed and my colleagues, more importantly, believed, were in the best interests of the UK. That will continue.</p>

<a name="80514-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08051512000014"></a>Part of what is factored in will be a recognition that the European Court of Justice will have a say in determining what the rules are and how they are

That is one of many factors that the UK Government will take into account, but it is just one. It is an important one, however, and part and parcel of what this treaty does. Noble Lords may decide that they do not like this and if they were on this side of the House they would renegotiate. Well, this has been a long negotiation, which started a great many years ago; it is time to move on from institutional reform and get on with the business of what being part of the European Union is for and tackle some of the long-term and difficult objectives that we all have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08051512000015"></a>In the context of the amendments, the role of Parliament is clear. It has the capacity to repeal the 1972 Act and to make that determination.

Can we please not have that sort of argument? The noble Lord, Lord Roper, has explained, and I have tried to explain, politely, the purpose of this instrument. It is a perfectly legitimate: it is for dealing with the activities that the European Union undertakes in the form of conflict prevention and peacekeeping operations outside the European Union. There are no provisions in any of the treaties for conducting such operations within the European Union. It is considered unthinkable that they should ever arise. You cannot turn negatives into positives in a vacuum. It really would be wiser if the noble Lord would, at this very late hour, ask the Minister to reply briefly and then withdraw his amendment because we are wasting time.</p>

When I withdrew my amendment earlier today, I hope I indicated&#151;perhaps I did not&#151;that I would return to it on this amendment.

If the noble Lord cares to read the House of Commons report on the use of Article 308, he will find that it applies to foreign crisis management, but is also applicable in this country and the European Union. This clause, Article 308, which was in the 1957 Act, and which allowed the Common Market, as it then was, to make minor adjustments to tariffs and so on, said that it could only be used in the course of the operation of the Common Market. This clause, with the support of the Luxembourg court, was used, among many other initiatives, to pass the control of civil contingencies to Brussels. Those civil contingencies clearly include civil contingencies in this country. There is no exception to them.</p>

I ask the Government: what is going on with this EU gendarmerie force? Can the Minister assure us that it will never be used to put down civil contingencies or for crisis management&#151;or however the Petersberg tasks wish to describe it&#151;in this country? Can the Minister give an unequivocal guarantee that the EU gendarmerie force will not be deployed in this country without parliamentary consent? Can he assure us that it will not be used, as is widely feared in Brussels and elsewhere, for instance, in the 2012 Olympic Games?</p>

I have read a great many documents on the EU gendarmerie force. Much of this is in the public domain. It started with civilian police operations in the western Balkans, to which the British made some contributions, usually from the Royal Ulster Constabulary. This has been used. There have been some operations in which civil police have operated in other European countries. British police, the noble Lord has no doubt not appreciated, walked in uniform on German soil during the last World Cup. It may well be that, during the British Olympics, police from other countries do the same here as a useful means of dealing with international crowds. That is entirely different from the delicate conspiracy theory of foreign takeover of Britain that the noble Lord is attempting to build.</p>

Under what authority were they deployed? No one seems to have answered that question. I think that they even manhandled the noble Lord, Lord Coe, who is in charge of our Olympics. If the Government are happy to have Chinese goons guarding the Olympic flame this year, will they have the EGF in any role in the future, whether at the Olympic Games or in any other capacity? Whether it might be for friendly matters at football matches, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, I do not know, but these are not friendly bobbies with whistles around their necks.

But that position would not arise because the European Gendarmerie Force is nothing to do with the European Union. There is no suggestion that it should be brought within the framework of the European Union using Article 352 or otherwise. In any event, it can operate only with the consent of the state concerned.

<p><a name="08051489000011"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am speaking for my noble friend Lord Howe and myself on this amendment. In Clause 50(1), the Bill proposes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000476"></a>&#147;The Commission may undertake or promote comparative or other studies designed to enable it to make recommendations ... for improving economy, efficiency and effectiveness in any activity mentioned in subsection (2)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000459"></a>Subsection (2) outlines those activities. Amendment No. 101B seeks to broaden the scope of the comparative studies to include the wider benefits and savings that medical technologies can bring. This is particularly timely given the Heath Select Committee&#146;s recent report on NICE. The committee said of the NICE process that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000477"></a>&#147;it is also vital that the system is accurate and reflects the real costs to society and the benefits to patients&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000460"></a>The Government agree that, while this is a complex area, the issue of how NICE takes into account the wider benefits and costs is a very important one and that it warrants further consideration. I hope that the Minister will give this item further consideration today.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000012"></a>Since the Care Quality Commission will take over the functions of the Healthcare Commission, including its role in ensuring implementation of NICE guidance, it is important to equip the new Care Quality Commission with the power to do so in an effective way. We talk a lot about joined-up government, and I applaud the appointment of Dame Carol Black, who works across the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions. I am sure that she would welcome

For example, where medical technologies enable people to continue in employment rather than have to claim incapacity benefit, those costs and benefits should be recognised.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000013"></a>A good case in point is the cutting edge technology Osigraft, which can be used to accelerate healing a bone following a break. Used during surgery, it can avoid the need for further operations and the resulting disruption to a patient&#146;s working life. New improved implants to replace damaged hips and other joints are being developed using newer materials. The impact on a patient&#146;s ability to continue in employment, thanks to increased longevity of the implants or their ability to improve the patient&#146;s mobility, should be taken into account. Currently, only the net cost and benefit to the NHS are looked at.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000014"></a>My final example is the improved insulin pumps, which provide a convenient yet sophisticated treatment for diabetic patients, benefiting their quality of life and equipping them to lead normal and productive lives. They are far preferable to multiple daily injections for many people. Unfortunately, five years after receiving NICE approval, there remains a pronounced variation in access to the pumps according to patient groups, including the members of the Medical Technology Group, which is a coalition of patient groups, research charities and manufacturers of medical technologies. I declare an interest as chair of the Association of Medical Research Charities.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000015"></a>Our amendment, at Clause 50(6)(c), seeks to redress the balance between medical technologies and drugs and to recognise the benefits that technologies can bring to patients. The Health Select Committee&#146;s report on NICE stated that there are problems with NICE&#146;s topic selection, and,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000478"></a>&#147;Only a few selected medical technologies are chosen as suitable for assessment as technology appraisals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000461"></a>As a country, our record on the uptake of innovation within the NHS is poor. Only 4.8 per cent of the NHS budget is spent on medical technology, compared with the European average of 9.4 per cent. As a regulator of health and social care, the CQC should rectify this situation.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000016"></a>The Health Select Committee, in its concluding remarks, stressed that NICE requires the backing of the Government. NICE must not be left to fight a lone battle and support cost and clinical effectiveness in the NHS. Paragraph (c) of our amendment supports the Select Committee&#146;s view. Again, I hope that the Minister will support the Select Committee here.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000017"></a>The recently formed Health Innovation Council&#151;unfortunately shortened to HIC, which sounds like something to do with the alcohol industry&#151;is a good idea. It has been established and is chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Darzi. It covers technologies as well as pharmaceuticals and other interventions. It seeks to deploy a strategy for speeding and embedding innovation across health and social care. In the light of that, I hope that the Minister will recommend the amendment to her ministerial colleague. I beg to move.</p>

The studies will look at both the independent assessment of the quality of NHS services nationally and the analysis of value for money, which is what we mean by economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000019"></a>In presenting recommendations, I would expect the commission to consider both the costs and the benefits in order to present a balanced view when making recommendations. Considerations of quality cannot be divorced from whether a service represents value for money. I also believe that the commission will consider both financial savings and economic gains in its reports. The amendment is therefore probably unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000020"></a>In particular, the emphasis on medical technology in the proposed Clause 50(6)(c) seems narrower than we hope these studies will be, given that they will cover both health and social care. We have discussed the important role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in producing guidance on the use of new and existing treatments and procedures within the NHS. While the Care Quality Commission absolutely should have regard to the use that providers make of innovation and technology, we would not want to duplicate NICE&#146;s role or to be too prescriptive about the way in which effectiveness can be achieved. As an independent body, the commission is best placed to decide what expertise it can draw on to carry out studies under Clause 50 and what recommendations are appropriate. I hope that the noble Baroness will now be reassured about our intentions for Clause 50 and feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000025"></a>The noble Baroness said: These are probing amendments. We are seeking to discover the department&#146;s proposals for regulating the emerging NHS market. Amendment No. 102 would introduce a new clause after Clause 51 and is designed to give the regulator powers to manage emerging competition within the NHS.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000026"></a>I would be very interested to know whether that is the Government's intention or whether they have a different model and a different regulator in mind. Whatever the model, subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the proposed new clause will be relevant. Subsection (1)(a) seeks to establish the principles and rules relating to competition between different commissioners or providers of healthcare. Subsection (1)(b) seeks to promote transparency and fairness in competition. This is in line with our previous amendments which set out to encourage openness. Subsection (2) would enable the regulator to publish studies and recommendations in the same way as the Healthcare Commission does now, and subsection (3) would ensure that the Secretary of State paid regard to the recommendations of the regulator.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000027"></a>It is clearly the Government's intention to have a mixed economy within the NHS&#151;competition between commissioners and providers within the NHS, and competition between the NHS and other providers from the private and independent sectors. Competition is seen as a tool to ratchet up quality standards and efficiency. Experience shows that there is a large body of opinion within the NHS that is ideologically against any quarter being given to the private sector. These people believe that the values of the founding fathers are being betrayed and that however good the private sector may be, it is not to meddle with the Christian socialist ethic that, whether rich, poor, black, white, young or old, healthcare should be provided free at the point of use. The Government, indeed, any Government, have an uphill struggle to change these attitudes and beliefs which are very deep in the British psyche.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000028"></a>When United Health Care Europe was selected to provide services in a GP practice in north-east Derbyshire, the PCT was taken to judicial review by the local people. Later the same company was successfully selected to take over another practice in central Derby. The results have been very interesting. The points awarded through the quality and outcomes framework have increased from 80 per cent to 98 per cent and the number of patients using the practice is up by 30 per cent. Neighbouring GPs who previously closed their practice lists have had to reopen them. It is evident that they have had to respond to competition in a way that they would not have done following a diktat from above.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000029"></a>Of course markets need to be managed and there is huge merit in the management being undertaken by an independent body, which, acting without fear or favour, will ensure a robust and fair system. It could be argued that the new CQC is well placed to take on this role since it will also control market entry and exit through registration, and has duties to ensure value for public money. I understand that at one time the Government considered giving this task to the CQC but then rowed back, and have now decided to set up their own  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC325"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Co-operation and Competition&#148; panel within the department. The title of the panel alone illustrates the complexities involved. When should co-operation be encouraged regardless of competition? When should competition be stimulated at the expense of co-operation? The two are uncomfortable bedfellows.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000030"></a>Understandably, the Government wish to start with a cautious approach and to feel their way, but this does beg the question: how independent is an independent regulator sitting snugly in Whitehall? Will there be pressures from down the Corridor&#151;temptations to favour NHS services in preference to independent providers, especially with the payment by results system in operation? Is it envisaged that the new panel will set prices in the same way as Ofcom and Ofgem do now? In the long term, are the Government planning that their regulator should be an economic regulator? How will it relate to the CQC and Monitor?</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000031"></a>However these issues are managed, it will always be essential for the regulator to assess each case openly and fairly, and for people to recognise it as a champion of public interest which is independent of the system. The proceedings, reports and findings will need to be published and made widely available.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000032"></a>If the Government seriously want to open up the market to competition, I think that their current approach with a departmental panel will be short-lived. There will be mounting pressure to have a freestanding body that is not only independent of government but seen to be independent, and, as we all know, perception is reality. As I have said, this is a probing amendment, and I hope that the Minister will be able to answer my questions. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, that is the Government&#146;s view. Yet they can be effective only if, as she said, there are clear rules guiding and governing behaviour in the healthcare system. I agree that developing competition principles and rules, and promoting transparency and fairness in competition, as Amendment No. 102 seeks to do, is very important. Indeed, in December 2007, the Department of Health published principles and rules for co-operation and competition as part of the NHS 2008-09 operating framework. In addition, in December, the Secretary of State made a commitment to establish a non-statutory co-operation and competition panel to provide independent advice on competition issues arising from the application of those principles and rules that have not been able to be resolved locally.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000034"></a>One of the functions that we currently propose for the panel is providing feedback and making recommendations to the department on how it should update the principles and rules for co-operation and competition. The noble Baroness asked how we will ensure that the panel is sufficiently independent and adequately resourced. It will have a high-calibre independent chair and operational vice-chair who can call on a range of relevant experts to resolve competition

It is intended that the panel will be established by October 2008.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000035"></a>The Department of Health is currently working with a range of regulators, including the OFT, Monitor, the Advertising Standards Authority and other government departments to ensure that the panel&#146;s approach is robust and achieves a consistency of values and approach with other regulators. We therefore see the panel, rather than the Care Quality Commission, as having the remit to advise the Department of Health on the principles of competition. This is in line with the results of our consultation on the future regulation of health and adult social care in England, which considered a role for the Care Quality Commission in competition issues. We propose that the panel has a role in advising the Department of Health and its stakeholders, such as other regulators, on competition rules, and we are establishing formal relationships between the panel and other relevant regulators to ensure that the panel operates effectively and efficiently. Once the Care Quality Commission is established, those discussions will commence.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000036"></a>That said, Clause 50 enables the commission to promote or undertake more general studies and make recommendations. In the course of carrying out those studies or any of its other statutory functions, the new commission may identify good practice that could inform competition rules and principles or other aspects of competition. Clause 49 constitutes a mechanism for the commission to feed such advice to the Secretary of State. I hope that I have explained our position sufficiently well to allow the amendment to be withdrawn.</p>

However, I am even less reassured because the panel is a creature of the department, and a body that will regulate competition in the NHS really should be independent. I understood her to say that the panel is not independent in that it is there just to advise the department, so who will regulate the economic side of this in the way that other regulators do?</p>

As the noble Baroness knows, I am very much in favour of the competition and choice agenda, and it is very likely that many people will be watching to see how this works and will see that it is reviewed in due course.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000048"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment builds on the concerns already expressed by a number of noble Lords, not only during the Second Reading debate, but in our discussions on the Bill, about the additional safeguards needed for those using social care facilities. It addresses the difficult issue of the frequency and circumstances in which inspections are carried out in the social care sector.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000049"></a>We already know that the moves towards lighter-touch regulation will further reduce on-site inspections from annual or twice-yearly to more periodic reviews. However, we continue to have an overriding duty of care to the most vulnerable people using, in particular, residential social care, who are less likely to have observant family and friends acting on their behalf and are less likely to complain about standards for fear of the consequences. This issue becomes even more critical when a wider variety of providers is entering the social care market.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000050"></a>The amendment would allow the Secretary of State by regulation to identify specific conditions which would trigger automatic additional inspections. This would need to be done in consultation with the commission. These conditions would be linked to circumstances in which it is known that deterioration is more likely. We already know some of those risk factors. They could include a change of ownership, a change of registered manager, adult protection proceedings on an individual who is in receipt of care at the premises, or an unexplained increase in staff turnover. Other conditions may be new factors that come to light in the application of the new provisions of the Act and the increasing competition in the market.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000051"></a>That is why giving the Secretary of State the powers to add conditions by regulation will provide flexibility in the application of the inspection regime in the future and will give some additional reassurance to service users and their families. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, this weekend, I am going back to the Lake District and will probably visit a couple more homes. I feel passionately about this business of inspections. Ministers have simply failed to understand the scale of concern on this issue among many of my honourable friends in the House of Commons and among Members of this House.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80514-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000054"></a>The only protection and assurance that someone in a nursing home, without a relative to visit them regularly, can have regarding the quality of service provided by that home is from the knowledge that the home is regularly inspected. I strongly object to a reduction in inspections.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000055"></a>The theory is that because a home achieves a top score for one year, it might as well not be visited the next year because it did well before. That is a nonsense because the conditions inside that home could have changed. The manager could have changed, as could the carers, the kitchen staff, the owner of the home or the shareholding control, whereby new pressures are exerted by a new management style. I see nothing in this legislation that even begins to dismantle the arrangements recently brought in governing the inspection of these homes. All the organisations I talk to have expressed their concern. The only people who seem to have no concerns about this are in the Government.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000056"></a>I believe that this part of the Bill is driven by people in the Treasury who have no idea what they are talking about. If a Treasury official comes up with an idea to make an economy in the use of taxpayers&#146; money, it is quickly given to civil servants in order to implement a change in the legislation and thus secure that economy. It is driven through the House of Commons on the back of a whipped vote. It comes into the House of Lords and is considered in committees like this one. The only people who have an opportunity of even knowing what is happening are those who attend the Second Reading debate in the House of Commons or committee sessions here. The proposal is put into legislation and the next thing we know, we see more and more newspaper articles drawing attention to the fact that an even higher number of homes are found to be operating to poor standards. I object very strongly to any reduction in the number of inspections that take place.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000057"></a>My noble friend might respond by saying that there will not be a reduction. However, I do not know the source of the term used by my noble friend, &#147;light touch&#148;. I am sure she has taken it from somewhere. &#147;Light touch&#148; must be a term used by someone in authority at some point who thought that the light-touch inspection of homes would satisfy the public&#146;s expectation of what we want to see when an inspection is carried out. I am sorry, but a light touch is not what I want and it is not what my colleagues want. I believe that Ministers should go back to their department and the Treasury and take a new look at the whole area. Again, I strongly object to what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000058"></a>I have tabled a Question for Written Answer to which my noble friend may have the opportunity of replying. It deals with a home in north-east England.  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC329"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I want to know about the inspection record of that home. What happened there, and how often was it inspected? I understand that in a state of panic it had to be closed down and people were prosecuted. So the question I have put down asks about the incidence of inspection over recent years. It will be interesting to see when the Answer comes through to what extent that home was inspected, how long it took to find out what was happening there, and why it subsequently became a scandal reported on national television.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000059"></a>The amendment of my noble friend is very important because in some ways it addresses the issues that I am raising.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000060"></a><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051489000571"></a>The Earl of Onslow:</b> It is not often that I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, but when we were both on the listing to look at the issue of the care of older people by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we heard about cases of bad homes. The reasons were absolutely crystal clear. There is increasing demand for places alongside a Treasury clampdown on costs. The wages paid to people working in these homes are not high, with many on the minimum wage, and a lot of them are foreigners.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000061"></a>I can tell the noble Lord what light touch means. It is the exact opposite of being a recruit at Caterham Barracks and having your bed space inspected by a Grenadier Guards sergeant. He would look for every single speck of dust and check whether a touch of Blanco had been left behind. You were put on a charge if anything was the slightest bit wrong. That is the direct opposite of light touch.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000062"></a>If there is a tendency for standards to slip because of the pressures I have outlined, inspection standards must be high and enforced more vigorously. We all know that we are facing a very serious problem of old age. People are living longer; people are, happily, being kept alive longer; as the noble Lord said, a large number of people have no one coming to see them and no one to look after them except the people in the care home. Obviously, there is an improvement on what happened 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still not satisfactory. The fear of inspection will maintain high standards. Light touch means doing practically nothing about it.</p>

I thought about it a lot because, with some notable exceptions, in my professional life I have come across the most downright harrowing incidents of treatment of older people in residential care. Because of that, I have arrived at the view that good organisations have absolutely nothing to fear from unannounced visits but bad organisations have everything to fear from them.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000064"></a>Bad residential homes are often very good at passing inspection visits, because an inspection visit is only an inspection at a particular time. For example, an elderly person I know told me about a home in which a friend of hers was. She said: &#147;It is absolutely awful. Every older person in the area knows that it is  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>awful. You know what? One day, they got up and everyone had brand-new sheets put on their bed. We all wondered whether the people coming round might wonder why everyone had brand-new sheets on the bed, but we are not sure whether they did&#148;. I do not have an aversion to light touch in the sense that it is proportionate, so that bad homes get frequent inspections, but the key thing is that those inspections are unannounced.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000065"></a>I do not question the intentions of the noble Baroness for a moment, but the second reason why I think that the amendment is wrong is that what passes for poor quality and bad practice in one home may not in another. They are people's homes; sometimes homes can be not exactly up to pristine scratch. Why? Because they are places where people live; there may be good reasons for that. The process of judging overall whether a home is, first, of good quality and, secondly, whether people are subject to abuse is quite subtle. What we really do not need is a replication of a very crude Ofsted tick-box approach. We are talking about people's lives.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000066"></a>I do not think that a list is right because I have not seen any evidence that the transfer of ownership of a home is necessarily an indicator of a change in practice. I am willing to be persuaded otherwise, but I have not seen it. I want an inspection regime that is effective because it is a deterrent. I very much fear that if we take the approach proposed by the noble Baroness, we may end up with an inspection approach that is very predictable. That would not serve people well. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, is absolutely right to ask his question about the documents.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000067"></a>This is probably one of the single most important aspects of the Bill, which will have an effect on people's lives. It is important that we have completely different inspection regimes for acute hospitals and small places; but it does not matter whether it is St Thomas&#146;s or somewhere little, it is unannounced visits that are fundamental to and at the heart of all of this.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000068"></a><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051489000573"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> Having listened to the passion of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I very much agree with what he said, as well of course with the amendment, particularly because it reminds me of when I chaired a local authority investigation, on behalf both of the unions and the local authorities, into local authority care homes of all ages. We have all heard of the terrible things that are happening in many homes, and equally we all know of the marvellous things that are happening in many homes, but this problem of more and more elderly people going into care with very few people to look after their interests is not going to go away.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000069"></a>We all know what happens during inspections. I have served on hospital authorities and everything else, and I know that everything is cleaned up and made nice and tidy for the inspection, so I entirely support the point made about uninspected visits. Why should local authority members not be responsible for one of the homes in their area and make a friendly visit at any time of the day or night? It always struck me as very odd indeed that it is always the officials who make the inspections. I am sure that some  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>members of local authorities do visit their homes, but if they were allocated a particular home and a particular responsibility and formed a relationship, that would be one way of looking at the whole matter. I merely throw that open to the Minister to think about. Perhaps he will take up some of the ideas.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000070"></a><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051489000574"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> I apologise to the Committee for arriving late and therefore for not hearing all the interventions. I have taken part in debates on most of the rest of the Bill, so may I be forgiven and be allowed to intervene on this amendment? I regret not having heard the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who usually informs my thinking. Perhaps he has not yet spoken.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000071"></a>One of my great concerns about the Bill is that we will have such regulation from the Secretary of State that the governing board and the executive of the new commission will not be able to take a strategic overview of what they find and will not be able to adapt and be flexible in their interventions and inspections in what will be a vast organisation. I speak particularly from my understanding of health and social care. I am not an expert in the health service, but I was one of the people who set up the National Care Standards Commission and who insisted that there were a number of unannounced inspections: people do now arrive on your doorstep. I am the chair of Liveability and know that at any moment you can expect someone to turn up on your doorstep on an unannounced visit, which means that you need quite properly to be on your toes most of the time.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000072"></a>Some information is historical. When I joined the National Care Standards Commission, I remember that we were criticised heavily for the number of homes that closed. Quite honestly, none of us would have wanted anyone whom we cared for or loved&#151;or even if we did not love them&#151;to live in a number of those homes. Many of them were closed, and members of the Government and the Opposition criticised what happened at that time because of the diminishing number of establishments.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000073"></a>At the moment, you will find on average that standards are reasonably good, if not excellent in many places. When Members have a complaint, they should ask to visit&#151;you can visit&#151;and ask the commission to observe the inspection. Indeed, inspections are published, so you can see what is happening. I only hope that as a result of the amendments we do not end up with a more restrictive regime that adds to the structure of the inspection, and that the new commission can put together an inspection in a way that responds to the new organisation and gives the best possible care to those for whom it will be responsible. Thank you for allowing me to intervene.</p>

I strongly support the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. I was a Mental Health Act commissioner for about five years and from time to time visited such institutions where we would find a little thing missing or a legal point out of order. However, that was quite

Then we found that someone had committed suicide because, because, because&#151;we gained a whole raft of information on those unannounced visits. I cannot say what a difference that made to the efficacy of the commission. So, any more visiting should be of an unannounced kind.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000075"></a>My second point concerns the links that some of us talked about at great length on previous legislation. I have trouble thinking about how the LINks people are going to be affected. It may be that with the CQC, possibly being invited by the CQC to make unannounced visits on its behalf and report back, there could be a really valuable role for the new LINks. I do not need to take up any more of the Committee&#146;s time.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000076"></a><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051489000576"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> This has been an interesting debate. Members of the Committee will not be surprised to hear that I thought the noble Baronesses, Lady Howarth and Lady Meacher, put their finger on some of the key points. Both amendments deal with the inspections that the Care Quality Commission will carry out as a vital part of fulfilling its functions both to ensure compliance with registration requirements and in some cases to contribute to its review activities.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000077"></a>I sympathise with the intention behind Amendment No. 103 to allow the ability to set specific triggers for commission inspections, and the remarks of my noble friends Lady Jones and Lord Campbell-Savours. Neither I nor my noble friend the Minister has at any point used the term &#147;light touch&#148;. It is not part of the terminology that we use to describe what the Bill seeks to do, and it is not part of the regime that we are hoping the commission will establish. The person who used the right word was the noble Baroness, Lady Barker; it is &#147;proportionate&#148;.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000078"></a>A similar amendment was debated in the other place, and my honourable friend the Minister for Health was at that stage able to provide sufficient reassurance for the amendment to be withdrawn. However, I appreciate that people remain concerned that certain circumstances&#151;for example, a change of management or ownership of the social care provider&#151;can have a huge impact on the quality of care. But they may not have&#151;they may improve the quality of care and could well be triggers for a new regulator to want to carry out an inspection. Other triggers might include serious incidents, staff turnover or sudden increases which often indicate that something else is going wrong.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000079"></a>I understand the concern that without the commission recognising such triggers, serious problems might not be spotted. That would of course be of particular concern if inspections otherwise happened only in a fixed cycle. However, I should stress to Members of the Committee that we are certainly not intending to set fixed cycles for inspections. Indeed, we are committed to giving the regulator greater freedom to develop a proportionate approach to regulation, building on the good work of the current commission&#146;s in the case of social care&#151;</p>

So the answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question is, in fact, no. There is no intention to reduce the resources that will be available to this organisation to build its work.</p>

We have three regulators who do an excellent job and through CSCI&#146;s work in social care, for example, it is the intention that its methodology will be used to inform the inspections that take place under the new regime. The development of its work will very much inform what will happen next.</p>

What has been the saving to date arising from the reduction in the inspectorate or those responsible for inspecting?

Returning to the question, the Bill allows the commission to focus its inspection activity where it is most needed. Let us not forget that the Bill in Clause 2 makes clear that the commission must in everything that it does pay particular heed to the need to safeguard the rights and welfare of vulnerable people. It is highly likely that as part of its methodology the commission will want to develop a sensitive range of triggers for a range of different settings and, indeed, we would encourage it to work with staff, Unison, other unions, residents and relevant organisations and others to develop this.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000088"></a>I really do believe that if the commission is to be the independent, intelligent regulator that we all want it to be, it is vital that there is flexibility to develop this methodology and not set it in secondary legislation&#151;or to involve the tick-boxes that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned. After all, as the nature of services evolves, we would like the commission&#146;s methodology to evolve, and while it is tempting to specify particular triggers for inspections,  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>doing so could unwittingly tie the commission&#146;s hands or cause it to devote less attention to emerging risk factors.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000089"></a>Amendment No. 104A probes the purpose of one of several provisions in the Bill designed to maximise coherence and transparency for all those with an interest, particularly the providers who are being regulated. The provisions for the commission to have inspection programmes and inspection frameworks mirror provisions for other public sector inspectorates. For example, Ofsted&#146;s chief inspector and the Audit Commission are each required by the relevant primary legislation to produce &#147;inspection programmes&#148; and &#147;inspection frameworks&#148;.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000090"></a>Similarly, a separate document setting out the planned frequency of the commission&#146;s reviews provided for in Clause 43 will be informative to those who are being regulated. Noble Lords will appreciate that knowing how often you are likely to have comparative information published about you in a review and what additional reporting this might involve is important to a provider. Periodic reviews, special reviews and investigations will draw on existing sources of information and, wherever possible, minimise the burden of the reviews to the providers. The current regulators have developed methodologies that help them to achieve exactly this. That said, because a review might involve some inspection activity there is a link between the commission&#146;s periodic reviews and its inspection programmes.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000091"></a>Noble Lords will also note that under Clause 77, the commission will similarly publish its programme of other reviews and studies. It is important that each of these different areas of the commission&#146;s responsibilities is made transparent. Each of these documents will, therefore, play a role in ensuring that service providers understand the wider work programme that the commission will undertake and they will help to reduce the burdens on front-line providers. In principle, I see no reason why the commission would not combine one or more of these into a single document. If the commission felt that it could still fulfil its responsibilities in this way, that would be a decision it would be able to take.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000092"></a>Nothing in these requirements prevents the Care Quality Commission making unannounced inspections, as sub-paragraph 5(5) makes clear. I hope the Committee will appreciate that these provisions are intended to help the relevant regulators minimise burdens on the front line by enabling them to co-ordinate their respective activity. They also provide clarity for providers so that they understand what level of inspection activity they might expect and when. I hope that with those assurances my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I did not suggest that we should move away from unannounced visits. At the heart of what I was proposing was the idea that we should retain what we have at the moment; namely, unannounced visits, primarily with inspectors trained to ask the right questions and to probe the right issues when they appear on premises. We are trying to retain that in the amendment. I take the

There is a skill involved in doing that but I believe that our inspectors are trained to ask the right questions, to make residents feel at ease and consequently to find out what they really think about where they live. If they are happy with their home, that will come across and there should be no further worries.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000094"></a>The other point that was raised&#151;it has been raised on several occasions&#151;concerned the overuse of tick boxes. I am worried that the Government propose to move away from on-site inspections to an increased use of form filling whereby people will be able to tick boxes and self-justify their activities. I am still not clear whether the Minister is saying that, having gone through a whole series of cuts, inspections will not be cut further. If she is saying that, I shall feel slightly reassured and be prepared to withdraw the amendment. However, I would like further clarification on whether we shall retain the current level of on-site inspections, which is what I intended my amendment to deliver. However, I thought that I had made a neat compromise that went some way to accommodate what the Government are trying to do. I seek clarification on that.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000112"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment seeks to resolve the crucial relationship between the new Care Quality Commission and Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. Grouped with it is Amendment No. 212, to which I shall return later, which addresses Monitor&#146;s current status. Firs, I must declare a personal interest as a member of the board of Monitor. This is also an opportunity for me to express my admiration for the rigour and quality of the regulatory regime that Monitor has established. Unfortunately, I cannot claim to have contributed much to it personally, since it was set up well before I joined the board. However, it bears witness to the superb work of the chair and chief executive, Bill Moyes, and his inspiring team of executives, most of whom come from outside the health service but all of whom feel passionately about improving the quality of care in the NHS.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000113"></a>As the Bill stands, it could damage the accountability arrangements for NHS foundation trusts and weaken the effective regulatory regime currently in place. It introduces a second regulator of NHSFTs with overlapping intervention powers and blurs the clarity of the accountability arrangements, putting at risk the success that Monitor has had to date. I should remind noble Lords that just under 90 of the 220 NHS trusts are now foundation trusts, and it is expected that all trusts will become foundation trusts quite quickly. The success of FTs reflects on the effectiveness of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC337"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regime in which they operate, and indeed the regime has proved its effectiveness by identifying and ensuring the correction of failings in both service and financial performance.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000114"></a>There are well-known examples such as the Bradford hospitals and UCLH as well as quiet interventions that are not so widely known publicly where major board changes have effected improvements in governance arrangements. I refer to Peterborough, Moorfields Eye Hospital and several others. Surely it would be better to build on the existing successful approach taken by Monitor and the Healthcare Commission working together. In the current arrangements, the HCC uses its clinical expertise to assess compliance with core standards and identify failures. It is, however, for Monitor to ensure that NHS foundation trusts address these failures and intervene if necessary.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000115"></a>I am not convinced that Ministers have understood what it is that Monitor does. Monitor is not simply an authorisation regime, although it is rather famous for the rigour of its authorisation process. In fact, its main function is that of an ongoing compliance organisation because compliance monitoring is its primary activity. We monitor how finances are managed and, crucially, quality as evidenced by performance against targets set by the Government, and the delivery of quality standards established by the Healthcare Commission. We do not monitor quality in order to assess the governance capacity of the board, as I believe Ministers may think. In fact it is exactly the opposite. We monitor on a quarterly rolling programme which has predictive value, whereas the Healthcare Commission collects aggregate quality data at the end of the year. The pragmatic collection of predictive information has the potential for use as a tool for improvement. There is no conflict at all here, rather there is total complementarity between the way Monitor works to assess predictively how quality is being upheld, along with the Healthcare Commission&#146;s assessment at the end of the year.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000116"></a>Monitor has run an exercise to look at what would have happened if, for example, Maidstone and Tonbridge Wells NHS Trust had been a foundation trust. Would its compliance regime have picked up earlier what was happening? Indeed, it would have done so. We believe that we would have known considerably earlier that the trust was in deep trouble with regard to the development of its MRSA and C. diff. problem. Monitor&#146;s wide-ranging powers are much more useful in securing improved performance in NHS foundation trusts, and indeed in all trusts, than the powers being proposed for the CQC, which are essentially limited to the issue of warning notices, fines, the closure of services, and of course the pressures that we know all regulatory bodies can exert through personal influence.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000117"></a>The government policy document <I>The future regulation of health and social care in England: response to consultation</I> set out clear arrangements for Monitor and the CQC working together, yet this position is not reflected in the Bill. The issue is that in providing the CQC with intervention powers that cut across NHS foundation trusts, the Bill creates a situation where NHS foundation  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC338"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trusts face two regulators with overlapping powers and no clear accountabilities or boundaries to their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000118"></a>The Bill needs to be amended so that there is clarity in the roles and responsibilities of the two organisations in relation to FTs. This should be addressed in the legislation. Only one regulator should be accountable for foundation trust performance. Having two regulators will not work. It would lead to confusion, duplication and delay; and there would be arguments about who intervenes on what account. There should be one regulator clearly accountable for performance.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000119"></a>There are strong arguments for Monitor retaining the primary accountability for NHS FTs. It is the only body that is able to take a broad view of FTs&#146; performance covering both service quality and financial performance. It is no good saying that you have a problem in one area and discovering that there is not sufficient money going in from the primary care trust to effect anything like the quality that is required and that the trust has no ability to manage the finances in a particular area. Monitor has wide-ranging powers to address failings, from requiring particular actions, such as the withdrawal of a service, to replacing the board of directors. Changing the regime merely introduces unnecessary risk.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000120"></a>The Government have argued that to provide a level playing field all providers must meet the same standards and face intervention by the same body. While I agree that common standards are crucial, I see no reason why the same body must be responsible for enforcement. The regulatory regimes for the different types of providers are simply different and we should seek the arrangements that provide the clearest lines of accountability and the best prospects of success.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000121"></a>The amendment would provide for a clear, single line of accountability and ensure that NHS foundation trusts were assessed for their compliance with registration requirements by CQC in the same way as any other registered providers. Monitor and the CQC would work together on who was to issue the warning notice and who was to intervene, and the CQC would be responsible for intervening to rectify identified failings, just as the Healthcare Commission does now.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000122"></a>I accept that in the most serious cases, where there is serious risk of harm, the CQC would still be free to seek an urgent cancellation of an FT&#146;s registration by order of a JP. That seems to us entirely proper. The CQC would seek Monitor&#146;s support and approval before imposing an urgent suspension or variation on an FT. This would ensure that it could not circumvent the role of the independent regulator. The power currently provided in the Bill is drawn extremely widely and at the discretion of the CQC. It would be possible to replicate the existing, successful arrangements that Monitor and the Healthcare Commission have put in place without jeopardising the role of the CQC, which is so vital to this new regime.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000123"></a>Some of the points made during the Second Reading of the Health and Social Care Bill added to my concerns. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, in his winding-up speech recognised that the relationship  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC339"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between Monitor and the proposed Care Quality Commission is an issue, but he did not address the key concern. There seems to be a lack of understanding at departmental level that Monitor is first and foremost a compliance organisation.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000124"></a>I know that there have been attempts behind the scenes to produce a way forward, which has not yet been achieved. I very much hope that the Government will continue to seek some resolution to what we see as a most important and difficult issue for an effective regulatory regime.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000125"></a>Briefly, Amendment No. 212 is something of a minority interest. Monitor&#146;s current status is that of an executive non-departmental public body, despite the Government&#146;s stated intention in 2003, during the passage of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, that the independent regulator should be a non-ministerial government department. To give the Committee chapter and verse, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, stated in Committee on 13 October 2003:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000494"></a>&#147;The office of the independent regulator would be a non-ministerial department&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/10/03; col. 620.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000126"></a>Further, in answer to a Written Question on 16 October 2003, John Hutton answered that Monitor would be established as a non-ministerial government department. Also, as Members will be aware, the Government&#146;s report, entitled <I>Reconf</I><I>iguring the Department of Health&#146;</I><I>s </I><I>Arm&#146;</I><I>s </I><I>L</I><I>ength </I><I>B</I><I>odies</I>, published in 2004, reconfirms very clearly the Government&#146;s commitment to establish Monitor as a non-ministerial government department. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000495"></a>&#147;When a suitable legislative opportunity arises, the Regulator will be formally established as a Non-Ministerial Government Department. This is a technical change and will not have a significant impact on the current organisational arrangements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000127"></a>Monitor&#146;s current status results from the erroneous inclusion of paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 2 to the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. Unfortunately, the inclusion of the paragraph, which I shall not quote from now, meant that the Cabinet Office could not classify Monitor as a non-ministerial government department. However, there have now been two opportunities in legislation to amend this. The amendment would give Monitor the status that was originally intended.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000128"></a>Why is Monitor so fussed about this? In practical terms, its independence from the Department of Health&#151;in some ways, of course, everyone needs a responsible Minister to report to&#151;would effectively put Monitor&#146;s position beyond doubt and on a level footing with other established regulators such as the Food Standards Agency, the Charity Commission and Ofsted. The main purpose of the amendment is to try to understand why the Government have resisted doing what they said they would do. Is this, as I suspect, because of the resurgence of the centralising tendencies in the past few months? Is that why we have never achieved the status that we were promised? Is there a shifting attitude, which we have heard in some small measure in the past days of this Committee, to the powers that the Secretary of State will have in relation  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC340"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the CQC? I wonder whether the Minister can reassure me if I am wrong. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000129"></a><a name="80514-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051489000590"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I strongly support the purpose behind Amendment No. 106, which was moved so ably by my noble friend Lady Murphy and to which I added my name. It is important to see the amendment as a probing amendment, because I do not think that any of us feels that we necessarily have the words precisely right. I spoke about this at Second Reading very much from my experience on the receiving end of the services of Monitor. I shall not repeat what I said then, but I do want to make a few points.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000130"></a>It is significant, and perhaps rather shocking, that the consultation document, the subtitle of which is &#147;The future regulation of health and adult social care in England&#148;, makes no mention of Monitor, the independent regulator of nearly half the provider health trusts in this country. I checked this with the Bill team and with Monitor, and I think it is true to say&#151;have you found it since, then?&#151;that none of us could find any reference to it. If someone has found a little reference to it, it is obviously very well hidden away. None of us could find it the other day.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000131"></a>This lack of attention suggests that the potential confusion and double jeopardy in the future system were not adequately taken into account by those people who planned this legislation. No one anticipated the serious issues which could arise when a failing trust finds itself under scrutiny by two regulators who will be fighting between themselves about whose warnings, and sanctions should be used to bring the trust into line. What a time to have confusion.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000132"></a>I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, fully understands the risks of this double jeopardy and the need to do something to avoid potential problems. But why does this issue give rise to such concern? It is that we risk damaging what in my view is the best regulatory system that the NHS has ever had. That is rather a strong comment to make, but I have been around, in and out of this system, for about 25 years. </p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000133"></a>The system of regulation by Monitor is incredibly effective, in my view, not only in ensuring the financial viability of the trust, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, but also in raising standards. I will not repeat the extraordinary impact on my own trust of raising standards&#151;I covered all that on Second Reading. Therefore, for me, this is the first time that the regulatory system enables high-flying managers to get on with the job, to think laterally and to innovate without the dead hand of bureaucracy eliminating all initiative. I have to say that that is how it has felt to me, as a member of boards in the NHS for many years.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000134"></a>I cannot overemphasise the importance of that aspect to the quality of services that the NHS is going to provide over the years ahead. It is the more important when foundation trusts will, as we know, become the norm in the NHS as regards providers. If a board underperforms, I am clear that Monitor will micromanage the organisation until the Government&#146;s failures have been put right. But if a board does well, if the financial position is strong and if reports from  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC341"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service users and the Healthcare Commission show that services are good and improving, Monitor will take a careful view, monitoring quarter by quarter how it is doing, and pick up any change. My trust is under obligation to report to Monitor any significant change in it: for instance, a change of chief executive; a change of chair; a difference in our financial systems; and a poor report from the Healthcare Commission on a particular aspect of our service. If it did not report those matters to Monitor, it would be seen to have failed and it would come under very close scrutiny. We are left in no doubt about those things. It is therefore a very robust system when it needs to be, which to me feels right.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000135"></a>I want also to emphasise that the relationship between Monitor and the Healthcare Commission appears to work well. From the receiving end, you do not get a sense of confusion in those bodies. But the CQC will have more powers than the Healthcare Commission. I have no objection to that in principle, but the work of Monitor risks being undermined if the powers of the two bodies are not clarified in the legislative framework. It would be a shame if the legislation were to undermine the highly successful regulatory system put in place by our Labour Government. So far, we have suggestions that the CQC will have the power to consult with various organisations. That, in relation to Monitor, would be disastrous. We know that consultation means that you talk and listen to people, but then you can go away and ignore what they have said. I would therefore be most grateful if the Minister would today assure the Committee that either in the Bill or in regulations&#151;one or the other, it is not frantically important, but it would be nice to have it in the Bill&#151;there will be a clear provision to ensure that Monitor&#146;s powers are protected. It should be made clear that the CQC and Monitor are equal and that their powers should be clearly different and complementary.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000137"></a>I reassure the Committee that the Bill already provides for those two organisations to share information and co-ordinate their efforts. The provisions mean that the amendment is unnecessary. The first part of the amendment would require the commission to send a copy of any warning notice it served on a foundation trust to Monitor as well. Clause 35 already provides for this. In addition, Clause 66 requires the commission and Monitor to co-operate to carry out their respective functions. In particular, it states that the two organisations must share information with each other. Together, Clauses 35 and 66 will ensure that Monitor is aware of any concerns that the Commission has in relation to a foundation trust.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC342"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000138"></a>Clause 66 requires no further amendment to achieve an effective working relationship between Monitor and the Care Quality Commission&#151;which is, after all, what we all want; it is essential. We would like them to work out for themselves what that relationship would look like, in the same way that the Healthcare Commission and Monitor developed their own successful working relationship, although we would expect it to be similar to the arrangements in the future regulation of health and adult social care in England consultation document.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000139"></a>Furthermore, what especially concerns me is that the amendment risks confusing the different roles of the commission and Monitor. The commission is being established to ensure that all providers of health and social care services maintain the required levels of safety, service quality and governance. Monitor&#146;s specific role is to ensure that foundation trusts are financially strong and demonstrate the quality of governance to operate autonomously as public benefit corporations.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000140"></a>In that context, the amendment significantly weakens the Commission&#146;s enforcement powers. It is vital that the Commission has strong enforcement tools that it can exercise independently and swiftly when necessary to ensure the safety and quality of all services. For example, when the commission responds to a safety or quality failing with a warning notice, the NHS foundation trust will be responsible for delivering the necessary improvements. Monitor will work with the NHS foundation trust to ensure compliance, because it will be concerned about the impact of enforcement action on the NHS foundation trust&#146;s ability to operate. Monitor&#146;s powers of intervention are available and will be used if required. If the provider fails to correct the problem, the commission, taking account of advice from Monitor, may undertake further enforcement action to protect patients using the services.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000141"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 212, Monitor is an independent body corporate established under the Health and Social Care Act 2003&#151;consolidated by the NHS Act 2006&#151;to authorise NHS foundation trusts and oversee their operation within the statutory framework for foundation trusts. The amendment would make Monitor a Crown body, changing Monitor&#146;s classification from non-departmental public body to non-ministerial department status.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000142"></a>We do not support the amendment; I cannot satisfy the noble Baroness. NDPB status gives Monitor independence within its remit while maintaining strong public accountability to Parliament via the Secretary of State. As an NDPB, Monitor has established a reputation for its independence, competence and rigour that is widely recognised. Its classification has not compromised the way in which it operates. We are not aware of any scrutiny of Monitor&#146;s independence nor has its classification become a matter of public concern.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000143"></a>Subject to legislation, the CQC will be established as a non-departmental public body. That is the most appropriate structure for that organisation and we do not think it is appropriate to have differing arrangements for the CQC and Monitor. I therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In this part of the Bill we have very few friends. Normally when we have a Bill there is a body of people who say, &#147;Yup, what you&#146;re doing is absolutely right&#148;, but it has been hard to find that constituency with regard to merging these three bodies. In opening, the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said that here we have two regulators with no boundaries and with overlapping powers. We have a situation that could end up in quite a muddle. I take the points that have been made about people knowing exactly who is going to regulate and who is going to do what. I wonder if the Minister thinks that this is an area where the two bodies should get some guidelines together so that everyone knows exactly who is doing what and when.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000145"></a>Monitor has been sensationally good. When one sees the amount of fear and anxiety there is about doing well in the people who are going before Monitor in order to become a foundation trust, including among the non-executives, one can see why it has been such a good regulator. If all the institutions become foundation trusts, do we have an opportunity here for Monitor to regulate the hospitals so that more of the work for social care could be in the remit of the new Care Quality Commission? That could go some way towards welcoming some of the thoughts that have been put to the Minister throughout Committee about the separation that we already have.</p>

Legislation is only part of the story, though, and Monitor and the Care Quality Commission will need to work out in detail how to work together and how to ensure that they do not fall over each other, that they are both effective and that Monitor can continue to be the powerful regulator that it already is.</p>

I strongly respect the views expressed by the noble Baroness about the value of trying to separate these responsibilities entirely; it would make so much sense.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000148"></a><a name="80514-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051489000595"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> It is essential for public assurance that the Care Quality Commission takes the same approach to all types of provider. That is our starting point. It is not a question of who is more or less equal, but of how you make both bodies work effectively together. The existing legislation sets out Monitor&#146;s statutory powers to intervene, and the new legislation will give the Care Quality Commission statutory powers to apply sanctions. The two bodies have to work out how best to apply the best of what they do.</p>

There is no doubt that there have been many discussions, and I know that Bill Moyes, the chairman of Monitor, has met the noble Baroness, Lady Young, on a number of occasions to discuss how they are going to work together. It is crucial that we are clear how this is going to work. It has the potential to create really serious problems, not just for foundation trusts but for both regulators. That is something which the Government should follow with interest when the Bill is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000172"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 112. These amendments echo the confusion evident in our debates on Clauses 29 and 30 about exactly who is deemed to be responsible when offences take place. They have been tabled separately  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC345"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because this clause applies solely to charitable bodies&#151;I believe that that is the case when we talk about unincorporated associations. Before I get down to the specific detail, I want to ask a broad question. Can the noble Baroness explain to the Committee what sort of unincorporated association she believes would be likely to be undertaking regulated services? I assume that she means small residential establishments and so on.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000173"></a>The two detailed questions I want to ask are reflected in the amendments. First, the clause appears, for the purposes of offences under this Bill, to treat unincorporated associations as though they are in fact corporate bodies. I want to ensure that we are not overriding some of the basic tenets of charity law in this legislation. I quite understand that it is not the members of the association whom the Government want to be criminalised, but I should have thought that the trustees of the association should bear responsibility.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000174"></a>My second point is about payment of fines. I quite understand that the Government may want to enable unincorporated associations to pay fines from their charitable funds if that were deemed to be appropriate. I do not quite understand why they want to insist on that, rather than leaving it to be judged case-by-case, where it would be evident whether the offence had happened because of the deliberate policy as determined by the trustees of the association or as a result of an action of an employee in contravention of the trustees&#146; policies. That is the sort of issue that normally arises with charities. I do not quite see how what the Government are trying to do is consistent with the tenets of charity law. I seek clarification on that. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000176"></a>I understand that unincorporated association status is usually chosen when a number of individuals agree or contract to come together for a common purpose, which may be of a social nature. Those organisations are usually run informally and are common in the voluntary sector. The noble Baroness is absolutely right: a management committee is elected to run the organisation on behalf of the members. Unlike limited companies, unincorporated associations have no separate existence from their individual members. The association itself has no legal rights, as it is not perceived as a separate entity; nor can an association be convicted of a common law offence.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000177"></a>However, an unincorporated association can be liable for a statutory offence. The purpose of Clause 88(1) is to make it clear that offences under the Bill may be committed by an unincorporated association. That ensures that in cases where the fault lies with the organisation, rather than any one individual&#151;or if the organisation is liable vicariously for the actions of its employees&#151;the association will be prosecuted. That will be the same for corporate bodies under Clause 87. Nevertheless, where an offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of an  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC346"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officer or member, then they, as well as the association itself, are liable for proceedings to be brought against them. The wording of Clause 88 is based on existing legislation, such as Section 207 of the NHS Act 2006.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000178"></a>As an unincorporated association is not a legal entity, its assets will be held by members as trustees on behalf of the association. However, it is not appropriate that proceedings should be brought against the trustees of the association, who may be individuals with no responsibility for the actions in question. Any fine subsequently imposed will be paid by the trustees but with the association&#146;s funds. In other words, the association will be found liable and the fine will come out of the association&#146;s fund.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000179"></a>Amendment No. 112 appears to be designed to allow for individual officers and members of an association to be liable for payment of fines, as well as the association itself. The amendment is unnecessary as Clause 88 already makes provision for individual officers or members to be liable if an offence is committed with their consent or connivance. Where proceedings are taken against an individual officer or member, they will be personally liable for any fines.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000180"></a>I thank the noble Baroness for tabling the amendments and giving me the opportunity to explain the Bill&#146;s provisions; I hope that she will be content to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am glad that she confirmed that my knowledge is still up-to-date. Trustees of an unincorporated association are jointly and severally liable for offences if they behave in a way that is imprudent or knowingly unlawful. It is precisely because trustees need to be clear about their responsibilities that it is important to state in legislation that they have that responsibility whether or not they are incorporated. The standard of judgment may be the same, but they retain that responsibility.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000182"></a>I see the point that the Minister is making: where an officer is found to be acting in contravention of the organisation's policy, they too can be sued, but her answer confused rather than clarified the position of unincorporated associations. However, I realise that this is a minority sport in the Committee. I am happy to take the issue away; perhaps we can clarify it in correspondence later. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, I was eventually dragged around to the view, which I have now accepted, that it is important that the Human Rights Act should be part of the care of old people.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000200"></a>Those in the nursing profession told us that they had had practically no training on this subject, and that this was a lever they could use to make things better. All I am doing here on behalf of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, in whose name the amendments is tabled, is asking that something to the effect of this collection of amendments should be in the Bill. I am sure the Government will say that it is unnecessary, because they have already said so. We do not agree with them because, it says in my brief, it was suggested that knowledge about how to use these rights to provide a better service to patients and service users was extremely limited. If we could have this in the Bill, it would help a little; it would ensure that these things are understood and, above all, that people are properly trained to use them. That would make things generally better all round and is a good idea. I beg to move.</p>

Since this is a brand new topic for the Committee, I thought I would say a few words before I address the issue raised by the noble Earl&#151;and it is a delight to have him with us again.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000202"></a>As noble Lords know, in recent years there have been a number of high-profile inquiries, such as the Shipman inquiry, into doctors who have harmed their patients. These inquiries have highlighted serious failings in the system of professional regulation and undermined the confidence of patients and professionals in the existing system. The Government have looked carefully at the recommendations of those inquiries, which have informed how professional regulation for all health and social care professionals should and could be modernised and improved more generally. Consultation resulted in a White Paper, published in February last year. The Bill carries forward the primary legislative elements of that White Paper. Before we go into detail on the measures in Committee, I emphasise that they are only part of a wider reform programme.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000203"></a>The amendments spoken to by the noble Earl&#151;Amendments Nos. 117, 138, 154, 157 and 160&#151;deal with a number of matters raised in the eighth report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which were tabled by the JCHR on Report in the other place and debated at that point.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000204"></a>The Government recognise the need to improve human rights training and to embed human rights in the training and induction programmes of all staff in health and social care. The Joint Committee set us the task of reporting at the Committee stage in this House on what progress we are making, and I hope that I will be able to do so. As the Joint Committee acknowledges in its report, <I>The Human Rights of Older People in Healthcare</I>, the department has taken steps to address these issues. We have published a

The pilots will be independently evaluated and, after that assessment, we will decide how to take recommendations forward.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0004.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000205"></a>The Government agree that the regulatory bodies responsible for the basic education curricula and codes of professional ethics should consider how best to ensure that healthcare professionals understand their responsibilities. We have set up seven expert working groups to advise on the implementation of the White Paper, <I>Trust, </I><I>A</I><I>ssur</I><I>a</I><I>nce and </I><I>S</I><I>afety</I>, and we expect two of those working groups, the Medical Education and Revalidation Working Group and the Non-Medical Revalidation Working Group, to look at this important area.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000206"></a>In preparation for that major piece of work, we have already written to key stakeholders, including the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the health regulatory bodies, the strategic health authority education commissioners, Universities UK, the Council of Deans of UK University Faculties for Nursing and Health Professions and the Medical Schools Council to seek their advice on how best to take forward this agenda.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000207"></a>Of course, in looking at what more needs to be done, it is important to recognise the good things that are already happening. Health and social care professionals currently receive training on human rights as part of their academic studies. Regulatory bodies already include references to human rights issues in their ethical guidance. For example, the framework for undergraduate education of dentists refers to the Human Rights Act, and the document <I>Standards for Dental Professionals</I> has a section on&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08051489000208"></a><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051489000606"></a>The Earl of Onslow:</b> May I interrupt the Minister? That rather goes against the impression that I got&#151;that we got&#151;in the hearing; that the professional bodies were not aware of it. The clich&#233; &#147;twixt cup and lip&#148; immediately leaps to mind. Something does not seem to be working quite right there. That is why we want it in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000209"></a><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051489000607"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> We looked at the last report where the committee expressed its dissatisfaction with the response made by the other place and we have been taking action to push bodies that we think need to consider this. I have given the example of dentists because they seem to have been active in this area, and their document <I>Standards for Dental Professionals</I><I></I>has a section on patient dignity and choices which addresses human rights issues. That is the good practice we need to build on.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000210"></a>We feel that, in light of the actions that we are already taking overall to improve human rights awareness and the training that healthcare professionals already receive, the amendments are not required. There are also specific reasons why we feel that each individual amendment is not needed, which I will now set out.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000211"></a>Amendment No. 117 imposes a requirement on the OHPA to ensure that it has regard to the desirability of improving the awareness of and training in human rights issues among its members. However, as a public  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>body, the OHPA will already be bound by the Human Rights Act. In addition, the chair of the OHPA is required by the Bill to be legally qualified, which will ensure that on the board of the OHPA there is a strong understanding of its legal duties in relation to human rights.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000212"></a>Clause 97 also requires the OHPA to provide appropriate training to its panellists, which will of course include training around human rights. In relation to the specific intentions set out in the JCHR report, OHPA will not actually deal with qualifications, relicensing or accreditation; its only remit is to ensure that fitness to practise cases are determined fairly.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000213"></a>Amendment No. 138 would require CHRE to promote the human rights of patients and the public. However, the function of CHRE is to promote the health, safety and well-being of patients; this already fundamentally encompasses promoting human rights. In promoting, for example, the well-being of patients, CHRE will of course be seeking to ensure that convention values such as the dignity of the patient are respected. Like the OHPA, CHRE is also a public authority and as such must act in accordance with human rights under the European convention.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000214"></a>Amendment No. 154 seeks to add,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000535"></a>&#147;awareness of, and training in, human rights&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000463"></a>to the list of examples in paragraph 2 of Schedule 9 of the kinds of regulations that can be made under Clause 118. This is unnecessary. The list gives examples of the types of areas which may be covered, but is not exclusive. Therefore, regulations could already make provision for human rights training and education&#151;and training is already in the list of examples in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000215"></a>Amendment No. 157 imposes a requirement on the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to make regulations about awareness and training in human rights issues, under the power to modify the functions of the General Social Care Council and the Care Council for Wales that relate to the education and training of approved mental health professionals. Again, this amendment is not necessary as both councils are public bodies and as such have to comply with the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000216"></a>I have set out the specific reasons why these amendments are not necessary, but I hope that noble Lords will also consider these arguments in light of the overall steps we are taking to improve human rights awareness across the board, which I began by detailing. On that basis, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000513"></a> Schedule 7, page 147, line 8, leave out &#147;General Council&#148; and insert &#147;OHPA&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000224"></a>The noble Earl said: Before I address these amendments&#151;like the Minister, I welcome the fact that we have moved on to Part 2&#151;perhaps I could preface my remarks by saying that a number of amendments have been tabled in relation to the changes proposed for medical regulation, nearly all of which are of a probing nature. The value of the Grand Committee is that we can examine the proposals in the Bill in an atmosphere that is not going to result in any division of opinion. We are here to test the underpinning policy. I note that the GMC is concerned that some of the amendments tabled are apparently of a kind that question the decisions that have been taken by it and by the Government. But it is right that these matters are debated and not simply glossed over. The job of this Committee is to test policy and, therefore, I make no apology for having tabled the amendments.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000225"></a>New Section 35ZA provides for the GMC to publish guidance on what type of sanctions should apply to the doctor, depending on the facts that are found by the adjudication panel. The OHPA must take account of this guidance. If the GMC believes that the OHPA has been too lenient, paragraph 11 of the schedule gives it powers to refer the decision to the court. The question posed by these provisions is this: if the intention is that the OHPA should be an independent adjudicatory body, how appropriate is it for the GMC to continue to determine the sanctions that should apply to fitness to practise decisions? The whole raison d&#146;tre of the OHPA is supposed to be that we have a body that is quite separate from the GMC, yet here we see this umbilical cord continuing to operate between the two bodies.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000226"></a>The requirement to take into account the GMC&#146;s guidance on sanction would appear directly to compromise the adjudicator&#146;s independence at the sanction stage. Indeed, the GMC&#146;s guidance on sanction is designed precisely to influence the adjudicator&#146;s choice of what sanction to impose. There are those who view this as a direct fettering of the adjudicator&#146;s discretion.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000227"></a>In a fitness to practise case, it is the GMC that instigates the proceedings. Therefore the question is: is it counterproductive or helpful for the council to have a say in the outcome of the case? When we look at the process in a criminal court by way of comparison, we do not find that the court has to take into account any guidelines about sentencing supplied by the prosecution, yet here we have the prospect of that happening.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000228"></a>I understand the counterargument that the GMC has powerfully advanced: that, as the guardian of medical ethics and medical standards, the council should have a direct role in ensuring that the operational guidance for the OHPA relates back to these standards in a way that is consistent and  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC352"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>coherent. The guidance will be there precisely to support professionalism. If there is a derogation from it, it will set out how seriously that derogation should be treated. The GMC regards the maintenance of professional standards as its core function, and none of us would disagree with that. It argues cogently that all it is asking for is for the OHPA to pay regard to the guidance, no more than that.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000229"></a>There need to be guidelines about sanctions and warnings&#151;they are an important way in which consistency and transparency of decision-making can be achieved&#151;but the question we need to address is whether the guidelines issued by the GMC are the only way of achieving the desired result. One alternative could be to allow the OHPA to draw up its own guidelines. It could do so in consultation with the GMC and the CHRE, as well as with other interested bodies. That is what the amendment proposes. What is at stake here is the visible independence of the OHPA from the GMC&#151;and, indeed, from anyone else&#151;in the interests of fairness and of justice being seen to be done.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000230"></a>I have been quite open and, I hope, fair in recognising that there are arguments both for and against the maintenance of the umbilical cord between the GMC and the OHPA with regard to indicative sanctions, but we need to hear from the Government precisely why they favour such an arrangement when, as we all know, perceptions in these matters are so important. I would like to hear what answer the Minister has to the concerns I have outlined. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000231"></a><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051489000610"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> Rarely in proceedings in your Lordships&#146; House do I ever find myself in disagreement with the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I have to declare an interest as a past president of the General Medical Council. I admit that my seven-year presidency ended in 1989 before I became a Member of this House, so the GMC and its responsibilities have changed substantially since that time, but surely the White Paper and its proposals that related to some of the recommendations of Dame Janet Smith in her important report were designed to remove from the GMC the final jurisdiction over doctors who were being accused of serious professional misconduct, and whose fitness to practise was in some respect impaired by reason of either conduct or health.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000232"></a>It is for that reason that&#151;although I have some reservations about many aspects of the White Paper&#151;the OHPA was so designed to stand in the Bill as being the final court, taking away from the General Medical Council the responsibilities for the legal proceedings against any doctor whose fitness to practise was regarded as being impaired. Surely, that independence would now be prejudiced if the OHPA were to be invited not only to be the final court of judgment but to lay down the criteria on which issues of professional unfitness to practise were defined. The GMC has made it clear in its letter that its core guidance in <I>Good Medical Practice</I>,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000536"></a>&#147;sets out the principles and values on which good practice is founded and describes medical professionalism in action. The guidance describes what is expected of all doctors registered with the GMC&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000464"></a>and has always made it clear that doctors may be disciplined if they show,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000537"></a>&#147;serious or persistent failure to follow the guidance&#148;,</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000514"></a>&#147;<I>Good Medical Practice</I> not only describes how doctors should behave, it sets the standards against which their behaviour is evaluated in any investigation and informs the criteria against which a fitness to practise panel should consider whether their fitness to practise is impaired&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000233"></a>I am very sad, having talked on Monday about the purity of the English language and correct phraseology, to find that an official letter from the GMC goes on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000538"></a>&#147;this criteria for panel decision&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000466"></a>which should be &#147;this criterion&#148;; being singular and not plural. I pass that over. I quote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000515"></a>&#147;These amendments would change responsibility for the production and ownership of Indicative Sanctions Guidance from the regulator to OHPA&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000467"></a>In other words, from the body that is setting the standards to the body that is determining whether those standards have been breached. It would mean that if fitness-to-practise panels were to make decisions,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000539"></a>&#147;without taking into account the GMC&#146;s guidance, then OHPA would be in a position where it was, de facto, setting the standards for medical regulation and usurping the role of the GMC as a standards setting body for the medical profession. It would also generate confusion for patients and the public if it appeared that two separate bodies appeared to be responsible for setting standards for doctors&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000234"></a>I could say much more, because there should be that separation between the standards-setting body and the body that is concerned with the decision as to whether those standards had been breached. In the GMC&#146;s briefing several quite important decisions by learned judges appear to clarify that situation. For that reason, with deep regret to my colleague the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I cannot support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000235"></a><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051489000611"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I slightly disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and I do so in fear and trepidation as a doctor who is registered with the GMC and who was registered when he was presiding over it. This demonstrates the importance of Grand Committee on a topic that is so fraught.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000236"></a>The reality is that the livelihoods are at stake of professionals who have been high achievers and who want to achieve well throughout their careers; and something has happened and they have come crashing down, for whatever reason. I remind the Committee that we must remember that in this country people are innocent until proved guilty and that, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, people have the right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. The hearing includes the totality of the case at the fact-finding stage and the sanctions stage.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000237"></a>I have been influenced in the way that I regard this amendment by the fact that the Medical Defence Union is not happy with the wording of the Bill, and some of the reasons for that have become important for the profession. The GMC guidance on sanction could be perceived to have a built-in bias because there is no requirement in the Bill for that guidance to take a balanced view. One part of sanctions is not to

There is a clear and compelling need for the OHPA to have published guidelines on sanctions and warnings, but I can see the arguments for the adjudicator to draw up its own guidelines, albeit with guidance from the GMC. It is the strength and power of the messages moving along that umbilical cord, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, put it, that becomes important.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000238"></a>I may have misinterpreted the Bill, but it appears that the GMC is able to question an inappropriately lenient decision by the OHPA in the event of a decision being taken, but I am not sure that the GMC is able to question an inappropriately harsh decision. What protection is built in for a doctor where the OHPA decision seems to those in the regulatory body to be inappropriately harsh?</p>

I, too, am very disturbed by the noble Earl&#146;s amendment because, like the noble Lord, Lord Walton, I find that I usually agree with him. Indeed, I wonder if I am saying the wrong thing because I am disagreeing with him. But I am worried about a general trend which seems to be developing in the National Health Service that almost deprofessionalises the profession. I hope that I am not putting it in too strong terms. We are no longer the great medical profession, we are part of the workforce of the National Health Service and we are being regulated and told what to do. In the past year, we have even been told how to train junior doctors, right down to where they should apply and what form they should download from the internet. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that there is no intention on the Government&#146;s part to deprofessionalise the medical profession.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000240"></a>At the moment, there is a great danger that this is beginning to happen because the profession has for decades worked loyally with the National Health Service. It is a dangerous development and the medical profession is starting to see a red light and to wonder what its future is within the health service. Maybe I am generalising too much, but that is my worry, and it is encapsulated in the noble Earl&#146;s amendment because I am afraid that it may be one more step in the deprofessionalisation of the profession because it would somehow diminish the role of the GMC. I would not want that to happen.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000241"></a>My noble friend Lord Carlile is not yet in his place&#151;I hope that he will arrive soon&#151;but I wonder what would happen if the same sort of processes were introduced for lawyers. I think that there would be an awful stink, but of course it cannot happen to them because they do not work for a national legal service, they are still independent. That is my contribution and I hope that the Minister can offer some reassurance.</p>

I have been very impressed by the openness with which it has done that, and I am aware of the amount of dialogue and support that there has been for what the Government propose here, so to start saying at this stage that we can do better than that is unfortunate.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000243"></a>I do not want to echo all the good things that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, which are included in the GMC&#146;s briefings, but I do think that the document, <I>Good Medical Practice</I>, is a gold standard. It is not a static document; it has evolved over time. My understanding is that doctors hold that document in very high esteem. It is more than just about establishing professional standards; it is something against which doctors accept they should be evaluated. We should not lose sight of that document. It would be hard for a new organisation, however worthy, to find the eloquence and the expertise to replicate that document, so we should not lose sight of its importance for doctors&#146; training and professionalism. I will not go on or I will repeat comments of colleagues. I oppose the amendment.</p>

I am afraid that I support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in this matter. This is a question of how we reassure the general public that there is a separation of powers. This is done in all sorts of areas. Many organisations have a part that hears complaints, and adjudication and sanction are often separated out from the professional body that sets the standard. This debate should be had because we got into difficulties previously when we used this word &#147;professionalism&#148; to cover poor practice.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000245"></a>I am a professional in another field, and I would expect to be held to account&#151;I hope by my organisation, which could strike me off. We need to think this through and discuss this kind of separation of powers, which would not prevent there being some method of influence. I have recently been involved with the General Medical Council and find it to be a superb organisation, but that does not prevent it being questioned. I speak simply because I wanted to support the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in testing and pressing the issue of what it means to be a professional. It does not mean that you are protected.</p>

The idea that any organisation should not be questioned is incredible, especially in a debate such as this. It is well known that paediatricians have had great difficulty with the General Medical Council. At a recent meeting of professional associations, 32 two members of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC356"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health tabled a vote of no confidence against what the General Medical Council was doing with regard to paediatricians. Something is very wrong when professional people feel that they have no confidence in an important body such as that. I intend to speak later on a number of related issues, but I wanted to say how strongly I support the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000247"></a><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0005.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08051489000616"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> This is Committee, so perhaps I may intervene again to say that that issue greatly concerns me, too, but it comes up later in the Bill, not here. The crucial issue here is that the amendments would overturn the principle of having one body that sets standards and another that has to look at the legal issue of whether those standards have been breached. It is for exactly that reason that I am not willing to support them. That principle, which was wrested from Janet Smith&#146;s report and which defined the different responsibilities of the standard-setting body and the body that had to decide on sanctions, is exactly what would be breached if the amendments were approved.</p>

As Members have realised, Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 would require the guidance on possible sanctions to be published by the OHPA rather than the GMC, as is now the case. With the transfer of adjudication to the OHPA&#151;I keep wanting to call it OPRA, I am sorry; I will get it right&#151;it is important to safeguard the continuing consistency of sanctions decisions. There is a clear need for such guidance to continue to be published, and I am confident that it is right for the GMC to do that.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000250"></a>Let me explain why we want to go down that route, and perhaps offer some comfort to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. I do not think that I need to defend the noble Earl, but he said that he wanted to explore the issue.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000251"></a>To be on the medical register, practitioners will need to comply with the standards set by the GMC. The gold standard, as it was described by my noble friend, is <I>Good Medical Practice.</I> As that is the basis on which cases will be put to the OHPA, it is appropriate for the GMC to publish guidance on the interpretation of those standards and the sanctions that might be appropriate if a practitioner fell short of them.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000252"></a>As I said, Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 provide for the OHPA, not the GMC, to produce that guidance. The Medical Defence Union has argued for the change proposed by the amendment on the grounds that requiring the OHPA to follow the GMC&#146;s guidance would interfere with the independence of the OHPA. The Committee is quite right to test and discuss that.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC357"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000253"></a>I agree that panels must not be unduly influenced by the guidance published by the regulators on the appropriateness of sanctions. That is why the Bill says that the OHPA must take account of it. It does not say that the panel must follow the guidance if there is good reason to depart from it.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000254"></a>I take this opportunity to state on the record that the OHPA&#146;s panels will be perfectly at liberty to make their own decisions. Clearly, a panel cannot operate in isolation from <I>Good Medical Practice</I> and the GMC&#146;s sanctions guidance, which is derived from it, but it will not be bound to impose a specific sanction in an individual case if it does not think that, in the particular circumstances of that case, such a sanction is appropriate. It is also important that guidance is general rather than unduly prescriptive.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000255"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked whether the GMC can question inappropriate guidance. Yes: if a decision is inappropriately harsh an individual has the right of appeal to the High Court. The right of appeal of the GMC is therefore to cover cases where the decision seemed appropriately lenient.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000256"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about compliance with human rights. We carefully considered the issue of compliance with Article 6 and the council&#146;s decision obtained by the Medical Defence Union. We do not believe that the guidance will fetter the discretion of the OHPA, nor is it incompatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Committee may be aware that the GMC is currently revising its <I>Indicative Sanctions Guidance</I>, and has just completed a public consultation, which closed on 9 May.</p>
<h5><a name="08051489000551"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000257"></a>The draft guidance that the GMC has produced does not attempt to set out a tariff of the sanctions that the panels must apply in a particular kind of case, and I agree it is important that it does not do so. The draft guidance sets out a range of factors that may lead panels to conclude that it would be appropriate for the protection of the public to consider a particular sanction, such as the suspension of a doctor from practice. It makes clear that if the panel considers suspension to be the appropriate sanction, the length of that suspension is wholly within the discretion of the panel. It is entirely right that this sort of general guidance can be given by the body responsible for setting professional standards, and I do not believe that such guidance will compromise the independence of the adjudicator.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000258"></a>The OHPA will obviously have to ensure that the way the guidance should be taken into account is covered in the training it gives its panel members and that its panels are making decisions in a fair and consistent manner. This is a key task for the OHPA board, and it will be the board&#146;s job also to monitor it. I hope that, having heard that explanation, the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendments. </p>

I am grateful particularly to the Minister for her reply.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000260"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that while he felt he had to come out in disagreement with me, I am not sure that he needed to do so. It is not necessary to disagree with a question, and a question is what I was asking. That question was neither unnecessary nor silly, and I am glad that the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay, Lady Howarth and Lady Golding, felt able to come out in support of it.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000261"></a>The Government&#146;s policy was originally to have a clear separation between fact-finding and fault-finding, precisely because of public perceptions, a point powerfully made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. If we were honest, we would admit that part of the deal between the GMC and the Government was that if a separate adjudication body were to be created&#151;namely, the OHPA&#151;that body should have a duty to take account of the GMC&#146;s guidance, otherwise I doubt whether the GMC would ever have agreed to a separate body.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000262"></a>I acknowledged in my earlier remarks that the deal that has been reached may well be a reasonable approach. Indeed, if the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Walton, were to be taken strictly, the OHPA would have been made to follow the guidance to the letter, but it will not be required to do so.</p>

It is perfectly true that for some years any doctor with a British qualification practising overseas in, for example, the United States or Canada who was subject to disciplinary sanctions in that country did not have the proceedings reported formally to the GMC. However, after one or two very notable cases that arose in Canada, that situation was changed and such proceedings were reported formally to the GMC, so that it became aware that the doctors in question had been disciplined in another country.

I have already said that doctors are fearful of the GMC, but it would be more accurate to say that they are terrified of it. Doctors know perfectly well that the panel before which they come under a fitness-to-practise hearing will determine the whole of their future life. Therefore, I am querying why the panel has only three members.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000289"></a>For some doctors, the fear of the fitness-to-practise panel has been so great that they have actually committed suicide before their hearing, not through guilt but through the burden of shame at ever having been reported to the GMC in the first place, even when that was vexatious reporting and they have known that that was the case, or even when they have known that a hate campaign has been run in the local newspaper against them and they have been unable to respond because of fear of breaching patient confidentiality, but they have known that their practice was not substandard and that they had nothing to feel guilty about.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000290"></a>No one should underestimate how devastating a complaint is to a conscientious doctor, let alone when it gets reported to the GMC. The problem with a panel of three is that it seems almost dangerously small. If you have a powerful personality among three people on a panel and one of the other people is not a very powerful personality, it becomes easy to see how that small panel could become biased in its thinking or perhaps overinterpret some items of evidence brought before it and underinterpret others. After all, however well trained the panel members are, they are only human. I am not questioning the validity of people who sit on panels for the GMC. I am questioning the principle of having a panel that consists of only two members. That is why the amendments suggested increasing the number of lay members to two and the number of professionally qualified members to two.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000291"></a>I note that under Clause 95(4), the rules can determine the fitness-to-practise panels, but I am concerned that nothing here says that the balance should be equally lay and professional. It would be just as dangerous to have a panel that was loaded with lay membership as it would be to have a panel loaded with professional membership. To have the latter would take one severely back in time.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000292"></a>This is a probing amendment that questions whether it is wise to have a panel of only three members rather than a minimum size of five and questions why we do not have a designated balance, accepting an independent chair as the fifth member of a panel. I have discussed this issue with the Medical Protection Society, and it has concerns about the small size of the panel.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000293"></a>The amendment about one member who should have relevant professional expertise is also a probing amendment. It is not at all to undermine the role of the professional adviser to the panel; rather, it questions whether, where a small panel is forming a judgment and there is only one professional member on that panel, that person can necessarily interpret some of the complex contextual aspects of the doctor who is up before the panel.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000294"></a>You could say, &#147;Can someone working in the pharmaceutical industry really interpret the full context of modern general practice or vice versa?&#148;. There are some very high-tech and complex areas of clinical practice that are far removed from the low-tech areas. I shall give the Committee an example: contrast inter-uterine foetal surgery with psychogeriatrics. Some of the pressures, the decision-making, the context and the team that one works with are very different. When you look at medical errors and problems that arise, they often have compounding factors from a team rather than being the responsibility solely of the doctor who is up before the panel. It is for that contextual reason that I am asking that it should be someone who had relevant professional expertise.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000295"></a>I say emphatically that I am not requesting that one should ever consider that it is someone from the same discipline. Medicine is a small world, and it is easy to have bias. If people have heard about someone being reported to the GMC and so on, their thinking might be biased before they ever come on to a panel. However, I wonder whether one needs to ensure that there is some relevant background to understand the context of the doctor who is before the hearing. I beg to move.</p>

A panel of three is too small, and the idea of having two lay and two professionally qualified members is very sensible. At the very least, I hope that the Government give us a complete assurance that, when OHPA decides what number of members will sit on the panels, there will always be equality between the number of professional and lay members. That is not in the Bill, and it is a principle that is absolutely to be commended.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000297"></a>The panels used to have on them an individual from the same profession as the respondent doctor. When I chaired the Professional Conduct Committee of the General Medical Council, we always used to appoint to the panels hearing the case a doctor from the same discipline as the doctor whose fitness to practise was under consideration. I fully appreciate that many paediatricians, particularly those who have been engaged in child protection issues, have taken the view that certain recent decisions by the GMC&#146;s Professional Conduct Committee on doctors working in that field have been perverse and might not have been taken if a specialist paediatrician working in child protection had been sitting on the panel. I believe that the GMC now accepts that view, but the problem with a specialist from the same field sitting on the panel is that the advice by the panel and the

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000298"></a>One great virtue of the Bill is that it clearly defines in Clause 98 the role of the legal assessor, and clearly defines in Clause 99 the role of clinical and other specialist advisers. After Second Reading, I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and he wrote back, saying that he was quite confident that the specialist and clinical advisers would be chosen with the same status as the legal assessor, with the authority to have those clinical and specialist advisers from the same speciality as the respondent doctor. If the Minister can give me that assurance, it is very important that that should be accepted. Subject to that, I am happy to support the amendment, except for the one point.</p>

In a recent case that came before the GMC, the professionally qualified member could not attend at the last moment but the case still went ahead. That is very regrettable. If the amendment is accepted, that will be avoided.</p>

Amendments Nos. 122, 123 and 125 would impose a panel of five members, no matter what the circumstances of the proceedings before it. Clause 95 provides for OHPA to have a panel of three members, a chair, a lay member and a professionally qualified member, with additional members appointed as necessary. This provides the flexibility for OHPA to form large panels in complex cases, while ensuring that a quorum of three members is all that is required to ensure that a decision can be reached. I suggest that to impose a fixed number of five panellists on OHPA would remove this flexibility and inflate the size and cost of panels needed to conduct adjudication procedures. In my view, the cost is not the issue&#151;</p>

In any case, to have three members of a panel deciding on the future of a doctor and whether they can pursue their livelihood for the rest of their lives is, frankly, an insult. The minimum should be five.</p>

Let me continue my remarks about other organisations that fulfil similar sorts of duties and do so with panels of three. First, I will respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, who made the point about the personality of one panel member on a panel of three who may come to a decision unfairly. If that were the case, I suspect that there would be far more successful appeals against  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC363"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>GMC panel decisions; as it is, there are actually very few. We would expect the OHPA to create equality and balance in its panels.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000303"></a>We do not think that, in this case, there is evidence that a panel of three is insufficient. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that the flexibility exists for there to be a larger panel if there is an important or complex case to be considered. It might well be that the cases that have been mentioned might be considered to be just such cases. A panel of three members is widely used by other bodies, such as the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and many of the health professional regulators. In light of best practice in other adjudication bodies, I do not want to impose a larger panel on the OHPA, especially when it will have the discretion through its rules to vary the panel size according to need. Those rules will be subject to consultation under Clause 104, the approval of the Privy Council and parliamentary scrutiny via the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000304"></a>Amendment No. 124 seeks to ensure that there is a professionally qualified member on the panel who has &#147;relevant professional expertise&#148;. We agree that it is important for the panel to have a professionally qualified member on it, and that is what the Bill provides for. The question is whether the amendment goes one step further by saying that the professionally qualified member must have &#147;relevant professional expertise&#148;. I was reassured by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that she was not suggesting that the person should be of the same discipline, and other Members of the Grand Committee have mentioned that. While I understand that there may, on the face of it, seem to be benefits from having this kind of knowledge on the panel, there would also be a real risk of such a requirement either undermining the independence of the panel&#151;if it was a very small discipline that might be the case&#151;or of delaying the panel because of the difficulty of finding someone. It is a question of whether &#147;relevant professional expertise&#148; ties the OHPA down in a way that would not be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000305"></a>As set out in the White Paper <I>Trust</I><I>, assurance and s</I><I>afety</I>, we recognise that professional regulation is a partnership between patients and professionals, and one must be fair to both sides of that partnership. In the context of the OHPA, that means requiring the panel to be, and to be seen to be, as independent as possible from the case that is in front of them.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000306"></a>The role of the professionally qualified member is not as a representative of the professional before the panel. The professionally qualified member is there first to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in the composition of the panel, and secondly, like the other panel members, he or she is there to listen to the evidence presented to the panel and make a decision about a practitioner&#146;s fitness to practise on the basis of that evidence.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000307"></a>Requiring panels to have someone with &#147;relevant professional expertise&#148; may have serious implications, as I have outlined.

I think the noble Lord, Lord Walton, mentioned that. Clause 99 provides for expert advice to be available from outside the panel from either clinical or specialist advisers, which will be made available to all parties. Further advice may be sought by either party to the proceedings in the form of expert or other specialist witnesses.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000308"></a>With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, sees that the Bill allows for the proper provision of specialist advice in a way that does not compromise the independence of the panel, and that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000310"></a>I am not so worried about the numbers, but what I do think is important is this. Where a member has expertise in an area, the role of that member should be transparent. Each member of a panel, although they will have different areas of experience, should be seen to be equal. When expert witnesses come forward to give advice and put forward their testimony, everybody should have a chance to put questions to them and listen to the answers. My worry is that there could be a confusion of roles if an expert person sits as a member of the panel. That could make life a bit more difficult.</p>

I said that these are probing amendments, and indeed they have probed. We have been given some answers, but questions have also been raised.

<p><a name="08051489000316"></a>The other assurance I seek concerns the OHPA being able to make special provision. Enshrined in that should be the need to maintain a balance between professional and lay members, so that there could not be a skewed number.

It must always be made up of an odd number in order to reach a decision, and that is why the quorum is three. The OHPA will set out in its rules, which the Bill requires it to consult on, how and when it will include extra panel members. We would expect the OHPA, in drawing up the rules, to take account of the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and others on the balance of the panel.

The panel members need to be independent of anything that has gone before. It is very easy to be biased at a subliminal level if you have been party to an investigation, proceedings or any type of inquiry that may surround any case. It becomes extremely difficult not to bring that bias into your thinking when you are in a hearing. Medicine is a very small world. The world of subspecialties is even smaller. There is gossip, there are rumours, and however much one attempts to be independent, it can be hard. I echo completely the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege&#151;transparency is critical.</p>

However, this amendment is not the place for that argument. I beg to move.</p>

I speak again about paediatricians. I wrote in March to the president of the GMC, who offered to help me to understand the way that the GMC works. I asked for an explanation regarding the inquiry on the fitness to practise of Professor Southall in the Sally Clark case. Following his reply, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051489000520"></a>&#147;As I understand it Professor Tim David was the sole paediatric expert assisting the G.M.C. in both the prosecutions of Professor Southall. I also understand that Professor David was appointed by the Family Court to oversee the care of the remaining Clark child and supported Mr Clark&#146;s position. He has also been retained to support the Clark family in their appeal against Mrs Clark&#146;s criminal conviction. If this is correct how could Professor David act as an impartial paediatric expert in the prosecution of Professor Southall by the G.M.C.?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000468"></a>I received a reply which said that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on Professor Southall&#146;s case at this stage, as he has appealed to the High Court. He did appeal to the High Court and his appeal was accepted.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000325"></a>That is one case where someone who was supposedly independent obviously was not. The General Medical Council also proposed to ask Dr Nicholson to act as the professional witness at the CMET trial of Professor Southall, Dr Spencer and Dr Samuel that was due to start this week. That was to happen even though Dr Nicholson had constantly made remarks criticising and attacking the research work at Stoke-on-Trent hospital, where the doctors worked.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000326"></a>I understand that the trial for those three doctors has been delayed because Dr Nicholson was replaced at the last moment. That makes me wonder why. Why should this kind of thing be happening, whereby doctors&#146; livelihoods are put at risk by people, who are obviously opposed to them, giving evidence as recognised witnesses to the three people sitting on the tribunal at the GMC? What kind of justice is that? We ask for justice for the patients. Where is the justice for the doctors?</p>

I was a bit bemused by the amendment, because when we are talking about fitness-to-practise panel members referred to in the amendment&#151;who are different from the specialist advisers who may give advice&#151;there is a requirement for them to be independent. Indeed, we all have to pledge that before a case starts. That may need to be written in the document, but it is certainly the case at the moment. There may be a separate debate about professional clinical and legal advisers and the extent to which they have been involved in a previous role, but the panel members themselves are guaranteed to be independent.

<p><a name="08051489000329"></a><a name="80514-gc0007.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0007.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08051489000649"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendment No. 126 seeks to ensure that fitness-to-practise panel members have not been involved in previous investigations or proceedings related to the professional before them. That is an important principle and one well established with the current regulators. On my noble friend Lady Golding&#146;s detailed questions on the case she mentioned, it is subject to ongoing proceedings, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000330"></a>The current GMC rules on the composition of panels specifically provide that no panellist shall act as a panellist for the substantive hearing of a case that he has previously considered or adjudicated on in any other capacity. That ensures that panel members who are involved in the investigation process are not called on to take part in the adjudication process, and that panel members who have heard a case against a practitioner do not hear any future cases against him or her.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000331"></a>As I said, that is absolutely right and I agree with the general spirit of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. However, I remind the Committee that the OHPA will adjudicate only on fitness-to-practise cases. It will take no part in the investigation process. There is also a specific problem with the amendment as drafted. It is currently recognised that review hearings following adjudication can benefit from the inclusion of an original panel member, and the GMC rules allow that as an exception to the general rule that I outlined.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000332"></a>Amendment No. 126 would prevent that, which would mean that it would not be possible to have any continuity between adjudication and any review hearing. Although that is a specific reason why I am unable to accept the amendment, I think that it also demonstrates more generally why it is important to give the OHPA the flexibility to set out the detail of its processes in rules, rather than in primary legislation. Clause 95(3) of the Bill allows for rules to make further provision about the selection of panels in relation to any proceedings. That will allow the OHPA to set out how panel members should be selected so that any conflicts of interest are avoided.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000333"></a>We are creating the OHPA within an enabling framework. We must be careful to resist the temptation to specify too much detail and make too many decisions for the organisation now. Given that we are setting up the OHPA in order to create a proper separation between investigation and adjudication, it is vital that its rules reflect the crucial principle of independence and separation. We must, however, allow the OHPA, as the experts, to decide exactly how to do this. There is a requirement for full consultation on its draft rules. I am completely confident that noble Lords who have participated here and the many organisations which have already played a part in the framing of this Bill will ensure that its rules are robust and fair. Parliamentary scrutiny via the negative resolution procedure will also provide a backstop. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is sufficiently reassured to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000335"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, I recognise that the fitness-to-practise panel members have to be independent at the moment; but it was so that we did not revert to the previous situation that I wanted to write that into the Bill. I hope that the Minister's words mean that it will be in the guidance to the panel that they must be independent.</p>

I have some slight concerns about putting a panel member forward from the investigative panel onto the adjudication panel, because I would prefer that the adjudication panel can call a panel member to give them evidence, to explain their thinking, to explain what went on and answer questions about the investigative hearing. I have a little concern that we fudge that clear separation by having a panel member go from one panel to the other, particularly given the small size of the panels.</p>

Both are probing amendments, and they bring us to an issue that has prompted a good deal of debate both inside and outside Parliament: whether the chair of a fitness to practise adjudication panel should on every occasion be legally qualified.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000343"></a>At the moment, the Bill specifies that the chair may be legally qualified and furthermore that rules may provide for pilot schemes under which legally qualified chairs are or are not selected for certain sorts of proceedings. I find it difficult to envisage how pilot schemes will work in practice. How, while ensuring fairness and consistency between cases, do you select which cases are going to be chaired by a lawyer and which are not? You could not do it by random selection, because that would open up the prospect of legal challenge. Will it be done by agreement between the parties? If so, one has to ask what doctor would agree  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC369"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to a hearing of their case being chaired by someone other than a lawyer if they believed that this was the best way to achieve a legally secure and fair outcome. I would be glad if the Minister could tell me how she envisages the pilots will be organised.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000344"></a>The more substantive issue is one of principle. There is a strong argument that says that what really matters in any adjudication process is the quality of the chairman; in other words, whether he or she has good chairing skills&#151;not whether he or she has a legal qualification. Because the Bill is drafted as it is, I take it that that is the position of the Government, and I know it to be the position taken by the GMC. The contrary position is to say that only someone with a full understanding of the legal process is fit to chair the panel. Adjudication is a legal process; it is not a medical process. The skills and experience that are needed to conduct such proceedings are legal.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000345"></a>To take one issue of many, the introduction of the civil standard of proof brings with it apprehensions about fairness and consistency between cases and concerns about how the sliding scale is to work. Those apprehensions and concerns would be considerably allayed if it were known that a lawyer with experience of applying the civil standard had to be the chair of the adjudication panel.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000346"></a>In general, applying the law properly and consistently, summing up a case fairly and composing the final judgment thoroughly and clearly are all tasks that, prima facie, are better done by a lawyer. I believe that legal chairs are the norm with the Family Health Services Appeal Authority, which can make decisions that have consequences for a doctor&#146;s future career that can be every bit as profound as a fitness to practise judgment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000347"></a>If it really is the Government&#146;s intention to allow the OHPA to decide which cases should have a legally qualified chair and which need not, it would be helpful to hear from the Minister what criteria should govern those sorts of decisions and why. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000348"></a><a name="80514-gc0007.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0007.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="08051489000656"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> I support in particular Amendment No. 128, regarding this rather clumsy Clause 95(4), which talks of,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000540"></a>&#147;a chair who is legally qualified for the purposes of section 96(2)(a), and may provide for pilot schemes under which chairs who are legally qualified for those purposes are, or are not, selected for such proceedings as may be determined in accordance with the rules&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000469"></a>I am still reading it, wondering if I have got it right. My difficulty with this is that we are talking about a legal process that is going to determine the future career of a medical practitioner, and we are saying that we are going to set up pilot schemes so that some doctors will be &#147;tried&#148; by one method, with a legal chair, and others with a lay chair.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000349"></a>If, after a certain time, the Government decide that the pilot for lay chairs is rubbish and has not worked and that we must ensure that all panels have a legal chair, will those medical practitioners who have been tried by a panel with a lay chair then be able to challenge the decision that that panel came to, on the grounds that the Government were not satisfied with

I am not a lawyer, but there is a crack in the pilot scheme idea that could cause an awful lot of trouble and confusion. It would be much better, if the Government are unsure about which is the best method, to say, &#147;We will go for a legal chair and in 12 months we will review all the cases that have been done by the panel and see whether that was a worthwhile method and if there have been any problems&#148;.</p>

On the one hand, there is a strong case to be made for having legally qualified chairs of these fitness-to-practise panels. On the other hand, if that is accepted, what is the role of the legal assessor who, under Clause 98, will be present at every hearing to advise the panel on matters of law? In my experience, the legal assessor played an invaluable role in being able to advise the panel on difficult points of law. It could be, of course, that the chair of the panel, if legally qualified, might be a barrister who took a completely different view from the legal assessor of the legal issues involved, or might be a solicitor who then felt rather overawed by the presence of a highly qualified legal assessor who was a Queen&#146;s Counsel. It is very complex. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, I am concerned about the principle of having pilot studies and pilot schemes in this very difficult and complex area.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000352"></a>The GMC makes a number of points. Whether or not the perceived procedural advantage of legally qualified chairs sufficiently justifies the loss of the current separation between decision-making and the provision of legal advice, if we always have legal chairs, other panellists&#151;lay members and doctors&#151;may be perceived as second-class participants in the proceedings. Are we confident that the blurring of roles between a legally qualified chair on the one hand and the legal adviser on the other might end up with the legally qualified chairman offering advice and guidance in private to fellow panellists that should, in the interests of fairness, be repeated publicly? This is a very difficult and complex issue, and I do not see how it can be readily resolved. I feel very uncomfortable about the pilot studies.</p>

The discussion already demonstrates that we almost have equipoise on some of these issues. My amendment would ensure that an independent legal adviser must be present. My concern is that if you have a legally qualified chair without a legal adviser, the chair could be put in the situation where he or she is also a legal adviser, in effect advising him or herself by wearing two hats. That does not push the debate towards an independent chair.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000354"></a>I also have a big concern about the concept of a pilot scheme, as it sounds a little like a randomised clinical trial but without the benefit of informed consent. You could never have a clinical trial in medicine without informed consent. Yet here we have the equivalent in a hearing about a doctor, so I have great concern about this. My personal view is that the training of the chair in the relevant procedures for the hearing is more important than what kind of university degree they have. They may have got it 20 years ago. The fact that they have a legal or medical degree does not mean that they are up to speed on procedures, are well trained and will conduct a hearing well. I would much rather have rigorous rules on the background training of whoever will chair this, so that they really understand the civil burden of proof, which we will come to later and which is the most contentious issue of all, whatever their background undergraduate degree. However, I also want to ensure that we retain a legal adviser, given that a doctor&#146;s whole livelihood is at stake.</p>

I found this extraordinary when I read it. After all the debate that we had about where we needed legal representatives&#151;we in this House decided that we did not&#151;to find it in the Bill was rather strange. I thought that we had decided at some of the highest levels that we did not need a lawyer&#151;and I have a huge respect for lawyers. As some noble Lords have said, we do have a legal assessor.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000356"></a>I have been an adjudicator in some curious places, such as the telecoms industry, and have adjudicated over situations involving large sums of money where whole companies could be put out of business if the adjudication went a particular way. The skills outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, were more important to me than any legal advice, because what I needed was my legal assessor. You need a lawyer by your side, but if the chair is also a lawyer, there could be a real conflict.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000357"></a>Given the way in which the Bill is framed, the noble Lord, Lord Walton, is absolutely right that there will be different sides to this. I found it strange that we did not think that the lawyers needed any training in chairing. I have had experience of brilliant chairing by lawyers and some pretty awful experiences too. Let us get the skills we need in order to get this right. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that this is something she can take away to consider because at the moment it is a hostage to fortune and could undermine the work of the panels.</p>

The danger of having a legal representative as the chair is that a lot will take place behind closed doors and will not be open to challenge. What is important in terms of transparency and openness is that people are able to hear, see and challenge the legal advice. That can be done if there is a legal assessor.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000359"></a>I also disagree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who I think was suggesting that lawyers have better chairing skills. I am not sure that that has been my experience either. On numerous occasions I have represented people at employment tribunals, which are chaired by lawyers. They tend to dominate the proceedings and do not give their colleagues much of an opportunity to participate. Moreover, their empathy with the people appearing before them sometimes leaves something to be desired. Good chairmanship skills are essential, and they come through training. However, what is important is good judgment. If the panel is well balanced, however many people are sitting on it, if they are all participating, that is much more important than trying to fix the chair or suggesting that that person has special knowledge which overrides that of everyone else. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and I oppose the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000361"></a>Turning first to Amendment No. 127, which would require the OHPA to have legally qualified chairs in all cases, I am glad to have the opportunity to set out why the Government do not believe we should make this decision on behalf of the OHPA. First, we have to look at how professional regulation adjudication is currently done. With the exception of the disciplinary committee of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, all the professional regulatory bodies currently carrying out adjudication use lay and professionally qualified chairs supported by a legal assessor. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and my noble friend are quite right to say that this is all about training and the quality of the person who chairs the committee. The system works well, and there is no compelling evidence that the OHPA should not continue with this approach. However, we agree that legally qualified chairs could be beneficial in certain types of cases. The Bill as amended on Report in the other place gives the OHPA the option of using legally qualified chairs for cases where it thinks it appropriate to do so.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000362"></a>The OHPA might set out in rules that all complex cases&#151;for example, those that involve a large number of witnesses or which are likely to be particularly lengthy&#151;should have a legally qualified chair. Neither the Government, the General Medical Council nor the General Optical Council consider that the arguments for a legally qualified chair apply as persuasively to cases involving performance or health. In these cases, the main task is to draw conclusions from an assessment of the doctor&#146;s  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC373"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>performance or health, and the proceedings are not dominated by the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Similarly, the benefits of having a legally qualified chair are less clear for conviction cases, or cases to consider determinations by other regulators, for example, where the practitioner is from abroad and has been struck off there.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000363"></a>The British Medical Association has said that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000541"></a>&#147;is not against the idea of a legally qualified chair for some OHPA panels, but would not wish to see all panels chaired by a legally qualified person ...When choosing panel members and chairmen, the most important factor should be their competencies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000471"></a>We agree that this is the key factor in the selection of chairs.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000364"></a>That leads me to my second point. While we agree that there may be merit in having legally qualified chairs for complex cases, all the evidence shows that lay and professionally qualified chairs are perfectly capable of doing a good job in these and any other case. Within the system of professional regulation there is strong reliance on lay and registrant involvement as chairs and panel members. Lay involvement is not unique to this jurisdiction. We need look only at the contribution of the 30,000 lay magistrates in England and Wales, who deal with 95 per cent of all criminal cases, to understand the value of lay involvement.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000365"></a>Amendment No. 130 would remove the provision under Clause 98 for a fitness-to-practise panel with a legally qualified chair to dispense with the services of a legal assessor. I understand the legitimate concern behind this amendment&#151;that legally qualified chairs will not be able to provide the same quality or independence of advice to the panel as legal assessors, perhaps because they are also occupied with managing the proceedings.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000366"></a>In giving the OHPA the flexibility to decide whether it wants to retain legal assessors where a panel has a legally qualified chair, we are confident that either alternative is fair to the individual practitioner. I can confirm that a panel with only a legally qualified chair would be fully compliant with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as would a panel with a legal assessor. There is no reason why a panel chaired by a solicitor would be more or less fair than a panel advised by the same solicitor. He or she would give the same legal advice in either role, and this is the crucial point.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000367"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that there is no clear evidence to support imposing legally qualified chairs for all cases, as in Amendment No. 127, or to force the OHPA to retain legal assessors on panels with legally qualified chairs, as in Amendment No. 130. It should be up to the OHPA, as an independent body, to decide what arrangements are most appropriate. The Bill requires the OHPA to consult on its rules and we expect it also to seek the advice of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council and consider the experience of other tribunals that use legally qualified chairs.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000368"></a>Amendment No. 128 would remove the OHPA's ability to make rules for the purpose of piloting legally qualified chairs. The OHPA would have to make decisions about the use of legally qualified

I recognise that, in allowing the OHPA to run a pilot, noble Lords need to be assured that it can be done in a way which does not compromise the fairness of the proceedings. I shall seek to give that assurance now.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000369"></a>First, in order for a pilot to be fair, all panels must be compliant with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards the right to a fair trial. We are confident that each of the possible options available to the OHPA will be compliant with this legislation. I say to the noble Earl that we do not have an exhaustive list of when legally qualified chairs will be used but they might be used advantageously where there are complex legal issues before the hearing; where allegations are complex; where there are multiple reasons for impairment&#151;misconduct, performance and health; where a number of practitioners are connected with the allegations; where a large number of witnesses are called to give oral evidence; or where the allegations are of a criminal nature and there has been no prosecution or a criminal prosecution has failed.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000370"></a>Secondly, in giving the OHPA the option to decide between having panels with legally qualified chairs, with or without legal assessors, we are looking at advantages and disadvantages in terms of effectiveness&#151;for example, speed and cost&#151;but not in terms of more or less fairness, nor in terms of better or worse legal advice. Lady Justice Smith, in her fifth report on the Shipman Inquiry, recommended that legally qualified chairs should be piloted for some cases. Clearly, Lady Justice Smith thought the proposal feasible. This was not an off-the-cuff remark but a key recommendation in her well considered fifth report.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000371"></a>Finally, I emphasise that the Bill does not require the OHPA to run a pilot. The OHPA may be able to gather more evidence on these issues than is currently available to us and make an informed decision without a pilot. It will also have the advice of the White Paper working group chaired by Sir Ian Kennedy.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000372"></a>If the OHPA decides to run a pilot, it will need to set out how it will do that in its rules, after working closely with lawyers to develop fair proposals. As I said, the Bill requires the OHPA to consult fully on these rules, and they are also subject to Privy Council approval. The Privy Council will approve the rules only if they are fair. As a final backstop, the order giving approval will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny under the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000373"></a>I recognise that these amendments raise valid concerns, and we have had a useful discussion. I hope that I have been able to reassure noble Lords that these amendments are not needed.</p>

There are some extremely difficult issues here. Whether we like the idea of legally qualified chairs or not&#151;and I fully take on board the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones&#151;the possibility of having them is provided for in the Bill.

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000375"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, put her finger on the problem created by the idea of having pilot schemes, because that must inherently run the risk of at least perceived unfairness on the part of some people. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, described the idea as a clinical trial without informed consent. She was right in that.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000376"></a>The Minister appeared to make a distinction between more straightforward cases and more complex cases that might turn on a number of difficult legal and ethical considerations. I can see the distinction that she was trying to draw, but, in practice, I would not have thought that the division was that clear-cut. The problem for the OHPA will be where one actually draws the line and makes that distinction. In any event, the outcome in every case has the potential to be very serious for the doctor concerned. Many doctors might argue that it makes no difference whether their case is complicated or simple; what matters is having a chairman who is fair and who knows what he or she is doing. I am not sure that I heard the Minister suggest that the doctor would be able to express a view on the matter, but perhaps that should be thought about.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000377"></a>I shall be interested to see how the rules in this area and the supporting guidance are framed. I remain uneasy about whether the proposed arrangements will guarantee consistency and fairness between cases. But, for now&#151;</p>

The amendment proposes that a statutory requirement be placed on the OHPA to carry out performance appraisal of the chairs and members of its fitness-to-practise panels.  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC376"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clearly, the need is for the OHPA and its stakeholders to be confident that fitness-to-practise panels are discharging their duties in a fair and proper manner. This will require the monitoring of the decisions of the panels themselves and the conduct of the individual panellists. However, this really does not require primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000385"></a>For example, the General Optical Council monitors the performance of their panels with regard to their decisions and to the performance of the individual members. In appraising the performance of individual panel members, the GOC provides a detailed framework for meetings between a panel member and an appraiser. The appraiser may be a chair-trained panel member or, in the case of when a chair-trained panel member is being appraised, an external appraiser. This seems to work extremely well. The General Medical Council, having examined a range of options and conducted pilots, is also adopting a new scheme of appraisal for its panellists. Both the GMC and the GOC produce papers for council meetings on the appraisal process and results.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000386"></a>Clause 96 sets out that persons appointed to a list hold and vacate the office in accordance with the terms of their appointment. We expect that these terms will include the need to participate in ongoing training and appraisal. It will be a crucial part of the OHPA&#146;s role to ensure that panels and individual panellists are operating effectively. As appraisals are currently undertaken by the current regulators without primary legislation, we are content for the same arrangements to apply to the OHPA. With that, I ask the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000399"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 131 is about the relationship between the OHPA and the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. It brings us to a simple but important point: if the function of the CHRE is to audit the decision-making of the medical regulators, and if the OHPA is to be an integral part of the medical regulatory process, the CHRE must have free access to the work that the OHPA is doing. At the moment the Bill provides no guarantee that the CHRE will have such access. It seems fundamental that there should be a duty on the part of the OHPA to co-operate with the CHRE and to share information with it to enable the CHRE to perform its job effectively.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000400"></a>Although I do not know what the Minister is going to say to me&#151;she may say that the OHPA would naturally wish to share information with the CHRE and that the amendment is therefore unnecessary&#151;we need only reflect on the possibility, which hopefully is quite remote but not unthinkable, that the CHRE might, for whatever reason, feel disposed to criticise the way in which the OHPA performed its work. In those circumstances, there could well be reluctance on the part of the OHPA to be as helpful as it should be towards the supervising regulatory body. We cannot in all situations rely on people&#146;s good will. That is why we need an explicit duty in statute in order to place the matter beyond doubt. In fact, the very existence of such a duty should guarantee that it never needs to be formally invoked. I beg to move.</p>

I understand that the CHRE has reviewed 1,200 cases, and out of those it has taken only six to court. Importantly, however, those six were very important cases, and it won each one in the Court of Appeal. This is a critical issue.</p>

The new clause would require the Office of the Health Professions Adjudicator to co-operate with the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence to enable the CHRE to perform its functions. This is a sensible issue to raise, and it is something that we considered carefully when drafting the legislation, so I am glad to have the opportunity to explain our views.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000404"></a>There are two possible purposes for having such a duty. The first is to ensure that the OHPA benefits from the CHRE&#146;s expertise in regulatory matters, and the second is to ensure that the CHRE can obtain the information that it needs from the OHPA to carry out its own statutory functions properly.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000405"></a>On the first possible purpose, to ensure that the OHPA benefits from the CHRE&#146;s expertise, the Bill as drafted already does so. Under Clause 104, the Bill requires the OHPA to consult the CHRE on its draft rules, which will set out almost every facet of its  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC378"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>processes. By requiring the OHPA to consult the CHRE on those rules, the Bill ensures that there is an appropriate statutory guarantee that the CHRE will be able to express views and advise on existing best practice on all the important issues that the rules deal with.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000406"></a>On the second possible purpose of having such a duty, to ensure that the CHRE can obtain the information that it needs&#151;which the noble Earl referred to&#151;from the OHPA to carry out its functions properly, existing legislation is already adequate. The OHPA is not a regulatory body; it will have functions only in relation to adjudication. The CHRE&#146;s remit and functions extend only to regulatory bodies. I am happy to reassure Members of the Committee that legislation is already in place to ensure that the CHRE is able to obtain information about how the GMC and the GOC carry out the investigation, referral and presentation of fitness-to-practise cases for adjudication, which will of course be matters still falling within the CHRE&#146;s remit.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000407"></a>Any information that the CHRE might require in relation to the GMC&#146;s or the GOC&#146;s continued role in fitness to practise would be obtained from the relevant regulatory body. Section 27 of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 already places a statutory duty on the regulatory bodies to co-operate with the CHRE, which includes the provision of information when requested by the CHRE.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000408"></a>However, I emphasise that there would also be nothing to prevent the OHPA and the CHRE from working together where that was beneficial. That model has already worked for the General Social Care Council, which is not in the CHRE&#146;s remit, but which works with the CHRE. For example, the CHRE recently extended an invitation to the General Social Care Council to participate in work on professional boundaries. The CHRE also works effectively with patient and public organisations without any formal duty of co-operation. In light of my explanations on this issue, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The central point to grasp, if I have grasped it correctly, is that the duty on the part of the GMC to co-operate with the CHRE will ensure that all the necessary information that the CHRE needs is passed to it, even if it has to come by a roundabout route. If it is information from the OHPA, it is almost certain that the GMC will have that information to pass across. I shall consider carefully what she has said. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000415"></a>On the basis of the recommendations of the Hampton review on regulatory inspection and enforcement in 2005, the Government committed to abolishing the Hearing Aid Council by April 2009 and to transferring responsibility for the regulation of private hearing aid dispensers to the Health Professions Council. This group of amendments is intended to achieve that, in addition to ensuring that public hearing aid dispensers can also be regulated in the future in the same way.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000416"></a>First, I acknowledge that it is not ideal to introduce this change into the Bill at such a late stage. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which leads on delivering this commitment, had considered a number of mechanisms to achieve the policy aims, but it became clear that primary legislation would be needed. It made sense to use this Bill both to meet the timescale and because it already includes substantial measures to reform the system of professional regulation. In modernising the regulation of hearing aid dispensers, and allowing for future consistency between public and private hearing aid dispensers, these measures contribute to the wider programme of professional regulatory reform. I recognise that the timing is not ideal, but I hope that I am able to persuade noble Lords that the great benefits that this measure will bring are worth this disadvantage.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000417"></a>Most importantly, this measure will provide improved protection for the hearing-impaired. For nearly 40 years, the Hearing Aid Council has done an excellent job in regulating the private hearing aid profession. I put on record the Government&#146;s thanks for the important work that the council has done over four decades. However, it is operating under legislation that is increasingly outdated, with gaps in consumer protection. The Health Professions Council, which was established in 2001, has modern and comprehensive legislation that will provide a much more complete service to patients and consumers. For example, the Health Professions Council has extensive fitness-to-practise powers, allowing it to remove someone from the register who it finds poses a serious risk before the registrant actually causes harm. In contrast, the Hearing Aid Council must wait until harm has been done before it can take action.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000418"></a>This measure also paves the way for the regulation of public and private dispensers on a single register with a single set of standards. Currently, hearing aid dispensers in the private sector are regulated by the Hearing Aid Council, with NHS hearing aid dispensers unregulated. Clearly, this will improve protection for the hearing-impaired.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000419"></a>I know that this principle is close to the hearts of many noble Lords: we will be reducing the number of regulators in existence. The Health Professions Council already regulates 13 different professions, so it is well equipped to regulate one more.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000420"></a>Finally, it is important to emphasise that both the Hearing Aid Council and the Health Professions Council fully support this move. Both organisations have worked very closely together over the past year to ensure that the transition will be as smooth as possible. Furthermore, the professional body, the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC380"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC380</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists, is very much in favour of this and has committed to continue working with both organisations during the transition from one to the other. The Royal National Institute for the Deaf also believes that its consumers will benefit from the change.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000421"></a>Subject to the passage of the Bill, it is therefore the Government&#146;s intention to bring forward an Order in Council later this year under the Section 60 provisions of the Health Act 1999 to allow the Health Professions Council to assume responsibility for the regulation of private hearing aid dispensers. This will require a formal 12-week consultation, followed by a debate in both Houses. The amendments and the future Section 60 order will ensure that the needs of the vulnerable are better protected under the auspices of a multi-professional statutory regulator, which has greater resources yet charges considerably smaller registrant fees.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000422"></a>Therefore, I hope that Members of the Committee will forgive the fact that this is a late addition to the Bill and will feel able to support the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps I should declare an interest as a hearing aid user for over 50 years and as one of the first people lucky enough to be able to afford a digital hearing aid, so I know how valuable they are. I therefore applauded the Government when they introduced a very reasonable range of digital hearing aids through the NHS. But, as the Minister and noble Lords know, waiting times for those aids are very uneven around the country. One must hope that what is being proposed will help to speed up the process.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000424"></a>As we have heard, the Hearing Aid Council regulates the independent sector. Under the new scheme, the Health Professions Council will ultimately do the work of both councils. I find it odd that some NHS hearing aid dispensers are not required to have any qualifications, so that will be a plus. I was also amazed to learn that because the Hearing Aid Council is a relatively small body, it has to charge something like &#163;695 a year for registration. It is hoped that that figure will drop to around &#163;60 when the change is made. However, everybody says that the council has done an absolutely marvellous job. No doubt all the professionals would want to add their thanks to those that have already been made.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000425"></a>All is going in the right direction, and I am particularly glad to hear that the transition is likely to take place later this year. That must be good news. I should like confirmation from the Minister that when we say that this will take place, it actually will happen and the handover will begin. I seek that confirmation because quite a number of hearing aid dispensers in the independent sector could be employed in the National Health Service and thus reduce waiting lists. The time for that to happen has more than passed, so we need good news on this front.</p>

Age is a factor which adds to this problem, even if, like me, you have had a different hearing problem for a long time.

<p><a name="08051489000427"></a>We all welcome the fact that the merger will benefit clients, and we know that the RNID is very much in favour of it. We also know that of course BSHAA equally welcomes it. Moreover&#151;and one has to say that this does not always happen&#151;all the parties have been working together really well for quite some time.</p>

In his absence, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, for writing to me about them in advance. I have no difficulty with the principle of what is proposed, which appears to be potentially beneficial to registered hearing aid dispensers as well as their customers. As has been said, the professional bodies most closely associated with audiology are in favour.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000429"></a>I have only three questions. The first concerns regulatory clarity. One feature of the proposals is that complaints by consumers will no longer be directed toward a single body, as they are at the moment. Complaints that fall under the heading of consumer protection will fall to the Office of Fair Trading or trading standards officers. Complaints about fitness-to-practise matters and professional standards will fall to the HPC. Is the Minister satisfied that the new system will be simple for the consumer to understand and navigate? An ordinary man or woman, especially if they are elderly and frail, wants a straightforward process. This aspect of the changes introduces greater complexity and scope of confusion.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000430"></a>My second question relates to the transition. If there are fitness-to-practise cases in train when the transfer to the HPC is effected, how will they be concluded? On complaints, will the Government ensure that there is the minimum hiatus between one set of arrangements and the next? It would be unacceptable for consumers if the HAC&#146;s work in dealing with complaints was suddenly terminated before the complaints were resolved, only then for the matters in question to be dealt with from scratch either by the HPC or one or other of the trading standards bodies. How will the transition be achieved smoothly so as not to disadvantage the consumer with undue delays?</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000431"></a>My third question relates to the employees of the Hearing Aid Council itself. How many employees are there? Are there new jobs for them to go to, and will their employment rights be protected under TUPE arrangements if they transfer to the HPC?</p>

<p><a name="08051489000432"></a><a name="80514-gc0009.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051489000679"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> First, I thank noble Lords for their general support. At the moment, I am let loose only on things about which people agree. I agree that it is odd that those in the public sector were not registrants; the proposals address that. On the matter of charges, yes, there will be a real reduction in fees. The Hearing Aid Council is a very small organisation with about 1,700 registrants, 200 of which are  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC382"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employers. To fund the running of the council, it now charges registrants an annual fee of &#163;695. The Health Professions Council, in contrast, regulates about 180,000 health professionals. It has significant resources at its disposal&#151;vastly greater than the Hearing Aid Council&#151;and charges its registrants &#163;72 a year. I am sure that the Committee will appreciate that the difference in fees of more than &#163;600 a year is not inconsiderable to the hearing aid profession.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000433"></a>I was invited to assure the noble Baroness that the transition will take place this year. I have to disappoint her. It will be taken with all due speed, but the transition will be next year. I think that I am right to say that the target was April; we are doing our best to achieve that, but we will have to publish the Section 60 order, and of course we will want a proper 12-week consultation.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000434"></a>Some of the noble Earl&#146;s concerns are covered by a communications campaign jointly instigated by the HAC and the HPC aimed at all relevant stakeholders to ensure that they are all aware of the impending change. The HAC has begun working with the RNID, Hearing Concern, Citizens Advice and other consumer groups to ensure that the campaign reaches its intended audience. The HPC and HAC are already working out a plan for a smooth transition, and have been planning this for two years. I can write to noble Lords with more detail if that would be helpful.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000435"></a>Finally, what about the workers? The Hearing Aid Council has a very small staff. The only full-time staff are three executive assistants and a modernisation and transfer manager. The chief executive, the registrar and the director of resources all work between one and two days a week, and the legal director works one and a half days a month. The council is working towards abolition in 2009, and any continuing uncertainty may affect staff retention. No staff are expected to transfer to the HPC, but we are confident that the two years of close co-operation with the HPC and the better protection will ensure that expertise is not lost.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000441"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a fairly clear and self-explanatory amendment. I am very concerned about the proposed changes to the General Medical Council and to the General Dental Council, which I know better. The proposal is that these will have 24 fully appointed members. Over the years, I have seen great variations in the make-up of the General Dental Council. I understand that originally almost all the members were nominated, but then there was demand for elections. I was elected as a general dental practitioner to represent general dentists. Then we reached the point when, in 2003, all nominated members were thrown out and all the dentist members were fully elected. The General Dental Council had 29 members, of which 15 were dentists who were all elected by a single transferable vote, 10 lay members and four hygienists or therapists. As I said, the General Dental Council decided that nominated members were not satisfactory and the change was made; all the dentists were fully elected in 2003. We are only in 2008 and the General Dental Council is proposing to throw out all the elected people.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000442"></a>I understand that a reliable and well informed independent appointments commission will take these decisions, but whatever the answer&#151;I am sure it will be a reliable panel&#151;it is taking away from the members of the profession their democratic right to elect representatives who really do understand the everyday problems of dentists in practice. As a member of the General Dental Council, I found that some people who were elected to represent general dentists&#151;I do not think that I was any great help in this respect&#151;raised amazingly important and interesting matters that affected every bit of general dental practice. There is perhaps a great division between dentists in National Health Service practices, who were the ones who were being elected, and people who are in important private practice. It is a retrogressive step in a democracy if we turn round and say that members of the profession will have no say in deciding who represents them. My amendment proposes that we retain at least an elected element on these authorities. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000443"></a><a name="80514-gc0009.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80514-gc0009.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051489000682"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I shall take the issue of the composition of regulatory body councils first. The Bill does not tell the full story of the Government&#146;s policy in that respect. As set out in the White Paper, <I>Trust, Assurance and Safety</I>, the Bill removes the restriction in Section 60 of the Health Act 1999 on lay majorities on the councils of healthcare professional regulators. It is our intention that subsequent secondary legislation will then ensure that all councils have parity of membership between lay and professional members as a minimum. We think it is important that every regulatory body has at least parity, because professional majorities on a council can undermine the perception of its independence from the interests of the profession. I think there is widespread agreement about that. Having parity will  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC384"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column GC384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remove any doubts that a professional majority can influence a council&#146;s decision-making process in favour of the profession.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000444"></a>The intention is that every professional regulatory body will have parity, but the removal of restrictions on lay majorities in the Bill will also allow us to consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests from regulatory bodies to move to a lay majority. We want to make that option available to the regulators because moving to a lay majority is an opportunity for a regulator to send a clear and public signal that the interests of patients and the public are at the very heart of what they do. After all, the very reason that a regulatory system exists is to protect patient safety, and having a lay majority may reflect that purpose. This has been recognised by some regulators, including the General Optical Council.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000445"></a>Even with a lay majority, there will be ample professional members on the councils bringing a crucial professional perspective to council discussions. When we talk about a lay majority, it is likely to be simply one more lay member than professional members on the council, as a symbolic acknowledgement that the purpose of the regulatory body is to protect patient safety.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000446"></a>With regard to the second aspect of this amendment, which would prevent councils from being fully appointed, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said in a recent debate on dentistry that appointed members are wrong because,</p>
<ul><a name="08051489000542"></a>&#147;they will not necessarily be representative of the practitioners in the way that someone elected to that post would be&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/4/2008; col. 1698.]</ul>
<p><a name="08051489000472"></a>However, it is for precisely that reason that the Government felt it was crucial to move away from elected members. Professional members on a regulatory body should not be representatives of the practitioners who have elected them. That creates a potential conflict of interest and a situation where patients and the public would be entitled to wonder whether the professional member, elected by his peers, saw his first duty to those who elected him or to the patients that the regulatory body exists to protect.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000447"></a>The appointment of all professional members is about resolving very valid concerns that being elected places on professional members a responsibility to the interests of their electorate and their specific concerns. It is also about creating a new transparency within regulatory bodies so that it is clear all members on the council are impartial and independent. Professional members of the regulatory councils are there to provide a professional perspective, but absolutely not to represent a specific group that elects them.</p>

<a name="80514-gc0009.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08051489000448"></a>In the light of these explanations, I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, feels able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

My point is that those ordinary dentists are selected by other practitioners because of their knowledge. They will not necessarily be put forward for appointment&#151;it might never cross their minds to apply to an ad in the paper&#151;but they are persuaded by colleagues that they are people who can help the profession.</p>

<p><a name="08051489000450"></a>The Minister talked about helping the public. That is why it is important to have people in particular who are involved in NHS practice: they are confronting issues that are quite different from other issues. It is in the interests of the public and patients to have what I am suggesting&#151;a very small number of representative people.</p>

As regards a &#147;new transparency&#148;&#151;what is transparent about these appointments? We have seen all the appointments to the House of Lords done by one of these special appointments commissions. We were told we were going to have &#147;people&#146;s Peers&#148;; we expected a hairdresser and a postman, and yet the only postman we have ever had here, as far as I know, is that hereditary man from Tasmania who came over to take his seat. The people who arrived from the Peers&#146; list were the people we would have expected to see anyhow&#151;the great and the good, or at least the good. I think that the panels, no matter how transparent, are lacking in this respect. Ordinary dentists in general practice, who have a pretty rotten job and work very hard, will be rather upset that they will have no say at all in the people who are sitting on their governing body.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08051454000010"></a>Member states will be invited to adopt council conclusions on the quality of public finances following a discussion at the Informal ECOFIN in Brdo, Slovenia in April.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08051454000012"></a>Member states will be invited to adopt council conclusions on the next steps on the western Balkans investment framework. Progress on the investment framework, which will bring together the donor funding streams for the western Balkans, is a priority for the Slovenian presidency. The UK supports work on the framework, which was discussed at the informal ECOFIN.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08051454000013"></a><I>Financial services</I></p>
<I>Financial Stability Arrangements: Supervision, including an Update of the Roadmaps</I>Following discussions at the Informal ECOFIN, member states will be invited to agree a unified set of council conclusions on arrangements on financial stability and supervision. The EFC has prepared the draft council conclusions on supervision and an update of the roadmaps on the review of the Lamfalussy process, the strengthening EU arrangements for financial stability, and on actions taken in response to the financial turmoil.<I>Communication on Financial Education</I>The council will be asked to agree to draft council conclusions on financial education, which suggest some initiatives and practical assistance for helping member states to improve the levels of financial education within their countries.<I>White Paper on Mortgage Credits</I>Member states will be invited to agree to draft council conclusions on a possible single market for mortgages.

The UK is strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against missing trader intra-community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.<I>Savings Taxation</I>The Commission will provide an informal oral report on the functioning of the savings tax directive in view of recent developments involving Liechtenstein investment vehicles and following the request of the March ECOFIN Council. The UK strongly supports the Commission's continued dialogue with third countries with a view to bringing them into the savings tax directive.<I>Good Governance in the Tax Area</I>Member states will be invited to agree draft conclusions containing a specific provision on good governance in the tax area, which is to be added to relevant agreements to be concluded by the Community and its member states with third countries.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08051454000021"></a><a name="80514-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80514-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051454000049"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08051454000022"></a>This Statement sets out the steps we are taking to provide more opportunities for first-time buyers to access the housing market.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08051454000023"></a>The vast majority of people in this country aspire to owning their own home. People value the security of home ownership, the sense of having a stake in the community, and the chance to build up assets.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08051454000024"></a>Rising prosperity in this country over recent years, with high employment and low interest rates, has meant that more people have been able to aspire to home ownership. Since 1997, there are a million more households who own their own home. Some 110,000 have benefited from our low-cost home ownership programmes, enabling them to get a first foot on the property ladder.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS55"></a><b>14 May 2008 : Column WS55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08051454000025"></a>However, a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand has now put house prices far beyond the reach of many, particularly first-time buyers. Ten years ago, the average house price was just 3.5 times the average income. Now, the average house costs more than seven times the average income. And while interest rates have fallen, the result is still that fewer first-time buyers are able to enter the market. Not only is this a potential brake on aspiration and social mobility, it may also cause stagnation in the rest of the market.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08051454000026"></a>The long-term solution is to build more homes to overcome this housing shortage. This is why we are embarking on a major housing supply programme under which we want to see outputs rising to 240,000 new homes a year by 2016. But in the short term, we want to do more to ensure that more potential first-time buyers are able to enter the property market.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08051454000027"></a>The current market situation makes this more difficult. Last week we announced a package of measures to help support home owners, including measures to ensure that financial advice and support is available for borrowers who may be facing difficulties with their mortgage. But we also want to see mortgages available for those who can sustain home ownership, and at the same time we want to support housebuilding.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08051454000028"></a>Through our shared equity schemes, we already aim to help 75,000 more householders on to the property ladder over the next three years. Today I am announcing how we can go even further than that by focusing spending to support the housing market and those looking to get on the housing ladder.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08051454000029"></a>In the Budget the Government announced two new Open Market HomeBuy products offering greater affordability to first-time buyers. We have also announced a purchase assistance grant of &#163;1,500 to the first 2,000 purchasers to help them with the costs of moving into a new home.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08051454000030"></a>Today I am announcing an expansion of the eligibility criteria for these products so that more people can benefit. It is right that we continue to give priority to key workers and tenants in the social rented sector. But from today both the New Build HomeBuy and Open Market HomeBuy products will also be open to all first-time buyers with a household income below &#163;60,000 who could not otherwise afford to buy. This will allow, for instance, those who work in public services, but who are employed by the private sector, to access this support.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08051454000031"></a>In addition we are focusing up to &#163;100 million spending to expand Open Market HomeBuy to help an additional 2,500 first-time buyers purchase a newly built home in 2008-09. Purchasers will be able to apply to use the new shared equity products announced on 1 April to purchase a new-build home of their choice on the open market. The new products help to improve affordability to buyers by offering an equity loan of up to 50 per cent of property value. This scheme will make a wide choice of new property open to prospective buyers while also helping to support the new-build market and maintain housing supply.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08051454000032"></a>This change will more than double the number of families helped by the new Open Market HomeBuy products this year.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08051454000033"></a>Alongside this, we are maintaining our commitment to deliver much needed social rented homes, keeping up delivery in 2008-09 and with a target of 45,000 such homes in 2010-11.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08051454000034"></a>The current market also provides opportunities for housing associations to buy new properties from housebuilders at competitive prices. The Housing Corporation has already been working with housing associations and housebuilders to take advantage of these opportunities. In the first three months of the year, housing associations bought 1,800 homes from developers through the National Affordable Housing Programme. Nearly 840 of these were for low-cost home ownership and 935 were for social rent.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08051454000035"></a>I have today asked the Housing Corporation to use flexibilities available to it in its current programme to fund more such purchases where they represent good value for money. The corporation estimates that it may be able to fund an additional &#163;200 million of direct purchases from housebuilders in the current financial year, helping yet more families into low-cost home ownership and rented accommodation.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08051454000036"></a>A marketing campaign for all the HomeBuy products will be launched in partnership with lenders and housing associations in order to raise awareness of the new criteria. Government will work with the TUC and individual trade unions to promote these opportunities to their members.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08051454000037"></a>Following the Government&#146;s meeting with CML and lenders, we will continue to work with a range of lenders to support a fair and well functioning UK mortgage market. We will also work with lenders to encourage them to develop their own shared equity products.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08051454000039"></a>In my Statement of 25 January (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 65-66WS), I promised to make an announcement once I had reached a decision on what form any future inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Baha Mousa in Iraq in September 2003 might take.</p>

<a name="80514-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08051454000040"></a>After wide consultation and after considering the representations that I have received, and with the full support of the military chain of command, including the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chief of the General Staff, I have decided that the right thing to do is to establish a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005. The inquiry will examine the circumstances surrounding the death of Baha Mousa. The terms of reference and other details will be made public once they have been established in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and the inquiry report will be published.</p>

The Army has no wish to hide anything in this respect. It has looked at itself very critically since 2003, and has made a number of significant changes that were enumerated in Brigadier Aitken&#146;s report of January this year. It nevertheless remains anxious to learn all the lessons that it possibly can from this disturbing incident.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08051454000042"></a>Overall, the conduct of tens of thousands of our people in Iraq has been exemplary; it is a tiny number who have caused a stain on the reputation of the British Army. But that does not mean we can allow these events to pass without looking into them thoroughly.</p>

Our National Action Plan for UNSCR 1325 commits to work to increase the number of women at senior decision-making levels in conflict resolution and peace-building in UK and international institutions and civil society. In October 2007 the UK supported a UN Security Council presidential statement which urged the UN &#147;to enhance the role of women in decision-making with regard to all peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction&#148;.</p>

This encouraged the mission to emphasise &#147;the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building&#148;. The UK supports programmes to promote the involvement of women in conflict resolution. For example, last year we started funding a &#163;3.2 million programme with the UN Development Fund for Women to support women's engagement in peace-building and reduction of gender violence in conflict and post-conflict countries, including Afghanistan, Liberia, Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
