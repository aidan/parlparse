The Nuclear Threat Initiative put forward an interesting proposal at a special session of the IAEA last month. At the same meeting, the United Kingdom also put forward an innovative suggestion for an enrichment bond. The IAEA is currently considering these and other proposals, and its conclusions will be important in guiding future decisions.</p>

Is he prepared to put some of these proposals in the Library of the House so that we can be better informed about them? Does he agree that an international system of the sort being explored is by far the best way of heading off the pressure for new enrichment plants, which are the short cut to proliferation, and that the proposal by Mr Warren Buffett is perhaps one way of addressing the fear that countries with civil nuclear will be at a commercial disadvantage <I>vis-Ã -vis</I> countries that already have enrichment capacity?</p>

Since then, we have been working hard to demonstrate how that would work in practice. The UK&#146;s enrichment bond idea is

Does he also agree that the future is bound to involve a major expansion of carbon-free civil nuclear power if we are serious about lowering carbon in the atmosphere; that in those circumstances there is bound to be a huge advance in civil nuclear power around the world; that the inspection system, which we have lived with since the Second World War, is not working very well; and that this alternative of an independent nuclear fuel bank to service and facilitate the use of civil nuclear energy around the world might be a much better approach? So could we have not merely putting the documents in the Library but positive thinking inside Her Majesty&#146;s Government and possible support for an initiative based on these ideas?</p>

Placing the documents in the Library just makes sure that everybody has seen the proposals so far asthey have developed. I completely agree that the widespread development of enrichment capabilities leads to the threat of further nuclear proliferation. If states can be assured of reliable access to nuclear fuel, they should and, we hope, will choose not to develop enrichment and processing capabilities of their own. The bond that I have described is one part of a mechanism that in practice&#151;it must be a practical solution&#151;will lead to that outcome.</p>

I wish to press the Minister a little further on the matter. Does he see any conflict between the proposal on the enrichment bonds, which I am delighted to hear has been put forward by the UK Government, and the concept of an LEU bank? That would enable the IAEA to approach a great many countries that have highly enriched uranium, often in a research reactor or something of that kind, with a proposal for substitution by lowly enriched uranium, which cannot be turned into nuclear weapons. Will he consider carefully whether the United Kingdom might support the Buffett initiative, as well as pressing its own case? The two seem to me to be helpful to one another and not in conflict.</p>

That is certainly not the case, particularly regarding NVQs and modern apprenticeships.

Is the Minister aware, following what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that the specific issues raised by the Employers Forum on Age are really quite serious? They include the lack of guidance or sensible policy on redundancy, insured benefits, pension-related matters and government-funded training schemes. It seeks not just policy changes but further guidance to clarify those issues. Would the Government be prepared to look again at the lack of proper guidance, as the forum says, on those issues, and in particular consider giving guidance on what is meant by an &#147;objective justification&#148; for refusing to continue employing workers beyond the age of 65? That seems a particularly important practical question.</p>

It has to do that. We are very open in what we think. If other countries take a different view, it is for them to answer those questions.

That process of negotiation would be unlocked and would move forward more rapidly were the negotiations on the road map in the Middle East to be pursued vigorously and as rapidly as possible. Having said that, with regard to the particular problems of engaging with Iran, Iran needs to engage with everybody else. Iran must also realise that we cannot accept breaches of the UN Security Council resolutions or threats if we continue to pursue what the Security Council has agreed.</p>

Does not all this conversation reinforce the validity and worthwhileness of the proposition that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, put forward in the first Question today&#151;namely, that this inspection route and the attempt through the IAEA to curtail Iranian activities when they are determined to push ahead is probably not going to work and that a far better way would be through the nuclear fuel bank idea, which we should develop as rapidly as possible?</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the report of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management&#151;CoRWM&#151;which was published on 31 July. Similar Statements have been made in the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. I thank the chair, Gordon MacKerron, and the members of the committee for the outstanding effort that they put into arriving at their unanimous report. &#147;The issue of nuclear waste disposal has dogged successive Governments. CoRWM was asked to recommend the best option, or combination of options, for the long-term management of the UK&#146;s higher activity radioactive waste to provide protection for people and the environment. The Government believe that CoRWM's report provides a very strong basis for moving forward with clarity and consensus. We accept CoRWM's recommendations that the UK's higher activity waste should be managed in the long term through  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1210"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>geological disposal, and the continuing need for safe and secure interim storage until the geological disposal is available. We also agree with CoRWM that we must continue to build on the momentum that it has helped establish.&#147;As CoRWM&#146;s report observes, geological disposal is the approach being adopted in many countries, including Belgium, France, Finland, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the US. Nevertheless, securing geological disposal represents a major challenge and will require a commitment over many decades. We accept CoRWM's recommendation that the process for developing a geological disposal option should be undertaken on a staged basis, with clear decision points. This will allow Government to review progress, assess costs and value for money and environmental impact before decisions are taken to move to the next stage.&#147;Planning and development of the geological disposal option must be based on four keypillars. First, it must have a strong and effective implementing organisation, with clear responsibilities and accountabilities. Secondly, there must be strong independent regulation by the statutory regulators&#151;the Health and Safety Executive, the environment agencies and the Office for Civil Nuclear Security. Thirdly, there must be independent scrutiny and advice to Government on implementation. Fourthly, there should be a partnership with the host community.&#147;The CoRWM report observes that the safe and secure storage of civil legacy radioactive waste already falls within the remit of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority established under the Energy Act 2004. The NDA also has responsibility for disposal of low-level radioactive waste in its current remit. We have decided that responsibility for securing geological disposal of higher activity waste should also fall to the NDA, to create one organisation able to take a strategic view through all stages of the waste management chain, accountable in a clear and transparent way to independent regulators and Government. &#147;The NDA is already subject to statutory safety, environmental protection and security obligations under the Energy Act 2004, and its contractors are subject to regulation by the environment agencies, the Health and Safety Executive and the Office for Civil Nuclear Security. Its strategy and annual plans are subject to approval by Government. We will ensure that in future the longer-term radioactive waste management interests of Government are appropriately represented in the NDA&#146;s strategy, and that it has governance arrangements to reflect its increased responsibilities.&#147;Nirex has played an important role in maintaining and developing the UK's knowledge on geological disposal, including the provision of advice to industry on waste conditioning and packaging, since the demise of its own geological disposal development programme in 1997. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I, as  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1211"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>joint shareholders in Nirex, are grateful to the successive chairs and the board for their hard work, and of course to the expert staff involved. None the less, the Government believe that having two organisations on the same playing field with potentially overlapping responsibilities has the potential to confuse and blur accountability. Instead we are determined to harness the skill and commitment of the staff involved within the NDA. Following the Statement we shall allow Nirex a short period to comment on the proposed ownership transfer and how it could best be brought about.&#147;The independent environment and nuclear safety regulators believe that this proposal will provide a framework that they can regulate in a strong and effective manner. They are content that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will be responsible for implementing the geological disposal programme, within the constitutional arrangements which I described earlier. The regulators&#146; support is of major importance, as strong independent regulation is key both to ensuring the safety of people and the environment and to securing confidence and trust in the delivery arrangements.&#147;Coming to the third key pillar of our approach, we remain committed to independent advice. Accordingly, a successor independent committee will be appointed to give advice on the plans for the long-term management of radioactive waste. CoRWM has set the standards for open and transparent advice that takes into account not only the best available scientific and other expert input, but the views of the public and stakeholders. It has also built up support and brand recognition.&#147;The new committee will therefore maintainthe current name, but its membership will be reconstituted to reflect its role in the next stageof the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme. The committee will be sponsored by Defra, the DTI and the devolved Administrations. Its primary functions will be to advise onthe implementation of a geological disposal programme, including considering the strategy and delivery plans and the site selection process. It will make its advice available to the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, as has been done by CoRWM.&#147;The circumstances surrounding the long-term disposal of higher activity radioactive waste are unique. We have made it clear that we are not seeking to impose radioactive waste on any community. In this context, we are strongly supportive of exploring the concept of voluntarism and partnership arrangements with the local authorities serving communities that might be affected. As CoRWM recognises, there is a need to consider further how such arrangements could work in practice. Accordingly, we will look to further develop a voluntarist and partnership approach including the stages and decision points, how communities would be involved, the role of  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1212"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>democratically elected bodies, and the potentialfor involvement and community packages, as suggested by CoRWM.&#147;Disposal facilities will be built only in a geologically suitable area, and we will consider how geological and scientific considerations will be meshed with other societal considerations as, for a successful programme, all criteria will need to be met. I invite any local authority or group of local authorities that wishes to be involved in these discussions to contact myself, my honourable friend the Member for Dudley South or officials directly. Similar invitations are being extended by my colleagues in the devolved Administrations.&#147;It must be stressed that any future facility-siting process will be a wholly new process, divorced from the historical Nirex process. Lessons have been learnt from that. We are also determined that the new approach will be carried out fromthe beginning in an open and transparent waywith appropriate opportunity for public and stakeholder as well as expert involvement.&#147;In the light of this further work, the Government will produce an implementation framework and publish it for consultation as soon as possible next year.&#147;This announcement, and the more detailed response which I am publishing today, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, completes stage 2 of the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme. We are now entering stage 3 on planning for implementation. We aim to be able to move to stage 4&#151;the final implementation stage&#151;in 2008, confident that the sharing of information and viewpoints and the transparency of the CoRWM process has been maintained.&#147;The CoRWM report says that,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="06102571000193"></a>&#145;for over three decades, efforts to find solutions to the problem of long-term radioactive waste management in the UK have failed&#146;.</p>
</ul>Governments of all parties have struggled to develop a long-term approach to this issue founded on science and driven by openness and transparency. I believe my Statement today combines scientific rigour and clear accountability, and I commend it to the House&#148;.

The real question is: do the Government actually mean business? I note what is said at the end of the Statement about moving through the stages to implementation, but regrettably the possibility of further prevarication exists.</p>

<a name="61025-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="06102571000081"></a>I welcome the decision that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will take responsibility for disposal of nuclear waste, and that body&#146;s proposed absorption of Nirex. I also welcome the continuation of CoRWM to provide independent advice. However, the Statement is not clear on what happens if the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and CoRWM disagree on the strategy. Is there a mechanism to resolve that disagreement, or would such disagreement impose further delay?</p>

<a name="61025-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="06102571000082"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could explain the cryptic remark that occurs on the top of page 5,</p>
<ul><a name="06102571000174"></a>&#147;exploring the concept of voluntarism&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102571000152"></a>Is that, in effect, a bidding process for local authorities that have suitable geology to, shall we say, advance themselves as possible candidates when sites are considered? That prompts a further question: what happens, as seems perfectly possible, if nobody volunteers? How is that to be resolved, or will we come back to someone having to say, &#147;In this situation we will have to look and act without a volunteer&#148;?</p>

<a name="61025-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="06102571000083"></a>I am not quite sure what,</p>
<ul><a name="06102571000175"></a>&#147;divorced from the...Nirex process&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06102571000153"></a>means. Nirex considered all types of disposal and the whole of the country. I even remember a consultation, sometime in the late 1970s, about a possible disposal site in Essex. Since we know that its work must have been very thorough, is all that work to be disregarded? Are we really to do it all again?</p>

<a name="61025-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="06102571000084"></a>The final question that is not clear in this paper&#151;inevitably so, I suspect&#151;is the little matter of finance. Is sufficient funding already provided to enable the planning process to be fully undertaken, because it will still involve a great amount of detailed work that will incur expense? Some assurance on that would certainly help. Even more importantly, deep geological repositories, which are a major long-term development, will involve a long-term financial commitment. The horrible reality of 30 years of delay means that the cost of that work is now grossly inflated from the figure that it might have been had the job been undertaken 30 years ago. Will the Government therefore establish a fund now&#151;not putting in all the money, but some funding? Will they start building a fund so that when we come to construction some of the money will be there? That would provide two assurances: first, that the Government are absolutely determined to get this through; and, secondly, that the planning work cannot possibly impose any additional delay. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

As has been said, the solution has been around for a long time. It has been accepted that the waste should be buried. I know that CoRWM was set up to reconsider all the options, but it has returned to the same conclusion. The issue has always been: where? If there is a weak point in the Statement it is: what happens if no community is willing to take the waste? Although fine words are said about democracy and that a community will be allowed to say no, what if a local council in Wales, for the sake of argument, says yes&#151;obviously, the Government will have to offer considerable benefit to go with the acceptance of waste&#151;but the Welsh Assembly says no? The issue is fraught with questions. I hope that it can be worked through, because it is essential just to deal with the legacy of waste. I am glad that the terminology is &#147;managing&#148; now, because it certainly still cannot be viewed as disposal. The waste is not being disposed of; it is simply being managed underground.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="06102571000086"></a>One of the most interesting recommendationsand government responses comes under recommendation 7, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="06102571000155"></a>&#147;If a decision is taken to manage any uranium, spent nuclear fuel and plutonium as wastes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06102571000154"></a>That is one of the biggest items in the whole report. First, there is a fair amount of such material and, secondly, there is an enormous budget implication well beyond what the Government have already costed. Will the Minister repeat the estimated cost of disposing of nuclear waste as envisaged by CoRWM? If recommendation 7 is taken on board to include all those materials, the spent plutonium will have to be moved in budgetary terms from an asset column, as it is now classified by the Government, to a cost column, with considerable implications for budgeting. I hope that safety issues will be paramount rather than accountant-speak&#151;being worried about the shifting of figures, which will have to happen.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="06102571000087"></a>The industry has been subject to constant change. Only yesterday, the formation of the new nuclear research body and the break-up of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd were announced. Reorganisation undoubtedly brings difficulties. The Government have accepted that there is an ever decreasing pool of expertise in this area. Although the Statement talks of independence, it will be very hard to get people who are truly independent, in the sense that they are likely to have worked for a long time in the industry. The democratic process will have to bring the checks and balances of that independence into being. I certainly hope we will have the time to examine that in this House.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="06102571000088"></a>The creation of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which we debated in your Lordships&#146; House during consideration of the Energy Act 2004, was a very positive move, and I hope that, in tandem with the other changes announced today, it will add impetus to dealing with the legacy of waste. None of this Statement can be taken as encouraging us to think that a future nuclear-build programme, in the unlikely event that we get there in our lifetimes, will be any more possible or likely until all these enormous questions about waste are dealt with.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said that the problem has been around for 30 years, and so have the solutions. I am not sure whether that is literally correct, but he is generally correct that many people have considered the problem.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="06102571000091"></a>Regardless of whether there is an issue between CoRWM and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the Government must agree the plans. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was set up under the Energy Act, so there are constraints. Indeed, we are considering the Government&#146;s arrangements, as the Statement said. We need a public discussion on the matter. I do not want to go over the past, because things can be misunderstood, but we also need a clear and transparent audit trail, exactly as the CoRWM process has shown. CoRWM has produced a first-class report with a first-class audit trail, and there can be no criticism of that. In some ways, that is where the answer lies in relation to the new facility siting process being divorced from the Nirex process. We must discuss how voluntarism and partnership can be linked to the scientific assessment of sites. The Nirex site list is, however, disregarded. That is what was meant by the new process being divorced from the Nirex process. One cannot wipe out what happened, but we now have a different arrangement. There is no question of going over the Nirex sites.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="06102571000092"></a>I cannot answer the financial question about possible start-up costs, but point to evidence from other countries&#151;I listed six, seven, or eight of them; I forget the exact number. We do not want to look as though we will fail. The Statement was made only today. I would not be surprised if the odd local authority had not made inquiries, because that is the way in which things will be done. We must set up a process in 2007, as we have said, so that we can assess the voluntary approach. We want an assessment and a solution based on partnership and a willingness to participate. As I have said, international experience indicates that this approach is the one that is most likely to succeed. So I do not envisage failure at the moment. It is true that the costs are large. We are talking about huge sums of money, as nobleLords know better than I do. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, funded by the Government, deals with historic waste. Any new operators must share the costs of their work.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="06102571000093"></a>The Written Statement yesterday is, in a way, quite separate from today&#146;s Statement, and I am not briefed to answer questions about it. Moreover, as always, in this narrow and specialist area as in other areas where science is involved, there will be debates about the  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1216"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independence of the people involved. One has to be realistic. Expertise probably will come from a specific area of scientific and academic research, and one of the practicalities of the industry is that you draw on that advice. I cast no aspersions on what the noble Baroness said, but while there must be checks and balances in the governance arrangements to weigh up the risks involved in taking independent advice, just because a person has worked in the industry does not mean that their advice on the best way forwardin another context&#151;advice based on their experience&#151;is not valuable or not independent. We are talking about an issue where no one around now will ever be accountable for their advice. This is decades of work.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="06102571000094"></a>On the question about cost implications if plutonium is declared a waste material, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will consider this as part of its strategy and planning, which will require government approval. It goes without saying that the Government are accountable to Parliament. Parliament would be involved in terms of scrutinising government actions. The planning I have referred to will include carrying out further important work to determine the costs. To be honest, I cannot go down the road of costs. All kinds of figures are bandied about and these costs will run over decades. Whatever ballpark figure one puts out, whether it is hundreds of millions or indeed billions, the costs will stretch over an indeterminate number of decades that neither I nor anyone else can begin to predict at present. Further work has got to be done.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="06102571000095"></a>Finally, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, we are determined to proceed on this and to secure as wide a consensus and partnership as possible. Previous approaches have failed, and that is no criticism of either Government. But the fact is that it is now time for action and we have to make some progress. The voluntary partnership approach seems to work elsewhere in the world and there is no real reason why it should not work here.</p>

Some 27 years ago I had ministerial responsibility in this area, and if one is inclined to be cynical, one would say that the only thing which has changed is that the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) has become CoRWM. I inherited a situation in which the previous Labour Government&#146;s attempts to develop geological storage had failed in the face of strong public opposition in several different places. I formed the view then that interim storage, as it is described in this paper, was much the most likely outcome and that it would be built in places which had a strong economic interest in the future of the nuclear industry. Moreover, vitrification would be a good way of making safe these materials and would therefore be the most likely process.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="06102571000097"></a>Is the position of the Government still the one recommended I think by the committee of the noble

Is that still the position and is it the reason for the Statement today? Does it open up the opportunity to introduce more nuclear power provision, which I certainly support? However, I should say that the one very sensible statement made in the longer document to which the Minister referred is that local authorities should plan for interim storage to last for at least 100 years.</p>

I asked my officials aboutthis because in the past a lot of people involved in this area would come to round to my house about this subject&#151;and not just those in the industry, but Ministers. So I respect what the noble Lord has said. The energy White Paper made the position abundantly clear. I am well aware of the allegations that nuclear waste would somehow not be dealt with, thus making it much easier for us to oppose new nuclear build. But we have to deal with nuclear waste whether there is new build or not; that is the reality. We owe it to future generations to deal with this waste. The people of this country want the lights to come on when they turn on the light switch. Approximately a fifth of that power is from nuclear energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="06102571000099"></a>I do not want to get into new plants, but we have to deal with the waste whether or not there is a new build. The position on that was wrapped up more in the energy White Paper, quite separate to the CoRWM report.</p>

It was a disastrous proposition which met universal hostility in the local community. From this we should learn a clear lesson: it is highly unlikely that anyone will volunteer. I might change the phrase from nimby to wimby&#151;&#147;Welcome in my back yard&#148;&#151;but this will not be welcome in anyone&#146;s back yard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="06102571000101"></a>Is not the real answer the one that people simply refuse to examine, which we concluded at the time was the solution; that is, to have an international settlement or site somewhere in the world where everyone sends their nuclear waste? That is the long-term solution that will survive a century; it is not for every nation state to somehow deal with the matter in a local way which offends local communities.</p>

I do not know the details and am going on advice here, but I read out a list of countries where this process appears to work. The evidence is that we ought to be able to find a site&#151;I do not know whether a site or sites will be involved&#151;based on international experience. I fully respect what my noble friend says about what happened under the previous proposals, which is probably why the voluntary route is the only way we can go down now.</p>

However, there is one exception: our report recognised, as the Minister said today, that Parliament has to be involved. The recommendation we made was that at least once in every Parliament, there should be an opportunity for both Houses, with a Statement of progress in front of them, to have a debate and to support the continuation of the process. I hoped that this line would be supported by all parties.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="06102571000104"></a>The Minister is right: this problem has to be dealt with and it will take decades. It is not enough just to say that Ministers are accountable to Parliament. The opportunity for a regular parliamentary debate at least once in every Parliament was seen by that Select Committee as an important measure in giving democratic accountability, so that Governments and those involved&#151;the NDA and the new forum, which I hope will have lots of scientists and engineers on it&#151;have the support of Parliament as the voice of the nation. I do not want a categorical undertaking but I ask that the Minister will take that away and discuss it with his colleagues.</p>

I am not familiar with the advice that the Select Committee gave seven years ago. However, only two years ago when Parliament pressed the Energy Act, it gave the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority the status of a non-departmental public body. It is subject to scrutiny by Parliament, it can be and is called before the Select Committee in the other place that looks after the DTI, and there are Select Committees here. It seems quite normal that Parliament would want to have regular check-ups or stock-takes on such a long-term process, and that Parliament would do so in the way that it thought appropriate. This matter affects everybody, and if it goes wrong we get the blame. Government are accountable to Parliament.</p>

My first question relates to devolved Administrations. I am not clear what the position would be if it proved impossible to find a geological site in Scotland or Wales but one was found in England, or vice versa. Would the waste from one part of the United Kingdom go to the other part which had accepted it, or is it intended that there will be self-containment, as it were, within each of the units of the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="06102571000107"></a>Secondly, like other noble Lords, I am fascinated by the idea that we are not seeking to impose radioactive waste on any community. That is made very clear in the Statement. To discover what the Government mean by &#147;community&#148; I looked inthe report, but all it has, on page 13, is a list of all the fairly obvious and interesting questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="06102571000108"></a>It may be unrealistic but let us assume that support could be found to revisit the proposal for a site in west Cumbria. What is a community? What would happen

But that is a minor point; the central point of the noble Lord&#146;s question relates to devolved Administrations. Today&#146;s Statement has been agreed with the devolved Administrations. The CoRWM report was published on 31 July, just after Parliament went into Recess. We are making the Statement today because this is the first available opportunity when all three bodies have been sitting. It has not been possible since we have been back because I understand the Welsh Assembly has been in Recess, having come back earlier. If the noble Lord checks the legal arrangements he will find that nuclear waste is a devolved issue&#151;and that, therefore, should answer the first part of his question.</p>

Whenwill the Government start the process of educating the public about the nature of radioactivity and the problems we face, as advocated in the report of the Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House in 1999? At present, the general public believe that the problem is insurmountable, that there is no technical solution that works. Clearly such a process will take some time, not a few months&#151;I think the report stated that it will take at least a year or maybe 18 months&#151;so when will we start work on educating the public?</p>

By and large, this issue affects people when it affects them&#151;either through their jobs, their communities, their locality, their family and so on. CoRWM has gone through an incredible process of consultation around the country which has been open and transparent. For those areas the process is under way. There is no single magic policy or annunciation or statement that will convince everyone. Surely people by now are wised up to the fact that we are losing control over our supplies of gas because the North Sea is running out; that there are some parts of the world that are politically unstable so where are we going to get our energy from?

The Canadians were outstanding and got a great deal of support. Admittedly it is a very large country and it is not unsurprising that some interest has been shown. But Finland, which is smaller, I think had three competitors for its storage plant. It is important that the public should understand that a number of countries have done this and how they have done it.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="06102571000113"></a>Secondly, the general public&#146;s perception of nuclear waste is grossly misleading. We have heard it described in this House this afternoon as &#147;immense&#148;. That is in the eye of the beholder. I think the last spokesperson for Greenpeace described it as &#147;mountainous,&#148; which it is not. Therefore, it would be helpful if some very clear information could be provided to the public, to remove from people&#146;s minds what is being fed to them by those who are, I think, pushing another agenda: that of not having any further nuclear power plants.</p>

<a name="61025-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="06102571000114"></a>Maybe I am anticipating something that will come along, but most countries have offered incentives. It would be extremely encouraging for local authorities to know that there is a benefit beyond creating employment for those who do not have it. The French did remarkably well in this, but, again, that is a differently run country, although they run my electricity supply. Lastly, presumably it is possible to indicate that some parts of the country are unsuitable. Why have greater anxiety in those parts if we can say, as I am sure Mr Livingstone will say of London, that they are not suitable?</p>

It does not apply just to this area of activity; there are others. Most people go to hospital without thinking about what happens to the low-level waste. I remember, some years ago, my former colleague, now a Member of this place, the noble Lord, Lord Cunningham, receiving letters which said, &#147;You should have this stuff put in your constituency&#148;. Of course, that is where it now is: at Drigg, in Cumbria&#151;tonnes of low-level waste from hospitals all over the country, looked after perfectly adequately. If we were not going to do that, we could not use X-rays in our hospitals. We have to make clear to the public the connection between the benefits they receive from our use of science&#151;including electricity and medical attention&#151;and the need to deal with the consequences. We must explain it properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="06102571000116"></a>In the past, I suspect this industry has probably been its own worst enemy, by not discussing matters openly enough. When HIV became a problem, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, broke all precedent for the Conservative Party by having all those leaflets that talked about sexual practices put through 20 million doors. No one ever dreamed of doing that. If you explain these things to people, they begin to understand why other policy actions are being taken. If we do not explain, we have only ourselves to blame.</p>

I wonder what has persuaded them that certain local authorities will come forward and volunteer to have suitable sites within their boundaries. Secondly, while we have been very much involved with this issue over the years, it will be new to the devolved authorities: the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="06102571000125"></a>Airports have had the statutory power to charge for aircraft by reference to their noise for almost25 years. Many of our larger airports do so. Moreover, BAA already applies an emissions-related charge at Heathrow and at Gatwick, using the airports&#146; conditions of use. We believe, however, that it is important to put it beyond doubt that any licensed aerodrome has the power to set such emissions charges, should their local circumstances make it necessary. That is the key purpose ofClause 1.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="06102571000126"></a>The Government believe that imposing a requirement that an airport's charges must be set by reference to noise and emissions would hamper airports' ability to reflect their own local circumstances. The Secretary of State will be able to require an airport to fix its charges in a way that takes into account its local environmental impact. This safeguard is already in Section 38 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 as regards noise charges; the power, now of course extended to cover charging by reference to emissions, is in subsection (4) of new Section 38. This power would be used if the introduction of noise and emissions-related charges at an airport seemed appropriate, and the airport operator was unwilling to do so.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="06102571000127"></a>The Commons' Amendment No. 4C in lieu would qualify that power of direction. The Secretary of State would be required to have regard to the interests  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of people who live in the area of the airport in determining whether&#151;and how&#151;to make use of the power. The Government's intention in proposing this amendment was to acknowledge the concern of stakeholders, reflected in previous debates in this House, that the provisions of this clause did not take sufficient account of the impact of aircraft noise on people living near airports. By accepting Amendment No. 4C the Bill would place a duty on the Secretary of State to consider this when deciding whether to use his power of direction, providing an additional safeguard for the interests of a local community around an airport. The further proposed Amendment No. 4D to Clause 11 is a minor consequential amendment that would ensure that this new provision, like the power of direction to which it relates, was executively devolved to the Scottish Ministers.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="06102571000128"></a>I am sure that on mature reflection the House will now see the point of the Government&#146;s view that Amendment No. 1 would be disproportionate. It would impose a legal duty on all 140-odd licensed aerodromes to set noise and emissions-related charges. I argued forcefully against that in previous proceedings on the Bill. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has now tried to address this issue by proposing a monthly level of commercial air traffic. It would become a duty for airports to fix their charges in this way.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="06102571000129"></a>Although the noble Lord&#146;s new amendment may seem attractive, and I congratulate him on his ingenuity in proposing it, I am afraid it has drawbacks that mean we cannot accept it. The first is that although it would compel some airports to fix their charges with reference to noise and emissions, it would so alter Clause 1 that other airports with lower traffic levels would not have the power to fix their charges in this way at all. Clearly, that is not something the Government want to see. Our position is quite clear: all along we have sought the power to be available for use by an airport dependent on local circumstances. It should not be dictated by some other broad criterion, which the noble Lord&#146;s amendment introduces.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="06102571000130"></a>Similarly, we are not convinced that fixing the requirement on the basis of monthly commercial traffic is appropriate. Commercial traffic fluctuates from month to month, whereas airports generally set their terms and conditions of use from one financial year to the next. As I have already noted, the local circumstance of each airport, and therefore the nature of its impact on the surrounding area, will be different. There remains a possibility that using the threshold recommended by the noble Lord would impose unnecessary regulation on some of the airports caught by the duty. For instance, Blackpool airport would be caught by the noble Lord&#146;s proposed criterion, having just over 1,000 commercial traffic movements per month. Yet it will be recognised that Blackpool has relatively few residential neighbours, and the largest aircraft regularly using it are Boeing 737s, which are generally comparatively quiet. The airport is considering its operating instructions with a view to further minimising noise nuisance. Under the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, Blackpool would fall

The case he put forward today is immeasurably advanced by those who know about aviation, including the previous Conservative Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="06102572000001"></a><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="06102572000042"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for attesting, with his intensive knowledge of the airline industry, that there is great support for the government position. The Opposition will have a chance to speak for themselves, and of course the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has already indicated that his colours are nailed to a different mast.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="06102572000002"></a>The airports operator has used its master plan, published earlier this year, to confirm that,</p>
<ul><a name="06102572000038"></a>&#147;it would be prepared to work closely with all the relevant bodies and the community to alleviate any particular concerns over noise and activity surrounding the airport&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102572000033"></a>Examples of the measures it would be prepared to contemplate include a limit on the total number of flights or a limitation on the extent of a particular noise contour.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="06102572000003"></a>The airport operator has also undertaken to continue to work with the airport&#146;s joint consultative committee and to continue its other liaison forums, which involve members of the public, on a proactive basis. In such circumstances it does not seem appropriate to the Government that the airport should be required to fix its charges by reference to noise and emissions when it is perfectly capable of relating to its local circumstances and recognising the needs of local interests.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="06102572000004"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 4E, like Amendment No. 1, would also be contrary to guidance from the International Civil Aviation Organisation that noise-related charges should be levied only at airports experiencing noise problems. I am aware that debate on these amendments has previously enabled noble Lords to raise their wider concerns about the Government&#146;s policy with regard to aircraft noise and emissions. However, the Government will not be changing their policy, as set out in <I>The Future of Air Transport</I>, that wherever possible local solutions are to be preferred for addressing the local environmental impacts of airports&#146; operations.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="06102572000005"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 would affect the way in which noise and emission charges should be set. As I have previously said, the Government of course agree that airport operators should set noise charges that are appropriate but, as ICAO guidance alreadystates that noise-related charges should be non-discriminatory between users and should not be established at such levels as to be prohibitively high for the operation of certain aircraft, we do not think it necessary to place these requirements in the legislation.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="06102572000006"></a>As I have already remarked, airports have been making use of the power to set noise-related charges for almost 25 years. We have no reason to believe that  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the powers have been applied inappropriately or disproportionately during this time. That is why we do not believe that this additional requirement needs to be added to Clause 1.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="06102572000007"></a>I cannot emphasise enough that charges are just one means by which airport operators can address the environmental effects of their operations on local people. The powers such as those in Clauses 3 and 4, which would enable airport operators to impose penalties for breaches of measures such as noise limits on departing aircraft or noise preferential routes, can effect more direct improvements for people living around airports.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="06102572000008"></a>I say again that should there ever appear to be a problem with a charging scheme, the Secretary of State will have the power to direct an airport operator as to the manner in which its charges are to be fixed. I hope that noble Lords can reach an accommodation on this clause, taking into account the thrust of Commons Amendment No. 4C in lieu. I think that it will be recognised that the Government have listened carefully to previous debates in this House. The House can rest assured that we have the necessary powers within the Bill to meet the challenges of airport noise and emissions. I beg to move.</p>

There are instances that I brought before the House in the early stages of the Bill. Bearing in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said just now, I should say that I know something about airports. I specifically visited the Birmingham area to be taken through the whole question of noise and pollution and how they are tracked there. I have been the director of an airport company. I may not have the knowledge that he does, but I am not speaking from a position of entire ignorance on the matter.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="06102572000013"></a>The airspace over Birmingham airport is partly shared with Coventry airport. Coventry is quite a big airport, but it does not have a noise and pollution regime, and that raises issues of competition. They are using the same airspace, so the issues about whatever international conventions there may be apply to both airports. One airport, in setting its charges and having lower standards of environment or safety, can decide whether an aircraft uses it or the next airport. We want a level playing field, so that airports are competing on the basis of efficiency and not on the basis of one airport having certain standards and another having lesser standards.</p>

There has been growing interest in this and, even as we debated the Bill over the past few months, the issue has been much more in the public eye.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="06102572000020"></a>I have some sympathy with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, but I am in the middle here. I totally agreed with the Minister that local circumstances were the most important consideration. I am very much a localist and do not like too much direction from us in this place about what happens in a local area.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="06102572000021"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, highlighted an example. I too have visited Birmingham airport, one of two airports that are close and of a considerable size in urban areas, and where there should be some alignment of practices. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on that. In spite of the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis&#151;I do not dispute what past Secretaries of State have done&#151;it would help us all if the Minister could categorically repeat what he has just said, so that it is put determinedly in <I>Hansard </I>that Secretaries of State would intervene and issue directions. I do not normally like them to direct too much, but here I would very much support that. If an airport was not complying with the sort of things that we would like, the Secretary of State should definitely intervene to try to put that right. If that was the case, I would not support the amendment.</p>

<a name="06102572000022"></a><b><a name="61025-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="06102572000047"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> My Lords, this has been an interesting debate and noble Lords opposite have raised the question of when the Secretary of State must do something and when he may do something. Coventry has been repeatedly mentioned by noble Lords. If someone complained about the noise at Coventry, who would that have to be for the Secretary of State to intervene? Coventry is an example of where a local authority owns an airport and, therefore, has a commercial interest in its success. That interest has everything to do with running lots of planes in and out of it, but has it anything to do with how noisy they are? That clearly matters to the residents, but we should consider whether that matters to the bean counters in the council.</p>

<a name="61025-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="06102572000023"></a>I would be interested to know under what circumstances a Secretary of State would take into account the views of residents affected. Many more airports than Coventry are affected, including Blackpool. How would the Secretary of State balance the interests of both parties before deciding whether he would look at the matter? That is the big worry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="06102572000024"></a>My noble friend mentioned the ICAO policy on airports that have noise problems, but who decides whether the airport is experiencing the problem or the residents around it? Words are all good and fine, but while there has to be a cut-off somewhere&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, mentions a figure of 500 in Amendment No. 4E&#151;many of us would feel much more comfortable if there was a requirement to take noise and other environmental considerations into

The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raised questions about the reasons that are advanced. That is a matter for procedures, both in this House and the other place. He has been involved in these exercises and it is not a question of each House spelling out exactly why it has reached a conclusion, otherwise we would have a document as long as the <I>Hansard</I> that covered the previous debate. What emerges from that short meeting held to convey reasons is a formula merely to indicate the broad area of dissent, discontent or unacceptability. That is all that this does. He is not advancing his cause by saying that he wants to take this position literally. The argument which is meant to be taken literally is the statement from this Dispatch Box that justifies the Government&#146;s position as we see it, which is what I am attempting to do.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="06102572000026"></a>The noble Lord mentioned Coventry and Birmingham, as did the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. Coventry airport featured in our previous debates. It is an airport of some significance and is close to Birmingham, another major airport. I draw the attention of the House to the planning agreement which exists between Coventry airport and its local planning authority, Warwickshire District Council, which includes a mitigation package. There are a range of noise-related measures in this agreement, such as a sound insulation grant scheme, a ban on night flying by the noisiest aircraft, a night-noise quota to ensure that night noise reduces, and a quiet operations policy that restricts the ways and times aircraft can operate. The airport also includes noise surcharges for louder aircraft in its conditions of use.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="06102572000027"></a>The airport reached this agreement and it now has a noise complaints procedure in place. The minutes of its sub-committee concerned with these issues are placed on the internet site, so that all local people are aware of the discussions which go on with regard to this issue and the way in which they can influence it. All these measures have been put in place using the existing powers available to the airport. There has been no compulsion; it is an agreement with the local authority. I certainly appeal to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, given his significant position with a leading authority in this country. I also appeal to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, who also has some experience of local government. Why should we impose from the centre when airports can satisfactorily reach agreement with their localities? That is all the Government are saying. Of course we have a reserve power.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="06102572000028"></a>I reassure the noble Lord that anyone can put forward proposals to have an airport designated for consideration by the Secretary of State. As we have said in our White Paper<I>,</I><I>The Future of Air Transport</I>,  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1229"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we will consider designating other airports beyond those already designated if there is evidence that a major noise problem is not being dealt with adequately through local controls. But Coventry is being dealt with adequately with local controls to local satisfaction. Why therefore should we insist that it must follow nationally imposed requirements when airports the size of the one at Coventry can solve this problem? There are many airports other than Coventry which are solving these problems on a regular basis and which would not welcome, and should not receive, the requirements designated from the centre that they must deal with this matter only in the way defined strictly in legislation.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="06102572000029"></a>I appeal to the House to recognise this. The Government are mindful that airports bring an enormous boon to our nation, in terms of both economic development and of course the great pleasure which tourists receive from being able to fly. We all know that the expansion of airports is a reflection of the expansion of the availability of flights to the benefit of our nation, but we also know that airports bring attendant problems&#151;noise and emissions&#151;and controls are necessary. What I want to establish today and want the noble Lord to recognise&#151;I hope that he will therefore withdraw his amendment&#151;is that the other place carefully considered the views of this House on these matters. It has put forward an amendment which strengthens the Secretary of State&#146;s position in taking local factors into consideration. If the Secretary of State decides to act, he has the power to do so, but the best solution is to have permissive legislation so that the main responsibility for airports meeting their requirements lies with the operators of those airports, taking into account the local communities which they serve.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="06102571000133"></a>I am sure that, by now, the House will be aware that Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 enables the Secretary of State to take steps to limit or mitigate the effects of noise and vibration connected with the taking off or landing of aircraft at designated airports. He is not required to set any operating restrictions at night or at any other time but, if restrictions are set, they must be in the form of a numerical limit on movements by aircraft of the types that it is intended to restrict.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="06102571000134"></a>In our White Paper, <I>The Future of Air Transport</I>, which followed extensive consultation on our longstanding aircraft noise powers, we said that we would amend the 1982 Act so that operating restrictions might in future be set on a different basis&#151;for example, one more directly related to the noise nuisance caused. Subsections (2) to (4) of the clause as originally drafted would have allowed a future Secretary of State to impose restrictions that limited cumulative amounts of noise caused by an aircraft using a designated airport. The provisions would not have prevented movement limits being set but Ministers could have chosen to set alternative restrictions&#151;for example, noise quotas or a limiting noise contour area. Those might have provided a more effective incentive for the use of quieter aircraft. </p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="06102571000135"></a>In bringing forward these provisions, it was never our intention to prevent future Governments setting stringent controls on night flying at these airports. We have not sought to relax the restrictions. Any suggestion that we have should be considered in the context of our announcement on 6 June this year on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. That announcement did not provide for any slackening of current limits; it tightened a number of controls, and that demonstrates our commitment to the effective management of noise impacts.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="06102571000136"></a>The restrictions regime which comes into effect on 29 October&#151;this coming weekend&#151;will run until October 2012. It has been set using the current legislative framework; that is, the Secretary of State&#146;s powers under Section 78 of the 1982 Act. Nor would we seek to interrupt that regime before 2012 to impose different forms of restriction. Night flying restrictions are put in place for a number of years to allow the industry to plan fleets and scheduling, and to give local stakeholders some certainty. Interrupting a regime would not be sensible or constructive. The value of movement limits to residents round the designated airports and the sense of certainty they are given is clear. Moreover, movement limits would have been a fundamental part of the next night flying regime, regardless of whether the Bill received Royal Assent before the new restrictions were set.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1231"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61025-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="06102571000137"></a>There have been advances in technology since the 1982 Act was passed, and a movements limit alone would be a pretty blunt instrument as that would not directly influence the types of aircraft used at night or control the amount of noise permitted. That is why noise quotas are set alongside the movement limits at present, as a secondary control to drive the use of the quietest aircraft available.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="06102571000138"></a>I am disappointed that the Government&#146;s arguments in favour of amending the Act were not accepted. However, in the interests of moving forward with the many other worthwhile provisions in the Bill, the other place has now proposed an amendment that would remove subsections (2) to (4) of the clause as originally drafted. This means that the relevant provisions of the 1982 Act will, as at present, say unambiguously that any future restrictions will have to be set by limiting the number of aircraft movements as they are now.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="06102571000139"></a>By tabling the amendment, we accept that this is not the right time to make a change to the legislation. However, the Government still think that there would be merit in giving the Secretary of State a more flexible power to set such restrictions. That would be possible only if a new legislative opportunity arose. As yet, no such opportunity is apparent. I am therefore clearly signalling to the House that we have nothing in the offing in that respect. The Government seek to continue a balanced approach to controlling and mitigating the noise impacts of night flying at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="06102571000140"></a>We have now delivered our commitment to maintain strict controls on night flying and to set those controls by limiting both aircraft movements and noise quota until at least 2012, as stated in the decision announced on 6 June. We remain of the view that it would be sensible for the Secretary of State to have more flexible powers to control aircraft noise at designated airports but accept that this Bill is not the vehicle for that. Accordingly, I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful that the Government have accepted that this legislation should not be used to change the current regime.

He said that the matter of altering the Secretary of State's power will have to await another legislative opportunity. I assume that he is referring to primary legislation and that we will not have an order brought before the House which is unamendable so that at a future date we are not going to be able to amend what the Secretary of State is doing.</p>

I beg the Minister to take this matter seriously. I recall our debate on the White Paper on airports policy a couple of years ago. Two questions were raised which worried me very much at the time and continue to worry me. First, in considering the possible expansion of Stansted, the Government&#146;s document made no reference to the fact that the southern boundary of Stansted Airport was the northern boundary of a unique forest in southern England which is regarded by dendrologists as a matter of great importance. It is astonishing that the department responsible for environmental matters did not even refer to that.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="06102571000147"></a>The second issue is the possibility of creating a new airport in Sheppey. There was also a short page on that, and it relied exclusively on the danger that an airport there would pose to migrating birds. The paper did not examine the issue properly or reveal that it would be perfectly possible to move the bird sanctuary created by the RSPB a few miles further to the east, thus making it possible to consider a new airport serving London which would be approachable over sea any time of the day or night, open 24 hours a day and very close to the Channel Tunnel link.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has shown extraordinary restraint this afternoon in a self-denying ordinance and I intend to follow him. The idea that I might protract these proceedings by a widespread debate on Stansted, or even on Sheppey for that matter, fills me with obvious horror. The noble Lord will recognise that we are at the last stages of this Bill, so I will resist that temptation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="06102571000150"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, for recognising that the Government, with the proposals which now come from the other place, are meeting the arguments presented previously with some force in the House. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, must accept that I cannot bind a future Government. He will recognise that there will be another Government before 2012 by another Administration of whatever colour, though I will almost certainly be the one answering on these matters at this Dispatch Box in 2011. The House will, however, recognise that I cannot possibly commit beyond a certain period except to say that in this afternoon&#146;s statement I am reflecting the announcement that the present restrictions will obtain until 2012. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges,will recognise that that position would not be eroded under any changes that Parliament would make to the legislation. That is the best that I can offer and I hope that the noble Lord will accept it in the spirit in which it is given. I commend the Motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="06102583000007"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, made to Clause 3(2) in the other place, provide that redress will now ordinarily also include the giving of a report on the action that has been, or will be, taken at local level to prevent similar cases arising. During the debate in both this House and another place, the point has been  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1234"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well made that patients harmed during their NHS healthcare often say that they do not want that to happen to anyone else.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="06102583000008"></a>There will be occasions where mistakes can simply be ascribed to genuine human error or where no procedural changes need to be made, and there a report of that type will not be appropriate. In these specific types of circumstances, the scheme may provide that a report will not be necessary. Ordinarily, though, such a report will now be provided.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="06102583000009"></a>Amendment No. 6, agreed in the other place, requires the scheme to provide for the findings of an investigation to be recorded in a report, which is to be made available on their request to the individual seeking redress. To reduce unnecessary bureaucracy for scheme members, we do not wish to impose an extra burden on them to provide the investigation report in every case. In some cases, an explanation may be adequate, but these amendments now ensure that, ordinarily, the investigation report will be provided if requested.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="06102583000010"></a>The amendments enable the scheme to provide that the report need not be provided before an offer is made or before proceedings are terminated, which is also intended to reduce the administrative burden on scheme members. It is envisaged that when the offer of redress is made an investigation report will be sent to the individual, where they want a copy of it. That will give them a complete set of documentation, which they can then consider with their legal adviser when the offer under the scheme is being assessed.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="06102583000011"></a>The amendments also enable the scheme to specify other circumstances where the reports need not be provided. That is intended to be used for rare cases where, for example, the person seeking redress is not the patient and it is considered appropriate to withhold certain confidential health information. I wish to provide reassurance that any exceptions will be the subject of full consultation.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="06102583000012"></a>I hope that the amendments made in the other place will satisfy noble Lords that we fully intendthe investigative process to be transparent. The investigation report will not be kept back on grounds that it is privileged, nor will it be claimed that investigation reports are &#147;without prejudice&#148; and inadmissible in any subsequent legal action.</p>

<a name="61025-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="06102583000013"></a>Regarding Amendments Nos. 11, 14 and 15, it has been the Government&#146;s intention to require a member of the redress scheme to prepare and publish an annual report about cases falling under the scheme and the lessons to be learnt from them. However, Clause 10(2)(i) provided that a scheme may require a member of it to prepare and publish an annual report about such cases and their lessons. These amendments are a response to the discussions that have taken place in both this House and another place. They place on the face of the Bill a requirement on scheme members to publish an annual report. The &#147;may&#148; has been replaced by &#147;must&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="06102583000014"></a>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are minor drafting amendments and clarify existing policy. Amendment No. 12 leaves out the words &#147;a specified person&#148; in Clause 10(2)(h) and replaces it with the words,</p>

<p><a name="06102583000065"></a>The amendment makes clearer the intention that the scheme may require a member to give an individual of a specified description responsibility for overseeing the scheme. The provision will enable the schemeto specify qualifications and experience, to be determined after consultation with stakeholders, that such an individual must possess to undertake the role. </p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="06102583000015"></a>Amendment No. 13 splits Clause 10(2)(h) to avoid any implication that only a person who has given responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of functions can be given responsibility for advising on lessons to be learnt. As we draw up the secondary legislation, we may wish to enable bodies to appoint two different types of people to carry out the two functions. For that reason, it again seems preferable to retain flexibility by splitting up the function. I commend the amendments.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="06102583000018"></a>Amendment No. 3 is a drafting amendment consequential on Amendment No. 6, which we discussed in the last group and Amendment No. 7 is a consequential drafting amendment to Amendment No. 10, to which we shall come later. It may be convenient for the House if I explain the legal advice that I have received on Amendments Nos. 3A, 3B, 7A and 7B.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="06102583000019"></a>I understand that the amendments question the drafting of Clauses 6(1) and 8(1). The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has written to me about this. I know that he is concerned that the wording of Clauses 6(1) and 8(1) could give rise to ambiguity or incoherence. I have consulted my legal advisers&#151;we have been back to parliamentary counsel on this&#151;and I am satisfied that there is no realistic risk of that. I hope that I can provide some reassurance. This will be rather technical, but it is important that we put this on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="06102583000020"></a>The general powers in Clause 6(1) are intentionally subject to the duties imposed by Clauses 6(2A) to (4).  Clause 6(1) appears to give the Secretary of State an unfettered discretion, but that discretion is in fact fettered by subsections (2A) to (4).  In the context of the clause, we think that it is helpful to flag up the fact that the discretion conferred by subsection (1) is not as wide as it might at first appear. </p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="06102583000021"></a>Amendment No. 3B does not assist the reader of the Bill, as his attention is no longer helpfully drawn to the fact that the Secretary of State&#146;s power is qualified. Furthermore, Amendment No. 3B causes ambiguity and confusion as the reader&#146;s attention is now drawn to subsection (2B). Yet subsection (2B) merely confers another power. The reader&#146;s attention is therefore drawn to another power. The power in subsection (2B) is linked to the duty in subsection (2A), but the reader&#146;s attention is not drawn to subsection (2A).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="06102583000022"></a>As I said, I have taken legal advice, including that of parliamentary counsel, and do not accept that there is, or could be, any realistic risk of ambiguity regarding the drafting of Clause 6(1). The Commons amendment to Clause 6(1) is properly drafted, according to the legal advice that I have been given. It helpfully draws the reader&#146;s attention to the fact that the power conferred by subsection (1) is subject to the duties imposed by subsections (2A) to (4).</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="06102583000023"></a>On Amendment No. 7, the general powers in Clause 8(1) are intentionally subject to the duties imposed by Clauses 8(2) to (4). Clause 8(1) appears to give the Secretary of State a discretion, but this discretion is in fact fettered by subsections (2) and (4) of that clause. In the context of the clause, we again think that it is helpful to flag up the fact that the discretion conferred by subsection (1) is not as wide as it might at first appear. Amendment No. 7B, again, would no longer helpfully draw the attention of the reader of the Bill to the fact that the Secretary of State&#146;s power under Clause 8(1) is qualified. For these legal reasons, I encourage noble Lords not to pursue Amendments Nos. 3A, 3B, 7A and 7B and to accept Commons Amendments Nos. 3 and 7.</p>

As he knows, one of the issues that I flagged up was that a court, if we are to judge by case law, could interpret the word &#147;may&#148; as &#147;shall&#148;, because the power conveyed by the word &#147;may&#148; is fettered in the way that the Minister acknowledged.

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="06102583000034"></a>When the Bill was last in this House, it was amended to require the Secretary of State for Health to make provision for the appointment of patient-redress investigators. There was to be a panel of independent investigators, and the Healthcare Commission was to maintain a list of those investigators and oversee them. The independent investigation was to be confined to fact finding, and the scheme authority was to have no role whatever in investigations. It could not even provide advice or guidance to scheme members. To refresh the memories of noble Lords, the amendments were passed here by the narrowest of margins&#151;one vote&#151;and were comprehensively rejected in the other place by 95 votes.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="06102583000035"></a>When the Bill went to Report in the other place, there was no attempt to reinstate references to patient-redress investigators or the Healthcare Commission. I believe this to have been an appropriate response. The model passed in this House suffered from excessive cost and impracticality. On that occasion, I mentioned that Department of Health economists estimated that the cost would be &#163;41 million a year.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="06102583000036"></a>We are now presented with a group of amendments that would enable the scheme to provide for independent oversight of investigation, with the person overseeing the investigation required to be independent of the scheme member in question and the body or person being investigated. I suggest that this is an attempt to reintroduce the concept, firmly rejected in the other place, of independent oversight of the initial investigation. This again raises many unanswered questions, the obvious ones being: who is to provide the independent oversight; how will these people be chosen, and by whom; what qualifications are they to have; to whom, if anyone, will they be answerable; how and by whom is administrative support and accommodation to be provided; and what if the member carrying out the investigation and the independent overseer do not agree about the investigation report?</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="06102583000037"></a>In Committee in the other place we were toldthat there would be the same administration, but operating under the direction of an independent person, so that there would be no new bureaucracy. This seems to imply that the investigation will merely be checked by an independent person but from the wording of the amendment before us, I do not know how we can be sure of that. It seems strange to be introducing at this stage in the Bill an un-thought-out set of proposals that is uncosted and which must make the whole scheme more bureaucratic and difficult to explain to patients.</p>

Should the investigation not be carried out properly, the Bill has in place a complaints system, ultimately to the ombudsman, who is of course fully independent of the NHS and the Government and who may be used if a patienthas a complaint about maladministration in an investigation which has fallen below the standard expected. Ann Abraham, the Health Service Commissioner, has welcomed the fact that the operation of the scheme will fall clearly within her jurisdiction subject to the usual conditions set out in the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="06102583000073"></a>&#147;I hope the fact that an independent review of complaints about the scheme will be available will give reassurance to both complainants and the NHS bodies involved&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06102583000066"></a>It certainly gives reassurance to the Government.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="06102583000039"></a>The Bill also takes powers that will enable the scheme to have other elements of independence. There may, where appropriate, be independent medical advice and evidence, and free independent legal advice that must be provided to people to whom an offer of redress is made. We have existing powers in Clause 10(2)(a) which will enable the scheme to require its members to charge an individual of a specified description with the responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of specified functions. This enables the scheme itself to provide that the person must oversee the investigation at the local level and have particular qualifications and/or experience. We envisage that the person given the task of overseeing the carrying out of investigations will ensure that appropriate information is properly collected and provided to the scheme authority. This will provide an additional check on the standard of investigation.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="06102583000040"></a>Finally, responding to concerns expressed by noble Lords about the need for an independent check on performance in the operation of the redress scheme, we intend that consideration of the effectiveness of the operation of the NHS redress scheme, including investigations carried out under the scheme, will be included as part of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual review of the provision of healthcare by and for NHS bodies. The intention is that the Secretary of State would include a new standard relating to redress and that the Healthcare Commission would include new criteria against which the operation of the scheme would be reviewed. This role can be taken on by the Healthcare Commission without the need for any amendment to its existing powers. Because I know of the concerns about independence, I have gone through this to demonstrate the wide provision in the Bill for independent elements at the various stages.</p>

<p><a name="06102583000067"></a>That is absolutely right, but the rules of natural justice are rules of procedure.

If decisions are being taken which determine a person&#146;s civil rights and obligations, then the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights must be met. There must be a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. We accept that.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="06102583000042"></a>However, the redress scheme will not involve any determination of civil rights and obligations. An offer may be made to a complainant, but it is only an offer. No rights will be determined when cases are investigated under the scheme in an effort to resolve disputes without having to go to court. It is standard practice for potential defendants to investigate, to try to discover what happened, and, if appropriate, to try to resolve matters without legal proceedings. Neither the rules of natural justice nor the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights require an independent investigation procedure to be established under the redress scheme. We have gone into this with a great deal of care, and this is the established legal advice in this particular area. There is no question of the NHS or the NHS Litigation Authority acting as judge in these cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="06102583000043"></a>I fear that some of the objections in this area lose sight of the purpose behind this Bill: to provide patients with the speedy resolution of low-value monetary claims without the need to go to court. We do not intend to set up a second independent judicial process or to duplicate the existing court systems. Throughout this Bill, we have argued that where a mistake is made, it is right that the scheme member promptly investigates the case, where appropriate makes an offer to resolve it, and learns from the mistake. If we remove or in some way fetter that responsibility, we damage the integrity of the scheme.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="06102583000044"></a>I must stress that the proposals put forward in this amendment are bound to lead to considerable additional bureaucracy, and they must lead to some costs&#151;we do not know at the moment what those costs would be. It would mean there was no single body with overall responsibility to ensure consistency of approach, cost-effectiveness and good standards. If investigations are to be independent, it is hard to see how a separate bureaucracy is to be avoided, even where the role is limited to oversight. This is why we believe we should accept the Commons amendments, and not pursue the ideas and proposals in the amendments to them.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="06102583000047"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 4A and shall also speak to Amendment No. 5A and Amendment No. 16A. I have listened carefully to the Minister and thank him for his full remarks. I would be the first to acknowledge that we have come a long way during the course of this Bill. There are a number of amendments incorporated into it as well as undertakings given by the Government that are positive and welcome. Yet it is with disappointment as well as a sense of genuine puzzlement that we on these Benches view the Government&#146;s resistance to the single most important concept which we have sought to introduce into the Bill and into the scheme&#151;independent oversight.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="06102583000048"></a>We genuinely want this scheme to work. I am not in the business of making life difficult for the Government just for the sake of it. We all know and all agree that there needs to be a workable alternative to civil litigation for patients who feel aggrieved about treatment they have received from the NHS. One of the main ingredients of a workable alternative is that it has to be credible. It has to command confidence. Patients have to believe that it will produce a fair result. What have we got? We have a scheme that will see a patient&#146;s application for redress disappear into a closed process, one that is the very opposite of transparent. The patient has no idea whether the facts of his case have been looked at fairly or fully.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="06102583000049"></a>Additionally, we have, examining the claims and acting as the scheme authority, a body that is a part of the NHS itself. The NHSLA is not, in a true sense, independent of the interests of the trust whose actions it will be examining. Why is it not? Because one of the main functions of the NHSLA at present&#151;a function which it fulfils with considerable success&#151;is to defend the health service against claims made against it. That is essentially its current role. It is there not to take the patient&#146;s part but to act on behalf of the NHS. How can patients regard the NHSLA, for all its in-house expertise, as having the necessary degree of objectivity and independence to do what is fair and right? They surely cannot. That is why we have sought at an earlier stage, with the approval of the House, to introduce amendments designed to import into the process that vital element of independence.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="06102583000050"></a>It is important to emphasise one thing here: independent oversight is needed at the initial stage of the process when the facts are being assembled. It is not necessary or appropriate thereafter. I am not suggesting that there should be independent oversight of the NHSLA when it comes to consider issues of fault and liability&#151;it will consider those issues and make an offer of compensation at the end or not as the case may be; the patient can take the offer or leave it&#151;but unless the patient is confident that the factual basis on which his claim has been considered is accurate and fair, it is very difficult to see how the scheme will command his confidence.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="06102583000051"></a>There are all kinds of ways in which this element of independence could be imported. At Report stage I proposed that there should be a panel of independent redress investigators, who would act rather as a  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1241"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>coroner does when conducting an inquest. I am not bringing that idea back because the Government have told us repeatedly that it would be too expensive. In these amendments I am asking the Government to accept the principle of independent oversight of the fact-finding part of the process. I am not being prescriptive about how this should be achieved&#151;after all, this is largely a skeleton Bill; a great deal will be left to regulations&#151;but, as one idea, I would propose that where the actions of a particular trust were the subject of a redress claim, a non-executive director of a different trust could be brought in to provide the necessary element of independent scrutiny and oversight. The cost of such an arrangement should not be a factor. Indeed, it should be no greater than the cost of the Government&#146;s proposals. Someone has to be responsible for ensuring that the trust assembles the facts of a case fairly and fully. Instead of it being someone within the trust itself, I am saying that it might be someone from another trust. The cost implications are surely <I>de minimis</I>.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="06102583000052"></a>My amendments preserve the concept of independence, to be fleshed out in regulations, and they also preserve the necessary accompaniment to independence&#151;the separation of fact-finding from fault-finding. The scheme itself covers both elements but the wording is designed to make clear that there are two separate processes&#151;fact-finding and fault-finding&#151;under the aegis of the trust and the NHSLA respectively.</p>

<a name="61025-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="06102583000053"></a>In another place, the Minister, Andy Burnham, conceded that the scheme would have to comprise <I>de facto</I> a two-stage process. I suggest, therefore, as regards this point, that there is not much separating the Minister and me. Indeed, one has only to look at Section 2 of the Inquiries Act to see that the separation of fact-finding and fault-finding is one that the Government accept as a way of achieving a ready separation between what is privileged and what is not privileged and as being conducive to achieving natural justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="06102583000054"></a>Natural justice is what these amendments seek to achieve. I note that the Minister argues that this concern is out of place in the context of the redress scheme. I am sorry to hear him say that, because I disagree. It really is a question of patient confidence in the scheme. It is, I suggest, a nicety to point out that this is not a judicial process. Of course we agree that it is not a judicial process, but the patient will want fairness. I very much hope that the Minister can take these points on board and I look forward to hearing what other noble Lords have to say. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="06102590000022"></a> My Lords, I hesitate to intervene in this debate, since health matters are generally considered to be outwith the remit of Scottish Members. However, the issues of redress, and

I do not know how we will get that confidence. In all the cases I have dealt with in my years as a Member in the other place&#151;and in some personal experiences, which I have related to this House before and will not repeat, as the issue is now resolved&#151;generally speaking, people who do not have confidence in the system will never accept a decision that goes against them. That is the nub of the problem.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61025-0007.htm"/>


<a name="61025-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="06102583000056"></a>I honestly do not know how one can get independence in the health service. The noble Earl suggests that someone from a different trust could be brought in. If my memory serves me correctly, this often happens with police authorities: a chief constable from one authority is brought in to oversee, or look at the problems in, another authority. What is the cry? &#147;You cannot trust the police to investigate themselves.&#148; I suggest that exactly the same thing would happen in this case. It is quite wrong to sow the seeds of the suspicion that the medical profession cannot investigate itself. For my sins, I sat as a lay member of the General Medical Council on its old disciplinary committee. I was constantly told that, although I was a lay member and independent, I could not be trusted because, not being a medic, I would automatically accept the views of the medical profession. All I say in this debate is that we have come a long way with this Bill. I wish we could achieve an absolute guarantee of transparency, of fairness, and that in every case the right result would be achieved. What we can hope for from this Bill is that the progress made will lead to more satisfaction, less delay and better care of the patient.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="06102583000057"></a> My Lords, I was a strong supporter of this Bill at Second Reading. It is fundamentally worthwhile to get early resolution of these cases, keeping down legal fees and the frustration of patients. I have administered complaints systems in the NHS for the past 15 years or so. The problem has always been that when local resolution fails in-house, and goes on to the next stage of the convenor system, it is perceived by patients to be partisan. As one patient&#146;s relative said to me: &#147;You think you are appealing to an independent person, and you get an answer on the headed notepaper of the organisation you are complaining about&#148;. The system thereby encourages people to seek independent legal advice. Unless we have, in here, the principle that the fact-finding, at least, should be independent, we will not encourage patients to accept the fact-finders&#146; reports., We should remember that fact-finding is usually the most disputed part of the case.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="06102583000058"></a>I know the Minister is concerned about the costs, but we do not yet have regulations worked out. There is everything to play for in the practical implementation of the scheme. We know that it is possible to set up panels of people from the local community to do a number of jobs around the NHS, very professionally, with the right support and training, without incurring costs. For example, people who serve on research ethics committees have to do  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very complex work for which they do not get a great deal of financial reward. They do it because the work is interesting.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="06102583000059"></a>It can easily be worked out how these schemes could be administered so that there was an independent fact-finding element. We have heard of one possibility which I believe would be quite practical. In any case, fact finders will require training, and that will cost, whether it is done in-house or out of house. It is a detailed job that needs a lot of professional work, but it does not have to be expensive.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="06102583000060"></a>This issue could be delegated to regulations but having an independent fact finder is such a fundamental principle of an effective complaints system that it should be in the Bill. It would add immeasurably to the confidence that patients have in the scheme, which is why I have added my name to Amendment No. 4A.</p>

<a name="06102583000061"></a><b><a name="61025-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06102583000088"></a>Baroness Neuberger:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the things he has said that have given us a degree of comfort. I speak on this amendment again, in sadness more than anger. This has been a long-running saga, as the Minister indicated, and I pay tribute to him for accepting that some level of independent oversight of the NHS redress scheme is necessary. He stated in terms back in February that the Healthcare Commission would make looking at how the scheme works part of its annual review,and he has repeated that today. The Healthcare Commission is regarded as independent, and that is good news. But as my noble friend Lady Barker said in further consideration of the Bill, and as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said from the Conservative Benches in previous debates, this is still not enough. We accept that both sides can instruct an independent medical expert, but even that is not adequate when there is no clear fact-finding separate from the fault-finding.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="06102583000062"></a>The Minister will forgive me if I go back to an earlier time in my life, when I was part of the advisory group that worked up the previous complaints system. We all, in good faith, believed that an in-house complaints investigation system could work. He will also know, because this will have landed on his desk now and in his previous incarnations, that we were wrong. As an NHS chairman, like the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, I chaired a community health service NHS trust and had to sign off the letters responding to complaints. Very often, I felt that the trust had investigated itself fairly. Sometimes I did not. Either way, it was equally clear that the punters outside&#151;the patients and their families&#151;were dissatisfied because no one outside had had a proper look.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="06102583000063"></a>I know the Minister will tell us that this would add hugely to the costs; he has already done so. Let me put it to him like this: whether investigation is done internally or externally, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, has already said, someone has to be paid to do it. They also have to be trained and their activities monitored. Irrespective of being inside or outside the trust concerned, that is the case. If, for instance, non-executive board members from neighbouring  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1244"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trusts were to carry out and supervise the fact-finding, I cannot see why that would be more expensive than the board members or the employees of the trust itself doing so.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="06102583000064"></a>Why does the Minister think that it would cost so much more when the amount of time spent on investigating complaints by the trust&#146;s own staff is also considerable? It does not make sense to me. What does, however, make sense is that patients and their families have little faith in a wholly internal system of investigation of complaints. We were wrong when we thought they would have confidence, and we need to recognise that for what it is&#151;a fact. Given that, surely the Minister can see some way to allow fact-finding before any assessment of fault, independent of the trust concerned. Surely he can see that it would be perceived as fairer by the patients and their families to go down that route.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="06102590000002"></a>Given that the scheme authority is to be the NHS Litigation Authority&#151;we all feel that it has a clear role to play here&#151;it might be thought that a wholly internal investigation conducted by a trust, although at a distance under the NHSLA&#146;s auspices, could amount to a conflict of interest. The NHSLA, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has already said, has legitimately to try and keep the lid on compensation payouts to the public. Many of us would say it was quite right that it should do so. That means, however, that it does not necessarily have the interests of individual patients close to its heart. However, if the NHSLA is the body that makes the offer but the investigation that went on before had an independent element within it, people might trust the system more. The non-exec route is one possibility, while groups like the people who serve on research ethics committees are another. That is still to be debated, and regulations are still to be written. The system might not then be seen to be unfair, with a trust likely&#151;in people&#146;s minds, at least&#151;to exonerate itself, and a scheme authority wanting to keep the payouts low.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="06102590000003"></a>The advantage of independent oversight of fact-finding also goes to the heart of the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s original intention in <I>Making Amends</I>. He wanted to see the National Health Service become a learning organisation. If fact-finding is independent but it is people within the broader NHS family, such as those who serve on research ethics committees and other non-execs from neighbouring organisations, who discuss the matters with those they are investigating, there does not need to be an automatic blame culture. Things go wrong and mistakes happen, but they can be discussed within the organisationwith sympathetic but outside supervision of the investigation before the fault-finding even begins.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="06102590000004"></a>In his consultation paper on the governance of doctors, <I>Good doctors, safer patients</I>, published last July, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, put forward a two-stage scheme for investigating doctors. I quote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="06102590000089"></a>&#147;In serious fitness to practice cases ... investigation ... should be carried out by the General Medical Council but formal adjudication should be undertaken by a separate and independent tribunal&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1245"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="06102590000083"></a>That was clearly in reference to serious cases, but earlier in the same report he had argued that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="06102590000090"></a>&#147;As the complexity of both medicine and the system within which it is delivered increases, the General Medical Council cannot reasonably be expected to fulfil the roles of complaint recipient, processor, investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury. Involvement of a single organisation in all of these processes brings with it difficulties that are philosophical, presentational and practical&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06102590000084"></a>I could not have put it better myself. What Sir Liam wrote may apply to medical regulation, but the principle applies to any scheme where one authority is to be in charge of both the investigation and the redress, hence our continued demand for an independent element in fact-finding and our desire for it to be seen as being separate from fault-finding. That is why we are back here at this stage, making the point yet again.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="06102590000005"></a>The Government have accepted that this is a two-stage process. We know the scheme is relatively inexpensive; we all recognise and applaud that. Indeed, when we were originally told of the Bill&#146;s arrival, we were all delighted. Such an attempt to help in cases of clinical negligence is long overdue. If it is to work, however, it has to have certain elements: independence&#151;we have been arguing for it each time we have come back to this subject&#151;sufficient for patients to trust the fact-finding involved, and it has to carry trust more generally.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="06102590000006"></a>We are not alone. Just to make the point even clearer, the chairman of the Bar Council has written to me on the subject this very week. The very distinguished noble Lord, Lord Patel, who expresses his regret that he cannot be here, has written to me saying how strongly he supports the desire to have independence here. InterResolve has written about it. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes of Woodside, has made the point.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="06102590000007"></a>It gives us no pleasure on these Benches to keep pressing for a reasonable level of independence in the scheme, and it gives me no pleasure to say that the NHS Litigation Authority on its own will not be seen as independent as the scheme authority without an independent element in fact-finding. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s oversight and the responsibility of Ann Abraham as the ombudsman give us some comfort, but that is not yet enough. I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting that this amendment and those that go with it are intended to bring some public trust to this scheme, and that he will recognise that it is not that expensive. The costs do not need to be huge, as the investigation has to happen anyway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="06102590000008"></a>We all want to see a good, solid, trusted NHS redress scheme. I hope the Minister will give us the assurance that we can have some real independence in the fact-finding in this process.</p>

I listened most carefully to what the Minister said. I am bound to say that I am still just as puzzled as I was at the beginning because none of the points that he made alters those facts. A decision made by people who are biased will be rejected by those on whom that decision must rest. The Minister says that they can always go to the ombudsman, but is that the best way to look at it? Do we say that our courts need not have unbiased judges and unbiased juries because the matter can always be taken further? Surely not.

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="06102590000010"></a>The Minister pleaded the case that the cost would be too high. Is it too expensive to have justice? Is it too expensive to ensure that decisions made in this land of ours are reached fairly and justly? I think not. I have argued for years that natural justice is not served when suspended hospital doctors are judged by those who suspended them. No judge in any court would have his judgment accepted if he were known to be very much on the side of those to whom he awarded a favourable verdict. Even the chairman of the most modest and humble committee is expected to be impartial. Surely investigation must be not only open and conducted solely on facts but clearly seen to be exactly that. Do the Government not recognise that deep resentment will be caused in doctors and patients if this un-British amendment of the other place goes through? Is the Minister impressed&#151;I hope that he is&#151;by the fact that noble Lords on all sides of this House are begging him to accept that we need to have a just conclusion to these matters?</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="06102590000011"></a>Is the Minister not moved by the fact that many people outside this place have written to us about this matter, as the noble Baroness has just pointed out? I have received letters and I have no doubt that other Members of this House have received them as well. I felt so strongly about this that I was determined to make a small speech. It is such a basic point of justice that I could not keep silent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="06102590000014"></a>In my opening remarks I mentioned the number of elements in this scheme which have a fair degree of independence. I mentioned independent legal advice and independent medical advice. There are provisions in the Bill that you can make requirements on the experience and qualifications of the investigator. There is the ombudsman waiting in the wings for complaints. There is the Healthcare Commission, which I think everyone will agree is very independent, and it is overseeing the functioning of the scheme.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1247"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposal from this House, which was passed by one vote, that there should be a panel&#151;I am not making this up; this is what was passed&#151;of patient redress investigators. It has rejected that idea of a panel of independent investigators. We are now coming back, as far as I can judge from the amendments, to a panel of independent overseers. Some would cynically say, &#147;What&#146;s in a name?&#148;. Let me explore what the overseer does. I am not altogether clear on it. Does he or she sit on the shoulder of the investigator? How far do they follow through the investigation? Are they a duplicate investigator? Is that what this House is providing in the Bill? That provision was rejected by the other House.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="06102590000016"></a>I have not heard any answers in any of the speeches that have been made to the questions that I raised about this proposal in my opening remarks, yet people want to place this in the Bill. I am going to repeat those questions, because they are relevant. What if the member carrying out the investigation and the independent overseer do not agree about the investigation report? That is not fanciful; that is quite possible. Who resolves that conflict? Who provides support to the overseer? Does the overseer just come along and decide whether they like the look of the draft report at the end of the process? Do they track the quality of the investigation by the investigator? How do they monitor and carry out their oversight arrangements? Those are the practical things that would determine whether the scheme works well.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="06102590000017"></a>The scheme has been introduced at the very last knockings of the Bill without any explanation of how it would work. If the Government come along and have a go at making a general provision, rightly we are interrogated in Committee about the details of those schemes. Here are the opposition Benches coming along and trying to put in the Bill a set of proposals that have not previously been discussed, for which they can give no explanation of how they would work or how much they would cost. I am charged with exaggerating the costs; I do not know what the costs are. I cannot see how it would work in a very clear way if we do not know exactly what the overseer would do or how much detail they would have to give to the investigation.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="06102590000018"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, said that it is said that patients will have no idea whether their claim has been investigated fairly. However, the Government have tabled an amendment to explicitly require the redress scheme ordinarily to provide an investigation report to be prepared and provided to the individual. That is a new approach. The individual sees that investigation of the facts, and they are then in a position to challenge that report if they think it is unfair, using legal advice and independent medical advice. We have put things very clearly in the Bill that support the independence of the investigation and will ensure that patients are properly supported. We have learnt from the past; we have introduced changes here that make it much more likely that patients will get a fair shout on this issue. I come back to the point that we really do have to know how an overseer system would work, because it looks remarkably to me like the panel of investigators by another name, which was rejected by 95 votes in the other place.</p>

He acknowledged it obliquely by listing those elements of the scheme that will provide a measure of independence. Yes, we can assume that the legal and medical advice received by a complainant will be independent. The ombudsman is clearly independent, as is the Healthcare Commission, but my concern is that patients look at the scheme and see a closed process that is not transparent as it deliberates.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="06102590000020"></a>A report will be produced at the other end, but you cannot see that report at the outset. I do not wish to accuse the Minister of disingenuousness, but that is the word that springs to mind when he protests that we have not fleshed out how independence would be imported into the scheme. The Government have not fleshed out many of the details of the Bill; it is a skeleton Bill and we have had extensive debate on many aspects of it, but much needs to be fleshed out in regulation.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="06102590000021"></a>I have outlined one way in which the element of independent oversight could be imported; that is to say that the person charged with responsibility to deliver a full and fair investigation of the facts should come from outside the trust being investigated. That is not a complicated proposal. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, helpfully drew our attention to a parallel from the police service. That is exactly right. It is not an unworkable system&#151;</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="06102590000024"></a>The Minister listed a raft of practical difficulties in this matter and pointed out that I had not made clear how, for example, a conflict of views would be resolved, how the independent overseer could be supported and so on. Those are not complicated questions to resolve and are certainly not beyond the wit of all of us, with good will, to sort out between now and a further day when the Bill could return to this House, should I decide to divide it.</p>

<a name="61025-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="06102590000025"></a>This is an issue of principle. As the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, indicated, the concern is not confined to this Chamber or even to Parliament; it extends much more widely than that. The need for an element of independence in the scheme, in whatever form, is an issue of principle. Because I want the scheme to work well, we owe it to ourselves to ask the Government and the other place to have one further look at this issue.</p>

During debate in another place, the point was rightly made by representatives of the Benches opposite in relation to Clause 8(1)(a) that it is vital for a legal adviser to know to whom he is providing advice. It was suggested that clarification was required to make it clear whether the legal advice was to be provided to the person seeking redress or to the scheme. These amendments make it clear that legal advice without charge may be provided to individuals seeking redress under the scheme.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="06102595000018"></a>I turn to Commons Amendment No. 10. Clause 8(1)(b) enables the redress scheme to provide for the services of medical experts. In the statement of policy, published in November 2005, we made it clear that, where evidence from an independent medical expert is necessary, the scheme authority will seek to ascertain the wishes of the patient to reach agreement on an acceptable person. The amendment makes it clear that, where the services of medical experts are provided under the scheme, the medical expert will be an agreed independent expert. The services of that expert will be provided without charge to the individual.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="06102595000019"></a>Although the amendment makes specific reference to medical experts,</p>
<ul><a name="06102595000148"></a>&#147;instructed jointly by the scheme authority and the individual seeking redress under the scheme&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06102595000116"></a>I reassure the House that we do not consider it reasonable to expect a lay person to instruct a medical expert on a complex issue. It is our firm intention that the individual seeking redress will have access to appropriate legal advice without charge to enable the individual to be fully informed and involved in the joint instruction of the expert. We have existing powers to enable that in Clause 8(1)(a).</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="06102595000020"></a>Amendments Nos. 8A, 8B and 9A would completely remove the power for the scheme to provide free legal advice to people using the scheme prior to an offer of redress having been made. By rigidly preventing free legal advice being provided to patients seeking redress under the scheme, the scheme will not give patients the assistance that they may require.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="06102595000021"></a>The argument for these amendments, put forward in the other place, is that legal advice is not necessary during the fact-finding process. Investigation merely ascertains what happened. I do not agree. For example, there will be circumstances in which it will be appropriate for there to be instruction of medical experts to help to ascertain the facts of a case. As I have said, we do not consider it reasonable to expect lay persons always to instruct medical experts without legal advice. If the redress scheme is to be effective and to gain the confidence of patients, there needs to be appropriate support throughout the process.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="06102595000022"></a>However, not only are patients to be prevented from having legal advice to assist with the instruction of medical experts, but Amendment No. 10A would remove the provision inserted in the other place that guaranteed that any medical expert would be jointly instructed.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para16"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="06102595000024"></a>For those reasons, I strongly urge the noble Earl not to pursue Amendments Nos. 8A, 8B, 9A and 10A but to agree to Commons Amendments Nos. 8, 9and 10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="06102595000027"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 9A and 10A. I should say at the outset that it is not my intention to press these amendments but I think that it is right to take a brief time to debate them. We need to hear from the Government in a little more detail why they have changed their minds about offering free legal advice throughout the redress process.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="06102595000028"></a>I do not have, and never have had, a problem about free legal advice being available under the scheme at the point at which the NHS local authority comes forward with an offer. It is at that stage that the aggrieved person wishes to assess the adequacy of the offer and to weigh up the alternatives open to him if he decides not to accept it. To make those decisions, he needs legal advice. Perhaps more importantly, he needs legal advice on the implications of his accepting an offer from the NHSLA, because the acceptance of an offer brings to an end his legal right to pursue civil litigation on that matter. Clause 8(2) covers that situation, and it is important. I have no argument with it.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="06102595000029"></a>But here we find that in another place the Government have agreed to the insertion of Clause 8(1), which would apparently allow for a complainant to have access to free legal advice from the very outset of the redress process. That is a significant changeof mind. In Grand Committee, the Minister acknowledged that at the beginning of the process support to the patient would be provided by PALS and ICAS. I had reservations about PALS and ICAS and suggested that we might think about someone more akin to a Mackenzie friend to support the patient, but the one thing that neither the Minister nor I envisaged was the intervention of lawyers.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="06102595000030"></a>There are two reasons why I am resistant to the presence of lawyers at this stage of the process. The first is cost. One reason why we all agree that we need to find an alternative to civil litigation is that it is costly to all concerned. Although the Government have not said it in so many words, they surely cannot  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1254"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be oblivious to the size of the legal aid bill associated with civil claims against the health service&#151;it is enormous&#151;yet here we seem to be reimporting one of the features of the current unsatisfactory system into the new one.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="06102595000031"></a>The second reason that I balk at the amendment is that I cannot see why lawyers are necessary at this point of the process. The whole point of the redress scheme is that it affords a quicker, less cumbersome way for a patient to receive an explanation; where appropriate, an apology for treatment that has gone wrong; and, in appropriate cases, an offer of financial compensation. By making an application under the scheme, you lose none of your legal rights; you are simply making an application. The added value of a lawyer at this stage of the process is therefore unclear to me. I have heard the argument that, if you make an application under the scheme and have it rejected on the grounds that it is ineligible, you might need a lawyer to contest that decision. Again, I do not follow that argument. If an application is rejected on grounds of ineligibility, the reasons for the decision will presumably be given, and that is certainly a situation in which ICAS could be brought in to offer the patient appropriate guidance. But a rejection need not be the end of the road: civil litigation may still be open as an alternative. Once you import lawyers into this early stage, you introduce elements appropriate to an adversarial, judicial process. The redress schemeis not a judicial process, nor is it adversarial; it is essentially an offer-making process which is consensual.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="06102595000032"></a>I have noticed in my time working on this Bill that there are only two groups of people who believe we need more lawyers for the NHS redress scheme&#151;the lawyers themselves, and those with an interest in promoting the services of lawyers. It is unfortunate that the Government have allowed themselves to be beguiled into modifying the Bill in this way. I put it no stronger than that.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="06102595000033"></a>In Amendment No. 10 we also see that the Government have changed their minds on the question of having jointly instructed medical experts. They were always in the Bill, but here we have a new subsection about joint instruction. Again, that concept introduces a dimension that we see operating in the courts. The redress scheme is not the same as a court. It is an executive process. A joint instruction implies that an adversarial tussle is going on. As I have said, I do not view the redress scheme in that way, and I did not think that the Government did either. What will be the status of the medical experts&#146; evidence? Will it be privileged, or will it be available to the patient at the end of the process? That is an important point.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="06102595000034"></a>In our earlier debates the Minister was quite clear that some elements of the NHSLA&#146;s deliberations would have to remain legally privileged. I am not sure whether the Minister has changed his position, but should be interested to know whether that is so. If he has not changed his position, I understand exactly why that should be. If the patient is party to a joint instruction it implies that he or she should be entitled to know what evidence is given as a consequence.</p>

However, we recognise that in some cases legal advice may be necessary at an earlier stage, for example, when the services of jointly instructed medical experts are required. In these cases, it may be inappropriate not to offer appropriate legal advice, but without that provision the scheme is unlikely to gain the confidence of patients.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="06102595000038"></a>I notice that the Liberal Democrats are not speaking on this Motion. I was pleased that Dr John Pugh said in the Commons Standing Committee that the Minister had confirmed that medical experts, where instructed, would be jointly instructed. It is imperative for any meaningful joint instruction of a medial expert that the patient has specialist legal representation. It would not be reasonable to expect a lay person to instruct a medical expert on such complex issues.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="06102595000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, will be pleased to see this new accord between the Government and some of her colleagues on this aspect. We agree with that entirely. We have certainly not changed our minds in the area of reports. They will be made available, and there is no question of using the excuse of privilege in denying access to the views of the expert medical witness. I tried to make that clear earlier, but I may not have done so as well as I might. A claim for privilege to prevent disclosure to another party can be made if a document is a communication between a solicitor and a third party, which arises after litigation is contemplated and the purpose of which is to obtain legal advice. Where documents have a dual purpose the test is whether the dominant purpose of the document was for legal advice. Privilege cannot be claimed for an accident or investigation report unless the sole or dominant purpose for which it was prepared was for submission to a legal adviser for advice.</p>

<a name="61025-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="06102595000040"></a>In this case, the expert advice will be a shared appointment and what they say will be made available to both parties, so I do not think there is any question of doctors claiming privilege on that issue. I hope that that reassures the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="06102595000055"></a>This new clause imposes a general duty to promote resolution under the scheme. A duty will now be imposed on scheme members and the scheme authority to have regard when carrying out their functions under the scheme to the desirability of settling the case.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="06102595000056"></a>The redress scheme to be established under the powers in the Bill aims to open up access to justice for the less articulate, less wealthy and those who traditionally would have been fed up and would have abandoned the process before a case is completed. Providers of NHS services will now be expected to take forward cases when they believe there may be a case of negligence.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="06102595000057"></a>An active approach of redress will be required under the scheme. There will be scheme members who are already taking an active approach to complaints and to clinical negligence cases. Some organisations will be prepared to be open and honest and will embrace the redress scheme, but there will be others who continue to be defensive and drag their heels. We need to do all we can to ensure that this will not happen.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="06102595000058"></a>The new clause signals that the redress scheme is not simply a parallel process to run alongside the courts. It is intended to be the primary means by which disputes arising out of NHS hospital services are, where reasonably practicable, to be resolved rather than leaving cases to be pursued through the courts. It would be wrong to require cases to be settled under the scheme willy-nilly, but the desirability of resolution is a factor that must be taken into account along with all other relevant considerations. For those reasons, I commend the Motion to the House.</p>

Despite the Minister&#146;s explanation, I am a little puzzled as to why the wording has been chosen. Despite the reasons adduced by the Minister, there is a problem of whether the new clause has genuine legal force. How could one ever verify one way or the other whether the scheme authority or scheme members were abiding by it, or failing to do so? In practical terms, the provision is unenforceable. If so, it is bad law and should not be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="06102595000061"></a>The whole point of the redress scheme is to provide an alternative to civil proceedings.

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="06102595000062"></a>Perhaps the Minister could say a little more on those issues.</p>

Views were expressed outside the Commons&#151;for example by Action against Medical Accidents&#151;that some reinforcing mechanism was needed in the Bill. The new clause seeks to reinforce the message that scheme members and the scheme authority should actively seek resolution under the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="06102595000064"></a>I can understand where the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is coming from. But the clause is not meaningless; it makes it very clear that there may be a legal remedy if the duty to promote resolution is not properly exercised. We felt that it was important to put this matter beyond peradventure, given some of the points made. This provision was generally approved in the other place as a way to give a clear signal that the redress scheme is intended as the primary means by which disputes are resolved, so far as is reasonably practicable. That is the reason we went ahead with this particular provision.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="06102590000033"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 2. The amendments simply ask the Government to provide further clarification about issues we touched on in Committee and on Report. I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, to our proceedings. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, has done sterling service throughout all previous stages, so I wait with bated breath to see why we have been targeted by a Minister of State as well.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="06102590000034"></a>I hope my amendments will give the Minister the opportunity to carry out his commitment given at col. 620 on Report. Clause 45 introduces a power to search school pupils for weapons. We have made it clear that we support that measure. Paragraph 312 of the Explanatory Notes states that,</p>
<ul><a name="06102590000097"></a>&#147;in the case of maintained schools (which carry out a public function), there is an obligation to act compatibly with Convention rights and schools will be given guidance on how to ensure that searches are carried out compatibly with Convention rights&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102590000085"></a>In Committee, I tabled an amendment to probe what kind of guidance would be given by the Government regarding how searches would be carried out and what training would be required. In particular, I asked what training would be given in schools to those carrying out the searches to ensure that the search was carried out in an appropriate manner.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="06102590000035"></a>In practice, the Minister did not respond to that question, perhaps simply because my amendment was at that stage grouped with a number of government amendments that had already been spoken to by him. In so doing he referred at col. 637 on 22 May to the fact that guidelines would be issued. The problem was that we did not obtain any further information about precisely what those guidelines might address. That debate was five months ago. Since then concern has been expressed particularly over the past two weeks about the wearing of veils in schools and elsewhere. I therefore felt that it was only right to give the Government the opportunity to put on record their view on the interpretation of the powers of search within that context.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="06102590000036"></a>On my reading of the Government's drafting, they have tried to cover the matter in the most sensible and sensitive way, but we need to be sure. Clause 45(5) permits a member of staff to require a pupil to remove outer clothing. Does that include the <I>hijab</I>? The subsection also states that the member of staff who carries out the search of the pupil while looking for weapons must be of same sex as the pupil and,</p>
<ul><a name="06102590000098"></a>&#147;may carry out the search only in the presence of another member of the staff who is also of the same sex as the pupil&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102590000086"></a>In my amendment I stipulate that the first member of staff must carry out the search only when the second member of the staff is the same sex as the pupil. I anticipate that the use of the word &#147;may&#148; in subsection (5)(c) is intended to have the same force as &#147;must&#148; in subsection (5)(b). I am puzzled why the terminology is different. It could lead those not used to parliamentary drafting to assume that a different objective is sought. I suspect that the objective is not different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="06102590000037"></a>Amendment No. 2 gives the Secretary of State the power to issue guidance regarding how the search powers in subsection (5) may be carried out. In particular it allows the Secretary of State to specify what should be considered as outer clothing. It is therefore more targeted than the amendment I tabled in Committee, which covered the whole clause.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="06102590000038"></a>How will guidance regarding the searches be formulated? Will there be national guidance from the Secretary of State after consultation with schools, their governing bodies, local authorities, teachers&#146; unions and professional associations, or will the guidance be provided by individual local authorities or schools? What progress have the Government made on this matter since the clause was published over a year ago in July 2005? I beg to move.</p>

It is a matter of English. If the Minister says in terms that a search may be carried out only in the presence of another member of staff, as a matter of English that is fair enough, but if there is a possibility of a search being carried out without another member of staff being present, that would be terribly wrong, from not only the point of view of protecting the pupil but that of protecting the teacher from false allegations. It would be very easy for a person who is carrying a weapon and who is discovered <I>in flagrante delicto</I> so doing to blame the teacher concerned and to suggest that there had been some impropriety, some planting of evidence or something of that sort. It is essential to have two people to carry out searches. I hope to hear the Minister agree.</p>

I greatly appreciate&#151;I want this understood by all Members of the House&#151;the constructive way we have had our debates on the many and varied issues that the Bill has raised. It has been a model of the way Bills should be considered and taken forward in the House. It has worked particularly well with some of the more practical, hard-nosed issues that we have had to consider.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="06102590000041"></a>These amendments, as set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, seek to alter the wording of the requirement that a member of staff must carry out a search only when another appropriate member of staff is present. They also seek to enable the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to issue guidance, and suggest that may in particular refer to who will conduct the search or be present during it, and the clothing that can be required to be removed.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="06102590000042"></a>Under subsection (5)(c) it is already a requirement of the search power that another member of staff of the same sex is present when a search is conducted. Therefore we would not seek any changes to the way that the requirement is expressed, as we believe the clause as currently drafted adequately meets the policy objective. It would not permit a search that is not carried out in the presence of another member of staff who is of the same sex as the pupil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="06102590000043"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills plans to issue guidance for schools, and that my department will issue guidance for attendance centres. Preliminary discussions took place this month with the working group on school security&#151;which includes representatives from teacher unions, parent organisations, police representatives and others&#151;and liaison is continuing with faith groups. Obviously, all comments will be taken into account and we will then consult fully on the draft guidance. That will include advice on staff training, on employers&#146; duties to take reasonable steps to keep staff safe and on the importance of having insurance to cover any liability for injury in the course of employment.</p>

These are important interferences with liberty, and it is essential that they should be properly marked.</p>

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="06102590000045"></a><b><a name="61025-0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="06102590000402"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord makes an important point. Yes, it would certainly be my expectation that there would be a proper record of the events surrounding a search of that nature. It may also be helpful to say a little more on the planned scope of this guidance, which has already benefited extensively from suggestions from stakeholders&#151;a term that, although I do not like it, we all understand. It will cover the context and practicalities&#151;the sort of points that the noble Lord raised&#151;and the consequences of searching. The context is likely to involve a school statement of policy, and options that staff should consider before embarking upon a search.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="06102590000046"></a>Practical aspects, to which I have already alluded, will include training for staff, the use of security firms, factors to take into account in suspicion, and being sensitive to issues of race, culture and religion arising from items of outer clothing&#151;headgear, veils and so on. The consequences section will cover keeping records&#151;the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas&#151;informing parents and dealing with complaints. I hope it is clear from this that the guidance will be thorough. It is certainly our intention that it should be. If noble Lords feel that other things, which we have missed or not dealt with, should be put into the guidance, then we will be open to listening to those concerns as part of the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="06102590000047"></a>While it is unnecessary to detail the contents of the guidance in the Bill, since the Secretary of State for Education and Skills will be issuing guidance following what I hope noble Lords will now realise is a full consultation process, I can also assure the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that we will note all issues raised during these debates and try to ensure thatthey are taken into account properly during the consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="06102590000048"></a>The guidance will be national and issued by the DfES. What is outer clothing is, apparently, a matter of law, but non-statutory guidance can give indications, and it will.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="06102590000049"></a>Questions such as, &#147;Can a search ever be carried out in front of a male when a female is involved?&#148; have been asked. Our guidance will certainly recommend that only in exceptional circumstances should a school allow more staff to be present at a search than the two who must be present, and that any other person present should be of the same sex as the pupil. I have now covered the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, unless there are other questions.</p>

The Minister referred to using security firms. If using those firms is to become a regular matter of course&#151;as it obviously has become in American schools&#151;presumably that would mean staff do not have to be present. Or, if the security firm&#146;s staff is used for this security clearance, would there be one member of staff? How does the approach work in that case?</p>

In any event, if firms of security staff are used, there will have to be compliance with the general principles of the process to which I referred. Points of detail like that are best left in guidance, but I am happy to respond to individual issues raised outside the terms of this debate. I hope that my comments have been generally helpful and constructive, as they are meant to be. I am certainly attempting to answer the noble Baroness&#146;s points in raising her useful amendment this evening.</p>

I expected him to say that the &#147;must&#148; in subsection 5(b) was intended to mean the same as the &#147;may ... only&#148; in subsection 5(c), as that did look like an odd bit of drafting for those not perhaps used to the vicissitudes of this particular Bill. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="06102590000053"></a>I also agree with the Minister that it is useful to have the outline of what might be in guidance now; in this case, we certainly do not expect to see detailed guidance. Sometimes it is important to see what is in guidance before one progresses further, but as the Minister points out there are existing issues on guidance&#151;both in statute, and non-statutory&#151;upon which one hopes this consultation will build. However, it was right to raise today the sensitive issue of matters such as head-covering and what it comprises.</p>

<a name="61025-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="06102590000054"></a>On the important issue of who is going to be present at a search&#151;and what sex they should be&#151;we had earlier discussions about how one defines a member of staff. I was pleased that the Government made amendments earlier, ensuring that they would

So, there is a greater quality control over what kind of search is carried out. I appreciate the Minister saying that it might, on occasion, be necessary to have more than two persons present at a search. One might envisage a particularly healthy teenager overpowering two members of staff, and for the security of those present one might want more than two adults there. However, it is important that they fall within the parameters of the rules set down, both in the Bill and subsequently in guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="06102590000060"></a>Noble Lords will be all too well aware from those press reports that there has been much concern about the prevalence of a new sort of activity. People with ready access to a camera phone or smart-phone that can take still or video pictures can use them to record a criminal event. That usually involves a group, perhaps kicking, beating or sometimes even raping an individual. The pictures are then transmitted to others so that they can all have a good laugh at the victim and applaud the criminal. Often, the pictures are posted on the internet. To take the footage is a despicable way to behave. The whole purpose behind it is for people to enjoy watching&#151;not to encourage others to commit the offence, which would obviously be a conspiracy&#151;but simply for the person in some sick way to enjoy what they see.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="06102590000062"></a>The amendment introduces a new offence that would make it illegal for any person intentionally to make an audio or visual recording of a criminal offence for the purpose of obtaining gratification for himself or another. I am trying to ensure that those who record criminal events for the purposes of prosecuting them are not caught out by the new offence. I want to protect the police and journalists who take pictures and pass them on to police, using them in a perfectly laudable way. I also want to protect those quick-thinking members of the public&#151;for example, those who were present at the horrendous events in London last summer&#151;who take video footage or still pictures on their cameras and hand them over to the police. The pictures taken then were invaluable in backing up CCTV footage.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="06102590000063"></a>I intend to protect all those innocent applications of the use of mobile telephony to take pictures, while trying to target those who take pictures for a sickening purpose. I believe that the drafting ensures that only those who are seeking to obtain gratification for themselves or another would be committing an offence. Police, journalists and members of the public who take pictures for detection, prevention, solution or reporting of crime would not fall foul of the offence. They are clearly not seeking to obtain gratification for themselves or another. Neither are the police when they take videos of offences such as dangerous driving on the motorway and then allow them to be shown on TV. That is clearly for educational reasons&#151;to deter others from committing offences.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="06102590000064"></a>I did not move my original amendment on Report, having debated it in Committee, because the Government indicated that they were not prepared to make any concessions on the matter. Although I felt strongly that my amendment was the right thing to do, I did not wish unnecessarily to take up the time of the House at that stage at a late hour. However, developments since Report have persuaded me that I should bring back my amendment on Third Reading, so that the Government can provide an explanation and clarification of comments made by the right honourable gentleman, Jack Straw, in Business Questions in another place just last Thursday. I have redrafted my original amendment so that it includes a new subsection (2) to respond to the specific point made by Mr Straw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="06102590000065"></a>He was asked by Iain Wright, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, whether he would arrange for time to be given to a debate on YouTube. Mr Wright said that he was concerned about a posting on it from his constituency entitled, &#147;Milton Road Fight Club&#148;. It shows a man being attacked in the street and kicked in the face until he is unconscious. Mr Wright said that he was worried that,</p>
<ul><a name="06102590000099"></a>&#147;acts of violence and instances of happy slapping recorded on mobile phones are being transferred to the web for wider consumption&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="06102590000087"></a>I entirely agree with him. Mr Wright went on to ask for a debate so that Members of another place could discuss how they might help to stop the problem.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="06102590000066"></a>Lo and behold, Mr Straw&#146;s response was to state that the Commons did not need time for a debate because it was already in the pipeline. He said that another place,</p>
<ul><a name="06102590000100"></a>&#147;will discuss the Violent Crime Reduction Bill during the next week, and I hope that he raises the matter in relation to an appropriate amendment. There is a very serious issue about how such videos should better be controlled&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/10/06; col. 1025.]</ul>
<a name="61025-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="06102590000067"></a>But, in Committee, the Government had already rejected my amendment to deal with happy slapping, so how on earth would another place have the opportunity to discuss that, unless the Government are minded to accept my amendment today? My new subsection (2) does exactly what Mr Straw hoped that his honourable friend Mr Wright would do: it makes it an offence for anyone to upload or place on the internet an audio or visual recording made for the purpose of obtaining gratification for himself or another. The word &#147;gratification&#148; already appears in legislation, but I understand from the Public Bill Office that the word &#147;upload&#148; does not yet. So, under its advice, I have used the words, &#147;place on the internet&#148;.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="06102590000068"></a>Presumably, the Government will now accept my amendment, as I am only doing what the Leader of another place wants&#151;what he asked his honourable friend to do as recently as last Thursday; what he obviously thought that the Home Office had already agreed should be an amendment to the Bill. Without my amendment, no debate can take place in the Commons when the Bill returns to another place next Monday. Let us help another place to have that debate. I beg to move.</p>

Obviously, what she has in mind is those who video rapes, muggings or fights outside a pub in which several men kick another man in the head while he is lying on the ground, and so on. In such cases, her amendment would be entirely justified, but there is no requirement in the amendment for the criminal offence to be a serious one. This may sound far-fetched, but suppose that a particularly unpleasant individual lived in a street who was disliked by all his neighbours and someone videoed him creeping out late at night to deposit illicit rubbish in someone else's recycling bin, or something like that, and all the neighbours got together to laugh at that individual&#146;s misdemeanours being revealed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="06102590000070"></a>More pertinently, perhaps, what about, heaven forbid, another 9/11? Let us suppose that someone were to video an al-Qaeda plane crashing into a skyscraper on Canary Wharf and hand the video over to the police, assuming that no one else had videoed it. Surely, it would not be wrong for him to keep it to show to his family and friends time and time again, just as&#151;whether or not it is right for them to do so&#151;people enjoy seeing a replay of the 9/11 tragedy

It may be wrong of them to do so, but I suggest that millions of people do. I fear that that would be automatically caught unless more discretion is given to the prosecuting authorities to ignore such things. Even if the video were handed over to the police for the purposes of trying to track down and prosecutethe individuals concerned, it would still be an offence for the person who took the video to keep it for the purposes of replaying it to his family and friends.</p>

I, too, have some reservations about the drafting&#151;I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive me for that. As drafted, it requires the prosecution to prove that the purpose of recording the criminal offence was to obtain gratification for the person making the recording or for the gratification of someone else. It would be better if a statutory defence were included, so that it was an offence for any person intentionally to make an audio or visual recording of a criminal offence and then, in subsection (2), for it to be a defence to show that it had been done for a legitimate reason&#151;however that is expressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="06102590000072"></a>I am also concerned that we know about these things because the media publish them in a &#147;shock, horror&#148; way&#151;&#147;Look at what these people are doing!&#148;. At the same time, one wonders whether there is not a secondary purpose in the publication of material of that kind. Although I applaud how subsection (2) is drafted, in the traditional Liberal way, I wonder whether it goes far enough.</p>

I will deal with this and other issues in turn.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="06102590000074"></a>As the noble Baroness has explained, the amendment attempts to tackle the unsavoury practice of recording offences, often on a mobile phone,for personal gratification, and publishing those recordings on the internet. It is clear that the aim of the amendment is to create an offence to ensure that any person who participates in happy-slapping incidents can be prosecuted under the law. I think we all agree that incidents of happy slapping can be vicious and traumatic for the victim, and the Government condemn the practice entirely, as does everyone else. We are therefore naturally sympathetic to the aim of the amendment. However, we have already done quite a lot of work to investigate the issue, and we have sought views from other government departments and agencies since the noble Baroness first raised the issue quite properly in Committee. We have tried to focus on identifying whether there is a gap in the legislation and, although we sympathise with the objectives of the amendment,  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1267"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we remain sceptical that there is a need for a new offence of recording a criminal offence, as proposed in the amendment.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="06102590000075"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s approach is not supported by ACPO or the CPS, which have told us that they know of no cases where prosecutions have failed or have not proceeded because of a gap in the law. There is already adequate criminal law to deal with anyone involved in an incident of happy slapping, and we are confident that any individual who is involved in such an incident in any way will be committing a criminal offence and will therefore be liable to be prosecuted for that offence.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="06102590000076"></a>Under subsection (1) of the amendment, a person who recorded a violent offence should be criminally liable, either because they also committed the offence being filmed, or because they were involved in the planning of the offence and so would be open to charges of conspiracy, incitement, or aiding and abetting, or were involved in a joint enterprise to commit the offence. I reiterate&#151;noble Lords will already be aware of this&#151;that a person does not have to make physical contact with the victim to commit what is an extremely serious criminal offence. Aiding, abetting or inciting an offence can be subject to the same penalties as committing the offence, and therefore an individual who does this can be dealt with as robustly as those directly involved. Moreover, happy slapping that is an element of a violent offence should be taken into account as an aggravating factor of that offence under current sentencing guidelines. This type of offence would usually involve three factors: planning, offenders operating in groups or gangs, and additional degradation of the victim. These factors would apply to all those committing the offence, not only to the person doing the filming.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="06102590000077"></a>Subsection (2) of the amendment relates to the newer offence of downloading on to the internet an audio or visual recording of a criminal offence. Under the current law, anyone who publishes material on the internet that is held to be obscene under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 is committing a criminal offence. It is also an offence under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 to transmit, by means of a public electronic communications network such as a mobile phone, images that are,</p>
<ul><a name="06102590000101"></a>&#147;grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102590000088"></a>Material that is not caught by this legislation is widely available for the general public to see elsewhere, for example in the media and the entertainment industry, and is not subject to criminal law. In this sense, the issue under consideration goes far beyond images on the internet, and it would not be appropriate to legislate only against images on this medium.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="06102590000078"></a>I am afraid that the amendment also has some drafting difficulties that could render it unworkable. First, the amendment would make it an offence to record any criminal offence. By not restricting this to violent offences, we could be criminalising the recording of anything from a minor traffic infringement to much more serious crimes. The amendment would also require there to be intention before an offence is committed. However, it is not  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1268"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear whether the intention relates solely to the filming of the act in question or to the filming of a criminal offence. In other words, it is not clear whether the person must know that the act they are filming for gratification is in fact a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="06102590000079"></a>Finally, the proposed offence would require the recording to be for the gratification of the individual or another person. Although there are currently 14 references to gratification in legislation, they all relate to sexual gratification. It is not clear what would be caught by the term &#147;gratification&#148;. For example, it is not clear whether publishing such material for legitimate purposes&#151;for example, as CCTV footage as part of the news or a &#147;Crimewatch&#148;-type programme, many of which can be viewed on the internet&#151;would be for personal gratification, and whether or not gratification in this sense would be legitimate.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="06102590000080"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, many news and other television programmes or clips can now be viewed over the internet. Even if a defence along these lines were included, there would be significant evidential difficulties in, for example establishing whether the offence being uploaded was real or staged and, if staged, therefore not a criminal offence. It is true that many of us find certain material available on the internet distasteful. However, I should say for the record that the vast majority of the internet industry takes a responsible approach to the content that it hosts, both of its own volition and in co-operation with law enforcement and government agencies. Where the industry is advised that the content that it hosts contravenes legislation or its broader acceptable-use policy&#151;many companies&#146; policies provide for them to remove material that will cause distress to an individual&#151;they will readily remove it. Any individual who is concerned about the contents of a particular website can approach the relevant internet service provider to ask it to remove either the site or some of the material hosted on it.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="06102590000081"></a>The Government accept the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns and, as I said at the outset, are sympathetic to the aim of the amendment. However, we are not convinced that there is a gap in current legislation. We do, of course, want to ensure that the law is enforced fully, consistently and robustly, and we think that by working with ACPO, the CPS and the Sentencing Guidelines Council we can ensure that the police, prosecutors and sentencers have the proper guidance to enable them to deal appropriately with incidents of happy slapping.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="06102590000082"></a>We also want to send out a clear message to children that incidents of happy slapping are abhorrent and will not be tolerated. We are therefore working with the Department for Education and Skills on how we can best educate young people, who are often the group exposed to incidents of happy slapping, about the seriousness of committing a criminal offence of assault and, indeed, about the seriousness of the penalties for crimes of this nature. I realise that this may be something of a disappointing response to the noble Baroness, although I have indicated our general support for what she is attempting to achieve; that is, to ensure that people  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1269"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are fully aware of the abhorrent nature of happy slapping and that the full force of the law can be used against them for perpetrating this appalling crime.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="06102595000072"></a>The noble Baroness made some salient points about my right honourable friend Jack Straw and his comments in another place. I have now looked at what he said. I think that the Leader of another place was making an observation in a way designed to be helpful, to assist his honourable friend Iain Wright, the Member for Hartlepool, in finding a venue to hold a lengthier discussion on the issue of YouTube. I think he said that he hoped that the issue would be raised with an appropriate amendment. In a sense we have done that and the noble Baroness has been helpful in that regard. My right honourable friend simply encouraged his honourable friend to use the opportunity of perhaps having an amendment to the Bill and perhaps returning it to another place for there to be a discussion. I do not think that he made a commitment or asked Iain Wright to do anything. It was just one of those moments when Jack Straw was trying to be helpful, as he is on many occasions.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="06102595000073"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity provided by the noble Baroness to discuss this issue further. I have tried to go through in detail the way we see the issue and how we feel it is best dealt with. In those terms, I hope that she has found my response useful.</p>

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="06102595000074"></a><b><a name="61025-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06102595000385"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord has now made much clearer the Government&#146;s objections than he was able to in Committee, and of course I understand that my drafting is not perfect. The noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Thomas of Gresford, were worried about how wide the offence would go and who it would capture. I was not in a position to explore these issues further on Report&#151;I gave an explanation at the time, and therefore it was not possible to knock off the rough edges of the amendment. Given that, I offer it again to the House today, but in a slightly different form.</p>

<a name="61025-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="06102595000075"></a>The Minister spoke of the drafting rather than the objective. He shares my aims and concerns, but has said that there is no gap in the current legislation. This is a matter that is abhorrent in nature. Happy slapping is not something that should be tolerated and it is clear that Jack Straw agrees. The Minister has said that his right honourable friend was trying to be helpful in another place. Well, he was helpful to me. It is one of those occasions when I shall remember his words very clearly indeed. The Minister is inviting me to believe that the Leader of the House of Commons does not understand the rules of amendments in lieu that proceed when we have exchanges between both Houses. The right honourable Jack Straw has been in Parliament for more years than me and has vastly more experience than I have now or ever could have, so I find that difficult to swallow. It is clear that Jack Straw believed that this Bill would be in another place and could be amended in such a way that Mr Wright would be able to table his amendment. If he did not believe that, he was misleading another place, and I do not believe that Jack Straw was doing that. I shall give him the opportunity to satisfy his honourable friends in another place. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

This relatively small change is intended to clarify the effect of that amendment, and I regret that it was brought to my attention only after Report. The clause that I put forward was intended to ensure that in-house staff performing security activities would not have to be licensed by the SIA if they were working at a ground covered by the safety at sports grounds legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="06102595000082"></a>I have been informed that the wording of the clause limits it to affect only those staff who work at their home sports grounds. It would not cover those sports security staff who sometimes accompany their club or team to work in other sports grounds. This minor amendment aims to meet the intended position of the original amendment. It will also remove from the remit of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 those in-house staff whose home ground is covered by the safety at sports grounds legislation and who accompany their team to play at another venue which is also covered by the safety at sports grounds legislation.</p>

I certainly understand and sympathise with the consternation of the reputable dealers in airguns across the country, both registered and unregistered, who find themselves faced with this restraint upon their trade after a consultation that took place some time ago, yet where we have still not seen the publications and analysis of the responses to that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="06102595000095"></a>Can the Minister also respond to the point I put in Committee, which has so far gone unanswered? I asked whether the Government have taken into account the fact that not all air weapons have a specific number, so that it is more difficult to carry out any registration. I am aware that it could be advantageous for the trade were the Government to adopt a pragmatic approach of allowing registration by batches of sale. The Minister said that he would give &#147;further thought&#148; to that matter. What is the result of that further reflection?</p>

<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="06102595000096"></a><b><a name="61025-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06102595000392"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for joining us in your Lordships&#146; House today and for moving his amendment. It enables me to place on record my thanks to him not only for the diligent and courteous way in which he has conducted himself during the debates and in raising these questions and issues, but also for seeking clarification on behalf of the Gun Trade Association and lobby.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="06102595000097"></a>The amendment challenges the Government to justify the inclusion of Clauses 31 and 32 and to show that they will be effective in tackling air weapon misuse. I know that the Gun Trade Association unreservedly condemns the misuse of air weapons&#151;as we all do&#151;and has done much in the past to promulgate safe and responsible handling. However, although there has been some recent improvement in the situation, the level of misuse remains a matter of real concern. In 2004-05, there were 11,825 crimes in which air weapons were used, resulting in 1,502 cases of injury, including&#151;sadly&#151;143 serious injuries. Occasionally the use of air weapons results in fatal injury, as occurred in Glasgow last year when two year-old Andrew Morton was killed.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="06102595000098"></a>All of this adds up to what we all agree is an unacceptable situation. We pledged in our party&#146;s last manifesto that we would tighten the law on airguns. Clearly one way of doing this would be to make all air weapons subject to certification but we recognise that this would impose a considerable administrative burden on all concerned. We concluded that restricting the points of sale to responsible registered dealers would help tackle the problem at source and, in any event, be more proportionate in its effect on legitimate users.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="06102595000099"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, seeks to establish whether the misuse of air weapons stems from those bought from retailers and by mail order or from weapons acquired through private sales. It also requires the Home Secretary to present research findings on this point to both Houses before the relevant clauses are brought into force. There are currently no comprehensive statistics, research or other studies on where offenders obtained their air weapons. Although it is very likely that some will have been obtained through private sales, I am equally sure that some will have come direct from retailers. I do not think this is generally disputed. Absence of evidence is not always evidence of absence and the Government do not propose to delay bringing into force these important measures while research is carried out. The results would, in any event, be largely academic as we want to tackle all air weapon misuse irrespective of where the gun was purchased.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="06102595000100"></a>Having said that, I understand the concerns about the impact of the clauses. As I made clear in Committee, we will work closely with the gun trade to ensure that the guidance on security and the requirements on keeping a register are kept proportionate. It will be open to existing sellers to apply to be registered and the fee of &#163;150 works out at less than &#163;1 a week, covering as it does a three-year  


<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1275"></a><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 1275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>period. Existing registered dealers will of course be able to continue to sell air weapons, with no charge to their business apart from a need to maintain a sales record and to conduct face-to-face transactions. We have already drafted Clause 32 in a way which minimises inconvenience to shooters in remote areas by allowing the final transfer of possession to be undertaken by a representative of the seller.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="06102595000101"></a>As well as bearing down on the present indiscriminate and anonymous sale of air weapons to unsuitable or under-age people in the way proposed, it will also be important to continue to tackle misuse through education and safety awareness and through the rigorous enforcement of existing offences. We believe that these measures, taken together, can only be good for the long-term future of the legitimate airgun industry if they succeed in tackling the present unacceptable levels of misuse.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="06102595000102"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for raising the question of the &#147;batches&#148; approach. I accept that not all air weapons have numbers and we have agreed with the gun trade that batch numbers will be sufficient in the absence of serial numbers. I hope that that assurance clears up that final point.</p>

<a name="61025-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="06102595000103"></a>Again I am grateful to the noble Earl and I pay tribute to him for his diligence in this issue. No doubt if there are any loose ends that he wishes to see tidied up I am sure that we will be able to deal with that in the usual way through correspondence and so on. I shall be happy to speak to the noble Earl outside the Chamber if there are any other matters that are still unresolved. Having heard what I have said, I hope the noble Earl will now withdraw his amendment.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="06102577000004"></a>The Committee met at half-past four of the clock</h4>


<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000005"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (BARONESS THOMAS OF WALLISWOOD) in the Chair.]</p>

<p><a name="06102577000006"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="06102577000078"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness Thomas of Walliswood):</b> I have been advised that these microphones are where they are so that they can pick up a speaker&#146;s voice when a speaker is standing. I think that I am right in saying that most people will not stand when they take part in the debate&#151;</p>

<p><a name="06102577000007"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06102577000079"></a>Noble Lords:</b> No!</p>

<p><a name="06102577000008"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06102577000080"></a>Baroness Thomas of Walliswood:</b> Oh, noble Lords do stand. Well, then, we should keep the microphones where they are and on no account move them up and down. I would not like us to interfere with the whole system by jiggling around with these delicate things, whatever they are. My instructions are to tell noble Lords not to move them up and down.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000009"></a>I remind Members of the Committee that, in the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that the Committee do report that it has considered the order in question. I should also make it clear that the Committee is charged only to consider orders and not to approve or disapprove them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000010"></a>I should also remind the Committee that, if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, the Committee will adjourn at the earliest convenient moment after the Division Bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="06102577000002"></a>Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) (Order) 2006</h3>

<p><a name="06102577000011"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06102577000081"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000012"></a>The noble Lord said: The broad purpose of the draft Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 is to help those who have suffered so much as a result of the Troubles in the Northern Ireland over the last 40 years. The Troubles have extended over many years and had profound consequences for many thousands of people in terms of trauma, injury and the pain of bereavement. For many, the pain and suffering remain a present and daily reality.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000013"></a>The Government believe that victims and survivors deserve a strong voice that will draw attention to their needs and which will help to inform the future of government policy. Giving victims and survivors a strong voice is the substance of the draft order. It provides for the establishment of the position of Commissioner for Victims and Survivors. The commissioner will have a general role in promoting the interest of victims and survivors and the draft order sets out various ways in which this will be done.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000014"></a>The commissioner will keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of services provided for victims and survivors by statutory and voluntary organisations. He or she will have a duty to provide advice to the Secretary of State, the Executive Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly and any person or organisation involved in the provision of services. The commissioner will also be there to provide advice and information on any matters concerning the interests of victims and survivors.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000015"></a>The draft order provides for the appointment of the commissioner to be made by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly, and for the commissioner to work in accordance with a detailed work programme agreed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. To ensure that the work of the commissioner helps to inform future policy, provision is made for the work of the commissioner to be carried out under work programmes which will be agreed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000016"></a>The commissioner will be under a duty to take into account the views of victims and survivors in carrying out his or her functions. Furthermore, and to ensure that their voices are heard, the commissioner will be tasked to take forward a victims and survivors forum. The commissioner will also be under a duty to publish an annual report on his or her work, and a copy of this will be laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly. A copy will be sent also to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000017"></a>The proposal for a draft order has been the subject of consultation and there is clear support in Northern Ireland for the concept of a commissioner. Many individuals have found the support of Mrs Bertha McDougall, who was appointed as the interim Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, to have been invaluable. I pay tribute to her work.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000018"></a>In broad terms, the draft order refers to those who have suffered bereavement or injury as a consequence of the Troubles since 1966. There is some divergence of view as to when the Troubles began, and this date has been chosen to ensure that we cover all the relevant period. I know that some concern has been expressed that the definition of &#147;victims&#148; should not include those involved in acts of violence. We understand these feelings and the deep hurt that many feel. The matter will no doubt resurface in today&#146;s debate. However, having considered the issue with great care, the Government are of the view that the definition of &#147;victims&#148; should be as inclusive as possible if we are to move to a better future for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000019"></a>We wish to provide the basis for a longer-term appointment of a Commissioner for Victims and Survivors. The introduction of the order demonstrates the Government&#146;s clear intention that victims and survivors must not be forgotten but should have a strong voice in the future. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000020"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="06102577000021"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06102577000082"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the Minister for bringing this order before the Committee. In principle, we support it: it is a good thing to be doing. I understand that the order is designed to be very inclusive. I, too, feel that there will be some challenges to its inclusivity and to who may or may not be considered victims and survivors, as the Minister anticipated. If that is the case, will there be a form of arbitration? How would such challenges be resolved? I do not wish to be pessimistic about a proposal that is as good as this and about a matter such as victims and survivors, but I am just trying to be realistic.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000022"></a>I understand that the commissioner will set up a forum at some stage, which is a good idea. Will the Minister tell us, if I am not jumping the gun, what form it is expected to take, when it is expected to be set up, how it might be funded and from where the people will come to form it? I know that a report is due shortly&#151;probably around Christmas. If I am pre-empting something, I am quite happy for the Minister to write to me.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000023"></a>Will the commissioner have the power to make grants? I read in the order some of the things that they will be expected to do. Will they be able to make grants to victims organisations or to victims&#146; families?</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000024"></a>I sense from the legislation that the management of the commissioner by the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister or the Secretary of State will take place through the work programmes and agreement, which is almost a substitute for regulation. Will that be the case? On this occasion, it may well be better than legislation. In principle, however, my party supports the order.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000025"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06102577000083"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> It is perhaps appropriate that this Grand Committee on Northern Ireland should meet in the enhanced surroundings of the Moses Room. I hope that this augurs well for the new beginning for Northern Ireland. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome the order. At the meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in Northern Ireland this week, some concern was expressed by the people of Northern Ireland about the process of the selection of the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors&#151;not the person, but the process. Perhaps other noble Lords will mention this later. However, I put on record our support for the order.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000026"></a>Victims organisations have grown greatly in Northern Ireland. There is now almost a victims industry, which may not, for a number of reasons, improve its clients&#146; lives in any way. There is a lot of cynicism about the value and the work of government initiatives. There is a feeling that there is too much bureaucracy and perhaps not enough feeling about the concerns of these desperate people.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000027"></a>We on the Liberal Democrat Benches support an overarching strategic approach to providing services to victims and survivors. That approach must be focused on victims and survivors and led by them, so that services are seen to be delivered and needs are seen to be met.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000028"></a>We very much support the appointment of the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors. As I have said, it has been very useful to have Mrs Bertha McDougall in post as an interim commissioner since December last year. We welcome the clarification given in the Explanatory Memorandum to the order that the position of commissioner will be advertised and that the appointment will fall within the remit of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Northern Ireland. However, that does not appear to have taken place, as I understand it.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000029"></a>We believe that the commissioner should be independent of Government. An independent commissioner would help to improve communication and minimise formality, so that services can be effectively and sensitively delivered. The commissioner should be similar, in relation to independence and autonomy, to the Commissioner for Children and Young People and should be able to undertake, commission or provide financial support for research into all matters relating to victims and survivors.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000030"></a>I should like to make a few broader points about victims and survivors in general. I am still concerned about funding generally for victims groups. It is vital that all funding sources, processes and procedures are carefully examined and sustained. Can the Minister reassure the Committee that efforts will be made to ensure that victims groups are made aware of all sources of funding and that procedures for applying for such funding will not be overcomplicated? That is an important point.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000031"></a>One-to-one counselling has proved very worth while to all concerned, including those most unsure about coming forward for help and support. This whole area of training and counselling must be sustained and there must be absolute confidence that adequate funding will be there to sustain it well into the future so that someone benefiting from one-to-one counselling does not suddenly find that it ceases when he or she is in most need. This is a sensitive aid and it is vital that it is targeted properly. Time-limiting these groups is totally unacceptable and could greatly set back those in need.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000032"></a>This service cannot be measured. Many children and young people who have suffered in the Troubles are now, for the first time, showing the effects of the disruption and the terror that they suffered at an earlier age. The effects of losing parents or siblings, being awakened late at night, being caught in violent situations and so many other experiences have often been bottled up in self-defence and are now causing disruption and distress in a wide range of ways. How can one guess the length of counselling and support necessary for them?</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000033"></a>Will the Minister inform the Committee whether any progress has been made on the proposal for a study to be carried out into the needs of carers who look after victims and survivors? Carers have been largely left to themselves, often in difficult circumstances. It is high time that they were provided with greater assistance.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000034"></a>Have the Government given any thought to the proposals made by the Alliance Party to the St Andrews talks that the British and Irish Governments should appoint an independent commission, composed of domestic and international experts, to consult, deliberate and make a series of recommendations to address outstanding issues relating to the past and its legacy and their linkage to the promotion of reconciliation? Addressing the past and its legacy is fundamental to the process of reconciliation and building a shared future. The failure to do this in a comprehensive and holistic manner is, I believe, a barrier to political progress.</p>
<h5><a name="06102577000076"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="06102577000035"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06102577000084"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> Like other noble Lords who have spoken, I generally welcome this order. Before dealing with it, I should declare a possible interest, as my wife is a member of the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund, which is deeply involved in the work of supporting victims.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000036"></a>When the Minister replies, I would like him to go into a couple of points in a little more detail. He mentioned that the legislation provides that the commissioner is to work in accordance with the detailed work programme and that the work programme is to be drawn up and agreed with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Failing the existence of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the detailed work programme is to be drawn up in consultation with the Secretary of State, which is the position at the moment. Therefore, I imagine that the Secretary of State and those who advise him have some ideas about what might be in a work programme. I notice that there are references to a detailed work programme, which implies that through it there will be fairly close control of the programme of the commissioner. I would be surprised if there are not already some ideas on that matter in the system. I am sure that the Committee would be interested to hear from the Minister on those matters.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000037"></a>It would be helpful if we had more detail on the proposal for a victims and survivors forum. It has been difficult for some victims and victims groups to find themselves in close proximity to others. A forum could be problematic and might be divisive, so we need to think and consult about it more carefully. I will be grateful if the Minister can give us some insight into the thinking on that matter.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000038"></a>The general question of funding has been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond. It is a sensitive matter, and I know from my former role that victims groups in my own patch had genuine reasons for feeling that they were not getting a fair deal under the present arrangements. Instead of finding officialdom helpful, they found that it was unhelpful and that it put obstacles in their path. Those may have been isolated examples, but we must be aware that some groups have reasonable grounds for feeling that they did not get a fair deal. We would not want to see that situation continue.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000039"></a>There is also the question of policy in general. This is not the first time that there has been a victims commissioner. Many years ago, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield was appointed to consider the question of provision for victims. He produced a report that, until now, has provided the bedrock for policy on these matters. This should have been explored further in the exposition of policy. Do the Government intend to reopen the issues that Bloomfield considered and advised on and to recast policy in these matters, or does Bloomfield continue to be the basis on which we approach these matters? Is the new provision for a commissioner to be supplemental to the existing arrangements, or does it presage a process by which they are overturned and something totally different is put in their place? It is important that the underlying issue is dealt with.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000040"></a>As I said at the outset, however, we generally welcome the order. We hope that it will help. This is an important issue. From my experience, victims want, first, to know that their story, experience, suffering and sacrifice are not forgotten, and, secondly, to be reassured that it was not in vain. Those are the important things. Of course there are questions of support. At the end of the day, however, remembrance and the feeling that a purpose was served are more important than support. That is not to say that support is not important&#151;it is. But we must get it into perspective.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000041"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06102577000085"></a>Baroness Blood:</b> I want to make a brief comment on this order and put it on the record that Mrs McDougall&#146;s appointment was highly irregular and threw the office of the commissioner into dispute. We have a strong public appointments policy in Northern Ireland, and I would like an assurance from the Minister that this appointment will be done in line with all other public appointments.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000042"></a>That is not to detract from what Bertha McDougall has done. She has done a good job over the past year. To take up the point of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I would hate to see the commissioner and their staff be made responsible for grants. That would start to unravel the whole thing. The Government should take that on board.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000043"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="06102577000086"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> If I appear somewhat more sceptical than previous speakers, it is perhaps because I have slightly more experience at the coalface of what has happened in Northern Ireland over the years. I do not want to inhibit progress or to suggest for a moment that a Commissioner for Victims and Survivors is not necessary&#151;it certainly is. I do not want to give the impression that I am somehow looking a gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000044"></a>Sadly, however, my experience over the years has been that Government tend to use an occasion like this for their own narrow and selfish political ends. The noble Baronesses, Lady Harris of Richmond and Lady Blood, have both mentioned how public appointments are made in Northern Ireland. I can virtually guarantee that when the appointment of commissioner is made in this case, it will be with both eyes firmly on Dublin and no real regard for the victims. I wait to be proved wrong.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, quite rightly mentioned sources of funding. I am of course concerned that victims should be aware of all sources of funding. I am also concerned, however, that sources of funding associated with the victims commissioner may be of the same dubious nature as that which came from the United States and has been used to fund restorative justice&#151;totally divorced from anything to do with the police, courts and so on. I am not going to stray, but the Minister will know exactly what I am talking about; he will know exactly how the Government have turned a blind eye to that dubious source of funding. I hope that those who will benefit from a victims commissioner will perhaps ensure that the Government do not allow this sort of dubious, doubtful money to be used in this way.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000046"></a>I am obviously concerned&#151;I am trying to find exactly what the Minister said&#151;about the fact that the main criterion on which a judgment will be made will be whether bodies and organisations provide services. Among the most effective bodies providing services in Northern Ireland are the prisoners organisations. Will they have equal status to those who are concerned with victims from the Ulster Defence Regiment or the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which are no longer in existence, or the Royal Irish Regiment, part-time, which is soon to be no longer in existence? Because they have been victims, the real victims and survivors tend to want to distance themselves from the circumstances that caused them to be victims. Hence, they do not have the degree of organisation and cohesiveness of those who were involved and may consider themselves&#151;I do not&#151;to be victims; that is, those who come from the terrorist, whether that be the loyalist or republican, side of the equation.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000047"></a>I hope that the Minister will assure us that he is not saying that everyone, regardless of whether he gave a service or created mayhem, is to be considered equal when we deal with victims and survivors. If we get that assurance, like others who have spoken today, I will be grateful and supportive. But if we do not get that assurance, my attitude will be reflected 100,000 times over by people in Northern Ireland who have seen their victimhood diminished and the elevation in public of those who created the mayhem of more than 30 years.</p>
<h5><a name="06102577000077"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="06102577000048"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06102577000087"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am grateful for all the contributions. I do not want to start another debate, but they were not all as helpful as each other to the settlement of a good future for the people of Northern Ireland. I will stick to the order because I would go into dangerous territory if I deviated from it. As I have made clear, the order involves a lot of sensitive issues, but I have been asked some questions that go way beyond the order and, if I can respond to those points with a degree of comfort, I will.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000049"></a>Give that we have the order, it would be difficult to open up a debate on who is more of a victim than anyone else or who is an innocent victim. Should the partners or families of people who have been involved in the Troubles be classified as victims or survivors or be excluded even though they are ordinary citizens but, nevertheless, have been tied up in the Troubles because of the actions of partners or other members of the family?</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000050"></a>I realise that there are problems of legal definitions anyway; if people are really upset about them, they can always resort to going to court if they are so minded. If we exclude categories of people because they, let us say, have served a term of imprisonment, some might even want to exclude their partners and families in future. I fully accept that there are some dodgy issues here. We cannot completely rewrite the order. There would be substantial difficulties in pursuing that.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000051"></a>A lot of voluntary groups, some cross-community, are involved in this. It would in no way be a good idea to open up legal niceties that stopped even cross-community approaches. To answer one point, nobody is going to be forced to sit in a room with people they do not want to sit in a room with. There is no idea of specific performance here. The remit of the commissioner is set out. It may not be as powerful as some would wish. For example, there is no facility for the victims commissioner to be involved in giving grants. However, if anything, that would create far more scope for hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds spent on parliamentary Answers to Questions about the grants&#151;as, indeed, happens now with the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000052"></a>Let us get this absolutely clear. The funding of the victims commissioner is effectively by the Government of Northern Ireland: the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. In other words, it is taxpayers&#146; money. Let us leave aside direct rule for the moment, because that does not change the funding mechanism. The victims commissioner is funded by public funds. There is no voluntary sector funding issue, or overseas funding. It will be part of the budget for Northern Ireland, which will be clear for everyone to see.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000053"></a>A good number of bodies and organisations provide services. I do not have a full list, although I came across many of them in my year in Northern Ireland as one of the Ministers. I have seen many more lists, as answering parliamentary Questions requires. The provisions of the order relate to the commissioner looking at services for victims and survivors provided by all bodies. We should not try to second-guess the commissioner, whoever he or she may be following an appointment. We will ask them to do a specific, professional job, and we should let them get on with it. They will be accountable in the court of public opinion in any event.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000054"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked me a specific question about the Alliance proposals in the recent discussions. We are grateful for the Alliance&#146;s paper, and careful consideration is being given to the ideas in it. However, no decisions have been taken yet. </p>

<p><a name="06102577000055"></a>I am grateful for the welcome of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. I am unaware of a plan of work set up by the Secretary of State. To be honest, given how we have gone with the order over the summer, the reasonable assumption of the Secretary of State&#146;s office is that he would not be doing this after 24 November anyway. In that sense, there is no plan. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, that our intention is&#151;as I have said, and will say in relation to other orders&#151;to progress what it is in the pot at the moment.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000056"></a>We sincerely hope, however, with advertisements and public consultations through the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, that by the time a victims commissioner is appointed in 2007, the work would be done by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, actually there and responsible in Northern Ireland. It would not be done by the Secretary of State, subject to the vagaries of fate&#151;it takes quite a while to advertise. I am not saying that this would happen, but it is our sincere hope that it does&#151;people in Northern Ireland should be making these decisions, not direct rule Ministers.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000057"></a>In the absence of that, however, we are making progress. We now have an interim commissioner, and we want to put the commissioner on a statutory footing. That requires going through due process, which is what we intend to do.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000058"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06102577000088"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> Perhaps the Minister would clarify that further. The officials who are notionally working for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are working to Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office. My question was whether there are in official circles proposals developing, or some sort of idea, about the work plan. I am sure that that work is going on and is available to the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000059"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06102577000089"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Of course those officials are working to the Ministers. I suspect that we are trying not to second-guess the appointment of a commissioner. The work plan would have to be discussed. If the Assembly and Executive are not back, a work plan will have to be drawn up by the Secretary of State and the Ministers who are responsible for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister&#151;those are currently my right honourable friend Peter Hain and my honourable friend David Hanson. I am not saying that no thought has been given to the issue. Our expectation would have been that Northern Ireland politicians would be running the show from 25 November. Clearly, that will not happen, but we certainly hope that it will be the case from next March. It would probably be quite counterproductive to act too soon. At present, the process is to get a commissioner in post in early 2007. We have to liaise with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments so that the process is open, transparent and not subject to any complaints. That is the way to do it. The public process will apply.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000060"></a>The commissioner certainly will be able to revisit issues from the past, particularly those covered by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, so there is no problem with that. We want the commissioner to look at services and provision for victims and survivors. There will be some areas where we do not know what the work programme will cover, but the work done by Sir Kenneth certainly can be looked at and taken into account by the commissioner. We want the commissioner to be appointed before we start deploying the work programme. As I say, our sincere hope is that the work programme is drawn up by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000061"></a>On the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, efforts have been made regarding the provision of counselling, but much more effort is required. In a way, an assessment of need is necessary, which we hope the interim commissioner will draw attention to in her report. The role of the victims and survivors forum will depend on the outcome of work taking place by the interim commissioner. It is likely that the forum will have an influential voice for victims and survivors, but its form is yet to be decided. There is nothing hard and fast about it. It is important that we get the statutory footing right.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000062"></a>I am well aware that there are gaps in funding. I came across this in the peace programme. Certain sections of society have not been too good at knowing what is available, filling in the forms and all that rigmarole. I regret the amount of form filling that people have to do in order to obtain services and sometimes funding. Nevertheless, special efforts have been made with regard to the Europe-funded peace programme to make sure that we can reach those areas from where we did not get enough applications. There are certainly gaps in the process and it is important that more work is done to provide information.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000063"></a>As I say, Mrs McDougall is carrying out a review of how well current funding arrangements are addressing need. It is not our plan that the commissioner should give grants. Knowing what I know&#151;and I would listen to others&#146; voices as well&#151;I do not think that it would be a good idea. I will say no more than that. There is no question but that it certainly would interfere with the main job.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000064"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06102577000090"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I certainly agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000065"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06102577000091"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> It would be nice if I could report back that this was the unanimous feeling of the Committee. But I do not want to put words into colleagues&#146; mouths.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000066"></a>The commissioner must look into areas of funding, including funding from the Government and the voluntary sector, as well as, as the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, dodgy funding. As part of the work programme, if there is any dodgy funding that results in unfairness, the commissioner should be able to comment on it&#151;so he or she will have to find out about it. The commissioner is funded by the public but not funding the public, if I may put it that way. There are other means of funding the public.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about forms of arbitration. We expect that to be a matter for the commissioner, but we wish the provisions of the order to work in an inclusive manner for all affected by the Troubles. That is a sensitive and global way of putting it&#151;to work in an inclusive manner. I realise that that means working with groups that people might want to work together with but not physically work together with. It is not for me to say, but I understand that it is quite the norm in Northern Ireland to have discussions in different rooms. People still come to a conclusion that they can agree to. That is fine, but it is best that we do not second-guess what the commissioner appointed under this order would do.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000068"></a>I do not want to open up a debate. I think that I have answered most of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, made. I can assure him that the United Kingdom Government&#151;the direct rule Ministers&#151;have no political or ulterior motives at all. I repeat &#147;no&#148;. We want to get out of there. We enjoy serving our fellow citizens, as I did, but the fact is that we want out. We want Northern Ireland politicians to do it. So we have no ulterior motive as the UK Government. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, mentioned narrow political ends. We have no political agenda, in that sense.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000069"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said, this is not the first time that someone has had responsibility for looking at what happens to victims and survivors, how they are treated and how the public services treat them. It is not only a question of the voluntary sector. The Government have no narrow political ends in introducing this order today.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000070"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06102577000092"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> The point that I want to make concerns the fact that here we have an Order in Council, coming forward at this stage. That is fine; I recognise that there is some urgency. But when the question is asked about a work plan, it appears that no serious thought has been given to why we are bringing forward this legislation in this form&#151;an Order in Council&#151;at this time, without having anything substantive that the Government, if things do not happen and we do not get an Assembly, or a new Assembly can build on.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000071"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06102577000093"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> In other words, we are damned if we do and damned if we do not.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000072"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06102577000094"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> To some extent.</p>

<p><a name="06102577000073"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="06102577000095"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I got that in a nutshell. We bring this forward but we do not bring it all forward because we want to have a commissioner appointed in a public and transparent way, with the help of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The agreement of the commissioner on a work plan is not something that can be imposed. If I came forward with a work plan, first I would be accused by people saying, &#147;Well, you don&#146;t expect the Northern Ireland Executive to be back, for a start&#148;. We do&#151;it is their duty to be back. Secondly, we would have pre-empted the appointment of the commissioner.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000074"></a>I am not saying that no thought has been given to those issues. We have got to the stage in the process of bringing the order forward to put the victims commissioner on a statutory basis. The order is a case of what you see is what you get. We would prefer it to be operated and implemented by the Northern Ireland Assembly&#151;that is our choice. But the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly is not an excuse for not introducing the legislation. That mantra will be repeated later this afternoon, because that is the way of the world. The reform process carries on. We want the Assembly to take it over but, if it does not, we will still carry on.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06102577000075"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="06102584000001"></a>Electricity Consents (Planning) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006</h3>
<h5><a name="06102584000039"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="06102584000002"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06102584000041"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Electricity Consents (Planning) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000003"></a>The noble Lord said: This order would introduce provisions amending the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 to bring consents for electricity projects in Northern Ireland broadly into line with those in Great Britain. The Great Britain arrangements with which those in Northern Ireland are being brought into line have existed since 1990, so it is not something that has just happened. It broadly reflects what has happened since 1990.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000004"></a>I shall comment briefly on what we are seeking to achieve with this order and then comment on the two detailed provisions. In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the world, demand for energy continues to grow. With that increased demand comes the danger of global warming and climate change. I know that noble Lords recognise that climate change is with us and that there is a necessity to take up the challenges associated with it. Renewable energy is something that Northern Ireland is uniquely placed to develop, as it has an abundance of wind, tidal and marine current potential and the opportunity to expand the contribution of renewables in a growing all-island energy market. It is with this in mind that the Secretary of State has made a commitment to establish Northern Ireland as a world leader in the development of renewable energy.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000005"></a>The order will streamline the electricity consent procedures for developers by, for the first time, charging one department with the responsibility of managing a combined consent process for electricity generating projects. The order will enable the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to grant deemed planning permission and deemed hazardous substance consent on applications for consent to construct, extend or operate an electricity generating station under Article 39, or consent to install overhead electric lines under Article 40 of the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992. Rather than the current dual process whereby a developer must apply to the Department of the Environment for planning permission or hazardous substance consent and to DETI for electricity generating consent, there will instead be one point of entry and one contact point for the developer. DETI will have the lead role in managing applications.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000006"></a>I want to make this absolutely clear, so that there is no misunderstanding: there is one entry for one consent to effectively two departments. All planning and environmental safeguards currently in place will remain and be operated. Doing it concurrently through one department rather than two will save time and money, which is in everybody&#146;s interests. The order will ensure that electricity consent applications, the vast majority of which we anticipate will be from renewable energy sources such as wind farms, are dealt with as a high priority and as efficiently and effectively as possible. I repeat that there is no attempt in the order to circumvent or cut the normal planning and environment safeguards. All applications will go through that process, but there will be one entry into government instead of entry through two departments.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000007"></a>There are two provisions in the order. Article 2 sets out the power of the department to grant deemed planning consent and deemed hazardous substance consent. Article 2 also inserts new provisions into the 1992 order to enable the department to prescribe procedures for notification of and objections to the application for electricity consent, to set out requirements for notification of a public inquiry and to appoint additional inspectors to assist in conducting an inquiry.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000008"></a>Article 3 amends the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order prohibiting planning and electricity consent procedures being carried out concurrently. That is a very important process of trying to speed the process up and cut out red tape.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000009"></a>The measures in this draft order lay the necessary foundations for ensuring that consent for important electricity generating projects is prioritised and dealt with efficiently. There is a responsibility for managing combined consents for electricity generating projects where they belong, with the DETI, which has responsibility for the strategic development of an efficient, economic and environmentally sustainable electricity industry in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000010"></a>It is as simple as that&#151;and it makes you wonder why on earth this was not done years ago. The fact of the matter is that the push that the Secretary of State wants to give in Northern Ireland to environmentally friendly renewables leads us to the view that we should remove the hurdles and barriers, some of which are plain red tape. In a way this is red tape, because there is no change to the process or the way in which consent will be looked at by planning and environment or the DETI. It is just that consent will be applied for via one department instead of two and given by one department instead of two. So it helps everybody all around. There is no attempt to circumvent the planning and environmental regulations in this order. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000011"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Electricity Consents (Planning) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="06102584000012"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="06102584000042"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I declare an interest, as I have three turbines on my land at the moment and the developing energy company is waiting for planning permission for a further number of turbines, some of which may well go on my land. But, speaking for the Conservative Party, I can say that we support this order.</p>

<p><a name="06102584000013"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06102584000043"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> We, too, welcome the order, as it seems a sensible way in which to speed up the process on electricity consents. Could the Minister reassure us that safety will always be the priority when such consents are granted?</p>

<p><a name="06102584000014"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="06102584000044"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I do not want to spoil the happy atmosphere that has surrounded the order up to this point, but I have a couple of queries, or two queries and one observation. The first query is hugely important.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000015"></a>The Minister assured us that all the normal environmental safeguards will remain intact. That is a hugely important matter, because the forms of energy that he is talking about, such as wind farms, are highly controversial in Northern Ireland. In some of the other proposals, I think that I caught a reference to tidal matters. If, as a result, a barrage is to be built across Strangford Lough to generate electricity, that will be probably the most controversial planning application in the last generation or two. These are potentially matters of great controversy.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000016"></a>The Minister says that the order will streamline the procedures and that, instead of applications to two departments, there will be an application to one department and the consent would be given by one department. That gives me great concern, and it is likely to give great concern generally. Is the consent now to be given by DETI, rather than by the Department of the Environment? The Government are bound to say that the normal environmental safeguards will be followed, in that the normal consideration will be undertaken within the Department of the Environment, but who takes the decision at the end of the day? Will people in the Department of the Environment take decisions on environmental matters or will those decisions now be in the hands of DETI.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000017"></a>The question of which department makes the decision potentially opens up a tremendous problem. If the final say goes to DETI on matters that are highly controversial in environmental terms, even when the procedures for the environment are followed through, there could be a significant lowering of environmental protection and of the extent to which the public can have their voice heard. That is the huge question.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000018"></a>I have a minor question, as well. In paragraph 1B under Article 2 of the order, a quite normal reference is made to notice to be given and,</p>
<ul><a name="06102584000038"></a>&#147;published in at least two newspapers circulating among persons likely to be affected&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06102584000037"></a>That requirement of publication is quite normal and is there in a host of legislation. But I understand that the practice is creeping in of putting those notices in what are called community papers, rather than in formal newspapers that circulate in a normal way and which you can buy in a newsagent&#146;s. That gives rise to concern, because in Northern Ireland the term &#147;community&#148; covers a multitude of sins, and to develop the practice of putting advertisements into those so-called community newspapers may defeat the object of the legislation, which is to let the whole public know&#151;and some of those newspapers are not available to the whole public.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000019"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum says that the new procedures have been introduced to streamline inquiries and to enable a multiplicity of inspectors to consider different lines or aspects of the inquiries simultaneously. The relevant paragraph ends by saying that the streamlining provision cannot be used if the Planning Appeals Commission carries out the inquiry on DETI&#146;s behalf. That underlines the problem that the commission creates in planning matters through excessive delay and the slowness of its procedures.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000020"></a>If, however, as a result of the legislation, the commission does not feature in inquiries, we need to know an awful lot more about who will be appointed as inspectors. It is all very well for the Minister to say that this brings us into line with the position in England. In England there is the Planning Inspectorate, which is formally established. The people who man it are known and their quality is known, but we do not have an equivalent in Northern Ireland. We have a Planning Appeals Commission, but if it is not to be used, who will the inspectors be? We do not have an existing inspectorate to draw on. We need to know answers to this before we can assess whether the legislation will respect the existing environmental safeguards and safeguards for public consultation in these procedures.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000021"></a>I understand the desire to enhance electricity supply and explore other forms of generation. That is perfectly understandable and, in general terms, I would welcome such proposals, but I am concerned about the points that I have raised. I hope that the Minister can allay my concerns.</p>

<p><a name="06102584000022"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="06102584000045"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I absolutely can allay the concerns because there is no substantial change in procedure here. First, there is no plan for a barrage in Strangford Lough. There is an experimental turbine in Strangford Lough for generating electricity; it is sunk into the water. That was done after proper consideration of all the environmental issues. But there is no plan for a barrage.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000023"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, says, these things are controversial. Wind farms are controversial&#151;energy generation is controversial&#151;but everybody wants the lights to go on when they flick the switch. If we do not go down this route, there will be other forms of power generation that people will find even more objectionable. There are no plans for nuclear stations in Northern Ireland&#151;and I raise the issue only as a way in which to knock it on the head. The fact is that energy use is growing in Northern Ireland, just as it is anywhere else in the UK, and we have to do better in using renewable energy. People put up these Aunt Sallies and say, &#147;We don&#146;t want coal stations that damage the atmosphere, we don&#146;t want to use fossil fuels and we don&#146;t want nuclear or wind farms or tidal barrages&#148;. But we cannot all live off the sun, because sometimes it gets dark and cloudy. We have to be responsible and say to people, &#147;We&#146;ve got to get energy in a safe way for the sake of the planet&#148;. We do not have a good record in that, so we have to move things around. Making greater use of renewable resources is one way.</p>
<h5><a name="06102584000040"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="06102584000024"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="06102584000046"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> The points that the Minister is making are not controversial. The question is whether, in doing this, there will be adequate safeguards for the environment.</p>

<p><a name="06102584000025"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0002.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="06102584000047"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I was just about to say that all the methods have the potential to do damage to the environment. The general consent among scientists is that burning fossil fuels has a highly damaging effect on the environment and the planet. Wind farms damage the visual amenity, depending on where they are located. In parts of Britain, I have seen wind farms that look really ugly. Environmental issues will arise and must be taken into account. However, if we want renewable, safe and clean energy, these decisions must be taken. You cannot say that you do not want them. All the factors&#151;location, size, visual impact, whether a wind farm should be sited on land or offshore&#151;must be looked at. There may be barrages, but there are no plans for any at the moment. There are no plans for a barrage in Strangford Lough.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000026"></a>Following the review that was instituted late last year, changes have been made in the way advertising is placed by the Government of Northern Ireland to achieve better value for money. Planning applications undoubtedly have a strong local focus. I say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, that we are talking about big energy operations&#151;they may be individual operations, but they would be large. I assure him that there will be proper and adequate advertising for these projects. Nobody will be able to say that they did not know about them. That is one of the issues with which we have to deal. However, we do not use advertising to fund papers or organisations; we use it to advertise jobs or to provide public information. We have been looking at this matter during the past year. The change followed a review of advertising policy and was aimed at getting value for money.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000027"></a>I was asked who takes the decisions. We are talking about two government departments and one Secretary of State. There has to be collective responsibility. We want a lead department to deem the planning consent, but it would not be possible for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to take the planning decision alone, ignorant of all the factors raised by the Department of the Environment and by the Environment and Heritage Service. Those bodies would be deeply involved as statutory consultees. If planning officials or the Environment and Heritage Service&#151;or indeed the Health and Safety Executive&#151;took a contrary view, it would be hard for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to take a decision that went against that view, because all the factors would have been disclosed and would be known. Ultimately, the Secretary of State would be responsible.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000028"></a>Expert consultees must be involved. The assessment of the environmental aspects of the legislation will be carried out in the Department of the Environment because it is the planning authority. Some projects, subject to changes that occur in the reform of public administration, will be assessed by local authorities when they become the planning authority. Those projects will probably be the smaller ones. However, I suspect that some energy projects, because they are infrastructure projects, will be assessed at the centre.</p>

<p><a name="06102584000029"></a>I was asked who can object. The appeals system in Northern Ireland is different from that in Great Britain. We have always said that it was not our job as direct rule Ministers to transfer to Northern Ireland what happens in Great Britain; instead, it is our job to find a process that is better for Northern Ireland. The Planning Appeals Commission has agreed to conduct public inquiries under the new electricity regime subject to consultation on the detail of its role in the inquiry and the procedure rules that will follow the order.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000030"></a>Article 3 allows inspectors to work concurrently on different aspects of the process. This is similar to what happened in planning legislation in England and Wales following the long delay over Terminal 5. That allowed different aspects of the process to be looked at at the same time, with those doing it reporting to the body that was taking the final decision, rather than a mini-inquiry being followed by another mini-inquiry and nothing being done. That is not to say that the decision is pre-taken&#151;far from it. This is a faster, fairer way of arriving at the decision.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000031"></a>The environmental and planning safeguards must be in place; that is, publicity for the application, consultation with district councils, and input from the public and the statutory consultees. The Food and Environment Protection Act, the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations will all be involved in the issuing of consents and licences. In other words, no attempt to short-cut or circumvent the existing planning and environmental rules will be made. The application will merely be made through one department instead of two. I emphasise that point, as I did more than once in my opening speech, because I do not want the wrong impression to be given in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000032"></a>The noble Lord asked about the process. Detailed processes have yet to be decided for environmental impact assessments and inquiries, but it is expected that they will follow those currently in operation in Great Britain with adaptations for the Northern Ireland context. Officials will work closely with colleagues in the DTI and across government departments in Northern Ireland and with other interested parties to develop the processes necessary. There will be full consultation on all the regulations that will flow from the order. That is the safeguard; it is not the be-all and end-all.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000033"></a>The noble Lord asked me about additional inspectors. It is envisaged that additional inspectors will be appointed by the department in circumstances where they are necessary for the progress of an inquiry, which because of its size and complexity requires additional inspectors to handle specific aspects. They will report to the lead inspector. This is virtually the same as the process under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 for England and Wales. The lead inspector will be responsible for reporting to the department. Even when devolution of planning to local government takes place&#151;if the reformed Assembly desires to proceed down that route&#151;a planning appeals process will still exist, even for small applications that are devolved. Larger planning applications will be dealt with at the centre&#151;that was implicit in the review of public administration&#151;because that is where the mass of expertise will lie.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000034"></a>I hope that I have given sufficient information to enable noble Lords to approve the order. I repeat that its purpose is to streamline. First, we want to see a big push on renewables. We make no apology about that and there is no secret about it, because budgetary funds have been made available as one of the Secretary of State&#146;s three new funds in the budget that we agreed for energy and renewables.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06102584000035"></a>There is a big push in another area, too. When I travel around England as environment and farming Minister, I praise initiatives in Northern Ireland in extracting energy from waste. Massive research projects into extracting energy from waste, whether it is food or animal waste, are taking place in some colleges and institutions in Northern Ireland. It is important to do that because it is environmentally friendly. More projects will be undertaken to meet the energy needs of Northern Ireland and to sell some of that energy to the south. We have the facility to do that and to have an all-island electricity market.</p>

<p><a name="06102584000036"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="0610263000001"></a>Rates (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006</h3>

<p><a name="0610263000002"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0610263000095"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Rates (Amendment) Northern Ireland Order 2006.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000003"></a>The noble Lord said: This will be the easiest of the three orders with which I shall have to deal. I suspect that noble Lords will have many questions about it, and that, one after another, they will in due course declare their interests because they live in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000004"></a>The order is no surprise to anybody. We wish it were being carried through by the Assembly. I understand that the work started in the Assembly with a keynote speech in 2000 and a consultation paper in 2002. This draft order is the culmination of a four-year period of research, analysis and public consultation, and puts in place a legislative framework for the introduction, in April next year, of the new rating system in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000005"></a>I am very well aware that the reforms contained in the draft order have raised a number of concerns and some controversy, and that some of those who responded to the legislative consultations were critical of the fact that they had only seven weeks in which to reply. That timetable was necessary to ensure that the legislation comes into effect in time to allow further subordinate legislation, and information technology systems and other procedures, to be introducedbefore the arrangements come into operation from1 April 2007.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000006"></a>Within the past few days, an application challenging the timetable for consultation on this draft order has been lodged in the High Court in Northern Ireland. I can tell the Committee that the court concluded that the seven-week period of consultation on the draft order was not unreasonable given that the Department of Finance and Personnel had previously carried out extensive consultation over 32 weeks during the policy development stage. The application for leave was dismissed by the court, which found no arguable case to substantiate claims that the consultation process on this legislation was inadequate. That is not my view; it is the view of the court. Obviously, I can make points because I was involved as the relevant Minister for the period in 2005-06.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000007"></a>The last of three Orders in Council associated with this process, the draft order will replace the current rating system based on outdated and inequitable rental values with one based on the individual capital value of property. I knew nothing about the system of local government finance and rating in Northern Ireland until I arrived there in May 2005. I was quickly informed that a massive amount of work was going on and had been going on for some time. I then had to remind myself of what the rates were all about. I had enough of a job doing that as a Member of Parliament for my constituents. My biggest shock was to learn that the rateable values on which the current rates are paid in Northern Ireland are based on late 1960s rental values, when the majority of properties were probably rented anyway. Today, the majority are owner-occupied.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000008"></a>Over time, there have been&#151;perhaps I may say&#151;distortions. If all the properties in Northern Ireland since, say, 1968 had gone up the same percentage in value, there would be no difference in what people would pay. This is not a revenue-raising measure. It is revenue neutral: it is another way of raising the same amount of money. If the value of all properties had gone up by the same percentage, there would be no change. But the world is not like that. The value of some properties has gone up vastly more than others. Therefore, there is inequity and unfairness in the system, which can be shown.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000009"></a>Our assessment is that, under the new rates system, 55 per cent of households will pay the same as or less than they do now. In fact, 68 per cent of the population will pay only &#163;1 a week more, the same or less. So there are far more gainers than losers under this system, which is a key criterion for changing local government finance, as the Conservative Party found out when it brought in the poll tax with more losers than gainers. Northern Ireland did not &#147;benefit&#148; from the poll tax; that is why it has not benefited from the council tax. There has been no reform of local government finance or rating in Northern Ireland while these reforms have gone on in England, Wales and Scotland, which has made the situation incredibly unfair.</p>
<h5><a name="0610263000090"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000010"></a>The new system and process are about introducing a rating system that distributes the rating burden among Northern Ireland households in a fairer way than at present. It is not about raising more money from rates. I want to be absolutely clear on that. The new system will be fairer than the present arrangements, more transparent and more easily understood. How can one explain to people in 2006 that the fixing of their rates is based on the rental value of their property in the 1970s? It is designed to confuse people. Some people have a vested interest in confusing ordinary ratepayers about how difficultlife is.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000011"></a>Generally speaking, people understand the market value of a property. There are exceptions, such as social rented housing, which I understand and will come back to. But, by and large, the buying and selling of property puts a value on it. It is not a question of saying, &#147;You&#146;ve got to pay more because you&#146;ve got a conservatory&#148;, or, &#147;You&#146;ve got to pay more because you&#146;ve got a garage&#148;, or, &#147;You&#146;ve got to pay more because you have a nice view&#148;. That happens anyway: people pay the price of a property because they like it and are prepared to pay a certain value as a willing buyer to a willing seller. The individual takes into account a whole gamut of things from the number, shape and size of the rooms, the size of the garden and all those things. It is not that these things are new; they are intrinsic in the value of a property that exchanges hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000012"></a>At the moment, 25 per cent of all households in Northern Ireland receive assistance with their rates bills, and 20 per cent of households&#151;140,000 homes&#151;pay no rates: one in five households pays no rates. Under the terms of this draft order, more families and individuals on low incomes will receive help than happens under the present system. There is more gain for low-income families and households.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000013"></a>The order provides for a transitional relief scheme, new relief arrangements for those in full-time education and training, and an allowance for people with a disability whose home has been modified because of the disability. The work that is done by way of aids and adaptations can sometimes&#151;not always&#151;have the effect of increasing the value of the property. People with a disability should not suffer because of that, so there is an allowance, which is not means tested. The system also includes a number of non-domestic measures aimed at providing assistance to rural businesses for which there was generally widespread support through the consultation process.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000014"></a>I do not propose in my opening remarks to list every provision contained in the draft order. I am sure that Members of the Committee have absorbed its content and, because they live there, will have had communications from the relevant government department about their own circumstances. But I will highlight some of the more important issues.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000015"></a>On domestic reforms, Article 14 introduces a new rate relief scheme, providing assistance beyond that awarded through the statutory housing benefit system. Households will be able to earn more than at present and still be entitled to help with their rates. A power is included in the legislation to allow relief to be directed at particular groups and to adjust the level of assistance provided, which will be an important mechanism to allow local politicians to tailor the system as they see fit.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000016"></a>I was part of the collective team that made these decisions and we all had personal views on what kind of allowances there should be for special groups. We took the view that we should not create a complicated system, but legislate sufficiently to allow locally elected politicians, if they wished, to introduce different reliefs for different groups, be they single people living alone or pensioners or whatever. That should be left to local decision-making; it should not be done by direct-rule Ministers. We have therefore created the legislative power and designed a system that operates from day one, gives more help to low-income households, and allows people to earn more money than at present and still be entitled to help with their rates. We regret that this debate is not taking place at Stormont, but that is where we are at the moment.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000017"></a>I commend the efforts of everybody who has been involved in this massive process. It has been coupled with the peace process, which has brought us to the verge of the reinstitution of the Assembly&#151;we sincerely hope that that will take place. I hope that the determination to get a grip on the situation and send the direct-rule, part-time, commuting Ministers packing is so strong in politicians of Northern Ireland that they will grasp the opportunity to take back power and then make the decisions that are implicit in this order.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000018"></a>In the detail of the agreement that was made atSt Andrews is a commitment from the Government to introduce a maximum cap on rates and to examine the possibility of providing further relief for pensioners on low incomes. However, I repeat that this will be subject to the restoration of the devolved Assembly. A further carrot is therefore on offer for the people of Northern Ireland if their own elected politicians take the opportunity that was offered atSt Andrews. The draft order makes provision for the measures to be introduced, so there would not be any legal and parliamentary delay. If the Assembly fails to be restored, the Government will take forwardreform in these areas as they see fit. That is our responsibility; if the Assembly is not restored, we will have to do it.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000019"></a>Article 15 provides for full relief from rates where a property is solely occupied by someone under 18, for young people leaving care or those in full-time training and education. This reflects our commitment to strengthen and develop opportunities for young people to continue in full-time education.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000020"></a>Articles 16 and 17 modify the current definition of disability and allow, as I have said, a 25 per cent reduction in rates where a property is occupied by a person with a disability and it has been modified because of that. Current recipients will retain their current allowance if it is higher than the 25 per cent under the new system, so there will be no losers. Article 18 enables relief to be awarded where rate bills increase by more than 33 per cent over and above what they would otherwise have been.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000021"></a>The package of relief measures is not a scattergun attempt at appeasement; it is the result of exhaustive and careful analysis. It follows robust discussions among Ministers about what we should do about certain reliefs&#151;whether we should introduce some, but leave others for the Assembly to decide to introduce. Let us be clear; any extra reliefs will cost money. They will be paid for by other ratepayers. The money is finite in that sense. This is a no-cost operation; it is not designed to raise more money. Therefore, reliefs for one group will be paid for by another group of ratepayers. That decision comes with the responsibility of elected office.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000022"></a>I emphasise that the measures have been designed specifically to assist those most in need, reflecting our aim that the focus should be on ability to pay. That was central to our plans. The only exception throughout the system is the 25 per cent reductionin rates for households where there has been modification due to disability. That is not based on ability to pay. These relief measures will become operational in April 2007, once the new systemgoes live.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000023"></a>In addition to the reform of the domestic rates, there are some non-domestic provisions that will assist businesses in rural areas. The agricultural sector will be given support through the introduction of a farm diversification relief scheme that will operate along similar lines to schemes in Great Britain. The Government are hopeful that this measure will reduce dependency on agriculture and sustain the economies of declining rural areas by granting relief for new enterprises that were previously agricultural. The draft order gives effect to this through Article 24.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000024"></a>It is universally accepted by all knowledgeable people&#151;I was going to say, by all right-thinking people&#151;that the current rating system in Northern Ireland needs to be replaced. It needs replacing because that is how to get more help for the low-paid families. There is no question about that. We want a fairer system. It is true that there will be some people who will pay more, including those people who live in those great big mansions that I have seen in parts of Belfast&#151;which I must say I was quite astonished to see, as I travelled around. Not everybody is income rich, even though they might be asset rich; I understand that. But our arrangements for relief go beyond housing benefit, so some of the people who would not at the moment qualify for housing benefit because they are a bit too wealthy will be brought into the system, which enables us to give more relief to people on low incomes.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000025"></a>The new system is more transparent and easier to understand, based as it is on capital values set at January 2005. For some people, those capital values will look a bit low as houses change hands now, in October 2006. But there has to be a particular day when the values of 700,000-odd houses are considered. There is a range of reliefs for ratepayers, which, as I have said, will benefit many more families on low incomes than is currently the case. That reflects the decision of the previous Northern Ireland Executive to introduce a relief scheme based on ability to pay. That is not a scheme invented by direct rule Ministers. It is true that we have processed it over the past few years with research and consultation. The idea that the old system, if I can call it that, needed looking at came from the Northern Ireland Executive when it was in place. We have just taken it forward rather than ossifying everything at a particular date. It is a much fairer system for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000026"></a>The people of Northern Ireland are not being used as guinea pigs. I have heard it said that they are and I have seen it in the press&#151;I keep up to date as much as I can. There is no plan in that regard. The system has been designed for Northern Ireland; it is a system that works elsewhere in the world, so it is not as though we have invented the wheel. It is much fairer than the council tax in England&#151;there is no question about that&#151;and it is certainly fairer than the poll tax. Above all, it is a lot fairer than the present way in which people in Northern Ireland pay their rates. That is the central point, and it is the duty of elected representatives to put over the fact that it is a fairer and more transparent system, which is easy to understand and which provides more help for people on low incomes. I am proud to move this Motion. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000027"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the draft Rates (Amendment) Northern Ireland Order 2006.&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker.</I>)</p>

I know only too well how much he knows about these matters. I also accept that the rating system in Northern Ireland needed overhauling. In no way would I challenge that. Things have changed dramatically&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0610263000029"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 6 pm to 6.10 pm</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="0610263000030"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0610263000097"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I shall not repeat my opening remarks, but shall pick up the main thrust of my argument. We agree with the Government that the rating system urgently needs to be overhauled, but we disagree strongly in a number of areas about the way in which they have done it.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000031"></a>What concerns me most is the way in which this matter has been used. There is no hurry to get this rating order through. The Minister told me that the rating review is revenue neutral, and I believe it will be in year one. However, after that, it will not be, and no one can kid me that it will. If the review is revenue neutral, there is no hurry. No money will be wasted or lost. We all believe and hope that devolution will return to Northern Ireland, and we are supporting the Government as part of the team to bring that about. This business was started by the Assembly, so why the rush? Why not let it finish it in the way that it wants to do it now? Why threaten it by saying that if this is done in the Assembly there can be a cap, but if it is not, there will not be one? Getting this serious business about the lives of people in Northern Ireland mixed up with the St Andrews agreement, peace agreements and other political stuff is wrong. It may be said that I am naÃ¯ve, but I do not think it is the right way to go about it. This matter has been taken out of context and used wrongly. It has created a certain amount of heat and made the Secretary of State seem to be a bully. I do know whether he is, but it is not a good way to allow him to be seen. There should be a cap of some sort, but I am not going to suggest where it should be.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000032"></a>The valuation process has not been taken into account. The Minister said that very few people owned their own houses 20 years ago, but now many do. However, most people who own their own houses&#151;over 60 per cent of them, at least&#151;probably bought them 20 or more years ago. There is not a big, mobile market. There is a market for new houses, which are bought by successful entrepreneurs, their families or first-time buyers. There is already a huge problem for first-time buyers, which is common to England and Wales, and this system will not help them, but will make their position considerably more difficult. That is not right.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000033"></a>I apologise to the Committee for not declaring an interest in this matter; I live in Northern Ireland and will be paying rates under the new system.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000034"></a>People on pensions who are living in their family home after their family has gone off will not have any money to pay the rates. They could well be living in a nice four-bedroom house in a nice area, but they are not wealthy. Their house is probably worth a lot of money, perhaps &#163;500,000 or more, but unless they sell it, they do not have &#163;500,000 in the bank or even &#163;100,000 to cover the rates. That is extremely unfair.</p>
<h5><a name="0610263000091"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000035"></a>The same can be said about young families or about farming families throughout the country who live in nice places in small- or medium-sized farmhouses. Anyone who, like the Minister, has had anything to do with the farming industry anywhere&#151;let alone in Northern Ireland&#151;knows that people can do no more than make a wage as a farmer. It is a wonderful way of life for those who like it, but all they can do is earn a wage. If the value of their property is raised to something that an entrepreneur might payto have a nice place around him&#151;&#163;350,000 or &#163;500,000&#151;the farmer living in it does not have the means to meet the rate increase that he will face. There is a series of issues in that area that I am unhappy with.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000036"></a>I am unhappy also about the business of being deemed to have been unreasonable or to have failed to give reasonable assistance to people valuing the house, for which one can be fined &#163;1,000. Who will decide whether someone has been unreasonable? I read the order to mean that people will be taken to court and given a criminal record because they happen to have an argument on the backdoor step with an official from a government department. I find that pretty heavy-handed.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000037"></a>There is also the business of flying overhouses, particularly country houses, to take aerial photographs. We live in a world where crime is still going up. Terrorism may be going down, but crime is going up. The smart guys will get their hands on those photographs to study the ways in to the house. They can then send a bogus surveyor to look at the house and get the information from him. It is just wide open. I do not see the sense in it. It is criminally wrong for the Government to go into that detail.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000038"></a>This order needs to be radically amended to deal with all sorts of loopholes, many of which I have not mentioned. My party&#151;I am speaking from the Dispatch Box and not for myself&#151;finds this order deeply disturbing in many ways. This issue should never have been involved in the St Andrews process. Consent is not won by threatening people that, if they do not comply, the tax on the roof over their heads will be too high. The policy should have been&#151;and should still be&#151;left to the elected representatives of Northern Ireland to determine and, in the absence of a devolved Assembly, it should have been afforded the full scrutiny of the normal Bill process.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000039"></a>I heard what the Minister said, but from the point of view of the whole country, Northern Ireland should not be bullied into being the test bed for a policy that the Government do not have the courage to try out first in England or Scotland. This order is a grim warning about where the Government are heading. This party cannot support this order. We ask the Government to withdraw it. If they do not, we shall seek a means when it returns to the Floor of the House to give the House an opportunity to cast its verdict on the deplorable policy and grubby tactics involved in it.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000040"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0610263000098"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> The Minister is going to hear more of the same from these Benches, which gives me no pleasure. Nevertheless, I thank him for introducing the order. In the press and in background publications, the Government have talked about the introduction of a fairer system of rates for Northern Ireland. While we agree that the current system needs to be reformed, we object to the proposals in the order. The proposed system is blatantly not fair; in fact, it is grossly unfair. The Secretary of State has made comparisons with England and Wales, but such comparisons have little relevance because they operate on a different local taxation system and the structure of the cost of living is different from Northern Ireland. However, if we want to go down that route, the Minister will find that the average Northern Ireland household income is19 per cent lower than that in the UK, that more Northern Ireland households&#151;21 per cent&#151;rely on benefits than in the UK overall, where the average is 12 per cent, and that Northern Ireland households pay 26 per cent more for fuel, light and power than the rest of the UK.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000041"></a>A major concern that has arisen in government consultations on this issue is that the scheme does not take into account a person&#146;s ability to pay. We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about property prices in Northern Ireland. Indeed, they are rocketing. A recent <I>Belfast Telegraph</I> article reported that house prices are rising at a rate of &#163;110 a day, compared with a rise of just &#163;30 a day&#151;which is still enough&#151;in the rest of the UK. The Nationwide house price survey for the third quarter of this year showed the average price of a house in Northern Ireland to be &#163;159,859, which is a 33.4 per cent increase on last year. The average price of a house in Belfast is at an all-time high of &#163;204,816, which is a 24 per cent rise in the past 12 months. In such circumstances, a person who bought his house 10 or 20 years ago, when property prices in Northern Ireland were significantly lower, is likely to find himself with a huge increase in his rates payments, which he may not necessarily be able to afford to pay, especially if he is on a fixed income.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000042"></a>As we have already heard, pensioners are extremely worried about their ability to afford the new rates, and the public response to the consultation carried out in 2004 contained many stories from pensioners or people approaching retirement who were extremely worried that their houses are now worth considerably more than they were when they were bought. Because such people are now retired and their incomes are fixed, they will find it extremely difficult to pay the increased rates. A large proportion of those who face rate bills that top &#163;3,000 will be older people who have retired from work. Massive extra bills will create havoc for those who have to pay them and for those who have to collect them, as larger numbers of people may not be able to afford to pay. Those older people worked hard throughout their careers to pay for their home, and they retired safe in the knowledge that they had paid off their mortgage and their financial situation was sound. It is not so any more. With rate bills of more than &#163;3,000 falling on their doormats, they now face a situation in which they own their home but cannot afford to live in it. This situation is potentially catastrophic for them. Furthermore, punitive rates will hit the economy hard by reducing disposable incomes in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000043"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to hear me ask what consideration was given to the introduction of a regional income tax based on a person&#146;s ability to pay, rather than on the value of his home. The Secretary of State has spoken about a cap on rates, and there has been some discussion of rate relief for pensioners, but neither of those proposals is in the order that we are looking at today. There is provision in the order for a rate relief scheme, and such a scheme is to come forward in regulations, if the department decides to bring forward such regulations at all, but what chance will Parliament have to debate and discuss such a scheme? Who will qualify for it? It is unacceptable for the Government to ask the Committee to consent to this order without the details of the scheme being in place.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000044"></a>However, our concerns are about not just the content of the order, but also why it has been brought forward at this time. The Minister sought to explain the Government&#146;s position on that. The Secretary of State made a Statement in the House only a week and a half ago that heralded the agreement at St Andrews as opening a way to a new dawn for democracy in Northern Ireland. We welcomed that Statement and congratulated the Government on the work that they had done to achieve such an accord. However,24 November is now less than a month away and, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked, is this legislation so vital that it must be pushed through Parliament at this time? If the Government were to wait until after 24 November, we would know whether the Assembly will be restored. If it is restored, would it not be better for local politicians, who are accountable to the people of Northern Ireland, to introduce a rate system that they feel best suits the needs of Northern Ireland? Indeed, the parties have been asked to respond to the St Andrews agreement by 10 November, which is only two and a half weeks away. By then, we should know whether there is a clear indication that a First Ministerand Deputy First Minister will be nominated on24 November. How can the Government say that this legislation must be pushed through today, before we have a clear indication of the prospect of devolution, when this process has been ongoing since May 2000?</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000045"></a>The process of rates reform was begun by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It should be concluded by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It should not be pushed through Westminster when there is a real chance that the politicians of Northern Ireland, who have been elected to take decisions on issues such as this, will be exercising power&#151;as we hope&#151;in the Assembly within a matter of weeks.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000046"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0610263000099"></a>Lord Rogan:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing this order. I shall start by agreeing with him that most people in the Province agree that the rating system in Northern Ireland was in need of reform. We share the aim of the order, which is to make the rating system in Northern Ireland fair and more understandable. However, I, like most people in Northern Ireland, feel that that has not been achieved by it. I shall mention several areas of concern.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000047"></a>There are inconsistencies between the order and the law as it applies in England and Wales. I should declare an interest as I live in Notting Hill. I have lived there for 20-odd years. Unfortunately, it is not Notting Hill in London. If I lived in Notting Hill in London, I would be paying rates of about &#163;3,000, but, because I live in Notting Hill in Northern Ireland, my rates will be upwards of &#163;6,000. Capping rates is acceptable in England and Wales, but it was not acceptable in Northern Ireland in September. Now, in October, it is apparently acceptable. What has changed to make it acceptable now when it was not acceptable a month ago? I do not believe that I heard the Minister correctly. I am sure that I got him wrong when I heard him say that it was changed as a punishment for the electorate for non-agreement with the politicians.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000048"></a>However, I shall be positive for a minute. Following the so-called St Andrews agreement, we are now told that the Government are looking at a cap of about &#163;3,000, which is positive, but surely we need more details. Why put the cap at the maximum level for England? Why would it not be more appropriate for it to be at the slightly lower maximum figure for Wales, an area that is more similar to Northern Ireland in per capita- income terms?</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000049"></a>There is another inconsistency. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has said, many households in Northern Ireland are asset rich and cash poor. I agree with him. We are not speaking about large farmers or landholders. In many cases, we are speaking of old-age pensioners, people who bought their houses some 20 years ago, widows and widowers&#151;people whose assets have increased but whose income has, unfortunately, not increased proportionately to pay these rates. There is a clear case for a single- occupancy and pensioners&#146; discount in the Northern Ireland system. Again, this applies in England. Surely Northern Ireland ratepayers should not be denied this relief.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000050"></a>The Minister has argued that the new rates system represents a win for most Northern Ireland property owners: 55 per cent are the same or better off, and only 45 per cent are worse off. I ask him to clarify whether the 55 per cent he speaks of is inclusive of those who were already not paying any rates because of housing benefits. The Minister said that the new system is revenue neutral. Surely that is inconsistent with the Government&#146;s policy of increasing revenue from rates in future.</p>
<h5><a name="0610263000093"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0610263000051"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0610263000100"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I can answer some points, but I probably did not sufficiently explain the benefits to low-income people. I will not go over it again.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000052"></a>I know that we are far more polite in the House of Lords, but the Liberal Democrats should be ashamed of themselves. More low-income people will benefit under this system than under the present arrangements. Even a pensioner couple living in a &#163;500,000 house would have to have incomes of over &#163;35,000 and/or savings of over &#163;16,000 in order not to get any help under this new system. At that level, they would still get help. They are going to be the minority. Most of the speeches that I have heard only make the case for the 45 per cent of those who have benefited under the present system. Obviously, because there has been no revaluation for nearly 40 years and house prices have gone up by different percentages in different areas, people have clearly gained. We must take account of that.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000053"></a>We cannot go down the road of local income tax. It is seductive but impossible to explain, as the last general election proved. Property taxes are cheap to raise; the cost of admin is cheap, which is an important factor. You do not want to waste money collecting the tax in the first place, you want to collect the tax. Doing so on a basis that people can understand must be fairer.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000054"></a>Before I respond to the individual issues, I must apologise. This is one of the problems of being part of the action when the issues are being discussed, but not being part of it at the end. I thought that we had put a single-person option unrelated to ability to pay into the order, but it is not there. I alluded to the fact that it may be. There are things that the Assembly can do, but they are all related to the ability to pay&#151;low-income households and low-income pensioners. They are things that are specific to pensioners, but they are related to income.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000055"></a>The only non-means-tested relief to which I referred is the one for people with a disability, when the house has been modified because of the disability. That 25 per cent is not means tested, but the other relief that is non-means-tested is the one for young people or people in education living in a household. That is related not to ability to pay but to the pursuit of education and the age of the young people. I apologise for that.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000056"></a>Most people in Northern Ireland will gain. That is the central issue, which people do not seem to appreciate. It is very difficult to argue against more people gaining, which is what the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats appear to be doing. This is not the poll tax, which meant more losers; with this, there are more gainers. I gave the figures of 68 per cent, if one looks at it in terms of households, of people who either gain, remain the same or pay less than &#163;1 extra. If you take the narrow view of gainers and losers,55 per cent of people will either have the same situation or they will gain.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000057"></a>I appreciate that the people who tend to complain are the losers. Most people, but not all, who tend to be the losers in this are those living in the properties whose value has gone up faster than the average. If they had all gone up on average, there would be no difference.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000058"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0610263000101"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> Does the Minister appreciate that the majority of those people are pensioners who have very little ready income?</p>

<p><a name="0610263000059"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0610263000102"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Yes, but I gave an example. A pensioner, even in a house worth &#163;500,000&#151;and I do not know whether there are many houses of that value with pensioners living in them&#151;would have to have savings of more than &#163;16,000 and/or &#163;35,000 gross annual income not to get any help with the rates. It is not as if they will be penalised. The idea that we are penalising pensioners who are living in high-value houses, irrespective of income, cannot be true. Those are not nominal sums of money; in modern parlance, &#163;16,000 savings or &#163;35,000 annual income. Those pensioners will still get help and gain under the present system; they are not losers. That is in a house worth &#163;500,000; not to mention houses of lesser value in which the gainers would gain more.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000060"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0610263000103"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I draw to the Minister&#146;s attention the figures that are available on the Valuation Agency&#146;s website, which shows that the question of gainers and losers depends very much on geographical locality. In Newry and Mourne, 57 per cent of people are losers; in Cookstown, it is 63 per cent; in Dungannon, it is59 per cent; in Castlereagh it is 67 per cent; and in Belfast it is 56 per cent. I wonder where all the gainers are when all those losers are piling up in area after area. Has the Minister looked at the quality impact assessment that was done on this, which showed that the effects were really quite disproportionate in some categories?</p>

<p><a name="0610263000061"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0610263000104"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I have seen some of the figures in some of the areas relating to communities and their housing, but some communities are living in lower value housing than other communities, and they will gain, because their houses have not gone up as much as the average. If that is the case in pockets of communities, someone might claim that we are being beneficial to one tradition rather than another. We are not. It just happens to be that the dwellings that they are living in have not gone up as much as the dwellings that others are living in.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000062"></a>Noble Lords cannot defend, I hope, the fact that there has been no revaluation in the past 40 years. If there had been rateable value revaluations&#151;as is supposed to happen and did so before, every 10 years or so&#151;you would catch up. It is all very well the noble Baroness saying &#147;Yes, I agree&#148;, but because there has been no revaluation, hundreds of thousands of people have lost out. They are paying more rates than they should because their houses have not increased by as much rateable or saleable value as others. Why should they lose out? They become the gainers under this system. They happen to be the majority of households in Northern Ireland. One can always make a case out of where people live, but we are not taxing people on where they live but on the value of the properties they are in. Because they have not all increased by the same amount, some people have gained more than others. Others have lost more than others. That is what we are trying to put right with a fairer system, so that we are on a level playing field.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked, since we would be willing to introduce a cap on the higher values following the return of devolution, why not now? We have put forward a fairer system, taking account of ability to pay. If devolution is restored, and we hope it is, a cap will be introduced. This reflects the concerns of local politicians about the impact of the reforms on certain groups. If we get devolution back, it will be local politicians effectively making the decisions. Until they are back, the status quo as planned in the order will apply. However, relief to one group will have to be paid for by other groups. That is the reality under the system in England.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000064"></a>I was also asked about introducing a cap at the same level as Wales. Lowering the threshold after 2006-07 would simply increase the impact on other ratepayers. It is revenue neutral for the year in which it is introduced, but if you change things afterwards and the pot of money to be raised remains the same from the same dwellings, and you then distort the system to give relief to some groups, you must raise the level on everybody else.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, thought that collecting data by photographs was criminally wrong. It may be a difference between the devolved admin of Northern Ireland and England, but I was surprised that the information about housing in Northern Ireland held by the Valuation Agency is much greater than that held about English homes by local authorities. We did not need property information for the poll tax; it was irrelevant and sort of abandoned. Because the Valuation Agency has a comprehensive database, constantly refreshed since the 1970s, it did not use aerial photographs to produce these figures; it did not need to. The information they have about dwellings in Northern Ireland is astonishing. The photographs, by the way, are already in the public domain; it is nothing to do with the rates. Anyone can go on to a website and check properties anywhere around the world. This has been approached in an open and transparent fashion, but the Valuation Agency already held enough information to make these valuations because of its normal processes over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000066"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about relief measures to ensure that there is maximum take-up. I accept that the minute you start means testing anything, you must ensure that people understand it. The Rate Collection Agency is looking at a range of measures that will make it easier to claim housing benefits, and looking at working more closely with the voluntary and community sectors. It will also use the media and information seminars. I accept that this is a big change for Northern Ireland. It is a cultural change, which affects every household in Northern Ireland. Whether they pay rates or not, it is a big change. Therefore, the maximum possible publicity and information has to be given. I have given figures relating to pensioners and this is not an attack on them. More people will gain than lose under the new system.</p>
<h5><a name="0610263000094"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000067"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about local income tax, on which I am serious. Obviously, it is very seductive to have a local income tax, but that is not government policy. Her party was completely unable to explain it at the last election. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 prevents a local income tax and some other taxation matters being introduced. There was very little support for that measure during the extensive consultation exercise. There would also be concerns about the potential to evade it compared with a property tax. As I say, it is a lot cheaper to collect a property tax than it is to collect from individuals. It would certainly have a disproportionate impact on employees.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked me whether people in rural areas benefit from the same level of service provision. It is true that distances are greater. It is for the community &#147;kitty&#148; to collect the money to pay for services and for a small proportion of public expenditure in Northern Ireland. It is not as though a massive amount is collected for that and most it&#151;I will be corrected on this&#151;comes from general taxation rather than local rates.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000069"></a>There is no question that Northern Ireland has got a dispersed population. It is so dispersed that there is a bungalow in almost every field, but I do not want to start another debate. There is no doubt that service provision tends to be more expensive where that is the case and the problem is exacerbated. It is no different in rural areas of Wales. Services are not just for the local council, they are also for the region and one has to make a judgment over everything. I have already refuted the allegation that Northern Ireland is being used as a test bed for reforms in Great Britain. It is not. We deliberately adopted specific systems for Northern Ireland that take account of local circumstances and avoided a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000070"></a>The Lyons Inquiry is reviewing local government financing and funding, and I would not want to pre-empt discussions. Clearly, anyone interested in local government reform will have a look at what is happening in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the world. It is a very sensitive issue. Local government tax is probably the single biggest up-front tax that most people pay, which is why council tax is so unpopular in England. When you pay PAYE, VAT and excise duty, you do not notice them up front. When you get the bill for council tax, you know about it, which makes it very unpopular.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000071"></a>The noble Lord also asked me about the miscellaneous powers that justify fining people who refuse to give government officers entry to their property. The power of entry provided in the order would be used only in exceptional circumstances. I understand that this power is less intrusive, rather than more. As far as I know, it has not been used in collecting the values for the 700,000 dwellings in Northern Ireland. We need people to co-operate as neighbours and we need to take action against those who opt out of providing part of the kitty. There has been no need to use the powers of entry in order to collect the information.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000072"></a>Our view is that first-time buyers will benefit. The properties that have risen less than average tend to be those that first-time buyers go for. First-time buyers will gain because their rates will be less than they are today. So the new system will benefit first-time buyers. If you are a first-time buyer going in for a &#163;300,000 house, perhaps that will not apply, but the vast majority of first-time buyers buy houses that are less than the average price and that have gone up, by and large, by less than the average over the past 40 years. Therefore, under this system, they will pay less in council tax than they do in rates. First-time buyers will gain, most people will gain and most pensioners will gain. I cannot believe that people will not want this new system.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000073"></a>Why are we rushing this order through in time for the November Privy Council? That is assuming it gets parliamentary approval, and I take nothing for granted. This has been a lengthy process, and it is part of a wider reform. We cannot simply leave this matter alone and say that, because the process has taken so long and is revenue neutral, we do not need to do it. The work has been done, the consultations have taken place, the information technology is in place and the preparatory work has been substantial. It is a fairer system and because there are more gainers than losers&#151;the figures back us up on that&#151;why should we hold back? We want to get more aid to the low paid, faster. That is why we have introduced the order rather than delayed it.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000074"></a>I have dealt with the cap and restoration. Not introducing a cap affects less than 0.5 per cent ofrate payers, about 3,000 dwellings out of 700,000 dwellings, but I accept that a small number of people are affected by that. I have dismissed the bullying charge. I am not saying that I do not take it seriously, but I do not think that noble Lords took the view that we had been bullying; as I said, powers of entry have not been used.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000075"></a>The equality impact assessment found that Protestants and people in the &#147;other religion&#148; category are likely to face an above-average increase in their rates bill in the new system, but, in many cases, that is linked to affordability, and where that is not the case, assistance will be provided for those on low incomes. The initial analysis undertaken on the basis of the new capital values published early this year shows that the difference on the basis of religion in average rates bills under the new system will virtually disappear once the other factors are controlled. Once we can control for ability to pay and other matters, the difference on religion disappears, which is a good thing. The difference is because in some areas, people live in community blocks and values have gone up at different rates; the distortion has not been caused by religion but by the increase in valuation. We have to make that clear.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000076"></a>We accept that certain councils have a higher percentage of households that will pay more, but often very little is being paid. For example, the noble Lord mentioned Newry and Mourne. I accept that averages can be very misleading, but one has to use a figure. The current average bill is &#163;660 a year, and the new average bill will be &#163;713 a year. In Cookstown, the current average bill is &#163;601 a year, and the new average bill will be &#163;642. That works out at about 75p a week. I do not think I would go to jail for that.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked whether this order is inconsistent with the policy to increase revenue. The noble Baroness must appreciate that reforms we are talking about today and the level of future rate increases are separate issues. This reform is designed to raise the same amount of money, but that is not to say that year on year more money will not be needed to pay for wage increases for public servants and for progress in the services provided, but we can separate that out. None of the increases will come about because of this change. This change is revenue neutral. It is not a change designed to bring in more money to start with.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000078"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0610263000105"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> Does the Minister&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0610263000079"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0610263000106"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Can I just finish this point? It is not unimportant. The other order that I would have brought forward, relating to water, has not been brought forward for reasons we understand&#151;I do not want to go down that route. If that reform does not come in, it will cost the Northern Ireland Budget a substantial sum of money, and it can come in only based on the new capital values of properties rather than the old system. That is another reason why we need a more modern system of rateable values. I gladly give way; I think I have finished.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000080"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0610263000107"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I thank the Minister. He is being unrealistic. It has been, as he knows, Treasury policy to insist on substantial annual increases in rates for quite some time. While the Minister hopes that this proposal will be revenue neutral in the year in which it is introduced, there will be a significant increase in rates in that year because of the Treasury&#146;s requirements. People on the ground are obviously going to judge this new system on the basis of the bills they receive. The 45 per cent, in particular, but also the 55 per cent, are likely to find themselves facing large increases because of the Treasury.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000081"></a>The Treasury&#146;s insistence on rate increases will probably damn these proposals in the eyes of the people of Northern Ireland when they get their bills. The Minister is being quite unrealistic by emphasising that it is not a revenue-raising measure. The rates are a revenue-raising measure from the point of view of the Treasury, and the Minister knows that.</p>

<p><a name="0610263000082"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0610263000108"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Let us get this clear. The rate increase this year was the decision of the direct rule Minister within the overall &#163;9 billion budget. We chose to raise the rates by a fairly large figure to get extra money for extra services. It was not a question of the Treasury telling us to raise the rates; we did not do it that way. </p>

<a name="61025-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000083"></a>We have a budget&#151;a fixed amount, it is true. Do not forget that there is more public expenditure per head in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK. Northern Ireland is not badly served in public expenditure per head&#151;believe you me. That would be a debate I would advise noble Lords not to open up.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000084"></a>The rate increase this year was not Treasury led. I take my full share of responsibility. It was a local tax&#151;a local charge&#151;that Ministers in Northern Ireland could change. It would be exactly the same with locally elected Ministers. We saw the need for more money for three pots of services; we created extra funds for children, training and energy, and were quite open about why we did it. However, I repeat: the new system, year on year, does not raise more revenue. I am not saying more revenue will not flow, because&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0610263000085"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0610263000109"></a>Lord Laird:</b> Well&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0610263000086"></a><b><a name="61025-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0610263000110"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Well, yes! That is all very well, but is the noble Lord therefore saying that public servants in Northern Ireland should not get a pay increase next year? Of course not. Where will the pay increase come from&#151;an increase from the ratepayer? That has nothing to do with the change from rates to the modern system. People in Northern Ireland will understand that. Their taxes are like that; it is exactly the same. If that is the argument, I shall be quite happy to have it. I am sure, however, that people do not want to go down the road of saying, &#147;Let&#146;s freeze all the public sector pay in Northern Ireland, because we do not want to increase the rates&#148;. Of course we are not going to do that.</p>

<a name="61025-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0610263000087"></a>This change is not the reason for any increase to pay for public servants&#146; pay increases. The figures will show that at the time. I cannot make it any clearer than that. I do not want to raise temperatures here by raising figures. This has gone on for some years. You must make the case forcibly: there are more gainers than losers and more help for the low paid under the new system. If noble Lords want to vote down the order, they must face and argue against that. That is why I am labouring the point. It is a fairer, understandable system. If people want to vote against it on that basis, they must take responsibility for their actions. That is why I am presenting it as I have.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="06102586000010"></a>I am pleased to advise the House that we have agreed to extend the existing grant-in-aid paid to the National Memorial Arboretum Company Ltd in support of the running costs of the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire. The current grant of &#163;250,000 a year was due to expire in October 2006. It will be extended for a further three-year period, initially at the current level but increased in line with inflation from October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="06102586000011"></a><b><a name="61025-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06102586000032"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="06102586000012"></a>On 1 April 2004 my right honourable friend the Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy) announced the Government's intention to establish public inquiries into the deaths of Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright, following reports by Mr Justice Cory. In his Statement to the House that day my right honourable friend said:</p>
<ul><a name="06102586000029"></a>&#147;We will, of course, take all reasonable steps to control costs in the inquiries that I have announced today, including capping legal costs where appropriate&#148;.&#151;(<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 1/4/04; col. 1757.)</ul>
<p><a name="06102586000028"></a>In line with that Statement, I subsequently agreed a number of measures to ensure that the inquiries would, while having the resources to establish the full facts in each case, operate in a cost-effective manner. These measures included maximum hourly rates payable for publicly funded legal representation by counsel and solicitors; and a 40-hour cap on hours that might be claimed in any given week. The chairmen of all three inquiries have taken seriously the need to ensure that the inquiries operate in a cost-effective manner, and I am grateful to themfor that.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="06102586000013"></a>The inquiry considering the death of Billy Wright is now under way under the chairmanship ofthe right honourable Lord MacLean. Following representations from him I granted his requests to be converted into an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 under Section 15 of that Act.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="06102586000014"></a>Section 40(4) of the Inquiries Act contains a power for a Secretary of State to place conditions or qualifications on any awards that the chairman of the inquiry may make under Section 40(1) and 40(2)in respect of compensation, expenses or legal representation. After discussions with the inquiry, I have decided today to issue the following notice of determination under Section 40(4) in respect of awards for legal representation. This notice will not alter the substance of those sections of the inquiry&#146;s costs protocols concerned with the award of funding for legal assistance but it will reinforce the limits on hourly rates that may be claimed by legal representatives.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="06102586000015"></a>The measures the notice contains have been discussed with the chairman of the inquiry and I know will have the support of honourable and right honourable Members and the general public.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="06102586000017"></a>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has determined under Section 40(4) of the Inquiries Act 2005 that the power of the chairman of the Billy Wright Inquiry to award amounts in respect of legal representation under Section 40(l) and (2) of that Act shall be subject to the qualifications and conditions set out below, which supplement and are in addition to the terms and conditions in the protocol for representation and the costs of legal representation when funded at public expense published by the inquiry on 12 January 2006 (&#147;the Costs Protocol&#148;).</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="06102586000018"></a>The qualifications and conditions are:</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="06102586000019"></a>1. For the purposes of paragraph 9b of the Costs Protocol, the maximum hourly rates for counsel and solicitors shall be:</p>
leading counsel: &#163;200;junior counsel: &#163;100; andsolicitors: &#163;150
<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="06102586000020"></a>2. For the purposes of paragraph 9c of the Costs Protocol, the maximum number of hours that can be charged in respect of each member of a legal team of a represented party shall be 40 hours per week save that the solicitor to the inquiry can authorise the exceeding of the 40-hour per week cap up to 60 hours for counsel during the oral hearings and for a short period before they commence where he is satisfied that such action is justified, for example where the work involved in any week clearly needs to exceed40 hours.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="06102586000021"></a>3. For the purposes of paragraphs 5 and 9c of the Costs Protocol, a witness who is granted fundingto cover the reasonable cost of legal assistance to prepare for, and deliver their evidence, shall be entitled to claim a maximum of 50 hours worth of legal assistance.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="06102586000022"></a>4. In respect of paragraph 2 of this notice:</p>
(a) No unused hours in any week may be set off against any other week.(b) A week shall be taken as commencing on Saturday and ending on Friday.
<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="06102586000023"></a>5. The hourly rates specified in paragraph 1 and the numbers of hours specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 may be exceeded only with the prior approval of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="06102586000024"></a><b><a name="61025-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06102586000033"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="06102586000025"></a>I have today given programme entry approval to a scheme to extend the Nottingham Express Transit (NET). The promoters, Nottingham City Council and Nottinghamshire County Council, are seeking to build on the success of Line One with two new extensions. The extensions are planned to go to Chilwell/Beeston and Clifton, linking directly into Line One at Nottingham Station.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="06102586000026"></a>The Nottingham tram has been a great success in encouraging people on to public transport. These extensions provide the opportunity to continue this success and give people in the south of Nottingham quicker and more convenient access to the city centre. We are still at an early stage in the approval process but we will continue to work with the Nottingham authorities so they can deliver a tram that is attractive to passengers and value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="61025-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="06102586000027"></a>Subject to the scheme progressing satisfactorily to full approval, central Government will contribute funding of up to &#163;437 million in PFI credits towards the costs of the extensions. Programme entry demonstrates our support for the extensions. Provided that the necessary planning powers are granted and the other conditions of funding approval are satisfied, including that costs are kept under control, construction of the extensions could startin 2010.</p>

The current Apache helicopter deployment to Afghanistan is our top priority. Over the timescale of the current operational deployment to Afghanistan, there has been a 4 per cent reduction in UK flying days due to the unavailability of spare parts. There has been no effect on the availability of weapons systems for UK training and there is no requirement for Apache to be available for other theatres of operation.</p>

<a name="06102587000054"></a><b><a name="61025w0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06102587000464"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 did not begin to take place in departments until after equality schemes approved by the Equality Commission were in place, around mid-2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06 in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure there were nine equality-related consultations undertaken. (Listed in table below with number of responses received for each).</p>

<a name="61025w0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_22"></a><a name="06102587000055"></a>For each consultation we consult groups and individuals who have requested that they be included in our Section 75 consultation list (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), which was established as part of our equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated continuously, but at least every year. Backdated lists are not kept.</p>

<a name="61025w0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a><a name="06102587000056"></a>In addition to equality-related consultations, the department consults key stakeholders as part of good policy-making practices generally, and because one must consult on legislation even where no adverse equality impacts have been identified.</p>

<a name="61025w0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="06102587000057"></a>With regard to the noble Lord's second Question, the information on what extent and what form consultation responses addressed equality of opportunity issues could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses received is published (usually on the department's website). All of this information is publicly available.</p>

<a name="61025w0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><a name="06102587000058"></a>It is difficult to identify specific changes that have occurred to a policy as a result of consultation alone. This is because, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development cycle&#151;through, for example, pre-consultation or informal consultation&#151;there will be no negative equality impacts evident.</p>

<a name="06102587000282"></a><b><a name="61025w0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06102587000472"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 began after equality schemes were approved by the Equality Commission in 2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, in the Department of Finance and Personnel there were approximately 26 equality-related consultations and a list of these can be found in the following table. The noble Lord may also wish to refer to the department's website at www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/about-us/publications where the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme and the department's annual reviews to the Equality Commission are publicly available.</p>

<a name="61025w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_242"></a><a name="06102587000283"></a>For each consultation the department consults groups and individuals who have requested that they be included. The Department of Finance and Personnel Section 75 consultee database was established as part of the department's equality scheme for these purposes. This database is updated on a regular basis in consultation with those Section 75 groups.</p>

<a name="61025w0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_243"></a><a name="06102587000284"></a>In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the noble Lord may wish to note that for every equality-related consultation issued, officials record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses is published (usually on the department's website).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_244"></a><a name="06102587000285"></a>In relation to policy changes arising from consultation, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development process, there may be no changes to the policy per se at a later stage following consultation.</p>

These are listed below. The groups consulted were drawn from the consultee list set out in the equality scheme, which is updated regularly. This information has been placed in the Library. In addition, each draft EQIA records the groups consulted.</p>

<a name="61025w0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_272"></a><a name="06102587000315"></a>The information requested on responses to consultations cannot readily be collated in the form requested and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, all final EQIAs record the outcome of the consultation process, including any changes made to proposed policies. EQIAs may be accessed on the department's website at www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOI/.</p>

<a name="61025w0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_273"></a><a name="06102587000316"></a>It is difficult to identify changes made to policies as a result of consultation as with the mainstreaming of equality pre-consultation with relevant groups helps to ensure that policy proposals take account of Section 75 issues from the outset. However, pages 28 to 30 of the five-year review of the equality scheme identify a number of changes made to policies as a result of consultation. These policies include: the regional transportation strategy, water reform, the regional planning policy statement on housing, the accessible transport strategy and the Blue Badge Scheme. The five-year review may be accessed on the department's website at www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOISearch/document.asp?doc=9764.</p>
