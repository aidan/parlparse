<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spopq0"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, given the loss to the Zimbabwean economy as a result of Mr Mugabe's policies, they still believe that their policy for southern Africa is viable.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, our approach to Zimbabwe has been to work to create and sustain an effective international consensus. We continue to work closely with the European Union, the United States, the Commonwealth, the Southern African Development Community and others. We consider that broad-based approach to be the right one. Ultimately, Zimbabwe's only way back to sustainable development is through respect for the rule of law, a return to democratic principles and sensible economic policies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, in the past two years, Mr Mugabe has taken about 18 billion US dollars from thousands of private investors. That was done with the tacit support of leaders of neighbouring countries and is in direct contravention of what they signed up to at the recent G8 summit. Given the Minister's Answer, I want to know what, if any, good reason there is to invest in or trust those countries in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we are all aware of the difficult economic situation in Zimbabwe. We know that unemployment has reached 70 per cent and that there will be negative growth of 10 per cent this year. We are all concerned about that.
<P>

<a name="20704-01_para0"></a>I think that the noble Earl was referring to NePAD. There is a declaration on political, economic and corporate governance that is due to go to the African Union meeting next week. In it, African leaders affirm their commitment to the promotion of democracy and its core values in their respective countries. As the G8, we made it absolutely clear that we would focus our efforts only on countries in Africa that demonstrated,
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, as one who has spent a great deal of his life in Zimbabwe, I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister is aware of how grateful I am to Britain for the generosity that it has shown to the hungry people of Zimbabwe. On 1st July, in reply to a Written Question, my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey said that Britain was to give a further £45 million of food aid to Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. Can the Minister say how much of that £45 million is meant to be used to ease the plight of the people of Zimbabwe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I must first thank my noble friend for those comments. We have worked hard to ensure that our policy, which is to try to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe are put first, is reflected in the policies of the governments of our partner countries.
<P>

<a name="20704-01_para2"></a>We know that there is a humanitarian crisis and that, in the rest of southern Africa, it has much to do with drought. In Zimbabwe, it is also to do with economic mismanagement and, in particular, the fast-track land reform programme. We introduced supplementary feeding last September, before the Government of Zimbabwe recognised that there was a problem. We expect that nearly half of the £45 million will go to Zimbabwe, which would bring our total pledge of humanitarian assistance to about £32 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the combination of drought and mismanagement in Zimbabwe means that we are likely to have a rising problem with refugees overflowing into neighbouring countries and, possibly, coming on to this country? Are the Government already in consultation with the Government of South Africa and others about how to handle such a surge of refugees?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we have kept a close eye on that. At the moment, there does not seem to be any additional refugee flow as a result of the drought and the humanitarian situation. We are, of course, in constant contact with our partners, including South Africa, and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the problem. We have contingency plans&#151;not only for Zimbabwe but for other parts of the world&#151;that would enable use to deal with a crucial situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, apart from the NePAD initiative, what measures are Her Majesty's Government taking to promote greater efficiency and effectiveness in SADC? What discussions are taking place with President Thabo Mbeki to encourage him to take a stronger and more decisive line on Zimbabwe?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, there has been a reform programme for the Southern African Development Community, to which we have contributed. We will continue to contribute to it. Discussions with South Africa are ongoing. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs had discussions with his counterpart, Dr Zuma, only last week. The Prime Minister met President Mbeki at the G8 meeting in Kananaskis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of just how astonished some of us continue to feel that the Prime Minister could, on Monday, make a Statement to the other place about African development that included not a single mention of Zimbabwe? That is at a time when there is continuing torture, misery and starvation in that country and when the Zimbabwean Government's political opponents are murdered, all of which has a disastrous effect on inward investment in the whole of southern Africa.
<P>

<a name="20704-01_para3"></a>Why does the Government's conscience seem to stop at the borders of Zimbabwe? Is it not now time to make a real effort to increase the sanctions, which have, so far, been dismissed as a joke, and to get together a coalition to press vigorously for fresh elections? Is it not time that something positive was done?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I refute everything that the noble Lord has said. First, we made it clear, when my noble and learned friend the Lord Privy Seal repeated the Statement, that the complexity of what was in the G8 Africa plan meant that it should be read in its entirety. I advise noble Lords to examine the plan. The first two pages set out clearly the commitments being made by the G8 and by NePAD partners.
<P>

<a name="20704-01_para4"></a>I am astonished that the noble Lord is surprised. As I have said consistently in the House, Zimbabwe is but one country in Africa. It is important that we remember the real gains that have been made on that continent. I refute entirely the remarks made by the noble Lord.

<A NAME="20704-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how the successful ceasefire in Angola called on 4th April, following more than 30 years of war, is being supported by Her Majesty's Government? What are we doing to promote stability? What are the <P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What effect they expect Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS 17) to have on charities.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, the Accounting Standards Board has announced a delay to the introduction of FRS 17 following the decision of the International Accounting Standards Board to review IAS 19, the equivalent international standard. Organisations, including charities, will now not have to change their accounting practices twice to introduce FRS 17 by 2003 and a new international standard in 2005. Charities will have the opportunity to make their views known on the standard that will apply to them from 2005.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that helpful reply. I should declare an interest as the chairman of a corporate pension fund, although it is not a charity. Does the Minister agree that, while greater transparency in company accounts is highly desirable, the FRS 17 proposal&#151;rightly or wrongly&#151;has brought about a number of unfortunate side effects? Does he further agree that charities are especially vulnerable because they do not normally hold extensive reserves which would lay them open to the charge that they were not fulfilling their functions or, if they were seen to have large reserves, donations might decline? Their assets are often restricted by trusts, deeds and so forth.
<P>

<a name="20704-01_para5"></a>The noble Lord points out that implementation of FRS 17 has been delayed. Given that, is there not a case for waiting until we adopt the international European standard, which might have less of an impact on charities? In the meantime, perhaps we should proceed as we are at present.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, no one would argue against improved transparency either in company or charitable accounts. Clearly, charities also have a duty to their stakeholders. Without going into further detail, FRS 17 has been extremely challenging in its introduction.
<P>


<a name="column_343"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-02_para0"></a>The noble Lord made two points with regard to whether all charities are exposed. Of course not all charities have defined benefits schemes; those which do not will not be vulnerable. I understand that the intention is for IAS 19 to be converged by the ASB, but at present we are not certain exactly what IAS 19 will look like. However, we have gained a useful breathing space for reflection and, it is hoped, for negotiation and influence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that this issue is a problem for charities mainly in relation to the funding of pensions? Does he further accept that many funders of charities are reluctant&#151;to put it mildly&#151;to contribute a fair share of the pension overheads of charities with employees in pensions?
<P>

<a name="20704-02_para1"></a>Will the Government set a good example in this regard by demonstrating that they are willing to make a full contribution towards the pension and other employment overheads of charities when contracting with or funding them? It has to be pointed out that, at the moment, that is far from being universally the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, at times the issues of the funding of pensions and FRS 17 can become interconnected. Clearly there is an issue with regard to the cash funding of the pension scheme on which an employer has determined, irrespective of the accountancy treatment. As an employer, any charity must think carefully and prudently about the package of employment benefits it thinks it needs and can afford to offer.
<P>

<a name="20704-02_para2"></a>With regard to the first question put by the noble Lord, asking whether the Government will in effect sign a blank cheque to fund all such pension schemes&#151;perhaps that was not quite what he said&#151;the answer is no. However, we are looking at the whole issue, both in the cost-cutting and the PIU reviews on charities. We expect to produce some interesting publications in the autumn about how policies towards charities and the voluntary sector are to be developed in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify the implications of the delay in the introduction of FRS 17? Is it not true that reserves still have to be shown in the accounts? Therefore, the point made with regard to the reserves held by charities is valid, irrespective of anything the Government may have done with regard to postponing the introduction of FRS 17.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, that is right. The noble Baroness has gone to the point I sought to make. Irrespective of the accountancy treatment, a company or a charity has to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due, including pension liabilities. I understand that until FRS 17 or its equivalent is brought in, a note will be put to the accounts making a statement about the estimated assets and liabilities of a pension fund. The <P>


<a name="column_344"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information will still be available in the accounts, but it will not be quite such a painful presence on the balance sheet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, am I right in understanding that FRS 17 rests on the principle of the worst case scenario? It assumes that all liabilities will become due at once; it assumes that defined pension liabilities will all become due at the moment of entitlement; and it further assumes that charities will be able to dispose of their assets when in fact, in law, many of them will not be able to do so. Am I also right in thinking that anything that can assume such a concatenation of worst case scenarios all happening at once deserves the comment of Winnie-the-Pooh:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Supposing it didn't?', said Winnie-the-Pooh, after some thought"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="20704-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I feel that my knowledge of Winnie-the-Pooh is stronger than that of the intricacies of the accountancy presentation of pensions. For that reason, I shall write to the noble Earl rather than go into the full details.

<A NAME="20704-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the transfer of powers from health authorities to primary care trusts has been satisfactorily completed.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, on 1st April 2002, 139 new primary care trusts were established, to make a total of 303. There was only one remaining primary care group at that time. The transfer of functions from health authorities to primary care trusts is well under way and early indications are that primary care trusts are progressing well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I welcome warmly the Government's very radical reorganisation and transfer of powers to primary care trusts because that will certainly reduce the bureaucracy involved in dealing with sick and disabled people. However, because the trusts are inexperienced, is there not a danger that they may deal exclusively with high-profile illnesses and disabilities and neglect the relatively unpopular conditions? Will my noble friend use performance indicators to ensure that that does not happen? Will he further seek to ensure that, as best he can, he will give general guidance to the PCTs on the points that I have raised?
<P>


<a name="column_345"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, on the question of performance indicators, the first set are due to be published later this year. It is clear that we need to strike a balance in this area. The whole point of devolving authority to primary care trusts is to ensure that GPs and other primary care staff have a much greater input into key decision-making. In many ways that is the best answer to the questions put by my noble friend. GPs experience the sicknesses of many patients day in, day out. I believe that the commissioning decisions reached by PCTs will be best informed by the experience of GPs. However, of course we shall ensure that if, through commissioning decisions, services are being missed out, we have a performance management regime to enable us to intervene where we have to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, the Secretary of State has pledged that primary care trusts will be responsible for dispensing 75 per cent of the health service budget. When will that become a reality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we are aiming for that to take place in 2004.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister satisfied that the transfer of authority and funding from health authorities to primary care trusts is preserving adequately the needs of tertiary and highly specialised treatments in our hospitals? Furthermore, is he satisfied that the problems related to teaching and research are being properly addressed now that we are increasing the number of medical students being admitted to our medical schools?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I very much accept the point made by the noble Lord on the question of specialised commissioning. We do expect some primary care trusts to take a leading role in their health communities, but we also have in place national specialist commissioning arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20704-02_para3"></a>With regard to teaching and research, it is in the interests of everyone working in the National Health Service to support those activities. We shall not get the high-quality doctors, nurses and other staff we need unless we do so. I fully expect primary care trusts to support teaching and research programmes. The noble Lord will know that we have agreed to a joint review to be conducted by ourselves and the DfES to look at those aspects which are presently causing concern.

<A NAME="20704-02_spnew14"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's Question concerns local out-workings in the context of shifting responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for raising the issue, which I know he feels keenly. The whole point of what we are trying to do with primary care trusts is to decentralise decisions down to local level. Within Portsmouth the local primary care trust will have much more influence in the future, informed by the experience by general practitioners, who are in turn informed by what patients think. So far as concerns the specific issue, we shall look very carefully at the points raised by the right reverend Prelate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that primary care trusts, with their welcome emphasis on patient and public involvement, will be well placed to monitor all the health needs of the communities they serve, including what my noble friend calls the "unpopular" ones? What are the Government's plans for evaluating and disseminating the information collected by PCTs?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. Primary care trusts will be helped by the enhanced arrangements for public and patient involvement in decisions at the local level through the creation of patients forums. As regards information about good practice, we are committed to a large programme of dissemination of such information. Primary care trusts will be fully a part of that programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, the Liberal Democrats have asked one question; we have not. Is the Minister aware that every reorganisation involves some redundancies because people find themselves in positions for which they are no longer suitable? When the GPs changed to primary trusts, a good deal of expense was involved in meeting redundancy costs. Who will be responsible for meeting these costs if the same situation arises? Has this part of the operation been adequately funded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we have made available more than £60 million to support the establishment of primary care trusts. Responsibility for staff redundancies will be transferred to the relevant authority. That is no different from any other reorganisation. Since we came into office in 1997 we have made great strides towards reducing the amount of money spent on bureaucracy&#151;but not, I hasten to add, at the expense of investing in high quality management. I draw a distinction between the two.

<FONT SIZE=3>drug addicts. Is the Minister aware that the transfer of funding to primary care trusts has caused chaos in the payments to many charities, which is causing extreme financial embarrassment to some. These charities are very much concerned in dealing with one of our most pressing social problems. Will the Minister look at this issue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to hear that. I shall be very happy to investigate. I am very keen to see stability in the funding and support by the health service of voluntary organisations in order that they may know what is likely to be their funding, not only for a year ahead but for a longer period. That is entirely consistent with the long-term spending review for the health service that we have already announced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for my untimely and inappropriately early intervention. Have those in primary care trusts been adequately trained to fulfil their function of ensuring equity in the monitoring of uniformly high standards, especially in relation to the care and protection of children and the care of the vulnerable and elderly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the answer is yes. While ensuring that there is a uniform provision of service throughout the NHS, we must also ensure that primary care trusts have sufficient flexibility to make their own decisions in the light of local circumstances.

<FONT SIZE=3>chairmen of companies should be required to take a greater responsibility&#151;and perhaps a personal responsibility&#151;for the fairness of the accounts. After all, chairmen recommend to shareholders the accountants they wish to appoint. They also appoint senior executives, some of whom, no doubt, will be aware of any imperfections in the accounts. These matters require considerable consideration.

<A NAME="20704-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, these are exactly the kind of complicated questions the group is looking at and on which it is co-ordinating various expert views.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give the House an assurance that those firms which may be involved in the inquiries he envisages do not themselves suffer from the very defects about which he is complaining?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the work we are doing at the moment involves co-ordinating the expert advice of various bodies. I do not think the particular issues we are talking about in terms of accounting standards apply to those bodies, which are, by and large, statutory bodies involved in controlling and regulating the profession.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that company accounts in this country generally present a truer and fairer view than those in the United States&#151;not because British businessmen and accountants are straighter than their American counterparts but because we learnt the lessons of our own Enrons and WorldComs five or 10 years ago? They were called Barings, BCCI and, above all, Maxwell.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, that is probably a fair judgment. I do not believe that you can make a comparison. In this instance, we had both problems and solutions, in some cases, earlier on. Of course, as has been pointed out, the basis of accounting is in some critical ways different. The American system has some very specific rules whereas the British system is principle-based and auditors have to give a view as to whether there is a true and fair account of the economic situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that what has happened with accounting practices, in America and elsewhere, is too serious for party political exchanges? It could happen here. I am glad that my noble friend is not complacent, but does he accept that it is less a matter for government intervention than for intervention by the major financial institutions, which select the non-executive directors who sit on the audit committees of major companies in the UK? If he is going to do anything at all, will my noble friend intervene by telling these major financial institutions&#151;which may in practice <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I have a good deal of sympathy for that view. However good the rules, unless there are people in the company who independently will enforce those rules and insist that the right things are done, many of the rules will be a complete waste of time. My noble friend is right to point out that the financial institutions which control many of the shares are undoubtedly in the best position to ensure that the non-executives fulfil their responsibilities properly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is right when he says that public accounts are too important to be dealt with in a party political way. Is it not true that the Government do exactly that? This Government call spending "investment"; call benefits "credits"; and call tax "insurance". By using those accounting practices, the Government massaged down the politically sensitive figure for the UK tax burden&#151;and would still be doing that today if they had not been stopped by the Office for National Statistics. Is that not the reason for the Chief Adviser to the Treasury&#151;the Government's own adviser&#151;writing this comment? I quote:

I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, always wants to make his little speech about deficiencies that he sees in the public accounts but the original Question was about company accounts.

<P>

<a name="20704-03_para1"></a>There has been considerable worry about late Written Answers, which has been taken seriously by the committee. At the end of the day, there is not much that we can do if departments refuse to answer. We suggest that there may be a way around some of the confusion, where there has been a certain amount of pass-the-parcel from department to department. We hope that the system that is being implemented will be of some assistance.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the inclusion of the paragraph about appellations and will add to the noble Lord Chairman's remarks. I hope that the appellation "the noble Lord X" will also be dropped. The correct term is "the noble Lord, Lord X". Also, while the table of appellations has been taken from the Companion, is it correct in the case of marquesses? The appellation shown is "the noble Marquess (the Marquess of . . .)". Surely that should be "the noble Marquess, Lord X". If I am wrong, perhaps the noble Lord will say so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I was delighted to see that the Select Committee has reaffirmed that correct appellations should be used. Too often one hears a Member refer to "the noble Lord, Earl so and so", "the noble Earl so and so" or "the noble Minister"&#151;which, as the noble Lord Chairman said, is a mistake. We all get into muddles and make mistakes, which is understandable&#151;provided that it is a mistake and not done on purpose. One member of the Government Front Bench perpetually seems to leave out the appellation "the noble Lord". One might think that he does so on purpose. I refer to a very distinguished noble Lord the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms. I mean, the noble Lord the Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am so grateful to the noble Lord for correcting me. It is odd that the noble Lord so often leaves out the word "noble". As we get older, we get befuddled and make mistakes. Perhaps the noble Lord is entering that territory. I somehow doubt it. It rather looks like a private campaign. As the noble Lord is so concerned that I should refer to him correctly as the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, I hope that he will observe the niceties and refer to your Lordships as "the noble Lord" or "the noble Earl" as appropriate. If not, perhaps the noble Lord the Leader of the House will correct the noble Lord the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, tow him into line and say, "You may be having a campaign of your own, but while you are on the Government Front Bench, you must abide by the Government's views".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Grenfell: </B>   My Lords, as we accord to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal or Marshal of the Royal Air Force the appellation of "noble and gallant", is it not to be regretted, if and when the senior military officer in this country&#151;the Chief of the <P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Defence Staff&#151;may be invited to join the House, that he should not also be referred to as a noble and gallant Lord?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, I too welcome the section on forms of address. Is the committee likely to take on board the need to remind Members that when the Lord Chancellor, Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman is on his or her feet, other noble Lords are required to remain seated? That convention seems largely to have been forgotten.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   My Lords, my understanding was that the committee has already reported on the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. We have before us the Companion as it stands, without the amendment that the committee has already made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct. I had spotted that point myself. As the noble says, the committee has agreed that former Chiefs of the Defence Staff shall be referred to in your Lordships' House as "noble and gallant".
<P>

<a name="20704-04_para0"></a>I will not enter into debate on the point put by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. That matter is for the person involved. It is not the job of the Chairman of Committees to correct individuals.
<P>

<a name="20704-04_para1"></a>As to references to "the noble Marquess", that is the appellation in the Companion as it stands at the moment. We fear that there was an error in the latest edition because previous editions have it exactly as the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, would wish. I may say in passing that I have not seen many marquesses around recently.
<P>

<a name="20704-04_para3"></a>Following is the report referred to:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>1. Late answers to Questions for Written Answer
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-04_para4"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Companion to Standing Orders stipulates that questions for written answer are expected to be answered within a fortnight (paragraph 4.108). In recent sessions many written questions have remained unanswered after three weeks and some have remained unanswered for over five months. It appears that one reason for the delays in answering is disagreement among some government departments about who is responsible for answering written questions since they are addressed to "Her Majesty's Government" and not to any particular minister or department.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-04_para5"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>In order to improve this situation we recommend the following new procedure.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-04_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Questions will continue to be addressed to Her Majesty's Government but on receipt of a written question the clerks will make a provisional allocation to a government department. The department will have 24 hours in which to ask for the question to be reallocated on the ground that another department accepts responsibility for it. Thereafter, in the composite list of questions for written answer published daily on the Internet and weekly in paper form with the House of Lords Minutes, the department to which the question has been allocated will be indicated by initials printed alongside the question.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-04_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The present practice is to reprint daily in the House of Lords Minute, 21 days after a question has been tabled, those questions on which answers are overdue. If the above recommendation is agreed to, the initials of the departments would be printed alongside the question and this would make public the identity of departments that are late in answering.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Craig of Radley: </B>   My Lords, I have no wish to delay the House or the approval of the House for the Motion, but noble Lords will have noted from the Minutes of the Committee of Selection that sat on 10th June that I moved&#151; and lost, on the casting vote of the noble Lord the Lord Chairman of Committees&#151;an amendment seeking to increase Cross Bench representation on the 24-strong Joint Committee from just two to three members. I owe it to the House to explain my reasons for that untoward step.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para21"></a>I make it clear that I imply absolutely no criticism of the noble Lord the Lord Chairman of Committees. My Motion, having collected an equality of votes for and against my proposition, presented the noble Lord with a most difficult situation. He dealt with it entirely correctly as he should, and my Motion was defeated. Nor would it be right for me, at the risk of delaying the establishment of this important Joint Committee, to attempt to persuade your Lordships to invite the Committee of Selection to reconsider its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para22"></a>For some years, by custom and practice it has been conventional for the usual channels and the Committee of Selection to work to an allocation ratio of two:two:one:one&#151;that is, two each for the Government and main Opposition parties, and one each for the Liberal Democrats and Cross-Benchers for every six members on committees. I asked the Library to research whether there was any record of the introduction of a 2:2:1:1 ratio. It found none; and it found only two specific references in Hansard to the ratio&#151;both by me, as it happens, in recent weeks.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para23"></a>There have been variations in the allocations on a very few committees when Cross-Bench numbers have been better than the 2:2:1:1 ratio would allow. But the Cross-Bench share on those committees was not unreasonable or excessive for the number of Peers who sit on these Benches.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para24"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the latest totals are: 219 Conservative; 192 Labour; 65 Liberal Democrat; 26 Bishops; and 180 Cross-Benchers&#151;almost three times the Liberal Democrat numbers, and now 24 per cent of the total House of 690 Peers, if the 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are excluded.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para25"></a>Some will suggest that party/group representation on committees follows no more than a loose convention which is in many cases ignored. My experience in the two and a half years that I have been Convenor is that 2:2:1:1 is not ignored. It has almost invariably been the starting-point for discussion on forming any new committee and has not infrequently been the end result.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para26"></a>The make-up of many sessional and other long-standing committees was also settled some years ago. Rotation of members on these committees follows a tradition of replacing one for one from party or Cross-Bench group. So the shares of membership of these committees is little changed over many Sessions and has not kept pace with changes in the composition of the House.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para27"></a>My rationale for raising committee membership allocations is that, as Convenor of 180 Cross-Bench Peers, I should like to see&#151;a view backed by noble Lords on these Benches&#151;their numbers and expertise deployed to the benefit of the House and the country. With the considerable changes in your Lordships' House since the end of 1999&#151;in its make-up; in the introduction of the independent appointments commission Peers; and in the widely acknowledged part that a strong independent element plays in the second Chamber&#151;I felt that only two independent members on a Joint Committee of 24 on Lords reform was insufficient. I had to accept that it would not be possible to increase the total numbers on the committee, nor to press for the Labour share of 12 members of the Joint Committee to be reduced to make room for another Cross-Bench member. The Motion that I moved in the Committee of Selection was the only option available to me.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para28"></a>I have argued, and will continue to argue, in the usual channels and elsewhere for an approach that would allow for fairer Cross-Bench representation as well as, when appropriate, representation from the Bishops Benches or from non-grouped Peers&#151;the so-termed "others".
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para29"></a>I have drawn encouragement from expressions of greater willingness to be flexible in the sharing of membership of committees. Thus, I hopefully assume that the 2:2:1:1 ratio will not be the accepted norm from which departures are difficult or impossible to achieve, however well justified.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para30"></a>If that had been the case in settling the membership of the Leader's Group on Working Practices or in the make-up proposals for the Joint Committee on Lords Reform which are now before the House, I should not have had to trouble your Lordships today.

<A NAME="20704-05_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, those of us on these Benches are pleased that we have moved to form this committee to seek progress on the reform of this House. As I understand it, there is a desire, expressed in this process, to draw together our several voices to find, if possible, a way forward which wins widespread consent. Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear me say that I am therefore disappointed that a mechanism has not been found for including someone from these Benches to contribute to the committee.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para31"></a>The composition of this House touches upon two crucial aspects of our constitution: the nature of our parliamentary democracy and the establishment of the Church. The noble and learned Lord the Lord <P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chancellor made it very clear in this House on 22nd May that the Government have no desire to enter into the minefield of disestablishment. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be an enormously complex undertaking to pull out the threads of the established status of the Church of England without damaging the tapestry of the constitution".&#151;[Official Report, 22/5/02; col. 812.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-05_para32"></a><P>

<a name="20704-05_para33"></a>The presence of Bishops in this House is part of that constitutional tapestry. We have sovereignty in this country vested in the Crown in Parliament under God. In our own particular history that is expressed in the structure of this House. Radical changes in these arrangements could lead to the unravelling of other aspects of the constitutional settlement.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para34"></a>In the contributions made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford in the Wakeham Commission, and in all the speeches made from these Benches on the reform of this House, it has been made very clear that we wish to play a constructive part in achieving an acceptable and principled reform. We are wholly committed to finding a representative and credible shape for the future of this House.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para35"></a>The Bishops are here not primarily to speak for the Church of England, narrowly conceived as a denomination, but for the spiritual and moral needs of the whole community. That is why we have stood for holding on to the best of our inheritance as we seek a more representative and inclusive shape to the whole House, including its spiritual aspects.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para36"></a>Contributions have already been made which indicate that we might have some practical ideas about how this can be achieved. I therefore find it extraordinary in the light of this history that a mechanism has not been found for these Benches to be at the table and contributing throughout the whole discussion. I cannot see how the task can be done in our absence.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para37"></a>Yes, it will involve more work for one of our number, already busy in the Lord's vineyard. But if there is a desire and a way can be found, it can be done. Do we not have a collective responsibility in this House to ensure that all the aspects of our shared life are participating in questions concerning its future shape? The failure to include this perspective will make the task much harder; it risks the inadvertent opening up of issues that will lead us into difficulty; and it will mean that we are less likely to deliver a solution. Failure to find a solution which strengthens our parliamentary life in the 21st century would be very bad news for our people.
<P>

<a name="20704-05_para38"></a>I regret having to speak in such strong terms. We have a duty on these Benches to seek to fulfil the role entrusted to us, and we are determined to do all that we can to ensure that the richness of what this means is not only preserved but shaped for the emerging needs of the people. I hope that we may hear some constructive responses to these concerns.

<a name="column_358"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, I, too, was sorry that the Committee of Selection decided on the ratio that it did as regards the Cross-Benchers and noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para0"></a>I have the greatest respect for the Liberal Democrats, sometimes even some admiration. But so far as concerns the numbers in this House, it would have been more appropriate had three Cross-Benchers been proposed for the committee and perhaps, therefore, only one noble Lord from the Liberal Democrat Benches. Be that as it may, the committee decided as it did, and that is that.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para1"></a>I strongly agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford about the absence of a Bishop from the Joint Committee. It would have been highly appropriate to have a Bishop on the committee. I am very sorry that it has been decided otherwise. It will no doubt be said that we should have had to sacrifice one member from one or other of the political groupings in this House. But why should that be so? Why could not a right reverend Prelate be added to the list? It is perhaps too late for that. None the less, I confirm my considerable disappointment, very much for the reasons expressed by the right reverend Prelate, that there is no Bishop on the list that is before the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend said that it is perhaps too late for that. I have no wish to make things difficult for the Chairman of Committees, of whom I am an admirer, but we have now heard from the Convenor of 180 or so Members of your Lordships' House, and from a spokesman of 25 Members of your Lordships' House&#151;a total of more than 200 Members&#151;that they are not satisfied with the Motion. I wonder, therefore, whether this is the right moment to put the Question or whether the committee should reconsider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, in case your Lordships think that it is has influenced my opinions, may I say that I have been in Parliament for 57 years&#151;34 years in the other place and 23 years here? During those 57 years, I have seen the amount of representation of people accustomed to responsibility decline at various times in another place. There was a time when every profession was well represented. There were nearly always about 20 Queen's Counsel. At the beginning of this Parliament, however, the Government could not find a Queen's Counsel in the other place fit to be appointed Attorney-General, nor one fit to be appointed Solicitor-General. We now have the advantage of the Attorney-General being in your Lordships' House. Numerous other changes have taken place during that time.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para2"></a>On the other hand, your Lordships' House has not only retained the eminence that it had years ago before many changes were made; it is now truly representative of the professions, business, farming and land-owning. Whatever responsibility is required can be found among your Lordships. The remarks of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, the Convenor of the Cross Benches, about representation of Cross-Benchers are very important. Like my noble friend, I agree entirely <P>


<a name="column_359"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with what the right reverend Prelate said too. It would be very unfortunate if the representation of your Lordships' House was inadequate and not representative. Therefore, I hope that further consideration will be given to the matter.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para3"></a>I turn to the detail of the powers being given. I agree broadly with the last five. However, the first one states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That the Committee have power to agree with the Committee appointed by the Commons in the appointment of a Chairman"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-06_para4"></a>It seems to me to be wrong that the Lords' representatives on the committee will have to agree, even if they do not. I should have thought that they should have the power to agree or disagree and the matter could then be referred back to both Houses for a better solution. I hope that I have said enough to prompt reconsideration of the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Tenby: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble and gallant friend Lord Craig of Radley. Every authoritative voice on second Chamber reform has said how important it is to have a strong independent element in this House. We have heard that there are 180 Cross-Benchers as against a total roll of 690. It is therefore extraordinary that there are only two Cross-Bench Peers in a committee of 24. Despite the temptation, it is right not to seek today to challenge the decision, arrived at incidentally only by a casting vote, of the Committee of Selection.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para5"></a>I emphasise that I am grateful that there is a new spirit abroad to challenge and, ultimately overthrow, the infamous 2:2:1:1 formula, which, for far too long, has dominated the selection of some&#151;not all&#151;important committees in the House. Flexibility, common sense and a duty to be seen to be fair should be the guiding principles as we enter a new age in this House. I look forward to that flexibility taking account of the strength and diversity which exists on these Benches. I wish the committee well in its Herculean task. It is not too much to say that the health of the parliamentary estate very much lies in its hands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, it is always difficult to get a fair balance of people to form a committee. I understand the Cross-Benchers feeling as they do. My concern lies with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford. It is a thousand pities that the bishops are not incorporated in this committee at all. They form a unique part of the House; their experience is totally different from that of everyone else; and they bring a breath of fresh and different air to the House. We may not always agree with them but that does not matter, especially when they are already threatened with being emasculated from 25 to 16, or whatever the figure is. They should have been included on the committee: it is a great pity that this brand of Peer is not incorporated. I hope that those in charge will think again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I speak as a member of the Committee of Selection which made the decision. I hope that the House will accept its views.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para6"></a>I do not know the individual opinions of any members of the committee as regards the form of this place. Perhaps I know the opinions of one or two, but not those of most members. However, I know that they are people of integrity and honesty who will do their best to listen to, and reflect, the views of all parts of the House. I hope that that will be seen as the basis on which the committee will proceed. Otherwise, we would be saying that we have no confidence in Members of this House or the committee because we do not think that they will fully take account of the views of the Cross-Benchers or bishops.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para7"></a>I reject that. I have full confidence that all those who sit on the committee will seek the views of others. I am quite sure that the bishops will be asked to give evidence to the committee, and that it will reflect in detail the views that we have heard expressed here. I believe that the Committee of Selection has got it right. I have full confidence in it; I hope the House has too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dean of Harptree: </B>   My Lords, in view of the anxieties that have been expressed, I wonder whether the Chairman of Committees can give any indication of whether special priority will be accorded those who are not members of the committee to give evidence to it at an early stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, reflected my remarks. I have much sympathy with what the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, said. I recognise the contribution that Cross-Benchers make to the work of the House. None the less, I believe that the Committee of Selection reached the right decision. We had difficulty in considering the matter raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford. The constructive way in which he put his points today reinforces our concerns, but our hope was that once the committee had been established it would be able to take views as fully as possible, especially those of the Bench of Bishops.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para8"></a>I hope that those noble Lords who will be nominated to serve on the committee, having heard the debate, will find ways in which to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am a member of the Committee of Selection. Both in the committee and more widely we were extremely sympathetic to the point made by the noble and gallant Lord the Convenor of the Cross Benches. Indeed, we supported the points that he made by voices and votes. As has been said, the committee was deadlocked, so the chairman had to cast his vote, leading to the decision we are discussing today.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para9"></a>We thought it important that on this committee there should be a substantial representation of the independent element of your Lordships' House and also of Parliament as a whole. There is little or no equivalent to the Cross Benches in another place. We thought it important not least because of the importance attached by everyone&#151;the Royal Commission and others&#151;who made proposals. Most proposals lay emphasis on the importance of an independent element in the reformed House.

<a name="20704-06_para10"></a>The Committee of Selection took its decision and we have no amendments before us today. We were sympathetic to the position of the bishops, as set out by the right reverend Prelate. It is important that the views of the bishops who are our colleagues in this House, as well as the faith communities more widely, should be taken into account by the Joint Committee. I hope that the right reverend Prelate and his colleagues will give evidence in writing, verbally and in person on those points. They will be listened to with care.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para11"></a>One of the proposed powers of the Joint Committee is that of appointing specialist advisers. It could perhaps consider appointing a number of special advisers to determine whether some of the points made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford can be taken into account in its deliberations.

<A NAME="20704-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I hope that the words spoken in this House today are listened to by all members of the Joint Committee. They are obviously sincerely and properly held. I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, for his comments about my vote in the Committee of Selection. I was faced with a difficult situation. One Member of your Lordships' House described my action as despicable. I am sorry that the Member concerned felt that way.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para12"></a>As chairman, I had to maintain the status quo; I did that. Whether I agreed with the status quo is a different matter. As the noble and gallant Lord said, the status quo relied on a 2:2:1:1 split for a considerable time. It is not for me to tell the usual channels what changes there should be, even if I believe that there should be changes. Neither of the two larger parties in your Lordships' House offered a seat to Cross Benchers or bishops.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para13"></a>I have considerable sympathy with the comments made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford. There was a serious discussion in the Committee of Selection on that very issue. It did not go unnoticed. The only comfort I can offer him is that I hope there will be an opportunity for evidence to be taken. However, I believe that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, for an early evidence-taking session may not be the case. As I understand it, the first phase of the committee's work will be to sort out the possible options. It will then move on from there.
<P>

<a name="20704-06_para14"></a>However, there is a lot of evidence, and much time has been taken in producing evidence in relation to the reform of your Lordships' House. The Royal Commission contained a Member of the Bench of Bishops in the shape of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford who made a big contribution. His chairmanship and membership of various committees is a good example of the way in which Members of the Bench of Bishops contribute to your Lordships' House. We are extremely grateful.

I sincerely hope that what has been said today will be conveyed by our representatives and made plain to Members of another place and the whole committee.

The question of the split between the major parties, the minor party and the Cross Benches is a matter for another day; it is not a matter for me.

<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the clause as I imagine it might be read in the minds of those who are faced with whether a prosecution could take place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he has in his custody or under his control anything"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-07_para6"></a>which I refer to as a cable&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which may be used for the purpose of changing or interfering with the operation of a unique device identifier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-07_para7"></a>Following the Committee stage I raised that whole question with Nokia and the mobile industry crime action group. Indeed, I met representatives of the action group in the House a couple of days ago. While they do not fully subscribe to the case that I make, they certainly understood the point and said that it was the subject of substantial debate in the department when the consultations were taking place. My argument is that a cable, in conjunction with a cache of 20, 30 or 40 telephones, might, in the minds of a prosecuting authority, be sufficient to warrant bringing a prosecution. My noble friend will no doubt say that he believes that that is not the case, but I can imagine circumstances in which it might well be the case. I can give my noble friend one example. With advances in science and developing technology, the printed circuitry may be involved in the cable and not necessarily in a PC. Such a cable, along with a cache of phones, might well be the basis on which a prosecution is called.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para8"></a>For the purpose of greater clarity at this stage, when such technology is not in place, I am asking that a clear message be sent to those who take these decisions as to what evidence should be taken into account when a prosecution is brought. The amendment refers specifically to the additional equipment taken in conjunction with a cable that would have to be in place along with a cache of phones before a prosecution was bought.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para9"></a>I should also point out that there is a mistake in the amendment as printed. The word "a" is omitted. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I generally support the amendment. My view has not changed since Committee stage. The Government's approach is dangerously complacent. The Bill seems to have been drafted by someone wearing blinkers. There are times when the use of blinkers is appropriate. When a narrow and specific issue is being dealt with, it is right to have a tightly focused approach. However, the problem that we are dealing with relates not just to mobile phones, but to street crime and a host of other issues. I have heard nothing to alter my view that the Bill has been drafted with such a tight focus that it can only be a second best Bill. It ought to focus more widely on the general issue of theft on the streets&#151;dealing exclusively with the subject of mobile phones, but taking its remit wider than the specific back-street operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. We rehearsed the arguments at Second <P>


<a name="column_364"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Reading and in Committee. The amendment would not take anything away, but would establish greater clarity. I hope that the Minister will see fit to accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the diligence and persistence of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours on the issue. Many of us respect his many years of parliamentary attention to issues that he believes need changing.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para10"></a>Let me explain why we think that the Bill as drafted is right and appropriate. Clause 2(1) targets a person who possesses anything that can be used to change an IMEI number and intends to use it or allow it to be used for that purpose. The offence covers all equipment or software that may be used for reprogramming, even if it was not designed with that in mind. The amendment would redefine the offence so that it applied to anything that might be used in conjunction with equipment that is capable of changing an IMEI number.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para11"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours asked whether a dealer selling a cable would be caught by the offence. If I understood him correctly, his concern was whether the offence was wide enough to cover equipment such as a cable when it is supplied by a dealer in the knowledge that it will be used to reprogram a mobile phone.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para12"></a>I fully appreciate my noble friend's concerns, but I do not believe that the amendment is necessary, because the Bill makes it clear that anyone who supplies or offers to supply anything that may be used to reprogram a phone will commit an offence if he knows or believes that the person to whom it is supplied intends to use it or allow it to be used unlawfully. The offence is not merely retailing the cable, but doing so in the knowledge that it will be used illegally to reprogram IMEI numbers.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para13"></a>The term "anything" in the Bill covers any software or equipment required for the purpose of making the change. Going back to our debate, I acknowledge with gratitude that that would include a cable, but the offence would not occur with the legitimate supply of equipment, because knowledge or belief of intent would have to be proved. In the everyday circumstance of a telecommunications retailer selling someone a cable that could be used for the purposes that we are talking about, the retailer would not be at risk of committing an offence&#151;and therefore of prosecution&#151;unless he knew or had good reason to believe that the item was going to be used for that purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, when I raised the issue last week, I picked on the weakest case. I could have picked on others, because there are three areas of offence: subsection (3) says, "he offers to supply"; subsection (2) says, "he supplies"; and subsection (1) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he has in his custody".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-07_para14"></a><P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Surely the prosecuting authorities would find it easier to decide on bringing a prosecution in that case than in the case that my noble friend referred to. Perhaps that goes back to me choosing the wrong example last week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, there is nothing wrong with the example. There was something wrong with my hearing when I heard "table" rather than "cable", but that is beside the point.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para15"></a>My noble friend referred to the words, "has in his custody". There would be no offence open to charge or prosecution unless there was evidence of an intent towards criminality. The retailer is safe in the circumstances that we are describing.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para16"></a>The definition is deliberately drawn widely by using the word, "anything". The amendment could be seen to narrow that offence. It would restrict the offence to the possession of anything that might be used in conjunction with equipment to change an IMEI number. The possession of a cable by itself would not be an offence, even if the intent to use it to change IMEI numbers could be proved. I do not believe for a second that that is what my noble friend intended.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para17"></a>The term "equipment" may also not be wide enough to cover anything that may be used to help change an IMEI number. It is doubtful that software would be covered by "equipment". For those reasons, the Government prefer the current drafting of the offence, while paying proper respect to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for the challenges that they have brought on the issue.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para18"></a>I hope that the Government are not for a second dangerously complacent, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. He argued his corner well in Committee. We had subsequent discussions and we offered to bring an assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to a meeting with him so that he could put to rest his legitimate concerns on whether the police were satisfied that the Bill allowed them to bring forward reasonable prosecutions. The noble Lord had the grace to say that he did not wish to avail himself of that opportunity because he did not wish to press the matter further. I mention that because I do not think that it is the action of a dangerously complacent government. We were prepared to carry on the discussion after the debate in the Chamber.
<P>

<a name="20704-07_para19"></a>I acknowledge with gratitude the challenge that has been made, but I respectfully invite my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 32, line 15, at end insert "from the membership of appropriate statutory organisations"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 73A, 74A, 75A, 75C and 77A. They all deal with the perceived need to define more precisely the power of the Secretary of State and, after him&#151;upon devolution&#151;of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting together.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para6"></a>My concern was about the object, however well intentioned, of being, as the politically correct would say, inclusive. Those Ministers might for perfectly understandable political reasons appoint persons whose agenda would be to achieve power over, rather than to serve, the community, and who might be representing the very paramilitaries who make their own people's lives a misery.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para7"></a>When the question was first debated in Committee, the noble and learned Lord quoted a number of organisations whose members might be seen by the Government as falling into the third category of designation that is provided for in the Bill, and which is now under consideration. He subsequently wrote a most helpful letter&#151;one of many&#151;to which he attached a list of such organisations. I found that very helpful and reassuring. However, I hope that he will nevertheless be able to accede to the amendment, which clarifies the position and gives the necessary reassurance that only persons from recognised organisations with professional expertise to offer can be considered for that powerful third discretionary slot, which recurs throughout the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in so far as it is very much in line with a helpful government amendment, to which we shall come later, about the membership of community safety committees. The Government, having reflected on what was said in Grand Committee, have recognised the inherent danger in the Bill in respect of community safety partnerships. The noble Baroness has done nothing more than extend the logic of what is now the Government's position by trying to ensure that those who will have responsibility&#151;a very important responsibility&#151;will be people of some substance and will be accountable. I fully support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support my noble friend's amendment. The amendments that I <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had tabled but which I did not move were fairly negative. I hope that the noble and learned Lord agrees that those amendments that have superseded it and which are in the name of my noble friend are very positive. They do not simply involve youth justice; they also relate to other parts of the Bill, including the provisions on safety partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para8"></a>The Bill, which I hope will be enacted, will devolve a criminal justice system to Northern Ireland. That criminal justice system will be used to guide, force and manage the law over people living in Northern Ireland for many years to come. As I have&#151;really rather drearily&#151;said several times before in different ways, we are very anxious not to leave much flexibility in the Bill. It should be a technical Bill and, largely, it is such a Bill but it contains some extremely good and interesting innovations. We feel that it is inappropriate to leave in such a Bill open clauses involving the Secretary of State's powers&#151;or the powers of whoever they are devolved to in future&#151;which mean that the Secretary of State or those other people are free to do more or less what they want at the time.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para9"></a>There are quite a few amendments in the group that is before us&#151;Amendments Nos. 72A, 73A, 74A, 75A, 75C and 77A. They thread through this and other parts of the Bill and involve instances of the open clause, which we on this side of the House do not like. We are suspicious of it and do not feel that it would be responsible to leave it in. I hope that the noble and learned Lord feels that my noble friend's amendment is positive, reasonable and could be lived with. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I am inclined to think that Amendment No. 72A is somewhat over-prescriptive; the same may well apply to other amendments in this group. In Committee, I advanced the case in which a young person might not at the time of his offence be known to a probation officer or a social worker. Therefore, in order to get a sensible report, the Secretary of State might need to have recourse to some other person, whom he would designate. I have not really shifted from that position. I hope that the Government agree with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, briefly but sincerely, I support the noble Baroness's amendment. However, I am at variance with my noble friend Lord Hylton, who I believe is too much of an innocent in advising that the Government should take into account his reservations. With all due respect to him, I do not think that he understands the sheer villainy of paramilitary organisations on both sides of the divide or their ability further to deepen the penetration by terrorist organisations into all of our various communities throughout Northern Ireland. As the Bill is drafted, we have the right respectfully to ask the Government: what guarantee can they give that such orders as have been mentioned in this regard will not be used to, one might say, "contract out" court-imposed penalties to those who exercise community control cynically by operating on the fringes of the law?

<A NAME="20704-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I very much support the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. The approach is over-prescriptive. I understand the views of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, who speaks from his own experience; he suggested that we may perhaps be unduly naive in this regard. The Bill must be presented with a degree of optimism and against all the odds. There is a case for giving Northern Ireland the chance to develop a mature judicial system.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I rise in the context of a mild paradox as regards Amendment No. 75C. I apologise to my noble friend Lady Park for not having given her warning that I was going to make an observation. I am not absolutely confident that that amendment makes sense in the context of the Bill. I believe that it has been included in a particular list on the grounds that the amendments were all the same. Amendment 75C relates to a matter which I raised at the end of Clause 55 stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para10"></a>The Minister said in response to me that it really was not a matter of great importance as it was only the rendering of a notice. I retreated abashed from the field and I acknowledge that his point is right. However, the original words in the Bill,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such as the Secretary of State may designate"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para11"></a>were the same as those which occur in the other cases. The Minister, in responding to the other amendments of this kind in Grand Committee, had explained that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such person as the Secretary of State may designate"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para12"></a>would refer to people from particular statutory organisations, which is the theme of the amendments to which my noble friend Lady Park has spoken. The case that I am citing relating to the passage in Amendment No. 75C did not matter at all. The problem is that if the wording is the same between the amendments which matter and those which do not, the man on the Clapham omnibus might have the impression that they are the same and that the meaning which the Minister has given to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such person as the Secretary of State may designate"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para13"></a>is not carried if the same words are being used in a much more nominal place somewhere else in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, as noble Lords have indicated, we discussed this matter quite fully at Committee. I am speaking to the amendments helpfully enumerated by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, grouped in this section.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para14"></a>They seek to cover the same area and therefore perhaps I should deal with one by way of example, which is Clause 53, page 32, line 15. It refers to Clause 53(4) which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before making a reparation order, the court must obtain and consider a written report by&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para15"></a><P>
<br>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) such other person as the Secretary of State may designate".

<a name="column_369"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Baroness's amendments would limit the designation to statutory organisations. That is the point of these amendments.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para19"></a>We need to remember that before the court makes a reparation order, it must obtain a report on the requirements it might impose as part of that order. So a court has a duty to obtain a report but, rightly, it has the judicial discretion to decide the source of that report. I agree that in the majority of cases the report writers will be either a probation officer or a social worker.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para20"></a>But to take up and echo the remarks of the noble Lords, Lord Hylton, and Lord Smith, there are those who can give extremely valuable assistance who are not statutory bodies, for instance, Extern, the YMCA, and other bodies which we have spoken about. They do work and they have vast experience with marginalised and vulnerable children. What we do not want to do is to exclude the possibility of those bodies providing such assistance to the court if it considers that they have an important contribution to make.
<P>

<a name="20704-08_para21"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment would exclude all those extremely valuable and worthy voluntary organisations. I understand the fears which have been expressed, but these amendments do not cure that real or imagined mischief. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is quite right. If one is dealing with the needs of victims and offenders one needs a decent amount of flexibility. I remind noble Lords that not any body or person would be eligible for a mandatory report. It has to be, according to subsection 4(c),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such other person as the Secretary of State may designate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-08_para22"></a>So it has to be a designated organisation. Therefore, the only difference is whether some voluntary organisations are rightly to be considered as worthy of designation. I can go through all the amendments, but the approach is similar. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, we do not want to be unduly prescriptive. We want to have flexibility, stressing as I do that any such organisation in any of the relevant contexts referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, would first have to be designated by the Secretary of State.

<A NAME="20704-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, I seek a little clarification. I see the point about Amendment 75C for which I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Brooke for identification. That is in a different category and I entirely accept that my amendment is not appropriate in that case.
<P>

<a name="20704-09_para0"></a>However, do I understand that the Minister is unable to accept all the other amendments that I propose or not? I am not perfectly clear.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is my position.

( ) the probation board of Northern Ireland"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-09_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 76 returns to my questions and suggestions on the inclusion of the Probation Board of Northern Ireland in this issue. In Grand Committee the Minister explained that existing probation officers who meet the required criteria for youth conference co-ordinators will be welcome to apply for such posts. I refer noble Lords to col. CWH 146 of Hansard of 18th June 2002. I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, and I understand why the probation board does not appear on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-09_para11"></a>However, I am concerned that such people may not be aware that they are able to apply for posts as youth conference co-ordinators. The board was anxious for us to raise the issue. It believes that existing probation officers are some of the best people to carry out the role of conference co-ordinators. The Minister suggested that our proceedings are scrutinised carefully in Northern Ireland. I agree with him. Perhaps the issue could be explained again on the Floor of the House and we could flag it up to ensure that people in the Northern Ireland probation service understand that they are qualified to play that role and know how to set about it. If the Government could give me some indication that through the administration a letter or pamphlet would go to members of the board informing them that they would be welcome and qualified to play that role, I would be happy. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has been modest in his requirement. He knows that if one were to ask the proverbial man in the street which body would be best qualified to deal with this delicate matter, the name that would automatically come to his tongue would be the Northern Ireland Probation Board. It is respected throughout the entire community. It is seen and held to be impartial and I cannot think of any body better qualified to deal with the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the way in which the noble Lord put his amendment. I hope that I can say unambiguously words that will assist his purpose. As noble Lords will know, I wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, on 25th June and copied the letter to all noble Lords who had shown an interest in our earlier proceedings, but I am happy to make the matter plain on the record again.

<a name="20704-09_para12"></a>Existing probation officers who meet the required criteria for youth conference co-ordinators will be most welcome to apply for posts. If successful, they will then&#151;as the Bill indicates&#151;become civil servants within the youth conferencing agency. Recruitment will be by means of public advertisement. Everyone who is qualified&#151;and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, that that may include a large number of probation officers, some of whom may not wish to apply and some of whom will&#151;may apply. To assist further the House, and in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I will undertake that the Northern Ireland Office will write formally to the head of the probation service in Northern Ireland indicating what I have just said. I hope that that is of assistance.

"( ) No youth conference may be convened until the rules specified in subsection (1) have come into effect."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-10_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope to clarify through the amendment a careful explanation from the Minister, who in Grand Committee said that Amendment No. 78 would ensure that youth conference co-ordinators are equipped with guidelines and rules of procedure before convening.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para4"></a>The Minister explained that conference co-ordinators will have such guidelines and that they will be published in due course. All the conferences will be unfamiliar. I therefore think it would be wise to place that information in the Bill with the added provision that youth conferences may not be convened prior to the circulation of guidelines.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para5"></a>The Bill specifies that the Secretary of State will provide a code of practice or guidelines as to how the conferences will work. Clause 86 allows the date of devolution to be flexible for different parts of the Bill. We support that. I should like to feel that this part of the Bill will not be devolved until the Secretary of State and his staff have had time to put together the guidelines so that conferences are not called and co-ordinators asked to do a job before the Government's guidelines for their management have been laid down. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to offer the clarification to which the noble Lord alluded. As he rightly said, in new Article 3B(1), the Secretary of State may make rules governing the procedure of youth conferences. I confirm that it is <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the clear intention that such rules will be made. Without such rules, the proposed system will not be able to operate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that confirmation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn </B>   moved Amendment No. 79:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(8) The Secretary of State may make procedural rules about youth conference plans which may (in particular) include provision about the period within which functions of persons required to monitor compliance with youth conference plans must be performed.
<br>
(9) Rules under paragraph (8) are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament in the same manner as a statutory instrument; and, accordingly, section 5 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 (c. 36) applies to such rules."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-10_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 80. New Article 3B(1) provides that the Secretary of State may make rules&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred in the previous amendment&#151;governing the procedure of youth conferences. It is expected that the rules will be used to set time limits for the various stages of the process and for the performance of the functions of the co-ordinator.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para9"></a>They cannot be used to make provision about youth conference plans, in particular to set a time limit within which the person monitoring compliance with a plan arising from a diversionary conference must submit the final report to the director.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para10"></a>Since the director may, having received a report on  compliance or non-compliance, still instigate proceedings against a child if he is of the view that the plan has not been complied with to a significant extent, it must be right to set a time limit for that stage of the process. Without it, the child might wrongly and unfairly have the threat of prosecution hanging over him for an indefinite period.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para11"></a>Amendment No. 79 therefore empowers the Secretary of State to make rules establishing a time limit for the submission of the report to the director. Since we intend to specify a time limit, it is not appropriate for the Bill to have the words relating to the making of the report,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as soon as reasonably practicable",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para12"></a>which Amendment No. 80 deletes. I hope that your Lordships will feel that that is a tightening up and improvement of the protection for a possible child defendant. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, new Article 33C(1) provides that a child may be referred to a conference only if he lives in an area where the new system is in place, so that we can pilot the new arrangements and, if necessary, stagger the subsequent roll out of the conferencing system. The amendment is simply to clarify that that applies equally to mandatory referrals to a conference&#151;provided for at new Article 33A(1)&#151;and to discretionary referrals, provided for at 33A(3) and (4). It is a tidying-up clarification. I beg to move.

<a name="20704-10_para20"></a>Clause 65 [Display of Royal Arms at courts]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rogan </B>   moved Amendment No. 82:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 58, line 8, leave out "not"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 85.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para22"></a>The question of display or lack of display of royal arms at courts is the first of&#151;and indeed, exemplifies&#151;the measures in the Bill we believe to be wrong. I imagined that the clause heading would give an indication of the purpose of that clause. However, these headings are more than misleading. The heading of Clause 65 is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Display of Royal Arms at courts";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para23"></a>yet its purpose is not to encourage but indeed to discourage the use of royal arms at courts by largely prohibiting them. The amendments standing in my name and that of my colleagues are designed to change the purpose of this clause to one more in keeping with its heading, and in a sense to uphold the continued use or display of the coat of arms in the courts in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para24"></a>The purpose of the royal coat of arms is to represent the state&#151;or, more accurately, the Crown. Courts throughout the kingdom display the coat of arms both inside the court and on exterior buildings. Therefore why should one part of the kingdom be treated differently from the remainder?
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para25"></a>This is a matter, as with the issue of flags, of treating Northern Ireland in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom. As some noble Lords may be aware, the flags regulations were tested for their compatibility with the Belfast agreement. As my noble friend Lord Magginis of Drumglass mentioned in Grand Committee, a High Court decision was delivered by Mr Justice Kerr on 4th October 2001. It had been claimed that regulations pertaining to flags were incompatible with the Belfast agreement. But Mr Justice Kerr upheld that the regulations were indeed compatible with the agreement. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That approach seems to me to exemplify a proper regard for partnership, equality and mutual respect and to fulfil the Government's undertaking that its jurisdiction in Northern Ireland shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions".
<P>

<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para27"></a>Therefore the correct balance and acting with rigorous impartiality was not to be compromised with treating Northern Ireland on the same basis as the rest of the kingdom on an issue that acknowledged, and therefore reflected, Northern Ireland's constitutional position.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para28"></a>My next point has been mentioned in this House before but I shall repeat it. The Belfast agreement, and more importantly those of us who endorsed the agreement,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"acknowledge the sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para29"></a>I emphasise,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"symbols and emblems are used in a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para30"></a>The agreement does not prohibit the use of symbols. I suggest that the approach taken by this Government goes against the spirit of that agreement, which accepted that symbols, and symbols of state, would remain in post-agreement Northern Ireland. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, in Grand Committee I spoke at some length on the contradictions that exist in relation to this clause. I am afraid that that seems to have been misunderstood. If it was not understood, then it was totally ignored, for nothing has been done in the interim to resolve those contradictions.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para31"></a>Perhaps I may, as briefly as I can&#151;I do not want to detain the House to an undue extent by repeating what I said in Grand Committee but it is important&#151;remind the House of my arguments. Clause 65(1) suggests that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Royal Arms must not be displayed in any courtroom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para32"></a>But Clause 65(2) then goes on to list a number of courtrooms to which that rule does not apply. They include the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast, the courthouses in Armagh, Banbridge, Magherafelt, Omagh, and Court No. 1 in the courthouse in Downpatrick. Why do we have that contradiction? Simply because the IRA have not managed to blow up those courtrooms. The courts are still there; the coats of arms are still on the walls and it has been decided that it would not be the wisest thing in the world to deface those courtrooms by hauling down the coats of arms that exist there.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para33"></a>That leads me to ask the question: if the Government are intent on being so political; if the Government believe that those who object to the coats of arms are right to the extent that they can be offended by their presence; and if in recognising that they repudiate to some extent the very source through which justice is administered&#151;that power that devolves from the sovereign, from the Crown&#151;then it is a sad day not just for Northern Ireland, but for the whole of the United Kingdom. However, if the Government accept that people will be offended, are they telling me that they should not be offended in any new courtrooms, but it is all right for them to continue <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be offended in existing courtrooms where the royal coat of arms is displayed? That is the ridiculous depths to which this argument descends.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para34"></a>The problem is that the contradiction does not confine itself to the courtrooms; it extends to courthouses as a whole. In Clause 65(3) we are told that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Royal Coat of Arms must not be displayed . . . on the exterior of an existing court-house . . . unless they were displayed there immediately before the coming into force of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para35"></a>There is a huge vacuum in terms of information relating to new courthouses. I raised this matter in Grand Committee and it was acknowledged by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, who indicated that the Bill, as she put it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is silent in the placing of royal arms on the exterior of new courthouses".&#151;[Official Report, 19/06/02; col. CWH 174.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-10_para36"></a>So every time a courthouse is repaired or rebuilt, or newly built, there will be a political argument which impacts on the whole judicial and legal process in Northern Ireland; an ongoing source of conflict in an area where for 30 awful years there was no conflict.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para37"></a>I cannot believe that the Government intend to continue to behave in such a naÿve and illogical manner in relation to Clause 65. Either it is right to acknowledge where the source of justice exists, and what is acknowledged in one courtroom should be acknowledged in another, or it is right&#151;"and" it is right, perhaps&#151;to acknowledge the symbol so far as concerns the exterior of the courthouses.
<P>

<a name="20704-10_para38"></a>I raised the issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, about the new courthouse in Dungannon. I posed the question that since the old courthouse had a coat of arms on its exterior what would happen to the new courthouse? She whetted my appetite by suggesting that there might be a precedent. But nothing has come forward between Grand Committee and this Report stage which indicates that a source of resentment, of conflict, and of ongoing turmoil will be addressed in a sensible and dignified manner by your Lordships' House. That is wrong. I support the noble Lord, Lord Rogan.

<A NAME="20704-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, I support these four amendments. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, that the title of Clause 65 is misleading. It is entitled, "Display of Royal Arms at courts". But that is not what the clause is about; it is about the lack of display of coats of arms at courts. There is a bit of government spin here. But the people of Northern Ireland see through that.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para0"></a>My colleagues and I raised the issue in Grand Committee. I am disappointed that on this issue we do not have a listening government. This is an important matter back home in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister is there today in order to attend a serious conference on the future&#151;or lack of it&#151;of the Belfast agreement. The Government could make a political decision, a political gesture, and they could listen to the voices from Northern Ireland. But there has been no positive response.
<P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para1"></a>The clause states that the royal coat of arms will be displayed on the exterior of some courthouses and not outside others. That is totally contrary to the recommendation of the review committee on the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. It recommended that the coat of arms should be displayed externally on all courthouses in Northern Ireland. Therefore, the Government must explain why  they have gone against the review body's recommendation and why they have decided that these coats of arms should be on the external parts of some courthouses and not on others.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para2"></a>Such confusion sends a message to the IRA. We know how they think. "We will now blow up the courthouses that still have the coats of arms outside" is the message being sent. The Government are in a state of confusion because they have rejected the recommendation of the review committee. I hope that further consideration will be given to the matter.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para3"></a>The situation in relation to the courtrooms is even more confusing. In some courthouses the coat of arms will be in the courtrooms; in others it will not; and in a third type of courthouse it will be in one courtroom but not in the courtroom next door or down the corridor. That is totally confusing. The Government should pay attention to a recommendation made by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, a body not noted for its favourable comments on royal coats of arms and Union flags. It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If Parliament determines that the display of the Royal Arms . . . is indeed consistent with equality, impartiality and independence, then it ought to consider adopting an approach that is consistent across the region. It ought not to allow the perception, however unfounded, that some court-houses or courtrooms are more British or more monarchist than others administering the same laws".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-11_para4"></a>There is consistency from the human rights commission. I appeal to the Government&#151;please listen to the voices from Northern Ireland.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak on Amendments Nos. 82 to 85. In one respect I very much agree with my noble friend Lord Kilclooney and the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, about the need for consistency in the way we approach these matters. Although tonight I shall be supporting the Government on the issue, I believe that the clause sends out contradictory messages. In some courthouses we shall have one set of symbols and in others we shall have a different set, even to the point where the Belfast courthouse, which is due to be completed this summer, will have the coat of arms, whereas others will not.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para5"></a>That will cause problems for the future in showing what we mean by the administration of justice. It starts to look as though we have one system of justice in one part of the Province and a different system of justice in the other. We either go for an "all" or for a "nothing" solution. Personally, I would go for the "nothing" solution. That is where I disagree with the noble Lords. I believe that signs and symbols have bedevilled the past 70 years of Northern Ireland's history. The more <P>


<a name="column_379"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 379</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one can remove signs and symbols that can be an affront to any member of the community perhaps the better.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para6"></a>However, if the "nothing" solution is not to be adopted then the "all" solution surely would be that it is legitimate to show both our coat of arms and the insignia of the Irish Parliament. That may be provocative. Noble Lords ask the question: what is the source of justice&#151;that surely is the key issue&#151;for the defeat of terrorism and for the defeat of those who would destroy our institutions? Surely the source is, "Yes, the monarchy in the United Kingdom, but our Parliament which sits under Her Majesty the Queen, and in Ireland, the Dail, the elected Parliament of that democracy". Is it so unreasonable to think that if we are to have symbols and signs that we should show precisely where the power of our judiciary comes from? It is from an elected parliamentary process in both countries. If we are to have symbols I believe that that would be a better way to go about it.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para7"></a>I remind your Lordships of the review and what it had to say. Four matters struck me. The first was that we should seek to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"create an environment in which all those attending court can feel comfortable".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-11_para8"></a>The review pointed out that all parties to the agreement acknowledged the sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public purpose and the need to ensure that they were used in a manner that promoted mutual respect. That is the key for me&#151;the idea of mutual respect from both sides of the divide. The review might also be recalled for the guarantee it gives of just and equal treatment and parity of esteem for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para9"></a>I know that the noble Lords who have just contributed to the debate would agree that the key, surely, for long-term stability and peace in Northern Ireland is to draw the minority community into our processes. If we fail to do that, the agreement will never work. Until that becomes a reality, and there is a real belief in civil society, its institutions, the upholding of the law, and government by democracy, then we cannot succeed in our objectives, however many agreements we sign or however much legislation we pass. I believe that sometimes we pass too much legislation and do not give it a chance to bed down and allow relationships to prosper. However much we act in these areas, whatever is produced will not be worth the paper it is written on unless we draw into the processes the minority community in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para10"></a>Secondly, the review draws down on the issue of identity. I remind your Lordships of the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities which said that the agreement does not merely protect identity, or should not protect identity, which is, I think, construed quite narrowly by the framework convention, but also aspirations which, in the context of Northern Ireland, plainly refers to national aspirations. That is why the agreement says that the people should be able to identify themselves "and be accepted as" British or Irish or both. So the <P>


<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>review's neutral approach to this question should be observed as regards all national symbols. We must get this right. Incidentally, I am also dubious about the rationale for flying flags on designated days because they are days on which flags are flown on government buildings. The courts are a separate organ of government from the executive and the rules for the one should not necessarily apply to the other.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para11"></a>Thirdly&#151;to cite the review again&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in time it may be more fitting to move towards symbols that emphasise the separation of the courts from the Executive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-11_para12"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain how it is envisaged that that recommendation will be implemented.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para13"></a>Finally, the review recommended that the interior of courtrooms be free of any symbol. But the Bill outlaws only the royal coat of arms. Other symbols are not affected. What is the Government's thinking here? How will they deal with that contradiction, which my noble friend rightly pointed out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, I have been watching and listening to the news bulletins emanating from Northern Ireland today. It is obvious that a great crisis is emerging in relation to the Good Friday agreement. Brave politicians have given their opinion and political commentators all consider a dangerous period now to exist in relation to the Northern Ireland agreement&#151;the Belfast agreement.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, said that he would like symbols to be created that would include the minority community in Northern Ireland. But what is happening now? In the course of trying to bring in the minority community, the majority community is being totally excluded. It is that majority which at present is in absolute crisis. The legislation passing through this House in so many aspects appears to be driving the Northern Ireland process in the direction of joint authority. Joint authority will never be the answer to Northern Ireland's problems.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, said that there could be two sets of insignia: one royal and one depicting the involvement of the Irish Government. If that were to happen, it would cause an awful uproar in Northern Ireland. That would be seen as joint authority. Joint authority would not be acceptable even to the IRA. It does not want joint authority either; it wants to have its input into the political processes in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para16"></a>I rise only to support what has been said from Northern Ireland. Here, we are a million light years away from what is happening at Hillsborough this afternoon. We are entering the month of July. There is a real danger. I am not sure how many people will read or hear reports of this debate. Anyone who does so will be further alienated from the so-called peace process of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-11_para17"></a>On the question of which courts are designated, it appears from careful reading of the provision that the Government are in danger of having particular insignia in Catholic areas and different insignia in Protestant areas. That is not the way to bring about <P>


<a name="column_381"></a>

<A NAME="20704-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, when the noble and learned Lord replies, perhaps he will tell the House what nation in the civilised world does not display either in or on its courts its national symbol.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House for long. My support for the amendments springs from my objection to the greater part of the Bill. It is, as the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said, another one-way street of legislation. It is in danger of alienating the majority community. On Monday, I said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The more the Government talk about the peace process, the normalisation of affairs in Northern Ireland and the end of emergency, the more frequently we find them legislating to make permanent a different standard of justice in the two parts of the kingdom".&#151;[Official Report, 1/7/02; col. 90.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-12_para0"></a>Here we are again. The symbols of justice will be different in the two parts of the kingdom. That does not bring communities together; it drives communities apart. We shall even have the ultimate absurdity of having two standards in Northern Ireland itself. That cannot make sense.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para1"></a>My feelings about these matters are unchanged. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked the Government to listen to the voices of the people of Northern Ireland. I think that that was also the message of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. The trouble is that all too often the Government do not listen to people's voices. They listen to the gunfire, react even to the clicking of a safety catch and run to offer more concessions to those with the guns and to alienate further those who would walk the path of peace.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Alton on a wide variety of subjects, but I am bound to say that I find his suggestion bizarre in the extreme. One might as well recommend that courtrooms south of the border should be obliged to display royal symbols as well as republican ones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, is it not surprising that the British Government are proposing to remove the royal coat of arms from the external walls of Northern Ireland court houses when, 80 years after independence in the Republic it remains on the external walls of courthouses south of the border?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, that is an interesting piece of news. I did not know that. However, I do not think that there is any suggestion that new coats of arms be erected when new courthouses are built. In any case, it is impossible to imagine that the French would ever allow the symbols of the French state to be removed from the exterior or interior of courthouses in Corsica, whatever the pressure from a terrorist minority on that island.

<a name="20704-12_para2"></a>Once again, as on the matter of the judicial oath, the Government appear to be capitulating to a hardline minority&#151;to be precise, not simply a minority but a minority of a minority, amounting to no more than 12 to 13 per cent of the population of the Province.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, ever since the Belfast agreement&#151;indeed, since the run-up to it&#151;there have had to be compromises in Northern Ireland. Every Secretary of State has said so and has said that each community must make concessions, that no one can have everything that they want, but that by achieving a compromise&#151;compromises are necessary&#151;we can move forward on the basis of some sort of consent. That has been the basis of the agreement.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para3"></a>As I have said previously, I regret that the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the main voice of nationalism in Northern Ireland, is not heard in this House. Our debates are the poorer for the lack of that voice. I cannot possibly speak for one side or the other in Northern Ireland; I make no claim to do so. But no one else in this House can do so either. There is therefore a weakness in that we do not reflect the many views in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has previously made this point about the lack of representatives of the SDLP and a legitimate view in Northern Ireland. Last time, the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, put him right. He told him: they have been offered the chance; they refused it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend continues, I remind your Lordships that we are on Report and that we have different rules and conventions on Report from those in Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I make that point simply because I am trying to get a sense of the views expressed in the House and to balance them against other views held by many people&#151;not the majority&#151;in Northern Ireland. It is on that basis that we must decide whether the Government have got it right in the Bill and therefore whether the amendments are appropriate. I contend that the Government have had to compromise. It is not possible to move forward in any way other than by compromise. I fully understand the strength of view on the unionist side; I understand the views on the nationalist side.

<P>

<a name="20704-12_para4"></a>It is not a matter of making concessions to one side or the other; it is a matter of saying, "Let's have a compromise because that is the best way forward". In the end, the most important issue relating to the courts in Northern Ireland is the quality of the justice that they dispense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, we have been over this ground a good many times. Nevertheless, I want to follow on from what the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said. In Committee, I mentioned the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly had chosen the flax flower as its shared symbol. I commended that as a highly sensible and construction decision on what we all acknowledge to be a deeply divided society.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para5"></a>I have been listening to the debate, and it has just occurred to me that, here in London, on the outside of the Old Bailey, there is a large figure of Justice holding the scales evenly balanced. Could that be a suitable symbol for the exterior&#151;or even the interior&#151;of courts in Northern Ireland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, the matter is simple. It is a fundamental part of the agreement that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and will remain as such, so long as the majority desires that. It is fundamental that, in part of the United Kingdom, the courts of justice are the courts under the Crown, and it is only proper to show that that is so. It should show people that the courts have nothing to do with politics and administer justice under the Crown. So far as I am aware, no one has ever objected to having the crown on a courthouse as such.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has, essentially, said what I was going to say. However, it bears saying again.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para6"></a>We are frequently reminded of the sanctity of the Belfast agreement and the importance of the peace process. That agreement states clearly that, while,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the present wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is to maintain the Union",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-12_para7"></a>that shall be the position. Why are we trying to anticipate what may&#151;or may not&#151;happen after May 2003 or later? We are treating an important matter as a political football and ignoring the words used by the Government themselves when they remind us&#151;as they do frequently&#151;how sacred the Belfast agreement is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, in response to what the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, has said, one could say that it is precisely because the agreement acknowledges that, for the time being and until there is a vote the other way, Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, that there must be concessions, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, suggested. That is why there must be a compromise. That is why the two communities must adjust and acknowledge the outcome of the Belfast agreement, which is that there <P>


<a name="column_384"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>must be some form of compromise. That is implicit in the overall principle that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom until the citizens of Northern Ireland decide otherwise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-12_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, we have had a long debate on the subject, and it might be appropriate if, with the agreement of your Lordships, I were to speak to Amendment No. 86, which would leave out Clause 65, even though it is not in this group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para8"></a>Many views have been expressed in the House. I have listened many times to the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, and have done so with admiration for the sincerity of what he said. I still admire his sincerity, but, today, I feel that he is, perhaps, not quite in the real world on these matters.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para9"></a>My reason for tabling an amendment to leave out the whole clause goes back to the theme of the arguments that I have made throughout the passage of the Bill. First, as has been said, Northern Ireland is wholly and integrally a part of the United Kingdom. There is no question about its sovereignty or about where that sovereignty lies. Secondly, the Good Friday agreement is, as the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Dubs, said, a compromise agreement. It is full of compromises. As I said from the Dispatch Box on Monday night, we should congratulate the Government on setting it up and getting it to where they got it. However, this Bill is about the judicial system of a part of the United Kingdom. Political compromise should be no part of a judicial system, for goodness' sake.
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para10"></a>The judges do not take their authority from Mr Trimble or Mr Adams or whoever the First Minister or Deputy First Minister is. Where do they take it from? They take it from the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. If the judges take their authority from the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, everybody who lives in Northern Ireland&#151;of whatever persuasion&#151;is bound by the law of Northern Ireland. That law is operated under the authority of our Sovereign. If that is the situation&#151;leaving aside the objections of those who refuse to accept the authority of the legal system in Northern Ireland, of whom there are a few&#151;what is wrong with having Her Majesty's coat of arms displayed where it has always been and where it is to be found in every courthouse in the rest of the United Kingdom?
<P>

<a name="20704-12_para11"></a>I have also criticised the Government for raising hares that should not have been raised. They have raised the temperature unnecessarily on some matters. In the agreement, it was accepted by all parties that there were flags, symbols and emblems that were sensitive matters for all parties to the agreement and that, where possible, they should not be removed or banned. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, spoke just now about the fact that the coat of arms can be found on courthouses in the Republic. I asked Jonathan Caine, who works for us in Central Office, to find out for me how often the royal title is used in the Republic of Ireland. He found, I think, two pages of "Royal This", "Royal That" and "Royal The Other" in the <P>


<a name="column_385"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Yellow Pages. What is more, if noble Lords go to Leinster House, they will see the shamrock well painted on the gates: they will also still see the crown. If the Government of the Republic of Ireland are content to operate in and around the crowns, thistles and other symbols of the United Kingdom and of the Ireland of the old days, why must we be so destructive in this way? It is not necessary to raise these hares.

My mind goes back to the agreement of 1993, the framework documents and other instruments over which we laboured for months and&#151;it sometimes seemed&#151;for years, seeking the kind of compromise that would help matters forward. So, I trust that I do not need to be reminded of the need for give and take. But it does not follow from the need to give and take that this part of the legislature has to accept in total the compromise that has been put forward either by the review body or, as is the case here in a rather rare instance, where the Government have departed from the strict letter of that compromise.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para1"></a>The review body was infinitely earnest, hard-working and admirable, but it has come to a view and, in turn, we are entitled to come to a view. The difference between us and the membership of the review body is that we are vested with a legislative right and a legislative duty. It is for us to make up our own minds. While there is much in the review that is quite admirable, here I believe the membership has gone wrong.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para2"></a>I look forward to hearing from the noble and learned Lord who is to reply whether the Government are acting in pursuit of a principle here. I do not know what that principle could be, but if there is one then I should be glad to learn it. I think that the answer is more likely to be that the proposal is based on expedience. There is nothing wrong with expedience, so long as it turns out to be expedient.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para3"></a>What appears to have been balanced here by the review body is the virtual certainty that the provision in the Bill seeking to deny the royal coat of arms to be displayed in certain courts is going to cause deep affront to those who support the Union and its continuance. It will do so because, as has been made clear during our previous discussions, it will seem to confirm the notion that there is something incompatible with neutrality and impartiality in the court system if the royal arms are displayed.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para4"></a>We know what will cause affront, so let us look at what will be the benefit. It will be the avoidance of what the review body states at paragraph 8.61 as follows,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we are conscious that the presence of the Royal Coat of Arms in a prominent position in the courtroom could be regarded by some as off-putting and inconsistent with the need for court proceedings to take place in a neutral environment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-13_para5"></a><P>


<a name="column_386"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The review body is perfectly entitled to take that view, although it is difficult to understand how anyone appearing in court could be put off by seeing the royal coat of arms, or that the body seriously thinks that the royal coat of arms might detract from the neutrality of the court environment. I say that because, as has already been pointed out, judges owe their duty not to the government of the day but to the Sovereign. In that regard, the presence of the royal coat of arms serves as a reminder of that impartiality rather than a kind of allusion to partiality or detraction from neutrality.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para6"></a>We have to ask the question: must we accept the package and every item in it simply because it is a package? I advance the view earnestly that we would be failing in our duty as legislators if we delegated to the review body, distinguished as it is, that duty. We have to think about each and every component of the package, as well as considering the influence of each item on the package as a whole.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para7"></a>Along with other noble Lords and, I am sure, the noble and learned Lord on the Government Front Bench, I have listened with great care to the debate. Certain aspects of the proposals in this Bill, if they were not so serious, could be described as ludicrous. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, has alluded to them. Other aspects are not ludicrous; they are very grave indeed. I shall not go over them because that would detain the House unjustifiably. However, when he looks at the end of his brief and sees the word "Resist" printed there, I urge the Minster to add, in his mind's eye, a further amendment which does not appear on the Marshalled List. It would read as follows: "Delete 'Resist' and insert 'Think again'".
<P>

<a name="20704-13_time0"></a><H5>5.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to say that I tabled amendments in Grand Committee which proposed the exact opposite of what has been proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan. For various reasons I did not move them. However, I should like to echo the remark of my noble friend Lord Dubs: there is another view. That other view has to be presented. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, pointed out, we should not pretend&#151;at least not in Northern Ireland and in the context of the Belfast agreement&#151;that certain symbols are neutral. We all know that there are very few neutral symbols in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para8"></a>I should like to respond to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about the Republic of Ireland. If the Republic can display symbols that go against its principles but not be bothered by them, that is because justice is conducted according to the law of the land. What do symbols matter when that is the case? Symbols are not important and the fewer of them we have on either side, the better it shall be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-13_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, in many ways this has been a somewhat sad and troubled debate. I should like first to respond to some of the comments made in rather trenchant terms by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. I think it was he who said <P>


<a name="column_387"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that this legislation is a "one-way street"; that it listens to gunfire and the clicking of the safety catch; and that it alienates those who walk the path of peace. I wish to say to noble Lords that the reverse is true. I have said this before, but I shall repeat it. It took the courage of the good people of Northern Ireland, from both communities, to lend their voice to peace. It is their courage that we celebrate and it is their courage that we now seek to reinforce.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para9"></a>The judicial system in Northern Ireland has operated well and Her Majesty's Government will jealously protect it, both now and in the future. I have also said this before, but I shall repeat it. Only when the institutions of Northern Ireland are ready will the system enable devolution of justice and its administration to be transferred. Symbols are just that: symbols. If we consider the reality of the Northern Irish courts, they have dispensed justice with integrity for a great many years. Nothing is about to change.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para10"></a>I am aware that this is a vitally important issue. It was closely debated in another place and then debated in detail by noble Lords in Grand Committee. Those debates were exhaustive, but some would say that they were not exhaustive enough because many of the arguments have been rehearsed again this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Desai, mentioned that two sets of amendments were tabled in Grand Committee. Those two groups of amendments sought to achieve the opposite effect. If no other proof were needed, that alone demonstrates the difficulty of striking the right balance in this area. Again, as I have remarked before, balance is the key to this clause. We seek to strike a balance between the sensitivities of the various communities in Northern Ireland and the constitutional position of the courts. We seek to strike a balance between the exterior and the interior of courtrooms, as well as balance regarding a neutral environment and courthouses of historical and architectural merit.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 82 and 84 require the royal coat of arms to be displayed in all courtrooms. Amendment No. 85 requires the royal coat of arms to be displayed outside all courthouses and removes the prohibition on their display on the exterior of existing courthouses where they are not already displayed. These amendments fly in the face of the balance which has been struck and I urge the House to resist any challenges.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para13"></a>We have to recognise that the reality in Northern Ireland is that at present there is a variation from court to court as to the symbols displayed. Contrary to what was asserted by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, it does not appear that this is dependent upon whether it is a Catholic area or a Protestant area. They vary. The noble Lord is shaking his head. If it was not he, I apologise to him. It may have been another noble Lord who made that point. In fact, I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Fitt.
<P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para14"></a>So we already have to deal with a variation. Perhaps I may give an example. There are coats of arms in Newry, but not in Ballymena. So we already have a degree of inconsistency with which Northern Ireland has lived in a relatively contented way.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para15"></a>We should remind ourselves of what was said in the review. I know that the noble and learned Lord made reference to paragraph 8.61, but that paragraph should be read in its entirety because it first refers to the Belfast agreement. It also has to be read in conjunction with what the review said about the way it would deal with the past.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para16"></a>Noble Lords will know that the review met for the first time on 1st July 1998; it had 45 days of plenary meetings; it issued more than 5,000 copies of its consultation paper; it held more than 70 meetings with interested groups and organisations; it received 90 written submissions; and it spoke to many, many ordinary men and women on the ground to seek their views&#151;not only legislators' views, not only interested parties' views, but the views of the ordinary men and women of Northern Ireland&#151;of what they thought should happen. A series of nine seminars were held across Northern Ireland in May and June 1999, to which more than 3,000 individuals, groups and organisations were invited and more than 300 attended.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para17"></a>What did the review say after all this? It talked about the past and about the future. I draw your Lordships' attention to what is said at paragraph 1.19 on page 6 and 1.20 on page 7. At paragraph 1.19 the review states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we heard some suggestions that, if the system was working, change should not be introduced for the sake of it . . . There was, of course, a range of opinions between these positions and there was much discussion about the workings of particular parts of the criminal justice system".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-13_para18"></a>At paragraph 1.20 it continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But we did listen carefully to genuinely and strongly held views, from differing perspectives, about past events. It was important for us to understand these points of view if we were to develop recommendations for arrangements most likely to inspire the confidence of all parts of the community in the future. We do not express any opinion about the validity of the views about past events and wish to stress that where we suggest change, this should not in itself be taken as implying criticism of what has gone before".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-13_para19"></a>So the changes in the review were recommended to create the prospect of a happier future for all the people of Northern Ireland, from both sides of the community.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para20"></a>I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that we are not delegating the duty to this body, but we believe that its work deserves our attention and that we should listen. We are listening.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para21"></a>The review clearly states that it makes these recommendations because the presence of the royal coat of arms,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"could be regarded by some as off-putting and inconsistent with the need for court proceedings to take place in a neutral environment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-13_para22"></a><P>


<a name="column_389"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The Government also acknowledge that there are those who may feel that way. We seek therefore to minimise those sensitivities, consistent as far as possible with the sensitivities of others. It is a fine balance.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para23"></a>Many noble Lords have in other debates rightly and eloquently supported the outstanding contribution of the Northern Ireland judiciary to the justice system. We cannot allow this one narrow issue to cloud that system, which has so much to commend it. That is why the review made that recommendation and that is why the Government have accepted it.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para24"></a>This is the history and the background to the clause. As I have said from the outset, I am aware of the sensitivities surrounding this matter, but the review is persuasive. This clause should be seen in the context of the Belfast agreement's adherence to the principle of mutual respect which forms the basis of the new Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para25"></a>By way of conclusion, I say again that the review struck a balance, and this clause reflects that balance. As recommended by the review, it prohibits the display of royal arms within courtrooms, though with the exception of those courthouses which are architecturally or historically important. Royal arms will continue to be displayed on the exterior of existing courthouses where they are already displayed.
<P>

<a name="20704-13_para26"></a>I hope that your Lordships will feel that the Government have striven, honestly and with integrity, to chart a path with which both parts of the community in Northern Ireland will be content, but also making clear that justice will never be subservient to mere symbols.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am not persuaded. I have a slightly different argument. I believe that we should maintain the status quo. It was quite unnecessary to raise this hare and the Bill would be considerably better without this clause. This would leave some courthouses in certain parts of the Province with coats of arms and other courthouses in other parts without them. As the noble Baroness said, they do not necessarily reflect the persuasions of the communities, so why do we have to interfere? The Bill will be considerably better without this clause. I wish to test the opinion of the House. I beg to move.

<a name="20704-14_para8"></a>The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach agreed with Sinn Fein at the Weston Park talks in July to do something to enable such fugitives, who have never been brought to justice, to return to their communities. The Prime Minister has recently given assurances that there was no offer of amnesty nor was one asked for. The Prime Minister nevertheless considers himself committed to finding a solution.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para9"></a>The OTRs include those who have planted the Enniskillen bomb. Their identities and the crimes for which they were responsible are already well known to the community, and the fact that they have fled and never dared to return suggests at least a recognition of guilt.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para10"></a>Since the intention to allow them to return became known, there has been widespread grief and rage in both the Unionist and the republican communities. That grief and rage are all the greater since there are no plans for the return of the many families exiled to the mainland under threat of death if they return. They are exiles solely because they displeased the violent and armed paramilitaries who still rule the streets in Belfast, four years after the Belfast agreement. These victims dare not testify against their oppressors and the police cannot act. So the innocent must remain exiles, while the OTRs, each with a record of crime, violence and murder, are to return and be welcomed home by their paramilitary community.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para11"></a>That is why I have tabled this amendment. I believe that the victims of the OTRs are entitled to be consulted and warned. The Government may well say that of course the scheme will cover them. Without explicit provision on the face of the Bill of the kind that I have proposed, it will not.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para12"></a>First, the present scheme refers to released prisoners. We still do not know whether the OTRs are to serve any prison term. Secondly, the existing early release information scheme states that the scheme does not apply to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person convicted who may not have served a prison sentence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para13"></a>or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a prisoner who has not received a sentence of five years or more".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para14"></a>Finally, the scheme lays down that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the protection of some of the individuals involved, specific information may not be provided".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para15"></a><P>

<a name="20704-14_para16"></a>We do not know what formula will be invoked to fulfil the commitment made by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach that they would,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"take such steps as are necessary in their jurisdiction to resolve the difficulty so that those concerned are no longer pursued"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para17"></a>although I welcome the Prime Minister's intention, as I understand it, to bring those proposals to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para18"></a>The Government have argued that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such people would, if convicted, stand to benefit by early release",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para19"></a>and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued".

<a name="column_393"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
On all those counts, it seems certain that under the provisions of the present early release scheme which I have cited, and perhaps particularly under the provision for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the protection of the individuals involved",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-14_para21"></a>the victims of the crimes of the OTRs would not be entitled at present to have advance warning of their triumphant reappearance on the streets where their victims live.
<P>

<a name="20704-14_para22"></a>I believe that we owe it to the victims of the OTRs to ensure on the face of the Bill that their rights are expressly preserved. I have considerable faith that the noble and learned Lord will recognise the justice and the timeliness of this amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20704-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend's amendment. The noble and learned Lord may tell us that it is not necessary and that the point is covered. But we do not believe that it is adequately covered in the Bill as it stands. I know of the noble and learned Lord's concern for victims and I have personal knowledge of similar happenings, with violent people being released from prison without their release being made known to their victims. In Grand Committee we heard the story about the happening in Wales.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para0"></a>This would not be a difficult provision to include in the Bill. It is not political in any way. It would merely provide a good safeguard to ensure that the "awful happening" did not in fact happen&#151;by that, I mean, for example, the mother, father, husband or wife of a victim of the Omagh bombing running into the person who is known to have committed that atrocity in the street without having been warned that it might happen. I strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I have great sympathy with the amendment and with the sentiments behind it. As I have said previously, we on these Benches would not support a fudge. We believe that true democratic parliamentarians should abide by two cardinal rules: first, that elections are free and fair; and, secondly, that the rule of law is upheld. So we should not be party to any sort of fudge or amnesty declared before due process.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para1"></a>That said, I understand that such terms as "OTRs" are not appropriate in the Bill and that the amendment would need to be better drafted. I understand also that the amendment as drafted is slightly contradictory and is not quite what the noble Baroness intends.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para2"></a>We shall listen to what the Minister has to say. But unless there is satisfaction here, we should support such a proposal at Third Reading if the noble Baroness were to redraft her amendment and if we were not satisfied with the Government's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it may be helpful in dealing with the noble Baroness's amendment and the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to return to the Bill itself, and to page 59. This part of the Bill deals with information about <P>


<a name="column_394"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discharge and the temporary release of prisoners. So one has the two possibly damaging circumstances: either a temporary release&#151;which has historically been more liberally used in Northern Ireland than in England and Wales&#151;or the discharge at the end of the sentence.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para3"></a>Clause 67(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State must make a victim information scheme and may from time to time make a new scheme or alterations to a scheme".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-15_para4"></a>We need to inform our minds about what a victim information scheme is. It is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a scheme requiring the Secretary of State to make available information about the discharge or temporary release of persons serving sentences of imprisonment in Northern Ireland imposed in respect of the commission of offences . . . to victims of the offences who wish to receive it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-15_para5"></a>So first of all it is available to those who wish to receive it&#151;many do not&#151;but it is about the discharge or temporary release of persons serving sentences of imprisonment. If those to whom the noble Baroness refers are sentenced after due process, to use the words in the amendment, they are covered anyway.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, is right. There is no definition of "OTRs"&#151;"on the runs". I agree that we have all used the term as our own shorthand, but there is no legal definition known to me, and I do not believe that it would be possible to find one. After all, I know what the noble Baroness is referring to. I think she means those who have committed offences which might generally be described as "terrorist" or might be scheduled offences. But the departed burglar is "on the run" in the same way as the departed terrorist is.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para7"></a>I am saying that, first, the amendment is flawed. I appreciate that that does not go to the substance of the matter, but it would be quite improper&#151;I hope I use that word without offence&#151;to include a term as flawed as that in a Bill of any sort. But, in any event, if these prisoners are discharged or are temporarily released, they are covered in any event by Clause 67(2).
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para8"></a>As a further assistance to your Lordships, one needs to look at Clause 67(9). I take the point that is implicit in the noble Baroness's approach and, I believe, that of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran: what about someone who has been convicted but perhaps not sentenced because he escaped, as some did, before being sentenced? That is dealt with in Clause 67(9) which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A scheme may make different provision in relation to . . . imprisoned offenders convicted or sentenced at different times".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-15_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20704-15_para10"></a>I would make two points. The first may be thought by the noble Baroness to be an ignoble lawyer's point, but it is an important one when dealing with any statute, especially with a Bill of this importance. Secondly, if offenders have been imprisoned or discharged on temporary release, they are covered in any event.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, with gratitude and appreciation. It was extremely helpful.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para11"></a>Will the Minister clarify whether he is considering the possibility that I might come back at Third Reading with an amendment related to subsection (9)? I agree that that would be a more appropriate place, but the problem remains. Those OTRs are likely to be released by the time the Bill becomes law. Therefore, I am concerned that the legislation should provide for that. Will the noble and learned Lord consider the issue further and advise me with his admirable expertise how I might bring into the Bill&#151;possibly at Clause 67(9)&#151;an amendment that would have that effect? I believe that I would have the House with me on that, as well as the noble and learned Lord. Will he clarify the issue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am not encouraging the noble Baroness to come back at Third Reading. I am perfectly happy for the sense of the House to be taken this evening.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para12"></a>I return to the fundamental point, which is not about drafting, as the noble Baroness concedes. If OTRs, as they are known, though not in law, are sentenced to imprisonment, discharged or temporarily released, they are covered by the Act in any event. They are no different from any other criminal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, may I be allowed to pursue the question further? I really do not understand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We never pay attention to them when the noble Baroness is speaking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I shall try not to take advantage of that.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para13"></a>I am seeking help in finding a way to ensure that the victims are notified when those people are about to be returned to the streets precisely because it seems quite possible that they will not be convicted and will not therefore be discharged. Nevertheless they will be known to have committed those crimes and would not have stayed away for 15 years had they not committed them.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para14"></a>We need a formula to cover that. I recognise that the Minister has quoted exclusions in the Bill that will exclude them, but how can we include them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Baroness intends to withdraw her amendment, as I suspect, I must not detain the House too much longer. I take her point that what she wants cannot be achieved in this way. I am more than willing to speak to her informally if she so wishes, but I cannot assist in the drafting at this stage. I should make it plain that no decision has been made in respect of those who are fugitive from the jurisdiction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-15_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, since I understand from those remarks that there is no possibility of returning to the issue at Third Reading, I should like to test the opinion of the House, if only to make the point.

<a name="20704-15_para18"></a><P>

"( ) No local community safety partnership may be established until the Secretary of State has issued practical guidance about the way in which local community safety partnerships will operate."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-15_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords for that disturbance. It was clearly demonstrated by the chairman when he started speaking that the loudspeaker was not on. By the time he finished it was. I wear hearing aids and link into the loop. If the loop is not on, I do not hear. I apologise for the failure to follow through the Division that was intended.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para20"></a>Amendment No. 87 would ensure that no local community safety partnership is established until practical guidance has been issued by the Secretary of State. I return to the point that practical guidance should accompany new introductions to the criminal justice system. I remain unsure as to how the new local community safety partnerships will sit alongside existing community safety structures and DPPs in Northern Ireland. My noble friends the Ulster Unionists have some points to make on that matter. Therefore, I shall not expound, except to say that it is not clear as it stands how those responsible for implementing the partnerships are supposed to proceed within the existing framework.
<P>

<a name="20704-15_para21"></a>The amendment is similar to one that I moved on a different subject earlier today. I am not suggesting that we do not want to see community safety partnerships operating satisfactorily and well. However, the legislation needs to be tidied up so that the necessary codes of practice or guidance notes are in place before any particular partnership, or the partnership scheme as a whole, gets under way. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>establishing local community safety partnerships until such times as the Secretary of State has issued practical guidance is no guarantee that safeguards will be forthcoming.

<P>

<a name="20704-16_para0"></a>Although I support, in principle, the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I believe this amendment will not achieve his proposals.

The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has served a purpose in highlighting the problem. Speaking to people who will be involved in those partnerships, it is apparent that there is a need for real clarity before we go too far down that road. It is important that the partnerships start on a firm footing, with no confusion over exactly what their role will be, and before we think about nominations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief. I, too, support my noble friend Lord Glentoran. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, implied that it was impossible for a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ever to come forward with a practical solution to one of the problems of the Province. We Secretaries of State must stick together. I must dissent from him in that. I shall not rehearse again the 29 months since the Secretary of State made a preliminary Statement in January 2000 about these matters. An enormous amount of printer's ink has been spilt on those issues in the ensuing 29 months.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para1"></a>If anyone has taken the trouble to read through all that has been said, there is some lack of clarity&#151;partly because of changes in policy direction during the 29 months. I believe my noble friend has done the House a considerable service by tabling a preliminary and cautionary amendment to ensure that when we move into active mode there will be a hymn sheet from which everyone can sing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall remind your Lordships that we have made a number of order-making powers in the clause subject to affirmative resolution. Therefore, we have further parliamentary scrutiny and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has approved that. A number of voluntary partnerships have already been established in district council areas. More partnerships are being developed by the statutory organisations.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para2"></a>Certain guidelines have already been issued and are in place&#151;for instance, how to perform a community audit. Others will be produced as needs are identified&#151;for example, the steps to go through in setting up a partnership. Guidelines are a source of <P>

<a name="20704-16_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is important to give some background on how local community safety partnerships have developed. The process has been without order or logic. To some extent, what we are doing today is belated and out of time.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para6"></a>The consultative document, which I hold in my hand, was produced on 16th April this year. I shall not go through it in detail. Despite that document arriving on our desks only on or after that date, one month later&#151;on 17th May&#151;a letter from the Northern Ireland Office was delivered to district councils, stating the Government's intention to encourage the formation of local community safety partnerships. The letter advised district councils of the availability of funding for the post of community safety co-ordinators for the local partnerships. It went on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are taking this step in advance of the completion of the consultation on the strategy because we have been asked by a number of existing and prospective partnerships to make it available now".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-16_para7"></a>I ask your Lordships to ponder on that sequence of events and on that letter, which shows that whatever bona fide consultees may have contributed and irrespective of what may be decided in your Lordships' House and in another place, decisions have already been implemented. The letter that I have in my hand goes on to say that £30,000 is immediately available towards administrative support and to the post of community safety co-ordinator for local partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para8"></a>Your Lordships will understand if I, as a borough councillor and as a Member of your Lordships' House, begin to wonder what my role and that of your Lordships is. I have no indication of which existing or prospective people have been so pressuring the Government that money is already being thrown at district councils.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para9"></a>After Grand Committee, I went to a meeting to be addressed by some of those responsible for explaining the role of community safety partnerships. After I had heard some detail, I pointed out that we were creating but another talking shop. Northern Ireland already has more than 600 councillors, 108 Members of the Assembly, 18 Members of Parliament and three MEPs, not to mention those from Northern Ireland who sit in your Lordships' House or the innumerable multitude of quangos, committees, sub-committees and amalgams of committees.

<a name="20704-16_para10"></a>It is only fair that your Lordships understand that we are being told that these groups coming together will have funds and will contribute funds to make something positive happen for community safety. I asked officers of the housing executive and found that they have no money. They have less money for ordinary maintenance this year than they had last year. When I asked any of the statutory bodies that have been mentioned about providing money to local community safety partnerships, they said that maybe the Government would give them money. Bluntly, a lot of them are going to be there, simply because they think that more money might be thrown at the problem. We do not know.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para11"></a>We do not even know what role in society the local community safety partnerships may have. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal was good enough to write to us on 20th June, sending us a briefing paper prepared by the Northern Ireland Office on community safety and community safety partnerships. Paragraph 11 of that paper said that the functions of community safety partnerships and district policing partnerships are very different. It went on to say that the district policing partnerships,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are established as an accountability body for the police at local level".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-16_para12"></a>Section 16 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 contains no provision to delegate accountability&#151;I emphasise that word&#151;for police at local level to DPPs.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para13"></a>It is worth pondering Section 16 of that Act a little further. It lists the functions of a district policing partnership. I shall not bore the House with that information in detail&#151;noble Lords can find it themselves&#151;but within the functions of district policing partnerships are the same duties as are now being delegated to community safety partnerships. The two lists are not identical in every detail, but there are many similarities. For example, district policing partnerships have to make arrangements,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to act as a general forum for discussion and consultation on matters affecting the policing of the district".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-16_para14"></a>That duty is being imposed on community safety partnerships. Section 16(1)(e) of that Act says that a DPP can make arrangements for obtaining various things and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such other functions as are conferred on it by any other statutory provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-16_para15"></a>So we did not have to have duplication; I draw that firmly to the attention of noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para16"></a>I must enter a caveat at this stage. I do not want it to be interpreted that somehow I am against community safety endeavours, just as it was somehow interpreted earlier&#151;I was about to intervene&#151;that because I have certain opinions about symbols, I do not know how to compromise with those who differ from me. I do not want to digress, but I thought that in that regard it was fully understood that the compromise was the Belfast agreement 1998 and that whatever happened should happen within the context of that agreement and should not be outside it, embellishing it or eroding it.

There was a meeting yesterday, I am led to believe, of the Policing Board, at which the SDLP, the DUP, Ulster Unionists and independents joined together to say that they did not want community safety partnerships. That conveys the difficulty&#151;the conflict&#151;that many of us have to face up to. Do we take the adamant view that we do not want community safety partnerships because they duplicate the responsibilities that are already vested in the DPPs&#151;they divert essential members of other statutory bodies away from the work that they know and do best&#151;or do I try to seek some sort of compromise, so that we give some sort of acquiescence to community safety partnerships but ensure that those community safety partnerships work under and are subordinate to DPPs?
<P>

<a name="20704-16_para18"></a>There are other considerations in this regard. The areas of responsibility of DPPs are coterminous with district council areas. The local police areas of command are coterminous&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, for clarity, is the noble Lord speaking to Amendments Nos. 89B, 89C and 90A, which refer to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and DPPs, as well as to Amendment No. 87ZA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   Yes, my Lords. I am trying, without impinging on the time of noble Lords, to paint the overall picture of how all of these matters impinge on each other.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para0"></a>I was saying that district council areas are coterminous with police areas of command and with DPPs but that there has been no clarity about whether they are coterminous with the proposed community safety partnerships. We must now look critically at the whole concept and discover whether we can put in place an arrangement that will benefit society, that will secure value for money and which will not be exploited&#151;that has been the huge difficulty that we have had so far.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para1"></a>I was diverted for a moment by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who asked whether I was speaking to Amendment No. 89. I thought that we had moved on to Amendments Nos. 89B and 89C.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can help; I think that there is some confusion. We are actually dealing with Amendments Nos. 87ZA and 89A. I think that the noble Lord has not been speaking to those amendments, which is why the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, courteously inquired whether the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, had perhaps misheard the Deputy Speaker call the amendments. Amendments Nos. 87ZA and 89A are both limited amendments. With great respect, I do not think that the noble Lord is speaking to the amendments that have been called.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords. I did mishear. Although I have strayed beyond the scope of those amendments, my comments apply very much to Amendment No. 87ZA. I obviously cannot withdraw the points that I have <P>


<a name="column_401"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made. However, they are pertinent to the whole question of whether we should establish community safety partnerships&#151;if they are established&#151;within the context of existing boundaries where other agencies and partnerships are coterminous with the district council area.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para2"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 89A. I have rightly, if accidentally, indicated our problems. My proposal in Amendment No. 89A is that if there is to be a community safety partnership, that must be vested in local government membership. We have had a couple of unfortunate instances of amalgams and partnerships that did not have clarity about who had primacy and which ran into financial difficulty in terms of accountability. If we have an area that is coterminous with all of those various agencies and if we have a district council controlling whatever amount of money may be become available if the partnerships are established, those of us who are publicly accountable will know exactly what is happening. One reason why that should be the case is that, otherwise, pressure will be put on civil servants, who have no chance to answer back when certain responsibilities are imposed on them which are outside the spirit of what I believe is intended to be achieved in this regard.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para3"></a>I apologise to noble Lords for moving beyond the scope of the amendment. But that saves the House from having to listen to me at greater length later on. I am grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, it would help me if he could indicate whether he wishes to move Amendment No. 87ZA and speak to Amendment Nos. 89A, 89B, 89C and 90A. I believe that it would assist the House were he to agree that in effect that is what he has done and then we can have one debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness knows that it would always be my intention to try to assist the House. I may, in error, have managed to bring together five amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, has exhibited his usual charm in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, for the sensible way forward that she has suggested. He is quite right in saying that the amendments in the second group which have been referred to touch on the same subject.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para4"></a>The reason why, on balance, I disagree with my noble friend is that certainly from my own experience of local government on Merseyside where partnerships were established, they were enriched by other statutory organisations becoming involved in them. If they become too local government focused and orientated, I do not believe that that would necessarily be to the advantage of the partnership.
<P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para5"></a>I believe that the noble Lord is well aware that membership of the partnerships is designed to include health and social services boards, education, library and probation boards, the police, the Northern Ireland housing executive and other statutory organisations. When the Minister replies perhaps he will be able to confirm that the problem is that with the review of public administration which is currently under way by the executive, it is necessary in the meantime to reserve power to the Secretary of State because until the review has been concluded we do not know exactly who the statutory agencies are.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para6"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 89A, were it to be passed by your Lordships this evening, reserving, for instance, the chairmanship and the administration in the local government membership of that partnership, would stunt and limit it. By reserving power to people who are elected representatives in local government would make the position far too narrow. It is right to trust the Secretary of State in this matter. I believe that the partnerships will be to the advantage of Northern Ireland if they work out as they have done in other urban areas in England. I know how passionate and committed is the noble Lord to the upholding of law and ensuring that the policing agencies get the public support to which they are entitled and that those responsible for breaking the law are brought to justice.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para7"></a>If he were right in any sense that people not committed to upholding the law were able to infiltrate these partnerships and take them over, I am certain that in those circumstances the Secretary of State would remove those members from the partnerships who behaved in that way. It would help if the Minister were able to confirm that to be the case when he replies. In any event, knowing the noble and learned Lord and the Secretary of State, it is pretty unlikely that the people about whom all of us would have deep fears and reservations would be appointed to such bodies in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Maginnis and what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has said about the Safer Merseyside Partnership. I am sure that he is aware, as I am, that the chairperson of that partnership is a member of the Merseyside Police Authority. The chief constable is also a member.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para8"></a>When I come to speak to Amendment No. 91, I shall refer to the question of whether they can be amalgamated to a certain extent or whether they should work together. Because Merseyside is one of the best practice examples in this country, it is absolutely clear that it is not the case that the safety partnerships cannot be linked with DPPs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is correct. There is a need for the work of the community safety partnerships. What is that work? It is to assist in the reduction of crime and to bring about a reduction in the level of fear of crime to the people in the community and enhance community safety. But some of these things can also be carried out by the district policing partnerships.
<P>


<a name="column_403"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para9"></a>People believe that there is now duplication. As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, there are already far too many quango organisations being created right across Northern Ireland in each district council area. In the council area of Moyle there are only 15,000 voters and yet massive community organisations are being created.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, fairly often points out that there is no one here from the SDLP. He very often speaks in a way which presents their case. I can say to the noble Lord that I can speak on behalf of the SDLP today because there is only one party in Northern Ireland which supports the Government as regards community safety partnerships and that is Sinn Fein.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para11"></a>If the Government are up to speed, they will know that yesterday, at a meeting of the policing board, which I attended, the SDLP, the Unionists, the DUP and the independent members which the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, mentioned, unanimously rejected the idea of the community safety partnerships. What is more, they instructed the chairman of the policing board to contact the Northern Ireland Office immediately and request that a Minister come before the policing board to explain what he is doing. That is the position of the SDLP on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, just to remind ourselves, following on the very helpful intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I am now speaking to Amendments Nos. 87ZA, 89A, which was in the original group, also Amendments Nos. 89B, 89C and 90A, which was the response of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis to the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington. I start with Amendment No. 87ZA.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, is absolutely right. He quite rightly reminds us that the Northern Ireland executive has launched a comprehensive review of local public administration in Northern Ireland. It may well impact on many statutory organisations, not least the district councils. The noble Lord is further correct in indicating that the only purpose of the clause in the Bill is to allow the Secretary of State flexibility to take account of any changes when he comes to place the CSPs on a statutory footing. There is no more to it than that.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para13"></a>As regards Amendment No. 89A, the chairmanship and administration of the local CSP shall be vested in the local government membership of the CSP, which, I suppose, in a Sinn Fein-controlled district council would inevitably give Sinn Fein the chairmanship and administration. I am not sure that the law of unintended consequences always works quite so ironically. I do not believe that that is what the noble Lord wants.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para14"></a>However, more fundamental than that, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who has vast experience, is absolutely right. We do not want to nominate a lead partner. We want a partnership of equals with every one having a degree of moral ownership of the work of the partnership. That deals with the first two amendments.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para15"></a>The next group is Amendments Nos. 89B, 89C and 90A. It will be remembered that in Grand Committee I accepted the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that the Secretary of State should be required to publish the reports. Therefore, there is no purpose in having the police service of Northern Ireland and other organisations specified in Amendment No 89B receiving the reports directly because I have accepted the proposition of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that they be published. The reports will be available in any event.
<P>

<a name="20704-17_para16"></a>Amendment No. 89C requires the CSP to have regard to the statutory functions of the DPP. But to echo the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, the CSP will have to have regard to the statutory functions of all its members. Therefore, I respectfully suggest that Amendment No. 89C is inappropriate. Amendment No. 90A defines a district police partnership, and I say nothing further about it.

<P>

<a name="20704-18_time0"></a><H5>7.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-18_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment. First, I declare an interest. Like my noble friend Lord Kilclooney, I serve on the Policing Board. I serve also on the sub-committee for community affairs, which deals with DPPs. My support for a measure which provides community safety is absolute. There is no question of that. However, I believe that the partnership should be much closer to, or even part of, district policing partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para13"></a>However, there are two misconceptions. The first is that DPPs are police. No members of DPPs are policemen; they are councillors and independent members not chosen by but approved by the Policing Board. There will be very few grounds for disapproving. DPPs are put before the board for approval. The partnerships could better be called "district partnerships on policing matters". The idea of a district policing partnership automatically leads one to believe that it is a policing institute. However, that is beside the point. The police attend only to discuss issues and to put forward their local policing plan. They are not in attendance the whole time.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para14"></a>The second misconception is that the Government know what they are talking about and no one else does. That is not always true, as a number of noble Lords believe is the case here. In his consultation document, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The development of this strategy is one of the key recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para15"></a>Development of the strategy is, but not into separate bodies. That is clearly stated in paragraph 11.11. The Government take the review and spill it out. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, who is not in her place, said a great deal about how wonderful the review was&#151;when it suited her. It obviously did not suit the Government on this occasion. The Secretary of State failed to state that that was in the review. However, a letter from the private secretary to Des Browne, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, stated that <P>


<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers were conscious that DPPs were established as a mechanism to hold the police to account. That is wrong.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para16"></a>As my noble friend Lord Maginnis said, that is not stated in the Act. Unlike my noble friend, I shall go through the functions because I am speaking to the right amendment, and cannot be interrupted. Section 16(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) to provide views to the district commander . . .

<a name="20704-18_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) to act as a general forum . . .".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para21"></a>Those tasks are set out in the 2000 Act. However, they are amazingly similar to the tasks for safety partnerships outlined in Clause 71. We have heard about the measure for the provision of finance.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para22"></a>In the minutes of a meeting with the Community Affairs Committee of the Policing Board, the head of the Criminal Justice Services Division stated that community safety partnerships could become a sub-committee of DPPs. I heard him say that; he said it relatively freely. However, I accept that when he returned to the office he had second thoughts. He wrote a letter which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While I did agree, in response to a question, that it might be possible to develop a model involving a sub-committee of the DPP as suggested, I fear that your letter rather misrepresents my position on this. I would not advocate such an arrangement. Our legal advice is that taking a direct role in relation to community safety would be outside the vires of the DPP".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para23"></a>He continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You suggest that I might be able to explain to the Committee how a sub-group of the DPP might work. I am afraid that I would not be qualified to do this. I have only a basic understanding of the DPP, limited to their role and function".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para24"></a>If he has such a basic understanding of it, what serious right has he to say that it should not be? I fail to see that.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para25"></a>The examples I have quoted show a total lack of understanding and a lack of joined-up government and thinking. How on earth can the two departments in the Northern Ireland Office, one involved in the policing Bill and the other in this Bill, not understand what each is doing, and argue the point? I cannot discover why the NIO is so determined to keep these two bodies separate. It is flying in the face of overwhelming opposition against its strategy for two separate bodies.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para26"></a>Unlike the NIO, the conclusions of those against the strategy came about as a result of well-informed, thoroughly consulted and well-justified research of both sides of the argument. One has to know who the bodies are and why they are doing this, and then ask why the Government are hell bent on their course. Perhaps it is jobs for the boys; I do not know. People have been working on this for a long time.

<P>

<a name="20704-18_para27"></a>We have heard about the consultative document. However, the closing date for responses was 3rd July; that is, midnight last night, and that has been extended. Yet here we are debating the Bill. That is brilliant. In his foreword, the Secretary of State says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I will carefully take into account all the views".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para28"></a>He has done well since midnight. At the end of the document, the following questions are asked:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Is the strategy structured correctly? Is the scope relevant?"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para29"></a>Before the Minister states that the consultation affects only issues outside the Bill, we must realise that that is not so, as the questions show. Structure and strategy are what the Bill is about. It is not about the detail. We do not have the codes of conduct or the suggestions for how they will operate. Therefore, this concerns the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para30"></a>Clearly, in order to justify separation of the two bodies, their tasks must be separate. However, the nine key issues for community safety as laid out by our friends, the Community Justice Service Division, not by me, are car crime; domestic burglary; business and retail crime; offences against women; youth offending; offences of prejudice and hatred&#151;sectarianism and racism; fear of crime; drugs and alcohol; and street violence. Is the prevention of any of those not connected closely with the police? The answer is not one; not even the fear of crime, which is not a crime in itself. If one looks in the police documents, which should be available to the Minister, it says clearly that they have to come back to fear of crime in the coming years. Therefore, although it is not a crime, it is included.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para31"></a>Only this department of the NIO, which admits that it knows virtually nothing about DPPs&#151;it said so, not me&#151;after working on it for three years, is supporting it. That is the core of the problem. It is not about parties, political beliefs, sectarianism, Roman Catholics, Protestants or ethnic minorities. It is straightforward management of one's affairs in the correct and proper way.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para32"></a>Who is against the strategy? The Criminal Justice Review Group is against having two different bodies. The Government fly in the face of that. At least 25 out of 26 councils are against it and have stated so. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is against having two parties. It is not against community safety; it has community safety officers. Are we about to appoint them? The big political term is community policing. Are we about to say that it has no role because we have community safety partnerships? No.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para33"></a>Your Lordships have just heard that the Policing Board is against the provisions across the political divide. There are other consultees. If one looks at the list of consultees&#151;I am not going to go through it&#151;some will support the implementation plan. But like the Criminal Justice Services Division of the NIO, they will know little about the tasks of DPPs. So I would expect them to be pro a safety plan, as I am, but when one knows a little more about DPPs, one realises that they should not accept it.

My noble friend Lord Maginnis mentioned most of the points about the councils. The Policing Board has come through to us with several additional problems.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para35"></a>What is the legal status of the bodies? Non-statutory. Who indemnifies the bodies? The councils are worried about that. They are being provided with £30,000 for staffing. They do not have indemnity cover. If many councils over here are not strapped for cash, I assure your Lordships that ours are. Who indemnifies the members? That is a problem. Who has the responsibility for audit and to whom are they accountable?
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para36"></a>The DPP is a statutory nominated body, but this is not. For example, Belfast has said that it cannot staff its four bodies. How will it be done? They will be run as a group of committees together with the DPP. Another noble Lord has dealt with the issue of the chairman.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para37"></a>The Safer Merseyside Partnership, to which my noble friend Lord Alton referred, is a classic example of how to do it, but it does not have DPPs with the strength of ours. That is probably why the police are on it. But the police have to be there. It is pie in the sky that someone can deal with safety in one corner of the town without the police knowing. It is no good saying that the bodies will talk to one another. Our police are strapped. They will have to attend DPPs by law. If they are pushed for staff they will not attend the community safety partnerships; they do not have to and why should they? They are accountable through the Policing Board, not the DPP.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para38"></a>The Police Service's response was luckily submitted before midnight or the later date, so the Secretary of State should have it. It says that the information about the commonality of the issues dealt with by DPPs and safety partnerships is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"further evidence of the need for the work of DPPs and community safety partnership to be integrated as far as possible".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para39"></a><P>

<a name="20704-18_para40"></a>The police are accountable to the Policing Board through the Northern Ireland policing plan. They are not accountable to the DPPs. The DPPs monitor, ask questions and make suggestions.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para41"></a>Paragraph 4.51 of the consultative document refers to key relationships. It says on safety partnerships,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It will be important that policing plans also reflect the Government objectives for the reduction of crime . . . It will be vital therefore for the CSU to establish an effective working relationship with the Policing Board, in view of that body's direct responsibility for policing",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para42"></a>which is fine, but we are talking about the local level. That is why we have the safety partnerships. It continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"most critically, for local CSP's to have close links with the District Policing Partnership established in their area to hold the police to account".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para43"></a>That is their phraseology, but it is incorrect.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para44"></a>It is all about linking closer together, yet the Government are trying to push the bodies apart. I am sorry that this is taking a while but it is about how this is meant to work. The board is under a statutory <P>


<a name="column_409"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obligation to produce a draft code of practice. It has done so, and in paragraphs 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4&#151;I shall not read them to your Lordships&#151;it says that the DPPs would have to have a close working relationship with the community safety partnerships and all local bodies statutory and otherwise.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para45"></a>When the document was presented to the Northern Ireland Office, it said, "take it out". The provision was taken out, which is amazing. Ultimately the Policing Board through the police is responsible for the nine key issues we discussed, at present laid down for safety partnerships. As it stands, DPPs and safety partnerships are separate bodies, but they are doing the same thing: studying and getting returns on causes and deterrents; solving crimes. There are bound to be differences in their surveys.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para46"></a>The safety partnerships could and should be part of DPPs or much more closely linked; as a sub-committee, for example. Yet the legal advice to the Criminal Justice Service Division seems to be incorrect. The head of that division said in his letter:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our legal advice is that taking a direct role in relation to community safety would be outside the vires of the DPP . . . in comments on an early draft of your code on the DPP functions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para47"></a>Section 16(1)(e) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 states in relation to the functions of the DPP&#151;and it was left wide open for precisely this purpose,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such other functions as are conferred on it by any other statutory provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-18_para48"></a>So we could do it now. It would be easy; a quick amendment and it would be done.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para49"></a>Immediately the response will be that sub-committees are not allowed. So Section 21, which is significantly in relation to Belfast but easily amended, permits sub-committees and people from outside who are not in the partnership in the beginning. There is no problem with including statutory bodies, so what is the problem?
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para50"></a>I turn to the funding of £2.5 million per year. It is said that there will be Lottery money, peace and reconciliation money, and so on. Between 26 partnerships, £2.5 million is not a great deal of money; I wish there was more. Do any noble Lords have an idea how much CCTV cost in North Belfast in the past month? I believe it was £1.25 million. We need more money.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para51"></a>With reference to the Lottery and other cross-border funds, are noble Lords aware that in Northern Ireland they hate joint funding? They like to fund things straight off. If the NIO is funding around the corner to the safety partnerships and if it is a reserve function such as security, there should be joint security through the DPPs. If not, why are they funding at the bottom level within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, department of housing and so on? I suggest that it is bypassing the Assembly. I support the amendment and I should like the Government to propose something in its stead.

<A NAME="20704-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I am as strongly opposed to  unnecessary bureaucracy and redundant organisations as anybody else in your Lordships' House. Having made that point, perhaps I can make just one point about policing and one point on community safety.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para52"></a>I know that over the years in Northern Ireland bodies called police and public liaison committees were set up. They existed in the worst of times and in face of considerable hostility to the police from a number of different quarters. Some of them, for example the one in Derry, still managed to do good work. I hope that the work of those bodies will not be lost sight of but will be carried forward into such district policing partnerships as may occur in future.
<P>

<a name="20704-18_para53"></a>On the matter of community safety, for many years some very good work has been done on crime prevention by, for example, Extern, which was mentioned earlier, by NIACRO, of which I have the honour to be president, and by quite a variety and range of youth organisations and other voluntary bodies. I hope that that work will not be lost in the sand but will be carried forward into this wider concept of community safety, which has quite a lot going for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, briefly I too should like to speak on Clause 71 and oppose its removal from the Bill. Though I understand the points made by my noble friend Lord Brookeborough this afternoon, I disagree with him about the need to take out this clause, not least because it is extremely flexible, on any reading.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para0"></a>The power in the clause can be exercised only after discussion with the Executive and the best way forward determined. It also recognises that bodies like the police could and should be involved in the local community safety partnerships and the Secretary of State is given the right in subsection (3) to specify, by order, who the membership of those bodies should be. So here is the opportunity to involve the police and I am certain that, given the experience of the Mersey partnership&#151;referred to several times this evening&#151;that is the way to do it.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para1"></a>Five years ago, when I had the honour to become a Member of your Lordships' House, I made my maiden speech on the subject of punishment beatings and the continued anarchy that reigned in many parts of Northern Ireland. Even to this day we know that there are people from both sides of the divide who have no respect for the law, who are not working with the police to maintain law and order in Northern Ireland and who ride roughshod over the wishes of the people in the community. But any of us who travel in Northern Ireland and meet people from both sides of the divide know that there is a common wish to see law and order established; the removal of the no-go areas; the drug barons dealt with; and an end to the kind of tensions there have been, especially involving youth crime. I am certain that the tools of local community and safety partnerships are a useful part of the armoury in dealing with those issues.
<P>


<a name="column_411"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para2"></a>Noble Lords today have warned about the dangers of unrest during this month and in the month that will follow in various parts of Northern Ireland. I understand in the context of the earlier debate on flags and symbols that in some parts of Northern Ireland the Palestinian flag is being flown in the nationalist communities and the Israeli flag in the unionist community, entrenching even further division. That is not a good example on which to build if we want hope for Northern Ireland. This enabling clause is one way forward. The Government have shown some imagination in the way they have drafted this Bill. It will be a great tragedy now to remove this clause.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para3"></a>Though I recognise the arguments about creating too many quangos and appointed bodies, the Secretary of State has the power in this clause to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication and replication. I am sure that he will take into account the need to have clear lines established, with authority given to perhaps just one body dealing with those issues. I hope that that will be vested in something like a local community and safety partnership rather than just a policing partnership.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, I rise simply to say that we are privileged to have heard the views of two distinguished members of the Policing Board, who have expressed to your Lordships not just their own views but the views of all the parties across the board who serve on the Policing Board. With respect I say that your Lordships, and the Government would be unwise to disregard those views.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, when I first came to this Bill, I felt that Clause 71 should not be part of it. I did not feel it was a part of the total judicial process. As the Bill has progressed I have changed my opinion.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para4"></a>I agree, and am delighted to do so, with the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool. On the other hand, what the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, had to say was both extremely interesting and worrying. On this side of the House we have been seriously concerned about the DPPs per se; about the potential conflicts of interest and over-bureaucratic management in such a small community and in particular&#151;small items but they will be important at the time&#151;the time that the police force will have to give to servicing those different groups when they could probably be spending their time in a more worthwhile way.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para5"></a>Without making a long speech I simply say that, on this side of the Chamber, we do not believe it is right to attempt to remove Clause 71 tonight. But we shall continue to chase the Government to tidy up their act in regard to the relationships between district policing partnerships, local authorities, community safety partnerships and so forth. There are too many local authorities&#151;we hope Stormont will tackle that. As a result of there being too many local authorities there will be too many DPPs; as a result of that there will also be too many community and safety partnerships. In general, too much money will be wasted and there will be too many people going round in circles to <P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>achieve what we all want to see achieved; that is, a clearing of the decks and a clear strategy for improving community safety in Northern Ireland involving the people of all communities.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para6"></a>It is with regret that I say to noble Lords on the other side of the Chamber that we will not be supporting the removal of Clause 71.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, before the Lord Privy Seal rises to respond, I must indicate that such is my concern&#151;I hope I spelt it out in general terms earlier in previous amendments; my noble friend Lord Brookeborough spelt it out in detail&#151;that I appeal to the Lord Privy Seal in terms of his response that he does not, as he did with me on the last group of amendments, ridicule by implication what has been said here this evening.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para7"></a>The Lord Privy Seal suggested that, by asking that the chairmanship should be vested in district councils, I was somehow promoting Sinn Fein, which may well have chairmen on some district councils. But the Lord Privy Seal well knows that there are members of Sinn Fein in many organisations. I sought to have district councils in the forefront because, irrespective of who may be the chairman or who may be in control, they are open to public accountability and to public scrutiny in a way that statutory bodies cannot be without further huge costs to the Exchequer and individual departments.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para8"></a>The Lord Privy Seal did not address the issues that were raised in relation to the precipitate way in which things were being put into place before there were any fundamental ground rules. I hope that on this occasion he will take the opportunity to enlarge on some of the points he may have missed earlier in the evening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I understand the frustration of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and my noble kinsman the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, on the details of Clause 71. I much admire the calm and good sense of the Minister in continuously bringing us back to the text of the Bill and its relationship to the amendments. One of the problems which those noble Lords trying to deal with this Bill have is that we are dealing with a real-time process on the Government's side which is operating in parallel to the examination and scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para9"></a>Perhaps I may give a tiny example in order to make the point. On Monday, the noble and learned Lord the Minister resented the suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that the Government's conduct was tardy in an area of the consultative process relating to a particular list of organisations. The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Browne&#151;whom I greatly admire&#151;said on 5th September in Committee in the other place that he hoped he would be able to complete the process that we are discussing by Report in the House of Lords. We now know from the noble and learned Lord's statement on Monday on Report that Mr Browne did not actually write until 28th February to consult the bodies involved in the exercise. That was only six days before the Report stage in the Commons. I realise that <P>


<a name="column_413"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that was not necessarily tardiness, but inevitably the two processes are not proceeding at the same pace. That places us all in some difficulty.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para10"></a>In this instance the consultative document was not sent out until the middle of April, which is a full six weeks after the Bill had its Third Reading in the House of Commons. Just as we are doing our best to sympathise with the noble and learned Lord the Minister, I hope that he will have some sympathy with our difficulty in following the detail of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para11"></a>The Minister perfectly properly picked up my noble friend Lady Park on the definition of OTRs and the difficulty of putting such individuals in the Bill. We have a similar difficulty in terms of how the detail will work when the process is going on in parallel and, if anything, a little behind the progress of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para12"></a>When the Secretary of State published his foreword to the consultative document he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am pleased to present this consultation paper setting out our ideas on a new inclusive partnership approach to creating a safer Northern Ireland.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-19_para13"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The development of this strategy was one of the key recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-19_para14"></a>What he did not do was to specify which recommendation in the criminal justice review he was referring to. He may have been referring to paragraph 11.51, which was obviously a strategic statement, because the Government immediately resisted and rejected the criminal justice review's recommendation in paragraph 11.61. The Minister courteously explained to me in a letter between Grand Committee and Report stage why it was not possible to consider the criminal justice review's recommendation in paragraph 11.61, which underlies some of the frustration expressed from the Cross-Benches in terms of the relationships between district police partnerships and community safety partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20704-19_para15"></a>I confess that I am not wholly clear where the Government are going, or even the Government know where they are going. If one does not know where one is trying to get to, any road will get one there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say something further on this issue. I quote from the noble and learned Lord's helpful letter of 3rd July about Amendment No. 87A. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As I explained, the Northern Ireland Executive has launched a Review of Public Administration, which is likely to result in significant changes to existing roles and responsibilities across organisations that could be expected to contribute to community safety. It would not be sensible to fix long-term arrangements now until the future shape of public administration in Northern Ireland becomes clearer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-20_para0"></a>That seems to me to support what my noble friend Lord Brooke has just said.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall just do as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, commended me for doing and go to the text of the amendment, which I know may be wearisome. The amendment simply states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Leave out Clause 71".

<a name="column_414"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
So, if noble Lords are minded to have local community safety partnerships they would vote against the amendment and if noble Lords thought that there was no purpose in them they would vote for the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said that I was ridiculing his earlier proposition. I was not. I was demonstrating that if one set out prescriptive rules in statute in some local authorities one would actually vest the administration and the chairmanship of a relevant body with Sinn Fein. That is one of the dangers of having over-prescriptive legislation.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para3"></a>I do not think that I can put the Government's approach better than the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Glentoran, have. Both said exactly what I have said: if noble Lords are in favour of these partnerships, which have a role to play, they should vote against the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para4"></a>There is a difference between these partnerships and the policing partnerships, the DPPs. The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, is quite right to say that all their functions are set out in Section 16(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. They are not the same functions as one finds in Clause 71 of the Bill. I believe that the experience referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in Merseyside offers an opportunity for local community safety partnerships to do work which is quite different from the work of the district policing partnership. I shall not read out Section 16 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, but I just remind your Lordships of its existence and its contents.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para5"></a>The local community safety partnerships have various duties which are clearly set out in Clause 71(4). I shall not read them out. They are on pages 61 and 62 of the Bill. The cautionary note that was sounded by the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, and indeed by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is one that the Government ought to pay attention to. Other noble Lords quite reasonably spoke of the possibility of over-bureaucratic solutions and a duplication of effort.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para6"></a>The Police Service for Northern Ireland will be represented on the community safety partnerships, but the primary focus of the DPP is on policing issues. The CSP has a much wider remit. One has only to look at Clause 71(4)(c) and (d). That duty is utterly different from that which a policing authority would normally be carrying out.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para7"></a>This is an opportunity for flexible systems for a divided community. I cannot assist further. I believe that Clause 71 is perfectly straightforward. If one supports it, one votes against the amendment; if one thinks there is no purpose in having them one votes for the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I wish to give him time perhaps to speak and consider the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, so that we can return to this at a later date. But at this stage I wish to withdraw our amendment.

<a name="20704-20_para22"></a>When my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General made the proposals for the expansion of the existing department of the Director of Public Prosecutions, your Lordships were grateful for his great care. We listened carefully to various questions and thoughts offered by your Lordships. I hope that your Lordships regard this as a response to concerns expressed, but we did not think that the timescale to establish the new service should be left open-ended. My noble and learned friend has therefore agreed that we should include a sunset clause in the Bill that would set a time limit of five years for that establishment&#151;although I think that every Member of the House would hope that the actual timescale would be shorter.
<P>

<a name="20704-20_para23"></a>We have therefore accepted&#151;I do not say this with any sense of self-congratulation&#151;that there ought to be a sunset clause provision of five years. But I ought to say that the updated implementation plan will give further detail on timescale as events develop. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on their Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1A in lieu thereof.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para4"></a>The Government have listened sympathetically to the view of this House that an annual report on tax credits would be a useful vehicle to ensure effective scrutiny of the operation of the new tax credit system. As noble Lords will recall, I explained on Report that most of the information required for the annual report is already published&#151;much of it in the Board of the Inland Revenue's annual report, which is laid before both Houses. But we want to ensure transparency in the operation of tax credits and to enable proper scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para5"></a>So, although we still believe that a requirement for an annual report is strictly unnecessary, we have listened sympathetically to your Lordships' view that it would be useful for the relevant information to be contained in a single document focussed specifically on tax credits. I am therefore pleased to speak to the government amendment moved in the other place in lieu of the Lords amendment. Please, my Lords, no jokes about scissors and paste or cutting and gluing.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para6"></a>The government amendment covers much the same ground as the amendment made by your Lordships. Much of the difference is due to a tidying up of the drafting&#151;a matter that I know is close to the heart of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. It may be helpful to the House if I explain the drafting changes. First, a report such as this is properly for the Board of the Inland Revenue to produce and present to the Treasury, rather than for my right honourable friend the Chancellor to produce himself. As the House is well aware, the Inland Revenue reports to Treasury Ministers, which is why subsection (2) of the new clause imposes on the Treasury the requirement to lay the report before both Houses.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para7"></a>Secondly, I believe that the intention behind paragraph (a) of the noble Lord's amendment was that the report should include the amount of tax credit paid out each year, as reported in the Inland Revenue's departmental accounts. That was not clear in the <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drafting of the Lords amendment, and subsection (1)(a) of the new clause in the government amendment sets that out in detail. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para8"></a>I turn to the other items. Subsection (1)(b) makes clear that the report will set out the number of awards of each tax credit made in a year. As the House will know, we normally publish statistical reports of the awards of working families' tax credit and disabled person's tax credit on a quarterly basis, but we understand the value of including information about awards in an annual report on tax credits. That will be a useful set of data to assess whether the credits are reaching the right families.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para9"></a>Subsections (1)(c), (d) and (e) cover information relating to compliance inquiries, penalties and prosecutions. Of course, there must be the greatest transparency in the reporting of the Inland Revenue's compliance activity. Much of that information is already provided in relation to WFTC and DPTC as part of the Inland Revenue's annual report. But again, we acknowledge the convenience of bringing together that information in a single report. Indeed, the government amendment goes further in that respect than the amendment passed by your Lordships' House. The Government's amendment will cover not only details of prosecutions&#151;as noble Lords intended&#151;but details of the number of compliance inquiries undertaken and the number of penalties imposed. That is an important and I hope helpful addition.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para10"></a>There was concern in another place that the number of prosecutions for tax credit fraud currently carried by the Inland Revenue was low and showed a lack of determination on its part to tackle fraud. That is not true. The Inland Revenue is serious in its efforts to tackle fraud both in respect of tax credits and in the tax system more generally. I hope that noble Lords will accept that that information will be useful to them.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para11"></a>Finally, the House will no doubt be aware that the new clause moved by the Government in another place does not include reference to the cost to employers of paying out working tax credit. As I made clear to noble Lords on Report, it is inappropriate to provide an estimate of employers' costs in an annual report. That matter is properly and comprehensively addressed by the regulatory impact assessment. The RIA is being revised in the light of announcements made in the Budget. The revised assessment will be made available to Members of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para12"></a>However, if your Lordships would find it helpful, I can give an undertaking that the information carried by the RIA will be included in the report&#151;in other words, bringing together all of the information in one place. Given that a new RIA is made not every year but only as, when and if the financial assessment changes, it would not make sense to promise to review it each year. But I am happy to include the RIA assessment, keep it in the annual report and then change it as and when appropriate, thus bringing even that information into the body of the one report.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para13"></a>I hope that your Lordships will agree that we have clarified the drafting. We have gone even further than your Lordships wanted in producing additional <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information about fraud and prosecution. We have addressed the substance of concern about employers&#151;that the information be available&#151;without accepting that it is the job of the Inland Revenue to continue to make regular, annual reports on that. That is a matter for employers. I hope that your Lordships will agree that the Government have taken account of the will of this House and are seeking to be helpful; that we have amended the Opposition amendment to embody it in the Bill; and that honour is served.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para14"></a>Moved, That the House do not insist on their Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1A in lieu thereof.&#151;(Baroness Hollis of Heigham.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I think that it is true to say that one's view of another place is rather different from this end of the building than when one is in the other place. Even after 33 years in the other place, having chaired the Procedure Committee on various occasions and so on, I read with some surprise the report of the Commons debates on 26th June, when the amendments were discussed. Curiously, when I read Hansard, the amendment in lieu does not appear anywhere. It is therefore extraordinarily difficult to follow what the subsequent debate is all about. The Minister failed to move the amendment in lieu at either the beginning or the end of her speech, but let us leave that on one side. It is in front of us now so I suppose that it is here by some process of osmosis.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para15"></a>On the point that the noble Baroness has explained about the Inland Revenue being responsible rather than the Chancellor, which we fully understand, the Minister in another place said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That is why subsection (3) of the new clause imposes"&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 26/6.02; col. 892.],
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-21_para16"></a>the Treasury requirement, and so on. In fact, as your Lordships will see from the amendment before us, there is no subsection (3). It gets worse, because later on in the debate there is further confusion about what is in the amendment and on the Order Paper. The Minister refers to subsection (f), which also does not exist. None the less, one struggled through it all, but it makes life a little more difficult when we come to consider the Commons amendments.
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para17"></a>There is another point that deserves some consideration. The amendment before us relates to the Bill as it first arrived in your Lordships' House. We do not have a re-print that shows the amendments made by your Lordships and agreed to by the Commons. That is of no consequence for this evening's debate, but, given the utter chaos that accompanied the government amendments that were accepted in this House and in another place, it would have been incredibly difficult to know what the amendment was, had it been of a more technical nature. Dozens of amendments were made here and accepted in another place, but this version of the Bill makes no reference to them. It would be terribly difficult to juggle all the papers.
<P>


<a name="column_420"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-21_para18"></a>I now turn to the points of substance. We raised the matter of employers' costs in earlier debates. This evening, the Minister&#151;who has, I think, been sympathetic throughout to the idea of an annual report&#151;gave a further undertaking on that issue. We understand the difficulty, but, despite what was said in another place, the costs will vary over time, and the regulatory impact assessment that we have now will be out of date by a later stage. If I understood the Minister correctly, she said that, if there were a significant change, she would take steps to ensure that we are aware of what is going on.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I shall clarify the matter. The regulatory impact assessment happens when legislation is changed, as part of that process. At that point the revised figures would be incorporated into the annual report.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020704/text/20704-22.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, that is very welcome. In the light of the Minister's helpful reply, we can leave that aspect to one side.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para0"></a>The second issue is take-up. Although it is not entirely clear, the Minister in another place seemed to be under the impression that the Government's amendment in lieu somehow covered the points that our amendment made about the take-up of working tax credit and the estimate of the take-up of child tax credit. My understanding is that that is not the case, although I am open to correction. With the Government's amendment in lieu, we will not get an estimate of take-up; we will get the number of awards of working tax credit and so on. That is something different.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para1"></a>Take-up is an important issue. We must know to what extent the tax credits are taken up. We need a comparison of the number of people who might be entitled to them and the number of people who actually receive them. The Minister in another place seemed to think that that was covered in the amendment in lieu, but that is not my understanding. Perhaps the Minister can correct me on that.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para2"></a>The third matter with which we are concerned is fraud and prosecution. Again, the amendment in lieu goes somewhat further than we had anticipated, as the Minister said. We asked for data on the number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions, whereas the Government's amendment in lieu goes somewhat further. It was explained in another place that that was because the Inland Revenue penalties were different from&#151;and, I suppose, more extensive than&#151;the penalties normally available to the Department for Work and Pensions. In that respect, we can say that the amendment is further progress.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para3"></a>I am not saying that everything that we would have liked is there. The point about take-up is important. However, the principle of an annual report has been accepted, and that is to be welcomed. Although the amendment is not a whole loaf, it is a significant improvement, made as a result of the debates in this House and the Government's undertaking to consider <P>


<a name="column_421"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and react to the points raised. It would not be right to reject the amendment and go any further, not least because of the technical point, which the Minister made, that it is for the Inland Revenue and the Treasury, not the Chancellor, to make the report. We welcome the Government's flexible attitude, even though they have not met all the points we made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-22_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the proceedings on the amendment do credit to a bicameral parliamentary system. Occasionally, people, fearing that Parliament may become more truly bicameral, express fears of deadlock. They do not realise how lucky they are. They should consider the constitution of the 17th century Dutch republic. It was a union of seven autonomous provinces, each sending delegates to a federal states general. Those delegates were mandated, so, whenever the seven provinces' delegates disagreed, they all had to go back for further instructions. Executive power rested with the stadtholder, who had little, if any, formal legal authority. Anything of importance needed the assent of the chief burgomaster of Amsterdam, who would be largely responsible for funding it. One would have thought that nothing could have worked under such a system: in fact, it was the best governed country in 17th century Europe.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para4"></a>The amendment illustrates that, when people want to reach a compromise, they can do it extremely well. Before listening to the Minister, I was going to say that two thirds of a loaf was better than no bread. However, having listened to what the Minister said about the regulatory impact assessment, the costs to business and the possibility of including that information in the annual report, I think that we have just about the whole loaf. The amendment is rather better drafted than it was in the form in which we originally left it. The Minister and those responsible in another place deserve our thanks for what they have done.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, made a point about take-up. It is worth attention. I assume that it will be possible to discover how many people were eligible for the tax credit and did not apply for it and that, were that information to be available, it would be included in a report. The Government are as interested in that information as we are.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para6"></a>The reference to Clause 18 clarifies a good deal. The distinction between prosecutions and convictions is valuable. Generally, the amendment has had a wash and brush-up, which has done it nothing but good. I thank the Minister warmly for her part in the story, and I welcome the amendment before us now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the warm response from noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, raised one major concern. Although he welcomed the clarification of what we were going to cover, including the incorporation of information that was in the regulatory impact assessment, he again raised the question of take-up.
<P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para7"></a>There is an ambiguity in the original amendment, which, I think, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, picked up. The amendment refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an estimate of the take-up".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-22_para8"></a>Take-up is something that has happened. If the credit has been taken up, we need not give an estimate; we can give actual numbers. Had the amendment referred to "an estimate of entitlement", it would have picked up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said that the other place did not seem to understand what we were getting at. I do not want to sound picky, but it may be that the amendment, as originally drafted, laid itself open to two readings. The other place took the view that take-up was something that had been taken up, as opposed to an estimate of entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para9"></a>There is, in any case, an issue about entitlement. We have a good idea what the entitlement ought to be for families with children because we can extrapolate from the figures for those currently in the system. However, there is a new group&#151;we think about 300,000&#151;of adults over 25 who are without children whose incomes are sufficiently modest. We do not know whether it is 300,000, or 200,000, or 400,000 or whether circumstances will change. It is very flaky. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, is right. We want the system to succeed, and we will track things as far as we can. There will be the sort of outreach work and information provision to encourage take-up that there was for the pension credit&#151;the minimum income guarantee. We have no reason not to wish for people to take this up. Therefore the noble Lord need not worry that we shall not actively pursue it.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para10"></a>With that information, I am glad that noble Lords have been able to welcome the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20704-22_para13"></a>The objective is to ensure that member states' economic policies are consistent with the goals of the treaty: non-inflationary economic growth; respect for the environment; a high level of employment and social protection; and raising the standard of living and quality of life for citizens across the UK and the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>entire European Union. Those goals are consistent with the Government's own approach to economic policy.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para14"></a>Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, usually known as the Maastricht Act, requires Parliament to approve the government information sent to the Commission for this purpose. The Government's strategy for economic policy is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report and the Financial Statement and Budget Report, brought together in "Budget 2002". This material will form the basis of the information that we send to the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para15"></a>Sharing the information in the Budget document with our European partners allows us to influence the development of the European Union, bringing enhanced employment and growth to Britain and other member states.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para16"></a>Five years ago this Government's first Budget set out long-term objectives and far-reaching reforms to achieve economic stability and higher levels of employment. In the last year, Britain has experienced the lowest inflation and lowest interest rates since the 1960s; for the first time for half a century, unemployment in Britain is lower than in America, Japan and Europe.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para17"></a>In this Budget, the first of the new Parliament, our task is to address, through modernisation and reform, three long-term challenges: the challenge of enterprise, with new incentives to raise investment and reward entrepreneurship; the challenge of family prosperity for all, with extra support for hard-working families, in the Tax Credits Bill which in the past five minutes has completed its passage through Parliament; and the challenge of renewing our public services, with a secure long-term financial foundation for a reformed National Health Service. The Budget sets out the Government's strategy to raise Britain's national economic potential and achieve high and stable levels of growth and employment, with rising living standards for all.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para18"></a>Last autumn, in the wake of September 11th, the world saw a fall in business confidence, declining markets and volatile oil prices, which posed major and simultaneous challenges to the stability and continued growth of the British economy. In the past, when the world suffered a downturn, it was Britain that usually entered weaker and suffered longer. Successive governments were unable to sustain economic growth, constrained by high inflation and high borrowing.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para19"></a>This time, from a platform of low inflation and fiscal discipline, both delivered through the new monetary and fiscal framework, we have been able to steer a steady course. The Bank of England has been able to adjust policy at the right time and in the right way, last year cutting interest rates seven times. Monetary policy has been supported by fiscal policy and we have, despite the difficulties, safeguarded both stability and growth.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para20"></a>The underlying state of our public finances remains strong. From 1997 we tightened fiscal policy by 4.5 per cent of national income. As a result we have been able <P>


<a name="column_424"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to reduce net debt well below 40 per cent, not just in one year but across the economic cycle. With debt and debt interest payments down it has been possible, even with lower than expected revenues, to maintain our three-year spending plans for hospitals, schools, transport and public services, and to respond to the challenges since September 11th at home and abroad, all the while still meeting our fiscal rules.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para21"></a>The envelope for public spending for the years to 2006 has been set. Current public spending will increase from £390 billion this year to £420 billion next year, to £444 billion in 2004&#150;05 and £471 billion by 2005&#150;06. Historically low levels of net public investment, which languished at 0.6 per cent of GDP in 1997, will be raised to 2 per cent of GDP by 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para22"></a>The Wanless report states that the NHS needs a long-term sustainable financial framework in support of reform and modernisation. It sets out the financial needs for the next two decades, starting with a five-year period of high and sustained growth. UK health spending will rise from 6.7 per cent of national income in 1997 and 7.7 per cent of national income this year, to 8.7 per cent by 2005-06 and to 9.4 per cent by 2007&#150;08.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para23"></a>One of the main long-term challenges facing the Government is to build a more prosperous Britain. That means higher productivity, higher investment and a strong national consensus on the importance of enterprise. As we press ahead with supply-side reforms to remove barriers to growth, the focus of the Budget is on two further sets of measures: encouraging higher levels of innovation and investment; and helping small and growing businesses. A productive Britain is also an inclusive Britain. Moving people from welfare to work and making work pay is at the centre of our strategy. Compared to 1997, there are now 1.5 million more people in work, giving Britain the best unemployment figures for 25 years. In the mid-1980s, 350,000 young people aged between 18 and 24 had been unemployed for more than a year. Today the figure is just 4,900.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para24"></a>As we pursue our goals, all families will receive more support for bringing up their children. In the Budget we announced £2.5 billion of extra support for families, a family tax cut that will help nearly 6 million families. As a result, the direct tax burden on a family on average earnings with two children will be below 20 per cent. That is lower than it was in 1997 or any previous year since 1979.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para25"></a>Public policy is all about choices. We have made ours. We have chosen in favour of a stable economy, low inflation and low interest rates. We have chosen in favour of an enterprise society: low levels of taxation, support for small business and reductions in red tape. We have chosen in favour of a fair society: extra help for children, for families and for pensioners, policies that make work pay. And we have chosen in favour of a healthier society with extra investment in a reformed NHS, funded through general taxation.
<P>

<a name="20704-22_para26"></a>That is the programme set out in the Budget and that, if the House approves, is the programme we will report to the European Commission. We are fulfilling our commitment under the Maastricht Act to report <P>

<A NAME="20704-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Lord for moving this Motion to resolve in the masterly way that we have come to expect of him on these occasions. The noble Lord is very practised in such debates and probably he can anticipate what each of us is going to say. Our viewpoints on the state of the British economy and its prospects are well known and range from the Chancellor's one of being "cautiously optimistic", a phrase he used again in his Mansion House speech on 26th June, to my own rather more pessimistic but still hopeful stance, which is shared by many on both sides of the Atlantic.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para0"></a>That comment reminds me that today is 4th July. Were it not for this debate, some of us might be helping the American Ambassador to celebrate the independence of his great country and the liberty that accompanied it. But, whatever else the Americans will be celebrating today, they will not be celebrating the state of the New York stock market, which is a fair but gloomy indicator of investors' assessment of the mighty economy of the United States and its prospects. The current depressed mood of the market appears to be very reluctant to change for the better in spite of low interest rates, and of course we see that mood reflected in the ebb tide of share prices in our own stock market and in other markets across the world. The FTSE 100 was at its lowest yesterday since April 1997. This has knocked on the head the Prime Minister's claim of 19th June that the market is,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-23_para1"></a>Of course markets are volatile and sentiment variable, but they do tell us something about the economies of the world in which we live.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para2"></a>I do not need to belabour the inter-dependence of the United States economy and our own, and, indeed, that of the euro zone. The euro zone, too, seems to catch cold when the American economy sneezes. That is not surprising bearing in mind the importance of the American export market to the euro zone as well as to the UK.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para3"></a>The economic clouds over us all have darkened even since April when the Budget Report was published. Economic growth is proving very elusive. We all hope that growth will pick up as the year progresses, but it is clearly possible that the slow-down will continue and that the Government's target of 2 to 2.5 per cent growth for this year may not be achieved.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para4"></a>The questions that arise in that event are obvious, but they must still be asked. If government revenue falls below the Chancellor's expectations and cautious optimism is dashed, how will the situation be remedied? Will the spending plans to which the Minister referred be curtailed, or borrowing and/or taxation increased? I suspect the latter alternatives will be favoured. The increase in national insurance contributions is still to come. I hope that the Government do not forget that a rising tax burden will retard economic growth still further.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para5"></a>The Budget Report is disarming in its assurance that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with sound public finances and low inflation, policy is well placed to respond to continuing risks".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-23_para6"></a>Exactly how well placed is policy, one wonders, to deal with the worst case scenario.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para7"></a>If the current economic doldrums persist, they must affect the Government's thinking about joining the euro. The unemployment rates in the euro zone are not enticing. Neither are the spats between Italy, France and Germany and the European Commission over their lack of respect for the budget deficit constraints of the stability pact. Incidentally, can the Minister say whether the Government have to make a separate submission to the Commission under the pact?
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para8"></a>While the major countries appear able to resist the Commission's strictures, smaller countries such as Portugal are not so fortunate. My understanding is that Portugal faces austerity measures imposed by Brussels under threat of punitive sanctions, so becoming the first country to lose control over tax and spending policy as a result of joining the euro. That must give the Government pause.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para9"></a>It was reported in February this year that the United Kingdom, too, has come under fire from the Commission for its spending plans. That was before the budget report and even though we have not yet joined the euro.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para10"></a>I accept that this is an extremely difficult time to make an economic assessment which carries the hallmark of certainty. It is a time of global instability, disappointing corporate earnings, accounting scandals and uncertainties and continuing terrorist threats. Nevertheless, so far as the Official Opposition are concerned, we are content to take note of the Government's Motion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, in following the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, I hope that the House will not know exactly what I am going to say. We shall see.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para11"></a>The financial statement in April in the Budget Report was bold. It expected the economy to grow by 2 to 2.5 per cent a year. This now looks a fairly heroic assumption after two consecutive quarters when GDP grew by only 0.1 per cent. Certainly very few independent forecasters, in the City or elsewhere, now look through the same rose-tinted spectacles as the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this central forecast, the one on which his public spending plans will stand or fall.
<P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para12"></a>No economy is an island. I agree with both the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, that we could be vulnerable to another slow-down in the United States. But the international economic outlook is far from being all black. Confidence and activity across much of the euro zone have turned up noticeably since budget time. We must face the hard fact that many of our economic problems are home made and getting worse.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para13"></a>What an impossible decision the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England had to face today in trying to set a one-size-fits-all interest rate for our two-speed economy. The Bank's latest estimates of consumer lending show that it is now back to its late 1980s peak as a proportion of gross disposable income. I received two letters pushing unsolicited new credit cards on me this morning, and we must have had 20 aggressive letters pushing credit through our letterbox over the past month. Is the Minister surprised that we have a debt-financed consumer boom, with both the main house price indices showing this week that over the whole of the UK&#151;not only the South East&#151;house prices have risen by 19 per cent over the past 12 months and are showing a dangerous acceleration, with prices up 11 per cent in the first half of this year and 2.3 per cent in the single month of June?
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para14"></a>Meanwhile, we have a massive balance of payments deficit, with most of manufacturing in deep recession and manufacturing employment down from almost 4.2 million when the Government took office to 3.7 million today. The Minister is right that unemployment in total remains low, but that is only because of rising employment in two sectors&#151;building and the public sector&#151;which has been masking job losses everywhere else over the past year.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para15"></a>So imprudent economic policy is producing a lop-sided economy. With so much of industry and the service sector sluggish or in decline, how can the few remaining pockets of growth make the Chancellor's growth and spending forecasts add up? Someone or something substantial will have to ride to the rescue soon. Can the Minister see help on the horizon?
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para16"></a>This inevitably has been rather a mouse of a debate. The Budget and the economic and fiscal strategy reports are old news by now. But next year will be different. The Economic Affairs Select Committee of the House will be able for the first time to examine the Finance Bill in detail. We look forward to constructive discussion and informed debate with, dare we hope, the Treasury taking some notice of the improvements and amendments that our committee will propose. We will not roar; we will not have teeth; but we will speak with authority and relevant practical experience, and we will be heard.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to both speakers for their responses. There are different views about the United Kingdom economy, although I have shown that the views of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, are in the outer range of most <P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forecasts and informed opinion. Apart from the general observations made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, three particular points deserve attention.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para17"></a>As to the stock market, of course we must remain vigilant but the facts underlying the UK economy are the same. It has low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and low tax burdens for business. Whatever the view of the markets in this country&#151;the situation is more serious in other western countries&#151;we have the right conditions in place to ensure that the impact of turbulence on equity markets is limited.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para18"></a>The noble Lord asked whether we have to submit evidence for the stability and growth pact. Member states in the single currency must submit stability programmes while non-participating members submit convergence programmes for annual examination by ECOFIN. They outline the country's medium-term fiscal strategy. The UK submitted its last convergence programme based on the contents of the pre-Budget report in December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked also about the convergence programme early warning system. In the last round of stability and convergence programmes, the Commission recommended that Germany and Portugal should receive early warning letters and formal recommendations advising the member state concerned to take prompt measures to prevent divergence of its budgetary position from one close to balance or in surplus, which is the requirement. The council decided at its last meeting that such early warnings would be inappropriate. The German and Portuguese Governments instead issued statements expressing their commitment to fiscal discipline over the coming years. No early warning letters have been issued.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para20"></a>I find it more difficult to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, because although he casts general gloom he does so in general terms and is somewhat at the edge of informed opinion. The growth assumptions underlying the budget forecasts were cautious and realistic. Government forecasting recently has an excellent record&#151;rather better than the average of independent forecasters, against which we constantly compare it.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para21"></a>Our statistics are that following the latest revisions, the level of GDP in the first quarter of this year is higher than anticipated. We made upward revisions to growth in 1999-2000 and the last two quarters, which more than offset the downward revisions of growth in 2001. We made upward revisions to GDP growth in 2000 and the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year show more momentum in the economy than was previously estimated.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred to the problems of manufacturing industry. We recognise the difficulties being experienced because of the slowdown in the world economy. The noble Lord did not make a point on this occasion about interest rates and the weak euro&#151;so often a theme of debates in your Lordships' House. The most important thing for manufacturers and other businesses is that the Budget maintains economic stability and takes action to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>encourage enterprise. Manufacturers will benefit from the research and development tax credit; the new zero corporation tax rate; the cut to 19 per cent in corporation tax for small firms; and the measures to boost training and skills.
<P>

<a name="20704-23_para23"></a>I can only disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. Independent forecasts have been too pessimistic. Our forecasting record is good. We are conscious that the outturn for the past year of <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>2.25 per cent was in line with our pre-Budget reports and Budget statements on every occasion since 1999. That is a good record and we are confident that the forecasts contained in the Budget reports that are to be submitted to the European Commission in conformity with Section 5 of the European Communities Act 1972 are valid and realistic.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) a child is subject to a placement order,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-24_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 67A and speak to Amendments Nos. 67B, 67C and 67D, and in fact the clause stand-part debate following will also be relevant. These amendments follow closely, and indeed could have been grouped with, Amendments Nos. 51A, 52A, 54, 54A, 54B, 54C and 53A, which we spoke to when the Grand Committee previously met. They are, like those amendments, based on the premise that there should be a placement order in every case, even where consent to placement is forthcoming.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para4"></a>The aim of the amendments, and indeed of the clause-stand part debates on Clauses 30, 31 and 33, is to ensure that once a placement order is made following judicial scrutiny, the placement should not be disrupted without the leave of the court, or the consent of the agency.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para5"></a>The advantage of this for the adopters is that they will know if a child is placed with them under a placement order, even if it was made by consent, but the placement cannot be disrupted by a parent who has changed his or her mind without the court being satisfied that there is sufficient change in circumstances to merit sanctioning a change. Conversely, a parent consenting to placement should do so only having taken into account that he or she cannot change his or her mind later without good cause.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para6"></a>As the proponents of the earlier amendments explained, the whole purpose of this is designed to reach some kind of certainty early in the day, but to avoid finality where parents give their consent to a placement without a court order. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support the concept of this amendment in the hope that it could perhaps commend itself to Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I have concerns because the provision follows on the making of a <P>


<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>placement order in each circumstance. I am not convinced that is necessarily in the best interests of all adoptive families, and indeed of ordinary families, and certainly in all children.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para7"></a>I believe the placement order should be in place to ensure that when a parent might change his or her mind, where there are difficult circumstances, the child is secure. There are circumstances in which families simply want to place their child for adoption, and social workers will say that one of the things that delays the progress of adoption is the time waiting for court hearings. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said that we should make time available if we pass this legislation. However, I was simply referring to waiting times at the moment for urgent issues, including criminal cases where children are witnesses and where they are supposed to be a priority. There is still a great difficulty about court time. I should prefer to see a situation where we have placement orders in circumstances that have been assessed as needing placement orders, and not have placement orders in other circumstances. Then, if you like, we would not need this convoluted process with which I was struggling&#151;though I believe I have got my mind around it now&#151;during the last debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has said, these amendments take us back to earlier amendments when we explored the differences in concept and application between placement with consent and the application for a placement order. The overall intention of the Bill, as I described it on Tuesday of this week, is to try to redistribute the power available to prospective adopters and birth parents, so that there is a more equal opportunity for birth parents to be fully informed and involved at an earlier stage so that irrevocable decisions are not taken. The noble Baroness described it as the "High Noon" situation at the point when the application for adoption is made.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para8"></a>I shall address the amendments in some detail because they are rather complex, although I appreciate the brevity with which the noble Lord introduced them. As part of these changes, the Bill must inevitably reflect those changed parameters when it comes to removing children from placement with consent. It has to ensure that the rights that are available to families involved are also matched by the security afforded at different stages of the process.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para9"></a>At the moment, through a combination of Clauses 18 and 51, the Bill ensures that in consent cases the parents can change their mind about placing the child for adoption at any stage up to the point at which an application for the final adoption order is made. It is worth emphasising this point. Although the birth families will have support to understand and explore the implications of what they are doing, we have gone to some pains to ensure that they can change their mind at any point.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para10"></a>Under Clause 41, there must be a minimum of 10 weeks between the child being placed with prospective adopters before they are able to make an application for adoption. So the Bill provides for parents to change <P>


<a name="column_GC183"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their mind in consent cases and to have their children returned. That being so, we have attempted to provide within the range of options both care and flexibility in Clause 29.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para11"></a>Perhaps I may briefly outline what the clause is intended to do. Clauses 29 to 34 place restrictions on removing children subject to the placement provisions. Clause 29 sets out the general rules and Clauses 30 to 34 expand on those to cover placements both with consent under Clause 18 and under placement orders.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para12"></a>Clause 29 provides, first, that where a child has been placed for adoption with consent, or where the child is under six weeks of age&#151;we have dispensed with the parent having to give consent for that period&#151;it is an offence for anyone other than the adoption agency, whether that is a local authority or a voluntary agency, to remove the child from the prospective adopters. It also provides for the alternative situation; namely, Where the child is still waiting to be placed with prospective adopters and is being accommodated by the adoption agency, whether it be in a children's home or with foster parents. But, again, only the agency can remove the child. The same rule&#151;that only the agency can remove the child from the placement&#151;also applies where the parents withdraw their consent to placement under Clause 18. Clauses 30 to 32 set out what happens in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para13"></a>Where the parents have consented, it is only the adoption agency that can act to remove the child. Where the parents have withdrawn their consent, it is still the adoption agency that would remove the child and oversee the return to the parents. In addition, the adoption agency is able to remove the child from the placement at any point, regardless of whether the parents have requested the return of the child. For example, we are thinking of situations where the agency was concerned that the wrong judgment had been made and the placement was failing. In that situation the agency would be able to step in and remove the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para14"></a>The removal provisions work broadly as follows. Where a child is placed for adoption by consent and that consent is withdrawn, the child must be returned to the parent within 14 days. If consent is withdrawn before the child has been placed, the child must be returned to the family within the week. I should point out that we made that concession: we reduced the period from 14 to seven days after representations from the agencies involved in adoption.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para15"></a>The clause gives parents substantial rights to have the child returned if they change their minds. We obviously have to provide for those situations where the local authority does not think that that is the right thing to do, even where the parents have withdrawn their consent. Where that is the case, and provided that the authority considers that the significant-harm threshold is met, under Clause 21, the authority is under a duty to apply for a placement order.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para16"></a>Under Clause 29(2), once the authority has applied for the placement order, the child may be removed only with the leave of the court. Again, for consistency, <P>


<a name="column_GC184"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>depending on whether the child is placed or waiting for a placement, the local authority must make that application within the seven-day or the 14-day period. Once the application is made, until the issue is resolved, the child may be removed only with the court's leave. This is to minimise the disruption for the child, otherwise, the child might be returned to the parents and removed again if a placement order is made. I take to heart what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said not only about the court time involved, but the processes and how they may affect the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para17"></a>I now turn to the placement order. The restrictions on removal, once a placement order has been made, are dealt with in Clause 33. Again, only the local authority may remove the child, and it can do so at any point. However, unlike a placement with consent under Clause 18, where a child is under a placement order, there is no provision for the parents to have their child returned to them as of right at their request. Their only option would be to apply to the court to have the placement order discharged. They would hope that in doing so, the court would provide that the child should be returned to them. Under the noble Lord's amendments, that would be the position in every case, because related to the discussion we had on Tuesday, there would be a placement order in every case.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para18"></a>I have described how the removal provisions work. The main point is that only the adoption agency may physically remove the child, but there is a caveat in the Bill. Subsections (6) and (7) of Clause 29 have made it clear that none of the provisions in Clauses 29 to 32 prevent the removal of a child who, for example, is arrested or removed as a result of a local authority or any other persons exercising a power conferred by any enactment. It is important to ensure that the removal provisions do not cut across local authority child protection powers under the Children Act. While these clauses reflect the right of parents to request the return of their child from placement with consent, at every stage up to the application of the final adoption order, they place the power of making the physical removal with the adoption agency.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para19"></a>We have done this because placement for adoption is a serious undertaking. It is of a different nature from a temporary foster placement or temporary respite in care homes. Given the different nature of placement for adoption, it is right to provide that where the parents ask for the return of the child, the parents simply cannot walk in and remove the child at will. Removal in whatever circumstances, whether from an actual adoptive placement or a pre-adoptive placement, has to be handled sensitively and consistently. We believe that the adoption agencies are right organisations to do that.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para20"></a>In the light of that, the Government believe that the process of preparing them to be returned to their parents, and the actual process of return, should be handled by the adoption agency. As a consequence, where consent has been given to place a child for adoption where the local authority has applied for a placement order, the clauses have the effect of <P>


<a name="column_GC185"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restricting parents under the Children Act to remove children who were voluntarily accommodated under Clause 20 of the Act.

<a name="20704-24_para21"></a>Where such children are in voluntary accommodation and their parents have consented to place them for adoption, if consent is withdrawn, they no longer as now have the right to remove those children themselves. In those cases, too, it has to be the adoption agency which removes the child within the defined period. I want to stress that the removal of those rights applies only where the child has been placed for adoption or where applications for placement orders have been made. The wider rights of parents to recover children accommodated under the Children Act, not in connection with adoption, are not affected.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para22"></a>Finally, subsection (9) of Clause 29 imposes a penalty of three months' imprisonment and a fine of up to £5,000, or both, for breach of the removal provision.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para23"></a>I turn now to the details of the amendments. I  understand that the motivation behind the amendments is to simplify the provisions. One consequence of removing the option for placement with parental consent under Clause 18, in favour of placement orders in relation to every child in every family, is that the placement order removal restrictions would obviously apply to all adoptive parents. That is reflected in the amendment. The overall effect of the amendment is that once the placement order is made, the child should be removed from the placement only by the decision of the local authority, and physically removed by the local authority. The parents would have no right to request removal of the child or to have the child returned to them within a set period, as they currently do in placement with consent under Clause 18.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para24"></a>We believe that where a placement order is necessary, that is broadly right. However, as the Committee will by now appreciate, we believe that there should be this alternative route for parents. The difficulty is that the amendments would not allow that. They would not allow parents the opportunity to change their minds before the point of application for the final adoption order. Even if the placement order were made with the consent of parents, once the placement order was made, that would be it&#151;parents could not change their minds; they could not ask for their child's return. The only option would be to apply to the court under Clause 23 to discharge the placement order.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para25"></a>That is a major change from the current position whereby children voluntarily accommodated under Section 20 of the Children Act are placed for adoption. At the moment, parents can exercise their right to have the children back. Yet, those placements generally proceed very successfully on this voluntary basis. Under the proposed amendment, all such cases would be under placement orders and parents would lose their ability to secure the return of the child without going to court. The Government believe that it is worth keeping open the voluntary option.

<P>

<a name="20704-24_para26"></a>To reiterate, under our proposed provisions, when parents have given consent to placement and decide to withdraw, they can have their child returned without needing to go to court within the seven or 14-day period, depending on the situation of the child. The only exception is where the local authority has applied for a placement order. Although we do not think that that is complex, as we shall see when we come to look at the amendments in detail, a degree of complexity has certainly crept in.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para27"></a>Taking Amendments Nos. 67A, 67B and 67E together, part of the problem we seem to have uncovered is that Amendment No. 67E risks undermining the intentions of Amendments Nos. 67A and 67B. It is a rather complex matter. Amendments Nos. 67A and 67B amend subsection (1) of Clause 29, to remove references to Clause 18 and to provide that the restrictions on removal in Clause 29 apply to all placements. Although it is not entirely clear, I presume that that means placements whether the child is placed or awaiting a placement. I am not sure that the word "placement" itself actually delivers that.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para28"></a>I anticipate that this amendment needs to be read in the context of the proposal that Clause 33 should not stand part of the Bill. I am, as I said, therefore assuming that it is intended to apply in all cases. The intended effect is that only the adoption agency may remove a child from placement. As I said, that would leave an application to the court to discharge the placement order as the only recourse for parents in consent cases who have changed their mind.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para29"></a>However&#151;if I am right and the amendments are intended to reflect the position whereby the parents of a child under a placement order who want the child back may not remove him without going to court to discharge the order&#151;Amendment No. 67E seems to cut across this objective. The reason for that is that Amendment No. 67E amends subsection (6). As I said, the purpose of subsection (6) as drafted is to ensure that the removal provisions do not block removal by local authorities in relation to arrest or child protection powers.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para30"></a>However, the effect of Amendment No. 67E would be to restore parents' rights under the Children Act, so that they themselves could at any point remove a child voluntarily accommodated under Section 20 of that Act. Therefore, the adoption agency would not be the only one that could remove the child. The effect of the amendment would be that, where the child has been voluntarily accommodated before being placed, the child's parents could at any time turn up and remove the child from the placement. I think that that would undermine the intention behind Amendments Nos. 67A and 67B. We do not think that the amendment is desirable, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, may agree with us.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para31"></a>In addition, where a child has been voluntarily accommodated but the local authority then decides that the child should be adopted and applies for a placement order, as currently drafted, subsection (2) of Clause 29 would prevent the parent or anyone else from removing the child without the leave of the court. <P>


<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>One effect of Amendment No. 67E would be that, in such situations, the parents would be able to remove the child at any point. We do not think that that would be appropriate. When an application for a placement order has been made, the issue should be determined by the court. Pending resolution of the application, the court should have a say over whether the child is moved. Of course, the parents would be able to exercise their Section 20 removal rights unfettered at any time before the point at which an application for a placement order was made.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para32"></a>The matter is not straightforward, unlike those dealt with in the remaining amendments. Amendment No. 67C would delete subsection (3) which covers restrictions on removing children where an agency was authorised to place the child under Clause 18, but the child had not yet been placed with prospective adopters. The subsection would clearly not be necessary if there were no Clause 18 placements.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para33"></a>Amendment No. 67D reflects the forthcoming debate on stand part by deleting references to Clauses 31 and 32 from subsection (4), which provides that the general removal restrictions in Clause 29 are qualified by the specific provisions in the following clauses.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para34"></a>These amendments essentially flow from our earlier debates. If that point is accepted, then the thrust of the changes proposed by the amendments would be sensible. As I said, however, it could be argued that the restrictions on removing a child may be somewhat "rigid" for what is supposed to be a consensual, voluntary placement&#151;which is our objective in Clauses 17 to 24&#151;arrived at, we were assured earlier, after the briefest of court hearings. That indeed was part of the case that was made. However, there seems to be little scope for parents to change their minds under these proposals. We argue that Clause 18 is valuable and that the route it offers should be retained. Consequently, in all logic, the provisions in Clause 29 and later clauses need to be retained.
<P>

<a name="20704-24_para35"></a>I have made it clear why we oppose in principle the thrust of the amendments. I have also set out why, regardless of our difficulties in principle, we have some concerns about their detailed operation. I am also conscious that we have necessarily dealt with this matter in a rather technical way. I should therefore be happy to provide to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and to any other noble Lords, a detailed explanation in writing or in a briefing which we could organise. If that would be helpful I should be very happy to do it. I hope that the essence of the argument and the Government's position, as expressed in the clauses themselves, is clear.

<a name="20704-25_para0"></a>In many ways the length to which the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, had to go in explaining how this part of the Bill would operate demonstrates its convoluted nature, and the reason why so many stakeholders believe that this is not the best way of proceeding. That is why, although it may appear to be slightly harsh in some cases, the placement order which goes to court&#151;which then does not have Clauses 30, 31 and 33 involved, but simply requires one to apply to court, or the agency comes back and removes in those circumstances&#151;is preferable as a much clearer way forward.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth&#151;whose speech I found very interesting&#151;described this part of the Bill as convoluted. Having done a fair amount of reading between our previous Sitting and today, she has clearly come to grips with it. It is very difficult. We on these benches would much prefer to see something clearer which gave that certainty. The agency would have powers of removal if it applied to the court and the order was made. However, the point at which discussions truly occurred would be in court when the placement order is dealt with.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para2"></a>There may well be issues about resources and about whether access to court is available and so on. However, when this House legislates, we assume that the resources will be made available to implement that legislation. We do that in relation to our NHS reform Bills every day of the week. If Bills are passed but resources are not available, we want to know why. The same would be true if we passed legislation simplifying the process so that placement orders had in each case to be dealt with in the court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I think that much of the complexity attaches to the amendment rather than to the clauses themselves. We are dealing with three steps here. Under the clauses on placement by consent, one can ask for the child back. If one does, the agency must return the child within seven or 14 days depending on whether the child is placed or waiting to be placed. The only exception is if the local authority has to seek an adoption placement order. That is the essence of the clauses. However, I am grateful to him for describing what I thought was a complicated matter as he did. Nevertheless, I believe that it is simpler than he thinks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Clearly we have a philosophical difference as to whether it is the Government's scheme or the scheme proposed in our amendments that is complicated. I should think it self-evident that we would make progress on simplification if we removed three clauses from the Bill. As the Minister is shaking his head, we clearly have a different philosophy of regulation, too.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para3"></a>I do not think that we are going to get much further on the matter; this is the second stage of debate on it. I shall read very carefully what the Minister had to say. Nevertheless, there is still quite broad disagreement on this part of the Bill. I shall take on board what she said about Amendment No. 67E, and about its interaction with the 1989 Act.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para18"></a>The amendment deals with a very important and much overlooked subject; namely, that of private fostering. My interest in, and my entire knowledge of, this subject were sparked when I started to read the Bill; I was previously unaware that private fostering arrangements are permissible. I suppose that that was because I had missed one very small but significant fact; that Victoria Climbieÿ was a privately fostered child. In the months since her death, there has been a great deal written and discussed, principally in the social work journals, about private fostering.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para19"></a>Many people are genuinely unaware that certainly since 1989 there has been a legal duty upon anybody who privately fosters a child to notify his or her local authority. In fact and in practice, very few people do so.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para20"></a>It may help Members of the Committee if I explain to them, as it was explained to me, what the term "private fostering" really means. It means a wholly private arrangement between birth parents and any private individual to look after a child for a length of time. Such arrangements are fairly common. It is impossible to be more precise because nobody knows how many private fostering arrangements there are.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para21"></a>This issue has been the subject of study over many years. In 1973, Mr Bob Holman produced a report entitled Trading in Children. In it he talked about the fact that there were any number of children in these long-term but wholly unregulated relationships. He concluded, at that time, that they were perhaps some of the most vulnerable children in our society. Interestingly, in 1973 he called for a system of registration. His findings were ignored then; and hence earlier on last year, in the wake of the Victoria Climbieÿ case, he was back on television saying exactly the same things that he had said in 1973.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para22"></a>In 1997, BAAF&#151;the British Association for Adoption and Fostering&#151;did some work with the African Family Advisory Service and, as a result, it produced its report entitled A Very Private Practice. It is perhaps the most comprehensive study of this subject in this country, and it makes for some rather horrifying reading. Its main finding was that, although local authorities have a duty to look after any child who they may have reason to believe is in a private fostering arrangement, in practice very few can do it. It is impossible to find many local authorities which know how many children are in such arrangements. If these children are not known about, they are quite often extremely vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para23"></a>What A Very Private Practice did discover and talked about were the different types of arrangements which exist. It is not uncommon in this country for children who have been here all their lives to hit adolescence, with all the horrors that that brings for them and their families, and to go off and live with another member of the family for a period of time. That is not really what we are talking about here. We are talking about a large number of children, many from particular minority communities, whose birth families remain in their country of origin but who are sent to this country by their parents in the belief that in this country they will have a better life.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para24"></a>There is also another subset of children; the children of people in this country who are often students&#151;medical students and so on&#151;who come from a culture where it is normal and accepted practice to send children to extend members of the family to be looked after for quite long periods of time. Therefore, there are not only the matters of children's vulnerability, about which we have spoken so far, but there are also, for some of them, acute issues about culture and distance from their parents.
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para25"></a>It is the case that notification is supposed to be given to local authorities. It is also the case that that rarely happens. That is not because people are defying the law; in most cases, it is because they simply do not know that they have to. Most people just do not know; they have come to a working arrangement that may exist within their family, so why should they tell anybody about it?
<P>

<a name="20704-25_para26"></a>There are also, however, arrangements which are commercial transactions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   Noble Lords may well remember the period when The Times newspaper was not published for a year. On the first day after the end of the dispute when the paper reappeared, Bernard Levin started his column with the words, "As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted".
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para1"></a>Before the Division was called I was setting out some of the background to some of the studies that have been done on the subject of private fostering. It is important to look at the Government's response. In 1998 the Department of Health, responding to publications by BAAF, said that at that time the Government did not consider that a new system of regulation was necessary as there was already a wide range of regulations associated with the offences which might occur in relation to private fostering and adoption.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para2"></a>In 1999 the Department of Health said that the Government would take steps to enforce current regulations on private fostering more effectively and that legislation would also be introduced to target private fostering regulations and placements lasting more than 42 days. That legislation has not been forthcoming. However, two things did happen. One was that a leaflet was produced for professional staff, principally for teachers, to make them aware of the existing provisions surrounding private fostering. A leaflet was produced which was intended to inform private fosterers of their responsibilities but, as far as I have been able to determine, the leaflet appeared only on the Department of Health website and, therefore, did not have much currency within the general population.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para3"></a>It is also worth noting that, over this period of time, all other forms of childcare, with the exception of nannies, have come under increasing regulation and this is the one remaining area where children may be away from their parents for an extended period of time without any supervision or inspection by anybody.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para4"></a>One of the categories of children who frequently are mentioned in relation to private fostering regulations are children who come to this country to stay in language schools. However&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;I believe that language schools now come within the Ofsted provisions and, indeed, in some cases under the provisions of the Care Standards Act.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para5"></a>The reason for moving the amendment, which I fully accept may be deficient in some respects, is to highlight the need to update the law in this respect. The Social Services Inspectorate has produced a document, By Private Arrangement, which is a consultation document setting out inspection arrangements for supervising children in private foster care. It is a document which draws upon much of the earlier work about which I have spoken. The deficiencies of the existing regulatory framework are highlighted quite graphically in that. When the Social Services Inspectorate set out to do this work, it set itself a target of finding eight local authorities that it could examine in detail&#151;it found only five. Therefore, it had to find others and make some extrapolations. The fact that the SSI was unable to find eight local authorities which could provide it with the information that it needed speaks volumes.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para6"></a>There is one other reason which is fairly compelling for considering this matter now. As I said, all other forms of childcare have been increasingly regulated over the past few years; private fostering has not. Sir William Utting, in his report in 1997 entitled, People Like Us, referred to private fostering as a potential honey-pot for paedophiles and people who seek to do harm to children. It is the sincere belief of many of the organisations working in this field that, as regulation is increasingly effective in all other forms of childcare, the potential for abuse within private fostering is increasing. As someone who believes passionately that anyone who wishes to be considered fit to assume care and responsibility of a child has a duty to prove that they are so, I believe that that is a loophole which should be closed, and should be closed now.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para7"></a>I anticipate that in his reply, the Minister will put forward the argument that the noble Lord, Lord Laming, is currently conducting an inquiry and, although that inquiry has been delayed yet again, it will come to public view probably in the latter part of this year.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para8"></a>That report will inevitably appear after we have completed deliberations of the Bill, and I suspect, after it has been further reviewed in another place. If the Committee does not take this step now, when will there be another opportunity in the legislative timetable to address the issue?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para9"></a>I suspect that I will be accused of being somewhat premature in raising the issue now in the light of the inquiry by the noble Lord, Lord Laming. However, I contend that the issues surrounding private fostering have not changed since the 1973 report was put forward; that many of those issues remain to be addressed; that whatever the outcome of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming&#151;a report which cannot and will not be ignored&#151;there exists a loophole which enables children to be placed in the most vulnerable of situations. Therefore, it is not premature to consider the issue now. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-26_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I rise briefly to support this amendment which seems to fill a serious and longstanding gap in the law relating to fostering. The problem with private fostering, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, indicated is that we do not know how big the problem is. That there is a problem is not in doubt. Five years ago, the Utting report flagged up some serious concerns about the risks to children who have been privately fostered. While it is perfectly true that local authorities have some powers that they can deploy where necessary, not many do so with any degree of energy.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para10"></a>Even if one sets aside the obvious risks of private foster carers abusing the children in their charge, and such people are obviously wholly unsuitable to act as surrogate parents, there are other, perhaps less visible, risks.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para11"></a>In 1988, the African Family Advisory Service found that local authorities and private foster carers had little or no knowledge of the children's medical histories, particularly crucial sometimes in West African children who may have sickle cell disorders, for example. It is estimated that between 80 and 90 per cent of private foster placements involve West African children. Privately fostered children were often passed around like parcels from one set of foster parents to another, without any control whatever. There was no formal system to enable local authorities to keep track of where children were, and not a few children disappeared altogether.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para12"></a>Children suffered behavioural and other problems due to unsatisfactory placements, and where West African children were with white foster parents, their cultural and racial identity was not respected or understood. There is no reason to believe that if a similar survey were carried out today, the results would not be identical. One has to ask what possible reason the Government could have for not following the recommendation of Utting that private foster carers, like all other foster carers, should be subject to  a system of approval and registration. Even childminders are subject to registration.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para13"></a>There is a vast difference between a situation where a child is entrusted to the care of a friend or a neighbour for a day or two, and the situation where a child is handed over indefinitely to the care of strangers without any prior investigation into the suitability of those people to look after the child. The risks are huge. Indeed, Utting stated that privately fostered children appear to be more vulnerable to <P>

<a name="20704-26_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20704-26_para15"></a>Against that background, the existing law is weak. It seems crazy that a local authority which wants to remove a child from the home of a private foster carer can do so only if it applies to the court. If an authority wants to remove a child from one of its own foster carers, there are emergency procedures that it can trigger, and the child can be removed without delay. However, a private foster parent, unapproved and unregulated, is in this sense legally on a par with birth parents, and that has to be a huge anomaly.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para16"></a>The status quo should not, I believe, be an option for the Government, and I hope that they will look with favour on this amendment.

<A NAME="20704-26_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for bringing this matter to our attention.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para17"></a>When we debated the passage of the Care Standards Act we had a long discussion on the whole area of private fostering, and I recognise it is an important area of concern. As both the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, have suggested, it raises concerns about the welfare of children who are privately fostered.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para18"></a>At the moment, private fostering is an agreement where a child under the age of 16, or under 18 if disabled, is cared for by someone who is not a parent, step parent, or has parental responsibility, or is a close relative, for a significant length of time; in other words, 28 days or more. The Children Act 1989 provides a legal framework for notification that requires the private foster carer, and the person with parental responsibility, to notify the local council of the proposed private foster care arrangement.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para19"></a>Once the local authority knows about the impending arrangement, the Children Act requires the local authority to satisfy itself that the welfare of the child is being satisfactorily safeguarded and promoted by others by supervising, regulating and advising it in respect of the private placement. The local authority is then required to visit at specified intervals and to report on those visits. The local authority must satisfy itself that the foster parents' household and accommodation are satisfactory, and it has the power to impose requirements, or if there are serious concerns, to prohibit the fostering arrangement.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para20"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, suggested, there are very different circumstances under which private fostering takes place. We know that common types of private fostering arrangements include the practice of African children being sent to England in order to benefit from a good education; or, as the noble Baroness suggested, many teenagers move in with the parents of boyfriends or girlfriends following family rifts, and others stay with school friends, or neighbours following family disagreements, separations, or indeed divorce.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para21"></a>Clearly this is a legislative framework intended to provide adequate protection, but as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, suggested, and as the recently published SSI report confirmed, there are issues of concern. The noble Baroness is right that only five out of eight councils which in a sample survey were asked for information were able to provide a significant sample of children and carers. As a result, a further five authorities were then asked to provide some basic information in order to supplement the inspection task.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para22"></a>This report confirmed the lack of awareness by carers to notify the arrangement to local authorities, and also highlighted the lack of awareness by local authority social services departments of their responsibilities to privately fostered children. I well understand the importance of this issue. I accept that Amendment No. 69 would require local councils to keep a register of private foster carers in their area. It would also require the council to be satisfied that the premises are suitable and that the person,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is fit to act as a private foster parent",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-26_para23"></a>in order to register him or her.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para24"></a>Under this proposed new clause, potential private foster carers would be required to register with local councils prior to entering a private foster arrangement. Private foster carers failing to register would commit a criminal offence. This matter was discussed not only during the debates on the Care Standards Act, but also during the Report stage of this Bill in another place.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para25"></a>I should outline the Government's position on a registration scheme. We are looking most carefully at it, although it is fair to say that we remain to be convinced that a scheme as proposed by the noble Baroness would solve all the problems that currently exist. Some of the discussion that is taking place is essentially as follows. If a heavy-handed regulatory approach were adopted, it might succeed only in pushing private fostering further underground. It would not solve the significant obstacle of the lack of notification of private foster arrangements, which is one of the key issues that we face at the moment. Nor does it seek to overcome the problem that private foster carers do not currently see any benefits themselves in registration and, therefore, would probably continue to operate without telling the local authority.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para26"></a>A blanket approach to registration may not work as successfully as suggested by the noble Baroness. However, I readily acknowledge that there is no doubt that the current arrangements are unsatisfactory. That is why my honourable friend Jacqui Smith announced a government review of the situation earlier in the year. There is a wide range of stakeholders involved, including Members of Parliament and private foster carers. The review is focusing on the existing arrangements within Part IX of the Children Act, and will consider whether they are robust enough to protect vulnerable children while they are living away from their parents.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para27"></a>We have had meetings involving the major stakeholders, and other government departments, covering issues such as notification of private arrangements, and standards and thresholds of involvement in private fostering arrangements. Private foster carers, those who are being cared for privately, and their parents, are being interviewed. An account of their experiences will be used to further the process of reaching conclusions in terms of the review.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para28"></a>In addition, as the noble Baroness suggested, we anticipate that the findings from the Climbieÿ inquiry in the autumn will also be very relevant to our deliberations as to how we should take the process forward. I understand why the noble Baroness presses us on legislation at the moment; that is entirely consistent with what she has been saying over the past two years. However, it would be unwise to rush into legislation without knowing the conclusions of the review, or, indeed, of the review of the noble Lord, Lord Laming. As I said, that inquiry is due to report in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para29"></a>As I promised during the passage of the Care Standards Act, we have taken this opportunity to send reminders to local authorities as regards their responsibility. As the noble Baroness suggested, we have produced leaflets in order to raise public awareness about this issue. The leaflet went wider than the Department of Health website, though I recognise that there is always more that can be done. In the light of the noble Baroness's comments, I shall look into how effective we are being and consider whether we need to improve our efforts in that direction. I also recognise the point that she made about language schools. I understand that language schools are not classed as schools and therefore are not regulated by the DfES or Ofsted. We are trying to encourage a voluntary accreditation scheme as one way forward.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para30"></a>I know that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of the contrast between the regulation of private fostering and regulation in other areas such as child minding. I fully acknowledge that child minding has been treated differently and that was the subject of our debate during the Care Standards Bill. It reflects to some extent the differing circumstances in which child minding operates. Child minders tend to undertake their duties on a self-employed basis in expectation of regular payment. That is significantly not the case in the vast majority of private foster care arrangements. I can assure noble Lords that as part of the current review of private fostering, we will examine the arrangements surrounding the child minding registration scheme in order to evaluate how effective it is and whether elements of the scheme could usefully be applied to private foster care.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para31"></a>On the point raised by the noble Baroness as to whether there will be another opportunity to legislate on private foster care, she knows that I cannot anticipate future legislative opportunities. However, in my four years or so with a remit in health and social care, we have already taken two Acts through the legislative process. The Adoption and Children Bill <P>


<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be the third if it is enacted. Without giving any commitments, I am sure that there will be further opportunities for legislation in the future.
<P>

<a name="20704-26_para32"></a>I can assure the noble Baroness that the points she makes the Government accept are important. We accept that the current situation is unsatisfactory. We do not think that a blanket registration scheme is necessarily the answer, but we will, of course, look at that carefully in the light of the current review and the conclusions of the noble Lord, Lord Laming.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I should like to make one fairly obvious point that is too often ignored. It is no good our sitting here making laws unless the resources are made available to carry out the obligations that they impose. I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree that at present some social services departments are so overstretched they do not know whether they are coming or going.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Lord takes us back to a debate last week about the willingness and  capability of local authorities to take on responsibilities when we were discussing adoption support services. He makes an important point that it relies on local authorities doing the job properly. That is, of course, partly to do with funding and the spending review settlement for local authorities' social services departments in the future was a very good one, with an average of 6 per cent. real growth over a three-year period. However, it is also to do with the effectiveness of management within local authorities. The chief inspector's letter to local authorities was intended to remind them of their responsibilities, but it is clear from the SSI survey that more needs to be done in that direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Is there bound to be legislation to take effective action about private fostering?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   No, my noble friend cannot draw me. She knows that I cannot give future commitment to legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, was concerned that if we miss the opportunity of legislating on private foster care in the Bill, we would be passing up the chance of doing so for a number of years to come. My point was that in fact this was the third Bill relating to social care issues that we have taken through the House in the past two or three years. I was saying that I am sure that there will be opportunities in the future for further legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   But surely legislation will be required at some point, will it not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   There is no doubt that if, for instance, one wanted to introduce a statutory registration scheme in part or in whole, which is being suggested, legislation would be required.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   With some difficulty I resist the temptation to follow the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on one of my favourite subjects; the funding of social services department. I thank the Minister for his reply. There are, however, a couple of <P>


<a name="column_GC198"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>points that need to be made. The noble Lord talked about the great fear when childminding legislation was introduced that childminding would go underground. The evidence is that it has not and that the registration process has worked extremely well. Both parents as users, and single people who operate as childminders, value registration as being important. I cannot see why childminding, in which a child is very rarely with a childminder overnight, should be more strictly regulated than private fostering.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_time0"></a><H5>5.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. The point I was making is that there are differing circumstances. Unlike childminders, many adults who engage in private fostering do not receive remuneration for it. Therefore, the circumstances are different in relation to whether those private foster carers would wholeheartedly embrace a regulatory system. I also said that as part of the review we will look at how the registration for childminders is working, and indeed if there are good things about that which we could relate in the area of private fosterers, will certainly look to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the Minister for the clarification and I welcome it. However, on the basis of some of the evidence I have read so far, I am not sure that he is wholly correct about the nature of the relationship between birth parents and private fosterers. In a great many cases, a financial transaction takes place. However, we will not dwell on that.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para0"></a>The point I wish to make is about timing. I do not see why, in the light of 30 years of research and experience, it is not possible to draw from that some of the clear points which recur time and time again. However, I accept that the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, will be a very important piece of this particular jigsaw.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para1"></a>One of the problems I have with the process the Minister has outlined is this. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, made a good point about what we say here and laws that we make have only limited effect; what happens on the ground is more important. It is quite clear that thousands of people are in breach of the existing regulations simply because they do not know about them. It is getting the information out to people and making them aware that causes the problem.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para2"></a>When the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, is produced and when the Government produce their response, a great deal of attention will be focused on this matter. It would be sad if the Government were deemed to be reactive to one particular incident, when all this work has been going on ahead. In withdrawing my amendment and accepting what the Minister says, I would at some further stage like to seek an assurance from him that the provisions of the existing law will be used by the department later this year&#151;when there will be increased attention on this subject&#151;to get the message across about the need to notify private fostering arrangements. Furthermore, there should be <P>


<a name="column_GC199"></a>

<A NAME="20704-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath </B>   moved Amendment No. 69A:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-27_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a minor amendment which completes a change to the Bill, the substance of which was made in another place.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para7"></a>Where an adoption is not happening through an adoption agency&#151;so-called "non-agency cases"&#151;Clause 43 provides that the adoptive applicant has to give notice to the local authority in which he has his home. The local authority then has to arrange for an investigation and report to the court on the case and the suitability of the adopters&#151;an important safeguard for children in cases where an adoption agency has not been involved in selecting and matching the adopters for the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para8"></a>At Report stage in another place we introduced amendments to reshape subsection (9) to cover cases where an applicant fulfils the domicile requirements in Clause 47 but does not in law currently have his home in a local authority in England and Wales, perhaps because he is a member of the Armed Forces or a diplomat temporarily stationed abroad. We did not want to block those individuals from adopting under British law simply on those grounds. Therefore, subsection (9) was amended to allow in those cases for us to prescribe in regulations which should be the appropriate local authority where the applicant did not currently have his home in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para9"></a>We further amended subsection (5) to make it clear that while the report to the court and the investigation are the responsibility of the local authority, it could arrange for elements of them to be carried out by other suitable organisations. For example, in the case of step parent adoption applications by service families stationed overseas, we would envisage that the Service Families Adoption Agency&#151;a registered voluntary adoption agency&#151;would conduct the investigation and visit the family, as required by Clause 41(7), and would pass the results to the relevant local authority. If the authority was satisfied, it would then submit the report to the court.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para10"></a>Amendment No. 69A completes this change by amending subsection (6), which sets out what the report to the court should cover, to remove the reference to the local authority. This makes it consistent with the position in subsection (5). So the local authority must arrange for the report but may delegate the actual preparation to another body. But whoever does it, the report must as far as practicable cover the suitability of the adopters and any other <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>matters relevant to the operation of Clause 1, for example, the range of issues set out in the welfare checklist.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para11"></a>I hope that on that basis Members of the Committee will support this minor amendment which completes a change we introduced in another place, which was welcomed as a useful additional flexibility for those British families temporarily stationed overseas such as service families and diplomats.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-27_para16"></a>The noble Earl said: I come now to an amendment which enables us to debate another critically important clause in the Bill, Clause 44. This clause relates to the regulations to be made covering the suitability of persons wishing to adopt a child. It is for me a rather depressing state of affairs that the Bill could consign a matter of such central relevance as this to mere secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para17"></a>I shall not anticipate the debate that we shall have shortly on whether unmarried as well as married couples should be able to become adoptive parents. That is a debate on its own. There is a whole range of other issues which are of the utmost significance for any assessment of whether two particular people are, or are not, fit to become adopters. Clause 44(2) specifies that proper regard should be had to the need for stability and permanence in their relationship.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para18"></a>Stability and permanence are, of course, indispensable qualities in any adoptive placement, but how are they to be determined? What are the indicators of likely stability and permanence, and who will be the judge of them? What other qualities should there be alongside those? Surely, for example, there should be an ability to provide a loving and safe home for the child; an ability to provide the wherewithal for the child's upbringing; an understanding of the individual needs and difficulties of the child; a commitment by the partners to each other as well as to the child; an absence of criminal background or any unsuitable domestic history; and many other qualities besides .
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para19"></a>I do not suggest that the face of the Bill should carry every element of the checklist that an adoption agency will be charged with filling out when reaching its conclusions, but we surely ought to have some idea of, and be able to debate, those which the Government regard as being of central importance.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para20"></a>Unfortunately, Clause 44 gives us almost no pointers. That is why I suggest, once again, that the regulations to be placed before us under the clause should be subject to the affirmative procedure in order to guarantee both Houses of Parliament the right to debate them.

<P>

<a name="20704-27_para21"></a>I fully concede that this is not something that the Delegated Powers Committee of your Lordships' House felt was necessary. However, this Committee is entitled to take a different view from the Select Committee. It may do so in the light of issues of policy which of course the Select Committee is not empowered to take into account. Bearing in mind that no draft regulations are before this Committee, and that we are not in a position to consider these matters in any depth, I submit that this suggestion is not unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para22"></a>I am aware that in their White Paper the Government committed themselves to carrying out a fundamental review of the adoption assessment process, and no doubt we shall have to await the outcome of that exercise. The regulations will, of course, take the results of the review into account.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para23"></a>Meanwhile, however, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has made a very creative and considered attempt to point Ministers in the right direction on these regulations. I will let him speak to them in his own way. I very much support the thrust of what he proposes which represents a distillation of the matters that we discussed on the first day in Committee. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support Amendment No. 70. The presentation of these three grouped amendments to Clause 44 which bear my name starts with Amendment No. 70ZC. That is the trigger clause in primary legislation which determines the legal efficacy of the subordinate legislation under Amendments Nos. 70ZA and 70ZB. I shall not speak to Amendment No. 70ZB as it is in the next grouping. I support it. It is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para24"></a>The subordinate legislation under Amendment Nos. 70ZA and 70ZB has to be approved after Royal Assent as proposed in Amendment No. 70. Having considered that, Members of the Committee have been considering this matter with a short reference to the true effect on enforcement of judicial review, which is the only effective means. At the outset, for reasons that are already wholly apparent, perhaps I may make a formal request, which could herald a formal Motion, that Clause 44 should be committed with Clause 4 and Clauses 48 to 51 for debate on the Floor of the House, to which some reference has already been made on Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para25"></a>Amendment No. 70ZC is a DIY effort to crystallise a principle; there is no form of hubris about whether it is totally correct. I am seeking to convey the suggestion that the principle is correct, and this could serve as a vehicle for implementing that principle.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para26"></a>The purpose is to limit the exercise of discretion, which is a wholly exceptional circumstance, and to exclude financial constraints. That is in accordance with a precedent that has already been set by the courts on misuse of assessment for special educational needs to curtail expenditure, and the courts have stamped on that.
<P>


<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para27"></a>It serves as a useful precedent for the situation with which we are faced; that is, the matter to which the Minister referred at col. 80 of the Official Report on 27th June, albeit in context with Amendment No. 16 to Clause 4, tabled by my noble friend Lord Howe. Again, in a way and in another context it runs parallel with this. Of course, both seek to establish in primary legislation the parameters in the case of Clause 4, so that there shall be no exercise of discretion beyond what is stated on the face of the Bill&#151;in this case the parameters.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para28"></a>As my noble friend Lord Howe said, it is wholly apparent now that no draft of these implementing regulations, statutory guidance, will be available for your Lordships' consideration before Royal Assent. Is it not wholly requisite that the nature and extent of the exercise of discretion should be considered by your Lordships and establish that in these situations by primary legislation to define and clarify the status of the legal efficacy of the subordinate legislation, which is on its way? Would it not also enhance the due process of parliamentary approval when we come to approve under Amendment No. 70, which is the ultimate safeguard, save for the courts on judicial review to which I shall turn shortly.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para29"></a>This is a very emotive subject and I try to keep it non-emotive. On an objective analysis, I ask whether it is not consistent with the intent of this Bill that these abandoned children should be entitled to some priority&#151;I stress that and it involves financial priority on resources&#151;for their own sakes and for the interests of society.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para30"></a>One then comes to Amendment No. 70ZA. It seeks merely to reflect the substance of the Committee's debate on Amendment No. 7, other than on subsection (5). Again, the opinion of the Committee is sought; this is a probing amendment. I have kept off the turf on subsection (5) because that now lies squarely within the province of the Minister. He has his letters of 20th and 21st June and it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to seek to anticipate. At least I thought it not proper to do so and I trust that the Minister in due course will give his attention to this.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para31"></a>Perhaps I may mop up a few cross-references, because the patchwork is getting very complex and it may help. To a limited extent, paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 70ZA, which is to do with representation and caring for the child, is considered in Amendment No. 66. At some stage, and assuredly not today&#151;or I shall not deal with it&#151;Members of the Committee will have to consider Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 12 of the United Nations convention.

<a name="20704-27_para32"></a>Today have Amendments Nos. 115A and 116ZA as supplementary to the Marshalled list, which I support. I prefer my drafting in paragraph (a) on this issue. It is expressed to ensure that the child is heard but I commend the concept of Amendment No. 116ZA as amending primary legislation and affecting children of general application and putting it on the face of the Bill. That is one way in which one removes oneself from the dilemma of not seeing the drafts of <P>


<a name="column_GC203"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regulations before Royal Assent. So this is an important amendment, albeit that it has come in at the last moment.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para33"></a>The structure of the Bill in Clause 44(1) and (2) has been followed in this amendment, subject to Amendment No. 70ZC which affords a qualified duty as regards exercise of discretion. I draw the distinction, which is firm, that there is no absolute duty as proposed by the amendment of my noble friend, Lord Howe, as supported by many noble Lords, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford and myself, on the grounds that, when discretion has already been exercised on an assessment, there really should be no further discretion to decline to implement the assessment.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para34"></a>On the question of judicial review, there is a considerable measure of misunderstanding as to its effect. First, it is a branch of administrative law, in which "unreasonable" has a wholly technical meaning that is not generally understood. It is a purely discretionary remedy within the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. It may set aside an exercise of discretion if it is contrary to construction&#151;that is, construction of these regulations or statutory guidance&#151;as applicable to the facts of each particular case, but it is does not, and never can, substitute its own opinion of the merits for those who made the decision.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para35"></a>Although the court would have decided otherwise&#151;and, on many occasions, had said so&#151;I have had the conduct of a case on more than one occasion where I have been told, "It's all very well Mr Campbell, we think you're quite right on the merits, but we're not concerned with merits; we're concerned with something quite different." What the courts are concerned with is whether anybody in the same position as the local authority, or provider of services, and so on, or anybody properly directing himself, could&#151;I repeat, could&#151;have made this decision; it is not "would" have made it. If anybody could have made it, they do not say that it is unreasonable, and they do not set it aside. They will only set it aside as unreasonable in the technical sense if they conclude that nobody could have made it.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para36"></a>As must be quite apparent, it is not a wholly effective mechanism. I have conducted more than 50 cases in judicial review, and we all know that it is not an effective mechanism. It is effective as far as it goes, but it is not a review of the merits on appeal by way of a rehearing; and so it is of limited consequence. It may also set aside a decision for unfairness in the administrative process, because it is an administrative jurisdiction, on bias, on the grounds that it was unreasonable in the strict sense to which I referred, or on grounds of error of law as a matter of construction where the devil lies in the detail of the drafting. If challenged, an objective exercise of discretion under Amendment No. 70ZC would be upheld, so on that there would be no problem.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para37"></a>The question of whether deviation from statutory guidance is permissible&#151;the Minister was good enough to write to me about this&#151;is entirely <P>


<a name="column_GC204"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dependent on the construction of the document. The noble Lord wrote on 26th June to draw my attention to a certain authority of 16th March 1996, in which the reasoning, wholly related to the circumstances of that case, was in effect somewhat elliptical.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para38"></a>The importance of mentioning this at this stage is that that decision did not reach the Court of Appeal; it did not reach the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House; and it has not the status of a leading authority of general application. It is respectfully suggested that it could not be relied upon as a safe or satisfactory precedent for the drafting of statutory guidance under this Bill. I am grateful, and I apologise for having taken some time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-27_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I should like first to support very strongly the notion of using the affirmative resolution procedure. Probably the most critical part of the whole adoption process is making the match between those who are adopting and the child. I cannot think of anything more important than that. I was disappointed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, refer to the fact that we shall not see the draft regulations, guidance or papers regarding the information which will serve as the criteria on which judgments on suitable adoptive placements will be based.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para39"></a>The suitability of any person in regard to adoption, and having regard to the need for, in the first place, stability and permanence of relationship, can mean many things to many people. What we know is that, in the past and in the present, there has been much subjectivity and not enough objectivity. Some prejudicial views have been applied by some involved in the adoption process. So the more we know and the more clearly we can ascertain the criteria laid down to make these judgments, the better it will be. It is so important to know against what criteria those judgments will be made. This should be a matter for the House. That is particularly true if we are not able to see the draft regulations during the Bill's passage.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para40"></a>I should like to comment very briefly on the issue of recommitment. I have enormous sympathy for the notion of recommitting important parts of the Bill. My difficulty is that I do not approve of the Grand Committee process at all. Many do not attend our Sittings in Committee but would be interested in some of our debates. If we went round the Table, I suspect that we would all have a different view on what is important in the Bill, and that other parts of the Bill would be thought appropriate for recommitment. It is a great pity that, when the Bill is considered on the Floor of the House, those rather stricter procedures will kick in. In the Chamber we shall not have this valuable iterative process. That will be lost, and I believe that it is a great pity.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para41"></a>Therefore, I start from the business of saying that the arguments used by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, are appropriate for opposing the whole Grand Committee system itself. I have more difficulty <P>


<a name="column_GC205"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in saying that little parts of the Bill should be recommitted. However, that is a matter for the Committee to consider.
<P>

<a name="20704-27_para42"></a>I believe that we should strive for the greatest possible objectivity and the greatest possible clarity. If we really intend that adoption processes are to work, and if we are to make the most suitable matches between adoptive parents and the children to be adopted, the matter is important enough to come before the Houses of Parliament for their endorsement.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   When I sought to rise earlier, I had planned on making a different point. I should now like first to comment on the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, regarding objectivity. I remind the Committee that there was a departmental investigation into many of the allegations of lack of objectivity in adoption proceedings. That investigation showed that social workers mainly demonstrated objectivity, and that many of the strange stories were myths and legends and not part of practice. We should continually remind ourselves that social workers and adoption workers are making extraordinarily complex decisions in these family situations. We should do all we can to support them in what we say in this Committee and this House.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para0"></a>I leave the legal points to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and shall concentrate on practice issues. I shall, however, deal with two of the points he made. The first is that I have absolute sympathy with Members about the wish to see what is in the regulations, as they will address the very heart and emotion of the Bill. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that matching is the core and most important point. That is why I do not agree with the noble Lord that we should deal with parts of the matter off the Floor of the House. The regulations will give an importance to some parts of the Bill which I believe they do not have in comparison with other parts of the Bill. Some people simply want to take a particular view&#151;perhaps a dogmatic view; and clearly I have my own views&#151;on those parts.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para1"></a>We should debate the whole of the Bill in Grand Committee. When we reach the next stage, people will have an opportunity to put those points. The proposal would give undue weight to certain issues, whereas those who are interested in this work should become involved in the broader issues.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para2"></a>I support one part of the proposals. Perhaps I should also say that I am having some difficulty following where we are in relation to the amendments. I support the proposal on independent guidance and representation of the child made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Earl, Earl Howe, in Amendment No. 70ZA. This would be a useful check on some of the issues we raised in relation to regulation. It is very difficult to discuss the detail of regulation because regulation itself cannot be written in Committee; it has to be clarified in consultation. In Committee, issues that do not have much relevance to actual practice are approached differently.

<P>

<a name="20704-28_para3"></a>If every child in the adoption process had an advocate with a position that differed from that of the placement authority and the local authority, we could ensure a check on the social work. Such advocates would know whether the child was concerned about the placement and be able to iterate those concerns to the court. I therefore support the proposal that every child should have the opportunity of independent representation. I think that that would address some of the other issues underlying our concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I shall, if I may, briefly support the point that has just been made. We sometimes talk about the wishes and thoughts of the child&#151;and I was guilty of this and made the same mistake when dealing with the subject very early in our first Sitting&#151;whereas we should be considering the effective representation of the child's interests in court. There are so many whose interests differ from those of the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The debate on this group of amendments is very important. In many cases, it links to the debate that we shall have shortly on unmarried couples. I well recognise that we need to consider these matters very carefully indeed. I have listened with great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, in his request that particular clauses be recommitted. He will know that that is a matter for the usual channels. I shall of course ensure that the usual channels are apprised of his wish.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para4"></a>As far as the noble Baroness, Lady, Blatch&#151;who is now not in her place&#151;is concerned, my own experience of Grand Committee&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   It might be appropriate for me to inform the Minister that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, told me that, unfortunately, she has to be in North London. She said that she was not walking out in high dudgeon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am relieved to hear that. The general issue of Grand Committee is of course not for this Committee to discuss. We are in our fourth day of debate and it has been an extremely helpful and useful process and very stimulating.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para5"></a>Clause 44 amplifies the general power in Clause 9 of the Bill to make regulations in respect of the functions of adoption agencies and adoption support agencies. Subsection (1) provides that regulations under Clause 9 may make provision as to the matters to be taken into account by an adoption agency in determining or making any report in respect of the suitability of any persons to adopt a child.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para6"></a>Subsection (2) makes clear that the regulations may make provision to ensure that adoption agencies pay proper regard to the stability and permanence of the relationship between prospective adopters when determining their suitability to adopt. The requirements on the stability and permanence of the relationship between prospective adopters, set out in the regulations made under this clause, will apply to the assessment of both married and unmarried prospective adopters. It is on that basis that I readily <P>


<a name="column_GC207"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>acknowledge that this is a very important part of both the Bill and, of course, of our future success&#151;one readily hopes and expects&#151;in improving the overall quality of the adoption service.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para7"></a>In that context, it is entirely understandable that Members of the Committee want to flesh out as much detail as possible as to what is likely to be in the regulations. I fully understand the points that noble Lords are making. I know that there is disappointment that draft regulations are not available and I will come on to the review that we are currently undertaking in this area. In our defence, Clause 44 was introduced at a late stage of the deliberations of the Bill in another place. There simply has not been time to work up draft regulations, which is why we will issue our proposals on the fundamental review of the adopter assessment process for full public consultation later in the year.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para8"></a>When we come to the substantive question, which essentially is how much we put in primary or secondary legislation, we have a balance to draw. On the one hand, the more precise the primary legislation, the more inflexible it could be in practice. In making difficult judgments in relation to prospective adopters, we have to put trust in adoption agencies and the social workers and give them proper discretion. I do not believe, therefore, that it would be wise to set out in primary legislation, or even in regulations, rules so precise that people who would make good adoptive parents were ruled out because for good reasons they may not meet precisely one of the conditions in the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para9"></a>On the other hand, there is no doubt that all Members of the Committee want to feel assured that stability and permanence in a relationship mean just that and that as far as one can ever determine the future relationship of any couple, whether they are married or not, those making the judgment feel that the relationship is strong and will last. We all want to give security to the adopted child.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para10"></a>I hope that the Committee will find it helpful if I say, by way of introduction, that I will take away all the points that have been raised in this debate because I am determined to see that we get the right balance. It might also be helpful if I set out the Government's current thinking on what exactly we mean by an "enduring family relationship" and by "stability and permanence".
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para11"></a>The concept of family life has been considered in recent case law, although with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway present it is somewhat foolhardy of me to mention case law, as I have discovered already from our earlier debate on statutory guidance.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   As I was saying, the concept of family life has been considered in recent case law as including,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"two adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterised by an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-28_para14"></a>
That would perhaps provide a starting point for consideration by adoption agencies and the courts, which will look at a range of evidence in coming to a decision about whether the couple has an enduring family relationship. The word "enduring" in the definition of a couple will reinforce the fact that the relationship should be a stable one that both partners intend should last.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para15"></a>We are carrying out a fundamental review of the adopter assessment process and the operation of adoption panels. This review is being taken forward in close collaboration with key stakeholders. The objective of the review is to ensure that the adopter education, training and assessment system is transparent and results in approved adopters who are empowered to meet the needs of the range of children and young people requiring adoption.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para16"></a>The scope of the review will include the range of criteria used for the assessment of potential adopters and the consistency of their application across the country, with a view to improving the process in the future. This will include the issue of judging stability and permanence in a relationship.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para17"></a>As under the present adopter assessment system, it is likely that there will be a number of ways in which adoption agencies will consider the stability of a couple's relationship. These will apply both in cases where a couple applies to adopt jointly and in cases or where an individual with a partner applies to adopt as a single person.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para18"></a>At present, as part of the adopter assessment process, a home study takes place over a period of several months. A designated social worker visits the prospective adopters at home in order to establish a detailed view of the prospective adopters, any family members and any other people living in their home.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para19"></a>A professional social worker also typically works through real-life situations with the prospective adopters in order to assess the evidence of the stability of their relationship. The prospective adopters and the social worker will discuss issues such as how they would expect to handle disagreements about the child, and how they currently handle disagreements about other family members.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para20"></a>In addition, adoption agencies ask for confidential personal references about prospective adopters. Personal referees are usually asked to comment on all aspects of the relationship between the prospective adopters, including the amount of time they spend together and the leisure and recreational activities they share.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para21"></a>My sense is that most potential adopters who go through this process find it to be a pretty tough process indeed. We have read of concerns among potential <P>


<a name="column_GC209"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adopters who have described the process as lengthy, often intrusive, sometimes over-intrusive, and certainly difficult.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para22"></a>I do not comment on that. It should be a tough process, because the judgment that has to be made is an important one. But nobody should be under any  misapprehension that decisions to approve prospective adopters are made in a frivolous or light-touch way. That is part of the confidence that must be given to the new system.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para23"></a>We then come to the question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It is: given that these regulations are so important, should they be undertaken by the affirmative rather than the negative procedure? We had a debate about this earlier, and perhaps there are further amendments to come on other regulations. In deciding on mainly negative regulation&#151;there are three regulations that will be affirmative in this Bill&#151;we are following current practice in relation to such legislation. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggested, the Select Committee of your Lordships' House which considered the matter raised no objection.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para24"></a>However, I recognise the force of the argument put forward by the noble Earl. I also recognise that these are important regulations. I should tell him that I am prepared to consider this matter between now and the Report stage. The noble Earl has made an extremely important point. As I said earlier, I want to ensure that this debate about the balance between how much discretion and flexibility is allowed at local level and what precise matters should be put on the face of the Bill, or in regulations, is carefully considered. I shall be happy to engage in further discussion on that balance between the Committee and the Report stage.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para25"></a>However, I repeat: one has to be extremely careful not to try to define too much in legislation and then allow less discretion to the social workers and the adoption agencies, which would exclude some potentially very good people who were being considered for adoption. That is the balance and the dilemma that we face in this area, but I accept that we must give a clear view as to what we mean by a "stable and enduring relationship". It is important that the broad parameters of that are known and discussed. The consultation process later in the year will be very important in that regard. That is why I have sympathy with the noble Earl's suggestion; namely, that when regulations in this area come before your Lordships' House we ought to consider whether they should be dealt with under the affirmative resolution procedure. I am sure that the noble Earl would not take that as a precedent for any other amendments that he may table in relation to other regulations.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para26"></a>I turn to the very helpful amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. I accept that he is trying to tease out some of the issues in relation to the judgments that will fall to be made as regards Clause 44 of the Bill. The noble Lord has also raised a number of important issues, such as the right of the child to be heard, the question of how we ensure that local authorities do the right thing, and how we monitor the situation. In addition, going back to our debate of a <P>


<a name="column_GC210"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>week ago when we talked about adoption support services, the noble Lord also raised the question of what duty there is on a local authority to provide such services after the assessment.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para27"></a>I come to the question of the voice of the child. We have of course already discussed this issue. There is no question that the Government believe that the child's wishes and feelings should actively be sought and fully taken into account. It is a key value that underpins our National Adoption Standards. In addition, Clause (1)(4)(a) of the Bill requires adoption agencies, and courts, to have regard to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-28_para28"></a>when coming to any decision relating to the adoption of a child. That is an overarching principle. The procedures that adoption agencies, and the courts, will operate for determining the child's wishes and feelings will vary depending on the age and understanding of the child, the stage of the adoption process, and the circumstances of the case. These procedures will be set out for adoption agencies in regulations and guidance, and for courts in court rules and guidance.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para29"></a>As I explained to the Committee previously, these regulations and guidances are not available now, as we intend to consult extensively. We have already made clear that there will be explicit obligations on adoption agencies to consult the child at specified stages of the adoption process, to record their views, to ensure that their views are considered by the decision making process&#151;for example by adoption panels&#151;and, where they are not acted upon, to record the reasons why not.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para30"></a>The detail of the regulations will be subject to consultation but, as a matter of good practice, we would expect the views of the child on any suggested match with prospective adopters to be sought and taken into account in the light of the child's age and understanding. This should take place before any match between a child and a set of prospective adopters is considered by an adoption agency adoption panel and before any decision is made. We would then expect there to be several meetings between the child and the prospective adopters before the child goes to live with them. This important part of the introduction process will ensure that the proposed placement works for both the child and the prospective adopters.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para31"></a>The key point in relation to the procedures operated by adoption agencies is that it is the job of the child's social workers to ensure that the child's voice is heard throughout the adoption process. I referred earlier to our National Adoption Standards which make clear that every child will have his or her wishes and feelings listened to, recorded and taken into account. Professional social workers have the skills and expertise needed to ensure that their wishes and feelings are listened to and attended to.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para32"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who is not in his place, also raised a number of other questions, to which I refer briefly. He takes us back to the question of how we ensure that local authorities do <P>


<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the right job. I do not want to go over all the ground that we have discussed previously, but I believe that the Government are absolutely clear that we want adoption services to work; we want to ensure that the local authorities perform effectively; that we shall performance manage; but that we have concerns about the nature of the proposals that the noble Lord put forward. If one puts on the statute the kind of duty that he wishes to see local authorities given, one runs the risk of saying not only are adoption services important but that they are of overriding importance; of more importance than many of the other provisions and functions of social services.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para33"></a>The final point raised by the noble Lord concerns Section 7 statutory guidance. All I would say on that is that the 1996 case has since been followed in a number of other cases. There has been ample opportunity to overturn decisions or for the House of Lords to consider this and they have not done so. As far as local authorities are concerned, they know that Section 7 guidance is tough guidance. That is why I often come under pressure in your Lordships' House to issue more statutory guidance to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20704-28_para34"></a>In conclusion, I believe that this is an important point and I recognise the importance of these regulations. We will do as much as we can to flesh out some of the detail, though that will not be entirely easy because of the process we set ourselves in relation to working on this over the autumn and the consultation process that we have set. However, I recognise the force of the argument put forward by the noble Earl in relation to the status of the regulations, and I shall come back to noble Lords on Report on that matter.

<P>

<a name="20704-29_para2"></a>The Minister referred to recent case law, which should only ever be a starting point in this context. When we are reforming the laws on adoption, as we are doing&#151;this is a basic point to make&#151;it is of course for Parliament to decide what constitutes an acceptable measure of stability and an acceptable family unit. We look at these matters afresh, which is our function. The Minister referred also to the assessment that is done by social workers of the degree of stability that a couple evinces.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para3"></a>The Minister made it sound more of a scientific process than it is in fact. There is very little science about it. It may be a tough process but it is not and cannot be a wholly reliable predictor of permanence because in the end it is a matter of subjective judgment. I do not want to dwell too much longer on this amendment, however, other than to reiterate my thanks to the Minister for his positive undertaking. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) In deciding the stability and permanence of a couple under subsection (2), the regulations shall require an adoption agency to have regard to (inter alia) the following factors&#151;
<br>
(a) whether the couple have lived in the same home together as a couple for at least the previous five years,
<br>
(b) whether they are prepared to make a written and public commitment that they will together make a home for the child until he reaches the age of 18,
<br>
(c) whether they are prepared to make a written and public commitment to act jointly to promote the welfare and best interests of the child, and
<br>
(d) whether they are prepared to enter into a binding and enforceable contract with one another and with the child that they will on a basis set out in the agreement jointly provide financial security for the child during its minority."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20704-29_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 70ZB and to speak to Amendments Nos. 123 and 122A, 122B and 122C. I brought this group together because they are all probing amendments relating to  the Government's proposal for adoption by unmarried couples. The Government's proposal for adoption by unmarried couples is a major change in the law and we have a responsibility to look carefully at the implications.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para8"></a>We are probably all at one in accepting that Clause 1, the primary welfare of the child, is absolutely right. I suspect also that Members of the Committee will agree that the most important needs of all children, but especially of children seeking adoption, are security, stability and enduring love. The Government indeed accept this in Clause 139(4)(b).
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para9"></a>We also know, alas, that the statistics show that couples who have made the long-term commitment to marriage are, on average, more likely than those who <P>


<a name="column_GC213"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have not, to be able to offer a child that stability. I give only one example, as Members of the Committee are no doubt aware of the statistics. Within five years of the birth of a child, on average 8 per cent of married couples will have split up and 52 per cent of cohabiting couples will have split up. Those figures show two things: first, that marriage is by no means a guarantee of stability; and, secondly, that the average relating to cohabiting couples does not mean that there are not cohabiting couples who have long and enduring stable relationships.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para10"></a>There are two ways of addressing this problem. The first, which I think will be advanced very soon, is to allow only married couples to adopt or, to put it another way, not to allow unmarried couples to adopt and to allow only married couples or single persons to adopt. The second alternative way is to apply stringent criteria to all couples in order to ensure, as far as possible, that only couples who are likely to offer stability are acceptable as adopters. Manifestly that is the route that the Government would like to take.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para11"></a>It is worth saying in passing that if we accept the 8 per cent:52 per cent ratio and the principle of applying stringent criteria, the likelihood is that there will be about six times more married couples approved for adoption than unmarried couples. I raise in passing the possibility that that situation might be challenged by the equal opportunities lobby, the human rights lobby and all sorts of other lobbies. That should be taken into consideration when we are considering this question.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para12"></a>Before the Committee makes a decision about which route we should follow, we must know more&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   We have difficulties in hearing at this end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I am sorry. If we accept the two alternative ways in which this problem can be addressed, it is fundamentally essential that the Committee knows more about the Government's decisions and understands more clearly what their intentions are before we are asked to make a decision. It is with the aim of finding out more that I have tabled this group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para13"></a>Amendment No. 70ZB and Amendment No. 123 suggest criteria that should normally be the minimum acceptable criteria before a couple can be accepted as adopters. These amendments propose three things. The first is that there should be a track record, to which the Minister has already referred. I have suggested a track record of five years stable co-habitation. The second is the willingness of the couple to make a clear, long-term public commitment to do their best to offer the adopted child the environment, stability and love that it needs. The third is a more practical one: to ensure that if the couple break up, the child is not exposed to the kind of drawn-out haggling over money that so often dogs divorce cases today and which is emotionally disastrous for the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para14"></a>Amendment No. 122A addresses the question of what constitutes a couple by asking what constitutes a partner. In the Bill the term "couple" is defined as a <P>


<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relationship of partners. This is a crucial question and in my view it is not clearly answered in the Bill. I give just one example. Across the country many young and old people who are friends live together not in a sexual partnership but to avoid loneliness and to share living costs. They may be brothers and sisters, two sisters or a whole range of others, for example, young unmarried people. Are these people included as couples? They may be committed, have been living together for a long time and have economic stability. We need to know. Or, is some element of sexual partnership imperative in the definition of a couple?
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para15"></a>Amendment No. 122B attempts to define a family for the purposes of the Bill. The Government are fond of saying that today families come in all shapes and sizes. They are certainly correct in saying that, but there is surely a need to define where the ultimate boundary of a family lies for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para16"></a>Amendment No. 122C seeks to delete subsections (5) and (6) of Clause 139. Why should a brother and sister from an excellent home not be satisfactory adoptive parents? Why should grandparents, or uncles, who happen not to be married but to be co-habiting, not be eligible to adopt as they would be if they were married? These seem to be relevant questions worth asking. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I want to speak to this amendment, which in the view of these Benches is certainly preferable to the next set of amendments we shall debate, or the amendments we shall debate probably next week. It is an attempt to establish some fairly stringent criteria by which the stability and permanence of a couple are to be judged.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para17"></a>In his previous response the Minister helpfully set out the test which needs to be applied. I believe that the measures we are discussing go beyond the application of any sensible test. As I understand it, the test that the Minister described should not over fetter an agency in the exercise of its duties, in the light of the fact that it does have to exercise discretion.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para18"></a>It seems to me that the measures which the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, proposes are fairly prescriptive. I realise that I sound like a government Minister, but those measures are extremely prescriptive. I hasten to add that I do not often take that line. However, they would put the adoption agency in something of a strait-jacket when assessing suitability, stability, permanence and so forth. They constitute a starting point for debate but no more than that. The noble Lord proposes that a couple who wish to adopt should have lived together in the same home for five years and should make a written and public commitment. What happens if any of those conditions are not fulfilled? Such conditions limit the possibilities open to adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="20704-29_para19"></a>I understand entirely where the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is coming from. As I say, I much appreciate the fact that he contemplates unmarried couples and gay couples being able to adopt. Therefore, if the price, as it were, of accepting that is <P>


<a name="column_GC215"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we have some sensible criteria in the Bill, I do not object to that. However, I believe that the measures he proposes are too rigid and would cause problems in practice.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   I briefly support some of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has made. I, too, have a great deal of sympathy with the reasoning behind the measures we are discussing. However, when I first read them I was very pleased that they had not been applied to birth parents as I do not believe that I would necessarily have been able to sign up to all of them when I gave birth to my daughter. Certainly, the first point would not have applied to me as I gave birth to my daughter 21 months after I was married. My husband and I had not been living together for five years. I believe that possibly&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Perhaps I may make the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, was not an adoptive parent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   No, I was not, but I do have an adopted grandson, so I am aware of the difficulties that adoptive parents face. My worry is that if these conditions are put before adoptive parents they may be off-putting for them. They may put off people who would be good adoptive parents.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para0"></a>I am particularly bothered by paragraphs (b) and (c). When people want to adopt children, they are eager to adopt and very vulnerable. At that point in their lives, they may well say, "Yes, I can commit myself to (b) and (c)", but then, for all sorts of reasons, find themselves unable to comply with their agreement.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para1"></a>Paragraph (d) also bothers me. It says that the couple,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will on a basis set out in the agreement jointly provide financial security".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-30_para2"></a>
What happens if one person in the couple finds herself disabled or unemployed and unable to get a job, and therefore unable to stick to her commitment?
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para3"></a>Although I see the aim of the amendment, I cannot agree with the four paragraphs. I re-iterate that the point which bothers me most is the possibility that this rather rigid criteria could put off couples who would be very good adoptive parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   It might be helpful if I replied to the debate. There is flexibility on detail, and there is the possibility of amending and improving these proposals. However, the point of the proposals is precisely to make the point that we have to draw a line somewhere. The Government have drawn the line by saying that adoption societies will have complete freedom to decide this issue; at least I think that that is what they are proposing. I am saying that if we as Parliament are passing this law, we have a certain responsibility to understand what it is that we are saying, and to draw a bottom line as to who should be excluded from being adoptive parents. If adoptive parents are not prepared to make a commitment to do <P>


<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their best to look after their child until it is 18, then they should not be adoptive parents. That is my opinion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I have some difficulty with this group of amendments. Apart from anything else, they are not internally consistent. I agree that Amendment No. 70ZB is very fierce in its demands. One cannot seriously make that type of binding, enforceable, public and written commitment. One can make such a commitment, but life itself teaches us&#151;there is a Russian saying to this effect&#151;that although one may have the best intention in the world of staying married to one's partners for life, or for 18 years, or for whatever length of time, one can nevertheless run on to the rocks and it will not happen.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para4"></a>I prefer what must have been the first drafting of the amendment, which is a declaration of the couple's "firm intention" to continue to live together. That is also a far more easily accessible concept. I do not think that a social worker could make a judgment on whether they mean to live together for 18 years, whereas she might be able to make an assessment that they had a "true intention" to do so. That is more realistic.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para5"></a>Turning to the other amendments, I am touched by the definition of a family used by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. In the context of this Bill, that is an extremely difficult concept to define. He has made a pretty good stab at it, although whether it will be acceptable to the Government is another matter.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para6"></a>In that context, however, there seems to be some inconsistency between Amendment No. 122A&#151;which says that a couple is two people living as "sexual" partners in an enduring family relationship&#151;and the noble Lord's omission, because he does not agree with it, of subsection (5) of Clause 139. That provision makes clear the Government's intention that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (4)(b) does not include two people one of whom is the other's parent, grandparent, sister, brother",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-30_para7"></a>and so on. The noble Lord deliberately introduced the concept that those sorts of people should be able to be considered as a suitable family. He may be able to explain this perfectly clearly, but I see a slight internal contradiction in that sequence of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I introduced the word "sexual" there in the hope that the Government would say that it was not that. It was merely to tease out what the Government do believe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   It was beyond my abilities to predict that that was the noble Lord's intention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I should like to make three brief points, the first of which concerns the issue of statistics. I have heard several times today the quotation of how many married couples stay together as against those who cohabit. We do not have statistics on how many families stay together with an adopted child as part of that family, although that is a key element. Of course there are adoption breakdowns. However, many families do stay together once they <P>


<a name="column_GC217"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have children in their midst. Some spurious statistics are going round. We need to examine them and be clear about them.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para8"></a>Secondly, people who adopt have to make a commitment. They have to court when that commitment is made. They have to decide and sign to the effect that they are going to support, maintain and give emotional support to that child. So, as the Minister said, the very act of adoption involves a very rigorous process. Nevertheless, some of that process has been criticised. We therefore seem to be saying, at one and the same time, that the process has to be rigorous, but that it is already far too rigorous. We need to tease out that issue.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para9"></a>I think, thirdly, that the real issue is about sex and people's feelings about sexual relationships. We should remember that there are married couples who may not have said that they are adopting because they have no sexual relationship for one reason or another. As a family practitioner, I have worked subsequently with such couples. There are also couples of other constituencies who make very good parents. However, we shall address that issue in a future debate. I do not think that we should deceive ourselves. It is not really about permanence; it is about sex.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_time0"></a><H5>7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This has been a very useful debate. I start by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that it is not the Government's intention simply to let adoption agencies get on with it. That is the whole purpose of Clause 44. That is why we shall develop regulations. That is also why I said that I shall seriously consider the suggestion of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that the regulations should be dealt with under the affirmative procedure. That is also why, in the next few months, there will be a very considered piece of work to ensure that we are as clear as we possibly can be in informing those who have to do the work about what is expected of them.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para10"></a>The debate has been useful. I know that the noble  Lord, Lord Northbourne, has tabled these amendments as probing amendments. However, in so doing, he has identified for us the problems of trying to be too precise. We come back to this dilemma as to how much we can wisely put in statute and how much we should wisely leave to practitioners' discretion. There is a genuine debate to be had, and the Government are very keen to lead that debate and to have discussions with those involved. I have no doubt that we will all want to address the issue at Report stage. Nevertheless, analysing the amendments is very instructive in relation to some of the problems that arise when one tries to be too specific.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para11"></a>I promise not to hold the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, against him. He has put aside the practice of at least five years to my certain knowledge in arguing that point. However, it was surely a very substantive point.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para12"></a>I turn to the specific amendment, Amendment No. 70ZB has the effect that regulations made under subsection (2) of that clause must require the adoption <P>


<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agency, when considering stability and permanence of the couple's relationship, to have regard, among other factors, to the factors listed in paragraphs (a) to (d). Paragraph (a) addresses the issue of the period of time during which the couple have lived in the same home together in order to be approved as prospective adopters. This is an issue on which the Government are keen to hear a wide range of views.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para13"></a>Under the current arrangements for assessing prospective adopters, the adoption agency would expect the relationship between the couple to be of sufficiently long standing, and three years is a typical benchmark presently used by adoption agencies. If a couple had been together only for a matter of months, it is unlikely that the agency would be willing to assess them, but we are keen to hear further views on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para14"></a>Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Amendment No. 70ZB are similar to Amendment No. 70ZA of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. They enable regulations to be made requiring the agency to have regard to whether the prospective adopters are prepared to make a written and public commitment that they will together make a home for the child until he reaches the age of 18. Paragraph (c) provides a specific regulation-making power requiring the agency to have regard to whether the prospective adopters are prepared to make a written and public commitment to act jointly to promote the welfare and best interests of the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para15"></a>The first point I would make to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on that is that the adopter assessment process is designed to ensure that only people who are able to provide a stable and secure home for a child are approved as prospective adopters. This thorough assessment process carried out by all adoption agencies will look at all aspects of the commitment between the prospective adopters as well as their commitment to the child. Our powers in Clause 44 enable us to make regulations explicitly to require adoption agencies to consider any legal commitments between the prospective adopters, should that be considered appropriate following consultation. Only prospective adopters who can demonstrate that they have a stable and lasting relationship will be approved to adopt jointly.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para16"></a>I should also reinforce the point I made in the last group of amendments. We must ensure that we comment on the commitment of prospective adopters only in the context of their suitability to adopt jointly. What I do not want to do is pre-empt the outcome of the work that Government are carrying out on civil partnerships more generally; that goes much wider than our current discussions.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para17"></a>Although we anticipate the debate on married couples to which we shall return in a week's time, I am aware of the statistics which show that unmarried couples are more likely to part than married couples. That is why we have made it absolutely clear that in order to protect the adopted child the first stage will be for the assessment process thoroughly to examine the stability of the prospective adopters' relationship, <P>


<a name="column_GC219"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether they are married or unmarried, to minimise the chances of placing a child in a home which subsequently breaks up.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para18"></a>The second point is that should the House vote in favour of enabling unmarried couples to apply to adopt jointly, we would be interested in the legal relationship between the child and each of his adoptive parents and not in the formal and legal relationship between the adoptive parents themselves. Even if the adoptive parents split up, the child will still have a legal relationship with each of the adopters and the protection that goes with it and that provisions on financial relief in Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989, which provide for courts to order maintenance or lump sum payments by parents, will apply.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para19"></a>If the noble Lord's concerns go wider than that, they will be best addressed within the Government's more fundamental review of the adopter assessment process, or as part of our subsequent consultations on the regulations to be made under Clause 44.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para20"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 122B and 123. Amendment No. 122B seeks to insert a definition of "family" into Clause 139, which provides general interpretation. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, the definition he puts forward provides that a family means a group of one or more adults who have agreed to live together and support each other, together with any children concerned. It also provides that an enduring family relationship should be interpreted accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para21"></a>The definition means that more than two adults living together could be embraced within that definition, perhaps in some kind of commune. However, Clause 48 of the Bill is clear in providing that an application for an adoption order may be made only by a couple or one person.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para22"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 123 seeks to insert a definition of an "enduring family relationship" into Clause 139. The amendment provides that an enduring family relationship means a relationship in which the couple live together in the same house and have done so for at least the previous five years. It also provides that an "enduring family relationship" means that the partners have made and are willing to make a public and written declaration of their firm intention to continue to live in the relationship until separated by the death of one partner or else until the child attains the age of 18.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para23"></a>I know that the definitions inserted by the noble Lord are partly probing and perhaps the concern that the term "enduring family relationship" has not been used in previous legislation to define the relationship of an unmarried couple. This can in fact be helpful, as it ensures that the definition of an unmarried couple which would apply for the purposes solely of this Bill does not encroach or pre-empt the wider work on civil partnerships being carried out across Government.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para24"></a>I turn to the issue raised in relation to the definition of a couple and Amendment No. 122A, which inserts the term "sexual" before the term "partners" in the definition of a couple in subsection (4)(b) of Clause <P>


<a name="column_GC220"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>139. Again, I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is asking me to issue a denial here. The existence of a sexual relationship is not necessary for a couple to provide a stable and loving home for a child. Where no sexual relationship exists and there are no unresolved issues for the couple around this, it would have no bearing on the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para25"></a>Amendment No. 123C seeks to remove subsections (5) and (6) of Clause 139. Subsection (5) sets out a list of family members who are not included in the definition of a couple in subsection (4)(b). Subsection (6) provides that the reference to "relationship" in subsection (5) includes the relationships of the full or half blood. Where a person is adopted, they include relationships of the full or half blood with the adopted person's birth family. They also include the relationship of an adoptive parent with his adopted child or with his former adopted child, where that child has subsequently been re-adopted.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para26"></a>A key point about the definition of a "couple" that we have included in subsection (4) of Clause 139 is that it seeks to ensure that the position on eligibility to apply to adopt jointly for unmarried couples is as consistent as possible with the position of those who could marry and subsequently adopt as a married couple. The fact that a same-sex couple is unable to marry is overlooked, but other restrictions on marriage within families are taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para27"></a>Subsection (5) of Clause 139 makes clear that the definition of a couple in subsection (4) does not include a couple where one person is the other's parent, grandparent, sister, brother, aunt or uncle. These groups are unable to marry under the provisions of the Marriage Act. It is helpful to bear in mind that such relationships may not be stable and lifelong relationships that would provide a suitable family environment in which to bring up a child.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para28"></a>Perhaps I may give the Committee an example. It would be very difficult for two sisters to demonstrate that they have an enduring family relationship and are able to offer a secure environment for a child throughout his childhood. One or both sisters could at any stage meet a partner, and the nature of the sisters' relationship would immediately change. The effect on the child of such a situation could be very detrimental. That is why we have chosen to define "a couple" in this way, and to put such exclusions in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20704-30_para29"></a>I hope the explanations that I have given to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, are helpful. I believe that the debate has been extremely helpful to us in teasing out some of the tensions between trying to get the definitions right and as precise as possible and the problem of not allowing enough flexibility at the local level. This is the stuff of the consultation process that we need to embark upon over the next few months.

<P>

<a name="20704-30_para30"></a>As far as concerns consultation, it is the good old story that we hear every time that we are asked to pass a Bill in this place: we are asked to sign a blank cheque. I do not like that. I want to get as much information and as much commitment onto the statute book as I possibly can before we agree what is a very radical change&#151;adoption by couples. Adoption by couples is totally different from adoption by an individual in terms of the stability of the child. Equally, the fact that each parent has a financial relationship with the child is completely different from the situation in which the parents have a financial relationship to one another, as well as to the child. The difficulty is that the child is hurt just as much when the couple breaks up. However, if he has just one adoptive parent, that is the only parent to whom he is attached&#151;

<A NAME="20704-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. We are now anticipating next week's debate. As I said earlier, if a single person being considered as an adoptive parent is currently in a relationship, that relationship will be scrutinised and assessed by the adoption agency. The argument for extending the possibility of unmarried couples adopting is to provide greater stability and security for the child in those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20704-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I think I understand the Minister's point, but I do not believe that I agree. For example, if you adopt me, you are my dad and your partner is not my mum; but if both of you adopt me, then you are my dad and my mum. If both start splitting up, that is chaotic and destructive. I have said enough. I shall be returning to some of these points. However, our debate has been extremely helpful. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20704-31_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 70A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 70B. These amendments relate to parental rights at the time when an adoption order is made. The issues underlying them are a little complicated, but I shall do my best to explain them simply.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para7"></a>The Bill makes clear in Clause 19 that parental consent to placement and parental consent to adoption are quite separate decisions. They rest, or could rest, upon different considerations. A parent may consent to a placement on the basis that it will <P>


<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC222</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>offer long-term security for the child, and so obviate the need for further foster placements. However, he or she may wish to reserve his position on an adoption order. The adoption order is very final. It extinguishes the parents' parental rights and responsibilities and places the birth mother and father in the position of "former parents". Because the effects of an adoption order are so profound, I believe there is one important right of parents that needs to be protected in such circumstances; that is the right to be involved in the proceedings which will terminate those rights.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para8"></a>Unfortunately, there are situations envisaged by the Bill in which parents cannot count on being involved in those proceedings. Clause 46(3) holds that a parent who has given advance consent to the making of an adoption order may not subsequently oppose an adoption application without leave of the court. This raises some important legal issues. Advance consent given under Clause 19 is not subject to judicial scrutiny when it is given. It is a purely administrative process. To exclude parents who have given advance consent to adoption from taking part in subsequent adoption proceedings seems contrary to natural justice and may be contrary to the right to a fair trial and to family life under Articles 6 and 8 of the European convention.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para9"></a>Equally, Clause 46(5) holds that a parent who has consented to placement for adoption, or whose child is the subject of a placement order, may not oppose the making of an adoption order without leave of the court. As I have just indicated, the issues which arise when consent is given for placement (and when a placement order is made) are not the same as those which obtain when an adoption order is made. Consent under Clause 18 is, again, a non-judicial process. I am troubled by the thought that such parents may not be allowed to participate in the proceedings for an adoption order. We need to bear in mind what Clause 1 says about the considerations that the court must bear in mind when taking a decision. For example, Clause 1(4)(c) refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-31_para10"></a>Clause 1(4)(f) refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20704-31_para11"></a>and so on.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para12"></a>These are matters which the birth parents should have the right to pronounce upon. However, unless I have missed something, the Bill says that birth parents, who have previously given consent to a placement under a non-judicial process, should thereby be denied any standing in the decision-making process leading to the final adoption order unless the court holds otherwise.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para13"></a>Under Clause 1(6), the court is mandated to consider the range of orders under the Adoption and Children Bill and the Children Act 1989 when it is deciding an application to adopt. One of these options <P>


<a name="column_GC223"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is guardianship orders, which effectively provide a middle course between adoption and residence orders. As Clause 46 stands, parents who have previously given consent to placement or who have given advance consent to adoption, will have no automatic standing in the decision-making process which examines the full range of options for the child.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para14"></a>In summary, birth parents will, in certain circumstances, be excluded from the exercise which the court is obliged to carry out when it considers making an adoption order. The fact that the parents may have been party to the decision when advance consent was given&#151;and I emphasise again in a non-judicial process&#151; or when a placement order was made some time in the past should not affect the parents' rights to be involved in the most far-reaching decisions about their children. Those are decisions on whether their legal relationship with their children should be severed and on who will assume that legal role.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para15"></a>It is quite possible to envisage a situation where placement orders may have been made at a time when the adoptive parents have not been chosen by the adoption agency and the birth parents will have no general knowledge of who will take on the role which they lose on the making of the adoption order. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20704-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   These amendments moved by the noble Earl seek to make a significant change to the provisions in Clause 46, which cover the conditions under which a court may make an adoption order as a result of a placement for adoption. I shall not recap entirely the reasons why we have made the decisions we have as regards placement for consent as opposed to placement by order. We have the two routes with their birth parents giving consent to placement and, when consent is absent, the local authority securing a placement order. We have a history of that as it has been mediated over the past decade under discussion with the various agencies with the aim of producing a better and fairer adoption process and redistributing the responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para16"></a>Our central motivation was to ensure that the birth parents, far from being treated in an arbitrary fashion, should have every opportunity as early in the process as possible to have their wishes, needs and prospects considered when the child was being placed for adoption, with court involvement only necessary in the other circumstances. Our aim in dealing with much of the question of consent at the placement stage was designed to reduce the uncertainty and the contest in the final adoption stage. We have been advised that the current system leaves much to be resolved at the final stage, so we are looking for the four benefits that I have mentioned previously.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para17"></a>The first is to provide greater certainty and stability for children. The second is to minimise the uncertainty for prospective adopters, which, at the moment, means that they face the risk of a contested final adoption <P>


<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hearing. Once the issues have been resolved around placements, there are limits to the circumstances in which the final adoption order can be opposed, as the noble Earl has said. The third is to reduce the extent to which the birth families are faced with a fait accompli at the final adoption hearing, as the child has, by that time, been placed for a considerable period with the prospective adopters. The fourth is that we are looking to minimise the opportunities for rehearsing and revisiting many of the circumstances which would have made that placement successful without the threat of it being reversed for potentially frivolous reasons at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para18"></a>The provisions in Clause 46(4) set out what is to happen at the end of the process at the final adoption order hearing. They provide that the court can make an adoption order as a result of placement with consent under Clause 18, or a placement under a placement order, provided that no parent or guardian of the child opposes the making of that order.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para19"></a>As currently drafted, subsection (5) provides that the parents may oppose the making of the final order in these cases only if they have the leave of the court. Subsection (7) sets out that the court is to grant leave only if there has been a significant change of circumstances since either parental consent was given or the placement order was made. The effect of the noble Earl's amendments would be to remove the leave requirement in these agency cases. As now, a parent would be entirely free to contest the final adoption order, regardless of whether they had earlier given consent to placement, or a placement order had been made.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para20"></a>That would greatly increase the prospect of contested final adoption hearings. It would, at a stroke, remove what we are very serious about doing&#151;the main benefit for placed children and prospective adopters&#151;of removing that fundamental uncertainty that the birth parents are going to turn around and say, "We have changed our minds. We have gone through all this process, we have placed the child with consent, but now we have changed our minds". We feel that it must be important to be able to prove that there has been a significant change of circumstances in those situations that justify that change.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para21"></a>As I explained earlier, the current legal framework has been criticised because it leaves too much to be resolved of that order, and it also brings an additional sense of insecurity. By bringing forward the question of consent earlier in the process, we are creating opportunities at each stage for the birth parents to establish the implications of their decision, without threatening the adoptive parents at the very end of the stage with that being reversed on a whim, or simply for frivolous reasons.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para22"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the question of the judicial process. He suggested it was not compatible with the ECHR. We believe the Bill is certainly compatible with the ECHR and Article 6. In the case of placement with consent through adoption <P>


<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<B>4 Jul 2002 : Column GC225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agencies, the parents' consent will have to have been dealt with at the time of placement. If they do not consent, the only route open to them is to seek a placement order, and then there would be bound to be a court hearing. It is on those grounds that we believe the question of compatibility is resolved.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para23"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, also raised the question of how the court will get the birth parents' views when birth parents will have given consent to placement in advance. The court will still be able to obtain their views, either through the adoption agency report to the court&#151;so there will be no question that by giving advance consent they will lose any of their ability or their rights to put their views&#151;or they can through the agency of a CAFCASS officer report to a court even if the parents themselves cannot oppose the adoption order. There will be agencies for their views, whatever they are, to be made known to the courts.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para24"></a>If the noble Earl, Lord Howe, would prefer, I would be happy to write to him about those two specific points to make them absolutely clear. They are important in terms of process and those two particular instances.
<P>

<a name="20704-31_para25"></a>I return to the fact that the door is by no means shut because the essential point is that parents can contest the final adoption order. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, is absolutely right to say that there is a difference between a placement order and an adoption order. It is because of that importance, and because it is difficult to take this particular aspect of the process out of context from everything that has gone before, that parents need to demonstrate there has been the kind of change of circumstance that could conceivably justify reopening the decisions which have been assumed in good faith to have been taken earlier on the basis of full knowledge. That way, the provisions will give a much greater sense of security and stability for the adoptive placement in advance of the final adoption order being given.

<A NAME="20704-32_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, which I find partially reassuring. I am not prepared to say that I find it wholly reassuring. If the Minister would kindly write to me on the matters I raised, I should be grateful, and I will of course read carefully what she has said. I am very much in favour of the central premise of this part of the Bill, which is to remove as much uncertainty as possible from the process at as early a stage as possible and thereby create stability and certainty for all parties.
<P>

<a name="20704-32_para0"></a>However, I am very uneasy at the thought that where birth parents have a legitimate point of view to express at the final stage when their relationship with their own child will be severed they cannot, for whatever reason, express that view directly. I think that that is potentially a very serious state of affairs. The noble Baroness said there would be mechanisms for the birth parents to be able to make their views known in an indirect fashion, and that I appreciate. I shall have to think very carefully about whether I regard that as adequate in the circumstances. It is perhaps a matter for reflection between now and Report stage on my part as much as on the part of the Government. In the meantime, in thanking the Minister once again, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20704w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  While recognising and accepting the independence of the component parts of the criminal justice system, the Government have a whole-system approach to provide clear strategic direction for the criminal justice system and to encourage closer working. The CJS business plan sets out system-wide aims, objectives and targets to which all CJS organisations work.
<P>

<a name="20704w01_para0"></a>To oversee the delivery of the Government's policies for the management and reform of the CJS, a Ministerial Committee on the Criminal Justice System has been set up, chaired by the Home Secretary. Ministers are advised by a recently established strategic board, made up of the most senior officials from across the CJS organisations and chaired by the Home Office Permanent Secretary. Other trilateral boards have been created to focus on CJS performance, resourcing and planning. This process of working together has helped highlight where policy and process change is needed, both within the individual organisations and across the CJS. The Government do not wish to deflect effort on direct service delivery improvements by going for major departmental reorganisations.
<P>

<a name="20704w01_para1"></a>To encourage closer trilateral working, the 2000 spending review introduced the CJS Reserve&#151;&#163;525 million over three years (&#163;200 million in 2002&#150;03)&#151;that is jointly managed by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General. This reserve is used to fund initiatives which contribute to jointly agreed objectives. It provides CJS Ministers with funding flexibility and the ability to respond to changing pressures on the system.

Since the 2001 estimate and leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&#163;11 million), there has been a real cost increase of &#163;25 million. This increase derives principally from additional costs associated with dockyard projects and with missiles and related equipment, offset by a reduced acquisition cost for the four submarines. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 2001 represented over 98 per cent of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;14,376 million.
<P>

<a name="20704w01_para7"></a>The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over
&#163;3.7 billion at current prices.
<P>

<a name="20704w01_para8"></a>The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20704w01_para9"></a>Three in-service Vanguard class submarines are successfully maintained continuous at-sea deterrence, with the fourth, HMS Vanguard, now undergoing planned major overhaul.<br><br>

<A NAME="20704w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Kilclooney  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the European Union has advised the Greek Cypriot leadership that Cyprus can join the European Union without any settlement with, or approval of, the Turkish Cypriot administered Turkish Republic of Cyprus; and, if so, whether such a guarantee would be likely to encourage a settlement in the present inter-communal talks in Nicosia.[HL4862]<P></UL>

<A NAME="20704w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The UK is fully committed to the 1999 Helsinki Conclusions, which were reaffirmed at the Seville European Council, and which remain the basis of the EU's position on Cyprus. Helsinki stated that ''The European Council underlines that a political settlement will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council's decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition.

<P>
<A NAME="20704w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The Seville European Council reaffirmed that Malta is one of 10 candidates expected to complete negotiations for EU accession by the end of 2002 if the present rate of progress in negotiations and reforms is maintained. It is reasonable to expect Malta to sign the Treaty of Accession in spring 2003 and participate as a full member in the European Parliament elections in 2004.

<A NAME="20704w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy and Construction has announced today that the White Paper Managing the Nuclear Legacy&#151;A Strategy for Action is being published today. Copies are available in the Library and the Printed Paper Office.
<P>

<a name="20704w02_para0"></a>The White Paper sets out plans for radical change to current arrangements for the clean up of the public sector civil nuclear legacy, including the creation of a new body, the liabilities management authority, responsible to government and with a specific remit to ensure that clean up is carried out safely, securely, cost-effectively and in ways which protect the environment for the benefit of current and future generations. It makes clear the Government's determination to drive clean up forward systematically and progressively, using the best available skills to get the job done and, through competition, to promote the development of the supply chain and skills base required to sustain the clean up programme over the long term. It also underlines our commitment to ensuring that management arrangements are open, transparent and command public confidence. Implementing legislation will be brought forward at the first available opportunity.

<a name="20704w02_para1"></a>In the interim, a Liabilities Management Unit (LMU) has been established in the DTI to drive forward the clean-up work and to prepare the ground for the LMA. Membership of the LMU is drawn from the private and public sectors. The appointment of Bechtel as partner contractor adds international experience to the LMU, reflecting the Government's intention to ensure that the best skills are brought to bear on legacy clean up.
<P>

<a name="20704w02_para2"></a>In line with the commitment to openness and transparency, the Government have consulted widely with stakeholders in the preparation of the White Paper and would welcome views on the proposed new arrangements and the way in which they should be implemented. Views should be submitted to the DTI by 18 October. Contact details are provided in the White Paper.

A public inquiry into the application was held in 1997, following which further detailed representations were made. After careful consideration we have decided to accept the inspector's recommendation and, with the agreement of the National Assembly for Wales, make the order.

This investment is included in the overall National Health Service investment for implementing the Cancer Plan. How the &#163;50 million is deployed locally will depend on the needs of the area. Cancer networks have drawn up service delivery plans on palliative care to review the level of services offered in their area and these will ensure that each network has a range of palliative care services available. We are currently reviewing the outturn position for 2001&#150;02 and the progress in that year.

<a name="20704w02_para3"></a>The National Service Framework for CHD published in March 2000 set an immediate priority that by April 2002 the total number of revascularisation procedures, over the 1999&#150;2000 baseline, would increase by 3,000. More than 8,000 extra procedures had been carried out by April 2002.

<P>

<a name="20704w02_para5"></a>It would not be appropriate for the Department of Health to pre-empt the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) by issuing interim guidance. The absence of guidelines from NICE does not prevent the NHS using new drugs or technologies. Standing guidance to the NHS (Health Service Circular 1999/176) asks NHS bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the new technology first becomes available.
