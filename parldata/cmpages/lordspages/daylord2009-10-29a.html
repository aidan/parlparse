What is more reassuring is that HMRC collects all but 1 per cent of tax due. Of the 1 per cent that is not collected, 90 per cent is due to business insolvency. That is an extraordinarily good record of debt recovery, which most businesses would find hard to match.</p>

We have been particularly vigilant in our dealings with the banking sector in this respect because some of the most invidious forms of tax avoidance are those associated with, and perpetrated or facilitated by, major banks. We are also extremely alert to areas in which tax codes and rules can be improved in order to reduce the risk of unintended consequences.</p>

Some 65,000 claimants received letters saying that they would have to repay major overpayments.

Have we not spent years talking about simplification? The problem is that while we all say that it is a good thing, we never do anything about it.</p>

The tax system and the benefit system are both complicated, but that is the consequence of targeted policies that try to ensure that we raise taxes in a fair and proportionate way and that we focus benefits on the most needy. The need to get good value for money and to preserve focus needs to be counterbalanced with the fact that there are some consequences in terms of complexity. I am not sure that any government will ever get it perfectly right, but the message of my noble friend is one with which I have much sympathy.</p>

Again, we are drawing on the experience both of the private sector in its management of debt recovery as well as that of tax agencies elsewhere. I have found HMRC to be an innovative and customer-focused organisation that is constantly seeking to improve its performance.</p>

We hope that the El Niño rains that have started to fall will help to make this drought something that passes relatively quickly but, as the noble Baroness rightly says, under climate change those activities that are to our disadvantage will be more frequent in future. We hope that Copenhagen will produce an agreement to put additional finances into climate change. We believe it is important that we do not abandon the African continent and its fight against poverty and for health and education by diverting money from the ODA and to climate change. That is why the Prime Minister is seeking &#163;100 billion from the Copenhagen summit, and today at the EU he will be pressing for support in that regard, as set out in his speech on 20 September.</p>

DfID has also provided &#163;35 million to the productive safety net programme in Ethiopia, which provides food and cash transfers to more than 7 million vulnerable people.

There is no other reason, and they will certainly be available by the end of the year. Work is still continuing. As for witness statements&#151;I do not want to get this wrong, so I shall read it&#151;a witness statement recorded by a member of An Garda Siochana may be used in committal proceedings in Northern Ireland, providing that it complies with certain requirements of Article 33 of the Magistrates' Courts Order 1981. Evidence of a confession made to a member of An Garda Siochana may be admitted in proceedings in Northern Ireland, unless the court considers that this would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. That is the clear position. The procedural manual will ensure that people are better able to implement the law as it stands.</p>

One of the most remarkable things that has happened in Northern Ireland over the past 15 years is the way in which north-south co-operation, which was previously very controversial, is now uncontroversial and largely accepted on both sides of the community. The one exception is this area where we have not been able to demonstrate mutual benefit. Therefore, does the Minister accept that, in view of the controversy surrounding devolution of policing and justice, it is vital that both Governments redouble their efforts to ensure that we deliver to citizens on both sides of the border real progress in this area?</p>

I know that there is a great deal of experience here. He asks what led to the decision. In part it was the improved recruitment to the Regular Army, which is more than 1,000 up on last year. Land Forces decided that, because of those pressures, this was something that it would look at. It made recommendations up to Ministers, but Ministers of course accept the responsibility for the decisions that were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09102929000054"></a>The TA has played a very significant role in Afghanistan: 540 TA members are deployed there at the moment, and we have had over 15,000 deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. So there is no doubt about the contribution that has been made. I think it important to remember that, in all of those discussions, it was made absolutely clear that no one who was going to be deployed would have other than the full training that they needed prior to deployment.</p>

It is important that those who are in the TA have all the benefits of all of the support mechanisms that we now know are necessary for all of those who serve in the Armed Forces. Whether the people who have served come back well or have been injured, or their families need support, or mental health problems arise later, we have learned a great deal in recent years about how to improve the service that we give to our personnel. The TA, and indeed all reservists, should have the same entitlements. We endeavour to make sure that that is the case.</p>

I also put on record my thanks for the leadership shown by the Leader of the House and the Lord Speaker in carrying this forward. It is because of that leadership that we have had, at this end of this building, a welcome absence of political point-scoring while we tried to go through this process. A year ago I said that the rules governing this House were vaguely drawn and lightly policed. That light-touch regulation produced one of the cheapest and most cost-effective legislatures in the world. However, we all recognised that things could not stay as they were. The Eames report is one more example of the determination of this House to put our house in order. This House does a good job, and this report&#151;and the SSRB study that we will receive very soon&#151;is an exercise in improvement, not in collective punishment. In that spirit, I welcome the report, promise full co-operation from these Benches and again record my thanks to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames, and his colleagues.</p>

First, I have not read the report, and therefore am unable to join all the leaders in saying that I welcome it&#151;I would prefer to read the report before welcoming it, because I might not welcome it. Secondly, did I understand my noble friend the Leader of the House to say that when it comes to be debated in the House, it will be on the basis of whether we accept it or not? My own judgment&#151;given the soundings I have been taking on a whole range of suggestions to do with our future&#151;is that it would be much better if we had a Take Note debate on this report, so that we could listen to each others&#146; views on the matter, and then come back to a more controversial debate in which we might amend or not. Given the other pressures that have come on to us from other reports, a Take Note debate would be an ideal way of finding out their Lordships&#146; views on this subject.</p>

When he has read it, he might then think that a Take Note Motion is not the most appropriate one, but we will discuss that among our colleagues and the usual channels, and we will come back to the House on that.</p>

I shall try to explain in a few words why I intend to take this course.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09102929000084"></a>These amendments would establish a statutory framework for regulating damages-based agreements. They are not currently permitted in court proceedings and these amendments do not seek to change this. These agreements are, however, commonly used by solicitors and claims managers in some tribunal proceedings, primarily proceedings before the employment tribunal.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09102929000085"></a>I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, for taking the time yesterday to discuss with my officials his and other noble Lords&#146; concerns. As a consequence, I shall seek the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment in due course.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09102929000086"></a>The primary intention of the amendments is to ensure consumer protection of claimants. We know from recent research that a significant number of claimants in employment cases who sign up to a damages-based agreement are not given proper information by their representatives. This lack of information covers alternative funding which may be available, such as through a trade union or a legal expenses insurance policy. Claimants are also not fully informed about the costs, such as experts&#146; and counsels&#146; fees, which they may nevertheless have to pay&#151;notwithstanding that they have signed a no-win no-fee agreement. It is right to legislate to introduce regulation to protect consumers.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09102929000087"></a>I understand that some noble Lords were concerned at the extent of the amendments as drafted. We are listening to those concerns, and propose to withdraw or not move these amendments at this stage, with a view to bringing back at Third Reading redrafted amendments, which will be narrower in scope and limited to the regulation of damages-based agreements in respect of employment claims which may go to the employment tribunal. I hope in this way that we can meet the concerns that have been raised by noble Lords, while ensuring from the outset the consumer protection of vulnerable claimants in employment cases. I beg to move.</p>

We have shared the concerns to which he referred and consider that the proposals as currently drafted are wide and could capture areas which the Government would not wish to. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, has taken a leading part in dealing with this matter and I hope that when we see the redrawn clauses our concerns will be met. I am pleased to note, for example that the Minister says that damages-based agreements will be restricted to the proceedings in

I, too, was concerned and had discussions with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. I agreed with the points that he made that the amendment would have an effect much wider than the one that the Minister outlined.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09102929000090"></a>We are all aware of a timely review of costs conducted by Lord Justice Jackson, which has been welcomed on all sides of the House. Will the Minister consider not taking this matter further until the report has been received and carefully considered&#151;as his ministerial colleagues have indicated that it will be? In the light of the concerns, and as the review is still under way&#151;I understand that it will be completed shortly&#151;we urge the Government to hold on until the report is published; and, if they are minded to bring the matter back, we will consider it in the light of the review and following wider consultation. These are important areas where we must proceed step by step to ensure the maximum level of consumer protection.</p>

I say straight away to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that we need to legislate urgently on this and will bring back amendments at Third Reading, which I hope to share with noble Lords in good time. We will see where we go from there. The suitable course now is for me to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We were not satisfied with the Government&#146;s response to similar amendments that were tabled in Committee. We continued to be concerned that the Government&#146;s proposals to enable court proceedings to be brought to recover royalties and fees earned by criminals from books, articles, films et cetera were not a proportionate response to a pressing social need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09102929000093"></a>Soon after we tabled the amendments on Report, the Government tabled amendments to modify their proposals in Part 7. First, they seek to reduce the scope of their proposals by confining them to indictable offences. Secondly, they seek to remove the test of offensiveness to the general public from considerations to be taken into account by the court when an exploitation proceeds order is sought. What remains for consideration by the court, if the Government&#146;s amendments are   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1282"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accepted, is any offensiveness to the victim or the victim&#146;s family from the offender receiving payments from a book, article et cetera.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09102929000094"></a>The amendments proposed by the Government are welcome, particularly because proceedings could not now be based on a media-led populist appeal to public outrage. All along, the Government have said that the new provisions would be exercised only sparingly. In the light of that assertion, and the amendments now proposed by the Government, noble Lords are entitled to ask: why seek the new powers at all? They ignore existing powers to deal with criminal memoirs and necessarily involve limitations on freedom of expression. Therefore, they are doubtfully compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;a matter on which my colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, will speak. These proposals introduce a large discretionary power for the Attorney-General and, if a court action is brought, discretion for the judge. This must leave anyone acting as an adviser to a potential author, and indeed the author himself or herself, in a state of considerable uncertainty as to whether the law would apply.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09102929000095"></a>The Government&#146;s answer is that sometimes real pain is caused to the victim or the victim&#146;s family from the offender being able to profit by exploiting his offence for personal gain. But these proposals are bound to have what I call a chilling effect on any attempt by an offender to express himself, including publications or artistic work that may of course be very helpful in assisting his rehabilitation. It is not as though our present law on criminal memoirs is non-existent. There is the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the full implications of which have not yet been pursued sufficiently to see its advantage in extreme cases. The prison rules, enabling confiscation of memoirs by anyone serving a prison sentence, were upheld by the Court of Appeal in the case of Dennis Nilsen as being in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights. Because Dennis Nilsen is serving a life tariff&#151;he has already served 26 years in prison&#151;there will never be a time when the Government&#146;s proposals could apply in his case. He will never be a free man able freely to engage in publishing memoirs. The same point could be made about Ian Brady, the Moors murderer, who is also serving a full life tariff.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09102929000096"></a>Then there are cases at the other end of the spectrum where there are no obvious victims whose outrage could form the basis for an exploitation proceeds order. In the recent case, which your Lordships may have read about during the Summer Recess, John Darwin the canoeist faked his own death so that he and his wife could live in Panama on insurance payouts. He profited from newspaper articles and was given a jail sentence of eight years for fraud. It seems that the proposed legislation can hardly apply to what is sometimes called a victimless crime. When you take all these things into account, surely the Government have a real question to answer. What is the value, use and worth of Part 7 of the Bill, with its 15 pages of proposed legislation? Part 7 can achieve very little for the victims of crime in whose name it is promoted, but it could have a number of damaging consequences, and it is doubtfully compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.</p>

As the Minister has already discovered, the problem is in the detail of how to do it without slipping into undesirable censorship. I make the point in passing that if we had a similar rule for newspapers publicising these sorts of crimes, most of the articles would not be published. After looking at yesterday&#146;s reporting of the poor  17 year-old girl who was killed as a result of an internet connection, one could well argue, as I suspect some of her friends and family may, that the detail and description given in the articles was undesirable and unacceptable. Of course, newspapers profit from that, so there is a delicate line here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09102929000098"></a>I leave that to one side because the important question relates to how we draft legislation in such a way that does not stop the release of good books and films. The Minister will know that this goes back to the publication of a book by Gitta Sereny about the Mary Bell case. I think that it was a good and important book because it explained a lot about why children kill. However, the media storm around it developed into a suggestion for legislation of this type. There is a case for it because there are examples of acute distress being caused to victims by people exploiting the horror of what they have done.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09102929000099"></a>At this stage, I would ask the Minister to look at the degree of flexibility available. I know why he moved to the indictable offence factor as a way of trying to judge the seriousness of the issue, but I am troubled by the fact that that also catches other people. In other circumstances, I mentioned to him the book by John Healey, a recovered alcoholic. It is the only book I know that was written by someone who was a vagrant alcoholic for some 15 years, who came off the drink and published a book that won an autobiographical prize and became a Channel 4 film that also won awards. Like most vagrant alcoholics, he has many convictions, most of which were petty&#151;being drunk and disorderly and so on&#151;but among them were several indictable offences.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09102929000100"></a>That book would not have been written if ultimately some payment had not been involved because it helped his development and it helped the development of the film that won the award. As I have indicated, it was also an important book in describing the process by which a person becomes a vagrant alcoholic and the processes by which they can abandon that position. It therefore has an important element. We have talked about the well-known cases of Mary Bell, Dennis Nilsen and so on. But, thinking about it, the book by Jean Genet, the French author, would probably never have been published.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09102929000101"></a>We therefore have to think carefully about this aspect, and I have a solution for the Minister. I understand the dilemma of getting this right. I wonder whether we could do more on the rights of the victim. The Government have introduced legislation in other areas where the victim has a greater say in what happens in sentencing. Without overriding the court, their views  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1284"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can be heard and considered. I am not sure whether in this case there is not an area where we can say that there must be some identifiable person with a genuine interest&#151;a friend, relative or whoever&#151;who needs to express concern before the process can be triggered. In other words, the process would start only if you had a person saying, &#147;I find this just too painful&#148;.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09102929000102"></a>I repeat for the benefit of the media that they need to think very hard about how they approach these things. If we introduce such a law for the media, most of the stories about violent crimes will not be reported. Although I do not like the way that they report crime, I have to say that that would be a serious mistake. The same applies to books and films. I ask the Minister to look again at the way in which we trigger this process. That is important. If we have a blanket provision of indictable offences, for example, I am almost sure that John Healey&#146;s book, <I>The Grass Arena</I>, and the Channel 4 film based on it, as well as books by people such as Jean Genet would not be published.</p>

I shall concentrate on why I consider that the Bill is not fit for purpose because Part 7 does not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Before I do that, perhaps I may say how much I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Soley, has just said. The concerns that he expressed are very important and place this House in something of a dilemma, because we are faced today with the problem that Part 7 was not properly debated in the other place&#151;which is a matter of great regret&#151;that we are the scrutineers and the revising Chamber, and that, plainly, Part 7 as it stands is not satisfactory. Somehow we need to try to stimulate the Government to reflect on what the noble Lord, Lord Soley, and others have said.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09102929000104"></a>First, I thank the Minister and his advisers for having met the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and me to discuss the possibilities of Amendments 106A and 107A, which I tabled in the hope&#151;foolish optimist that I am&#151;that there might be some way of making Part 7 convention-compliant. I am grateful for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09102929000105"></a>One of the points that Her Majesty's Official Opposition make in their scepticism about aspects of the Human Rights Act is that it does not allow Parliament to do its job sufficiently and leaves too much to the courts to repair legislation enacted by us. I have some sympathy with that, even though I think that I am one of the architects of the Human Rights Act. It has come to be seen as an easy get-out for Governments, who can simply say, &#147;The courts have an obligation to read and give effect to legislation if they possibly can to make it convention-compliant, so it does not really matter if the legislation enacted does not really get it right on its face&#148;. One of the attractive points made by the Opposition is that it is really important for Parliament to do the best it can to pass legislation that is fit for purpose in being convention-compliant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09102929000106"></a>Yesterday evening, in a short debate on Section 5 of the Public Order Act, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, perfectly correctly referred to the fact that the European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 10(1) of the convention, the free speech guarantee, applies,</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1285"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09102929000361"></a>&#147;not only to ideas that are favourably received, or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/10/09; col. 1190.]</ul>
<p><a name="09102929000269"></a>That is the starting point for Article 10. There is a right to freedom of expression which can be interfered with only where there is legal certainty and necessity&#151;proportionality. I am sure that that is common ground and that Ministers would not dissent from that basic position. There is also the right to property, the right to the peaceful enjoyment of one&#146;s possessions in Article 1 of protocol 1.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09102929000107"></a>The Explanatory Notes to the Bill, although they do not explain why the Government think that the provisions are convention-compliant, repeat the fact that they think that they are convention-compliant. I do not understand how a Minister could have been advised to come to that view. In the first place, the criteria in the Bill, which the court will be expected to exercise, are not only incommensurable&#151;you cannot weigh one properly against the other for the reasons explained in our previous debate&#151;but they are so vague that, even without the &#147;offence to the public&#148; provision, which will now happily be removed if Part 7 stands, as to have the chilling effect to which the noble Lords, Lord Soley and Lord Borrie, have referred. Therefore, the first vice in these provisions is that they are vague and lack legal certainty. That would be quite enough to cause the European Court of Human Rights to say that they are in breach of Article 10.</p>

<a name="91029-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09102929000108"></a>Secondly, they also sweep too broadly; they are disproportionate. The Minister will no doubt say in his reply that all that may be, but it is for the judge to make sure under the Human Rights Act that the provisions of Part 7 can be read and given effect in a way that cures the vices of legal uncertainty and overbreadth. The courts cannot cure the vice of lack of legal certainty. That vice can be corrected only by Parliament. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, has repeatedly pointed out, it is quite wrong to use the Human Rights Act, which I strongly favour, as a substitute for proper legislation. The safeguards have to be in the Bill.</p>

Obviously, the Minister will wish to explain whether he is willing to accept that or something very similar to it. It is important that we know that. It is also important to know whether there is any Strasbourg case that Ministers can point to in this debate that supports their belief that this satisfies either legal certainty or proportionality in the context we are talking about. I know of no basis in Strasbourg case law that could possibly support a view that these provisions as they stand are convention compliant. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us because the legal advice he will have received about why it is compatible will surely have pointed to whether there are any Strasbourg cases&#151;I bet there are not&#151;and I reserve the right, if  I may, having heard that to reply to him later in the debate. I hope that when the official Opposition come to decide what to do they will join those of us who want to get legislation passed that is fit for purpose

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09102929000112"></a>Genet, who was born in 1910, was a social outcast who, as a novelist, transformed erotic and even obscene subjects into what has been called a poetic vision of the world. He began his life of crime as a child. His mother abandoned him to the care of the assistance publique. He lived in state institutions and spent five years in the notorious reform school at Mettray. There he lived through the degrading experiences that were later described in his novel, <I>Miracle of the Rose</I>, in which he pondered the meaning of imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09102929000113"></a>After deserting from the Foreign Legion, he wandered around Europe, to be charged in various countries with vagrancy, theft, and homosexuality, which was then a crime. Here it may be apposite to say that Genet&#146;s obscene or pornographic work is never gratuitous or designed to excite or titillate. Much of it explores man&#146;s solitude and the meaning of shame and abjection.</p>

Under French law, automatic life imprisonment ensued after 10 convictions and, when Genet was convicted of burglary for the tenth time, Gide, Sartre and Cocteau, among others, successfully petitioned the President of the Republic for his reprieve and release.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09102929000115"></a>Genet subsequently wrote a poem that praised criminals&#146; values and in which a prison cell becomes a centre for dreams and meditations. His autobiography, <I>The Thief&#146;s Journal</I>, followed. This, about his youth and what he called a forbidden universe, is a prime example of the kind of memoirs that we are talking about here&#151;a convicted criminal profiting from the publication of a record of his experiences.</p>

This absolutely applied to Genet, who is a fine example of what redemption can achieve if not by imprisonment then by writing about the prison experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09102929000117"></a>In 1966, Genet largely gave up writing and spent his time giving lectures and supporting various radical causes. Concern for the victims of criminals is a theme that runs through this Bill, although the victims are not to recover compensation. To return to my own theme, those who suffered from Genet&#146;s crimes were mostly the people from whom he stole. I do not know whether any of them believed that his large output of distinguished literary work compensated them, but I do not see how anyone could be injured by the work itself. I can, however, see the damage that may be caused by censorship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09102929000118"></a>If kleptomania exists, it looks as though Genet suffered from it&#151;some pathological condition that impelled him to steal. For a story is told that he was so addicted to theft that he stole diamonds from his hostess while at a literary party. Such a condition may well be true of many compulsive thieves whose early lives were as tragic as Genet&#146;s. This is a matter only for speculation, as is the possibility that what Genet wrote may have been restrained if, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has put it, he had come under the dampening effect of measures such as these.</p>

I should like to say how grateful I am to all those involved in trying to deal with this part of the Bill who have taken it so seriously, and to outside organisations, such as English PEN and the Howard League for Penal Reform, which have worked hard to set out and explain to the wider world why this is such a flawed proposal.</p>

Why did the Government want to put this into the Bill? I am aware that there were consultations here and in Scotland, but it is clear that very small numbers responded. Most people who work in offender rehabilitation have never heard of these consultations, although presumably that was their fault because they would have been on a website somewhere.</p>

He told me that there were 24 responses to the consultation, including two from victims&#146; organisations, not including Victim Support, and one from a relative of a crime victim. I got a clue about from where this might have come from reading the equivalent Scottish documentation and I thank the Minister for the information about Scotland included in his letter of 14 October to those who had spoken in Committee. The Scottish material talks about preventing &#147;defamation of murder victims&#148;. I began to see that a sensible germ of an idea was at the basis of all this. It is clear that defamation of

The noble Lord, Lord Soley, made that point very helpfully. However, it is not at all clear how we got from murder victims to all indictable offences and from books to all forms of artistic expression. When confronted with one or two bad examples of offensive behaviour, the Government have a tendency to look for a new law that aims to prevent it and stretches more widely to encompass a huge range of behaviour. But this measure must be the most dramatic example of that genre&#151;if I can use that word.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09102929000122"></a>In his letter of 14 October, if I understand him correctly, the Minister says, as consolation, that the scheme does not prevent publication of any material. It prevents only the author keeping the money earned by it. The letter suggests that the books I mentioned by ex-prisoners give valuable insights into imprisonment and prison reform and that they could still be published, but that the authors would not be able to keep the money they made. From a Government who are committed to offender rehabilitation, this approach is absurd.</p>

Has the Minister or any Minister from the Ministry of Justice been across the river to the South Bank to see this year&#146;s Koestler exhibition of art by offenders, an exhibition curated by six women offenders on release from Downview prison? It is a quite outstanding display which demonstrates the value of the arts in the rehabilitation of offenders. The arts do not necessarily contribute to the prevention of reoffending as such but, by encouraging and developing the self-esteem of the person engaged in the activity, they encourage them to become involved in the education, training and work education that may lead to their being able to live a law-abiding and useful life. They therefore have a very pertinent part to play in encouraging the development of offenders.</p>

The impact has not been properly thought through. As the small print of the Bill reveals, it could have an impact on organisations that are involved in the delivery of arts to offenders&#151;which is part of protecting the public. My strong recommendation, therefore, is that this whole part of the Bill should be withdrawn and rethought because it really is a sledgehammer to crack a small nut. I believe that the nut can be cracked in a much more effective way.</p>

I do not pretend to have even a fragment of the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in the matter of the human rights implications of the proposal, so I neither can nor should address it, but what I would like the Minister to explain is this. In what way will the legislation address the harm that it seeks to redress? Perhaps I have misunderstood it, but the legislation addresses only those circumstances in which prisoners or ex-offenders are paid for the work they produce. It seems possible, at least in principle, that someone could publish work that has the capacity to offend or distress victims or their families and not be paid for it, but the distress and harm would be exactly as if the writer had been paid. I cannot see how the linking of distress and harm to victims and their families&#151;which is something we certainly should be concerned about&#151;with payment in any way seriously allows the mitigation of that harm to be achieved.</p>

<a name="09102929000128"></a><b><a name="91029-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09102929000619"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his lengthy letter of 14 October, which sets out in greater detail the Government&#146;s thinking on this issue. However, having read it and listened to the powerful comments and questions put by Members of your Lordships&#146; House today, I think that the Government should take away and rethink the set of clauses dealing with this issue.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09102929000129"></a>The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Soley, is powerful because the question of the trigger is the essential one, but it is far from clear in the Bill. Perhaps I may cite the Minister&#146;s letter where he talks about seeking the consent of the Attorney-General, who will weigh up matters of public interest. Although the Government have now tabled an amendment to address the issue of public distaste, the Attorney-General will nevertheless have to weigh up something when a case is put before her. The Minister then goes on to talk about how the court will have,</p>
<ul><a name="09102929000362"></a>&#147;wide discretion as to whether or not to impose an order, taking account of a number of factors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102929000270"></a>Lengthy arguments will arise in court where offenders will no doubt have great difficulty representing themselves&#151;we have not touched on this issue&#151;but what it comes down to is the chilling effect spoken about by many noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09102929000130"></a>The Minister&#146;s letter does not give any sound examples of what drove the Government to introduce this provision. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, asked why that is so, but none of the examples quoted in the four pages of the Minister&#146;s letter really answers the question. The Minister will recall that he quoted the case of Nick Leeson. That, as the noble Lord mentioned, is clearly a victimless crime for the purposes of this Bill. If that case informed some of the thinking behind these

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09102929000131"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell of Babergh, made a powerful point. There is no doubt that, as I mentioned, there will be a chilling effect, even when this is never going to come to court because the books or works of art will never be produced. That is something that we need to worry about.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09102929000132"></a>This is not adequately drafted. No doubt there are other approaches and solutions that would not have this effect. We are unhappy with the way that these clauses are drafted.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09102929000133"></a>The book <I>Cries </I><I>Unheard</I>, which was one of the major reasons why the Government moved down this road, was written by someone else. The Government do not address at all the issue of books written by someone else, and although I gather Mary Bell received a payment for it&#151;we have never seen any evidence of that, but she may have received a payment&#151;this would not prevent someone else writing about a crime. This catches only the person who has written themselves about their crime, which leaves a bit of a gap if the Government are trying to prevent the victims from suffering more.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09102929000134"></a>For all the reasons that we have heard today, we shall be supporting these amendments.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09102929000136"></a>I shall briefly set out the Opposition&#146;s point. We accept that people who have committed awful crimes should not be allowed to profit from that crime by selling their story, so there is some merit in what the Government propose. We also note, and this is relevant in this House, that it is a matter that was promised in their manifesto at the last election. The Minister nods.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09102929000137"></a>Having said that, it is also important to remember the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that Part 7 was hardly discussed in another place. It is unfortunate, when a new crime&#151;and this is a new crime&#151;or a new procedure is being added to the statute book, if these matters are not properly discussed in another place as well as in this House. I hope that the Minister can comment on that. It is obviously rather late in the day for that to be rectified, but procedures are such that the Government should ensure that these matters are properly discussed.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09102929000138"></a>In some respects we are slightly more supportive of the Government. We note that nothing in these provisions actually prevents publication. We do not think that there is an infringement of free speech. In fact, free speech is not the issue; we are talking about paid speech. I dare say that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will correct me if I am wrong on this, but there is  no human right to be paid for saying or writing what  you wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09102929000139"></a>The clauses in the Bill allow an application to be made for profits or benefits to be confiscated. A court may hear an application for an order&#151;</p>

The answer is that it is not just the right to communicate with the public; any impediment&#151;for example, a tax on free speech, newsprint or costs&#151;or any other burden upon free speech implicates Article 10. That is accepted in the Explanatory Notes. I think the Government will accept that there is an issue under Article 10 of the convention, as well as on the right to property.</p>

I think the Minister will accept that it is still possible to publish; there is just the impediment that he referred to that the individual cannot be paid for it. He might remember what Dr Johnson said about people not writing for money, which has some bearing on that. If he does not know the quotation, I think the great doctor said, &#147;No one but a blockhead ever wrote but for money&#148;. I can have that corrected if I have got it slightly wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09102929000142"></a>A court may hear an application for an order only if it has been authorised by the Attorney-General. We have voiced doubts at times about the Government&#146;s proposals, but we accept that checks, balances and safeguards are built into the process. It is not simply a grabbing exercise but what we trust could be a carefully targeted system that would deny offenders convicted of some of the worst crimes the opportunity to profit from their misdeeds.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09102929000143"></a>Having said that, we await assurances from the Government on a number of points. Clearly there are people who have reformed or are reforming and who make a positive virtue out of their past offences. An ex-convict who draws on his experiences to make critiques of penal policy, or who writes about their experiences as a warning to others, should not, under any reading of these clauses, be swooped on by the enforcement authorities. When determining the application, the court will be mindful of such requirements in Clause 151(3). We have asked the Minister to confirm that. We think that these orders should be applicable only in the case of the most serious offences. Again, we would like to have some confirmation to that effect.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09102929000144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, has proposed Amendments 106A and 107A, which would put in the Bill a direct reference to the convention rights. No doubt the noble Lord might intervene again, but while he has made a good point, in our view it is an unnecessary one; as I understand it, the courts have to make their decisions in the light of the convention in all cases. His amendments are therefore unnecessary.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09102929000145"></a>It is clear to the Government that there is significant opposition to the clauses in the Bill. However, we have endorsed the principle behind them, and we look now for assurances from the Government to the House that they have struck the right balance between protecting the right to free speech and the rights of victims and

For that reason, we cannot support the amendments but we will leave it to others in this House to decide what they wish to do with them. We want further assurances from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09102929000147"></a>We have not changed our view that it is wrong for a criminal to cash in by exploiting the story of his or her crime, especially in cases where the offence has already inflicted immense suffering on victims and their families. We felt so strongly on this point of principle that we included a commitment to legislate in this area in the Labour Party&#146;s 2005 election manifesto.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09102929000148"></a>Earlier this month I wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, giving details about those offenders who had prompted public debate after receiving payment for material about their crimes. There are several more, including the Ian Huntleys of this world, who have reportedly written material that has not yet been published. I do not intend to go over each case cited in my letter, but one thing is clear: offenders will continue to benefit in the future from publishing material about their crimes if we do not take this opportunity to do something about it.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09102929000149"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie has argued that the scheme is not worth while because it will rarely be used. It is, of course, hard to predict precisely how many cases there will be each year. We suggested a figure of two a year in the impact assessment published alongside the Bill; this was on the basis of past cases that have caused concern. However, in some years there could be a greater or smaller number. Even if the scheme is rarely used, it does not mean that we should turn a blind eye to this problem. The fact that the scheme may be used in only a small number of cases is no reason for saying that people who cash in on their crimes should be outside the reach of the courts.</p>

<a name="91029-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09102929000150"></a>My noble friend also cited the existence of the prison rules and existing legislation on confiscation as a reason for not introducing these provisions. I recognise that the prison rules provide some degree of protection, but history shows that they cannot fully address the problem. Crucially, prison rules bite only when an offender is in prison. As to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, this was not designed with criminal memoirs in mind and their potential application to such cases is doubtful. Even if the Act could be utilised, confiscation orders are imposed at the time a person is convicted, whereas criminal memoirs are often published months or years after the conviction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09102929000151"></a>I turn now to some of the other criticisms that have been levelled at our scheme in recent weeks. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and some organisations think the scheme will have a &#147;chilling effect&#148; on the right to freedom of speech and might damage an offender&#146;s prospects of rehabilitation. Let me be clear that the scheme does not prevent anyone from writing or publishing anything. If offenders want to write and publish material to develop their skills, they can continue to do so. Indeed, we recognise that the natural outflow of expression in print can greatly

All we are saying is that if offenders profit from accounts of heinous crimes, an action which can cause great distress to surviving victims and bereaved families, the courts should have the power to order them to pay back the proceeds.</p>

As I understand it, the Government are of the view that what the victim of a serious crime minds, if something is written about it, is not that it is written about and that is published and many people read it, but that the person gets money for it. I understand that it is the Government&#146;s view that once that money is taken away, the victim no longer suffers from the hurt and distress of having it published.

We believe that what is particularly offensive to victims, and to families and friends of those victims, is that the criminal is able to profit from his crime by subsequent publication. We have looked to all sorts of things to make this reasonable and fair, but we see the act of profit as particularly and excessively offensive. We believe that we could not possibly address the simple act of publication, because it would go too far the other way. I am sure that all noble Lords in this House would say that it would, and that it would interfere with freedom of speech.</p>

It will consider a number of factors before deciding whether to impose an order and, if so, the amount. These include whether details about the offence are central or integral to the publication as a whole; the social, cultural or educational value of the publication; the extent to which the material is in the public interest; and the degree to which the publication causes offence to victims and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09102929000159"></a>I am aware of Amendments 106A and 107A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, which seek to amend the factors that a court has to consider before imposing an order. The amendments have the effect of explicitly requiring the courts to have regard to the right to freedom of expression and peaceful enjoyment of property and the extent to which the imposition of an order is a proportionate interference with those rights. We have considered his proposals carefully, but we do not believe that it is right to amend the scheme in that way. We have already set out clearly in the Explanatory Notes our firm view that the scheme complies with the convention rights.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09102929000160"></a>As noble Lords will know, any interference with the right to freedom of expression is justified under the convention if it is in accordance with law, in pursuance of a legitimate aim&#151;in this case the protection of the rights of others and the protection of morals&#151;and necessary in democratic society&#151;the latter term referring to there being a pressing social need for the interference&#151;and that the means employed are proportionate to the legitimate aims being pursued. Interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property is justified under the convention when the interference is in the public interest, subject to conditions provided by law and is proportionate to the aim pursued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09102929000161"></a>The detailed reasons why any interference with convention rights that may result from the operation of the scheme is fully justified and therefore compatible with the convention are set out in the Explanatory Notes. Any order made applying the scheme set out in the Bill will accordingly be consistent with the convention. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the Bill did not raise any general concerns regarding the scheme. It simply raised one detailed point about Clause 151(3)(f), which is addressed in Amendment 106A, to which I will turn shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09102929000162"></a>Noble Lords will also recall that under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act the courts are already required to act compatibly with convention rights and will therefore need to do so when applying this new scheme.

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09102929000167"></a>It is also important to bear in mind that, when deciding whether to impose an order, the courts will naturally balance the various factors that they have to consider in reaching their decision. The need for such a balancing exercise is plain from the clauses, which provide a list of factors to be considered, some of which are likely to tend towards an order being made and others that are not.

In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, asked me to clarify whether the scheme would truly apply to offenders who exploit information about any offence, regardless of the seriousness of that offence. I can confirm that that is indeed the effect of the current clauses. However, we have been reflecting on this issue over the summer and government Amendments 101, 102, 103 and 112 should help to allay concerns about the breadth of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09102929000169"></a>Those amendments will narrow the scope of the scheme so that it applies only to offenders who exploit material about serious offences, namely those offences that can be tried on indictment&#151;that is indictable-only offences and offences that are triable either way. It is, after all, people profiting from accounts about serious offences, not low-level summary offences, who are most likely to be of concern. To provide additional reassurance to the House and after extensive consultations, we intend to bring forward amendments at Third Reading to further limit the ambit of the scheme to indictable-only offences. Limiting the scheme to those who exploit material about offences that are triable only on indictment will be a major move on our part.  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1296"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The original scheme in the Bill would have applied to memoirs about any offence. Offences can that can be tried only on indictment form a small proportion of such cases. It would cover only offences at the most grave end of the spectrum such as murder, manslaughter or rape.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09102929000170"></a>Noble Lords may also recall that the Joint Committee on Human Rights was concerned about the reference to the &#147;general public&#148; in Clause 151(3)(f). It was suggested that it would be difficult for a court to measure the extent to which the general public is offended by a publication when weighing up whether to impose an exploitation proceeds order. I know that that view is shared by other noble Lords, as it was raised during the debate in Committee on 21 July. On reflection, we think that that is a valid point. Government Amendment 107 therefore deletes the reference to the &#147;general public&#148; from Clause 151.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09102929000171"></a>Importantly, however, the reference to the extent to which the victim or family of the victim are offended by a publication will remain. It would be much easier for the court to measure the degree to which victims or family members are affected than it would be to gauge the strength of public feeling.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09102929000172"></a>I hope that I have answered the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. He brings forward what I called in my previous life the de minimis dilemma. Yes, this provision will relate to only a small number of cases. Nevertheless, our judgment is that those cases are important. The noble Lord, Lord Soley, talked about the case for flexibility. It is quite clear that the court can consider all factors and will reasonably do so. The impact on rehabilitation, the impact on victims and the victim's views are all things that the court should consider, but the key issue about flexibility is addressed by the move that we have made to indictable-only offences. Non-lawyers in the House may not know what that means. Offences that are triable either way include sexual assault, burglary, causing death by careless driving, fraud, membership of a proscribed terrorist organisation and drugs offences. When we bring forward our amendments at Third Reading, none of those offences will be included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09102929000173"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, made his case about the Human Rights Act. I thank him for the time that he spent discussing that with us and I am sorry that we have not come to a common understanding. The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, made a brilliant speech about a French novelist, who I have never heard of. I cannot possibly judge whether heinous crimes were committed by that novelist or not, but the contribution that she described would be considered by the courts if a parallel situation were to exist. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, suggested that hundreds of thousands of people would be impacted. Our view in the impact statement was two per year. I hope that I answered the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09102929000174"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, quoted from the letter that I wrote, particularly the Leeson part. She claimed that his was a victimless crime. That would no longer be included under the Third Reading amendments that we intend to introduce.</p>

We have now limited the provision to the worst crimes. I cannot bring forward the specific reassurances that he asked for, but I hope that I have answered the issues on the Human Rights Act and that the breadth of the Act allows all sensible things to be taken account of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09102929000176"></a>I hope that we will get support for this provision, the bipartisan nature of which goes back to before the previous election. Michael Howard, the then leader of the Tory party, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09102929000301"></a>&#147;We don&#146;t think criminals should benefit from their crimes&#151;society should draw a clear distinction between right and wrong&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102929000272"></a>Later in the same discussion, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09102929000302"></a>&#147;What I want to see is a presumption against criminals benefiting from their crimes in this way&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102929000273"></a>As I set out in my letter to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, there was cross-party support in the other place. I am afraid that I cannot be responsible for its conventions. During Committee in the other place in March 2009, Shadow Justice Minister Henry Bellingham stated,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09102929000303"></a>&#147;We have supported the Government&#146;s policy of including part 7 on criminal memoirs in the Bill and have taken the view for some time that people who commit heinous crimes should not benefit financially from them after their release or, as in some cases, while they are in prison&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102929000274"></a>Despite some misgivings about the finer detail of the Bill, the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman, David Howarth, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="09102929000304"></a>&#147;Like the hon. Gentleman, I have no objection to the general principle&#151;indeed, I support it&#151;that people should not benefit from their own wrong. Civil remedies in this area are more difficult to obtain&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09102929000275"></a>and are not as exhaustive,</p>
<ul><a name="09102929000363"></a>&#147;as some academic commentators would have us believe&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Coroners and Justice Bill Committee, 10/3/09; col. 680.].</ul>
<a name="91029-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09102929000177"></a>I hope that I have touched upon all of the points. Finally, I again remind the House that the provisions in this part of the Bill stem from a commitment in the Labour Party&#146;s 2005 election manifesto. The relevant passage reads,</p>
<ul><a name="09102929000364"></a>&#147;we will develop new proposals to ensure that criminals are not able to profit from publishing books about their crimes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102929000178"></a>I hope that in the light of all I have said, the House will accept the need for these provisions, as modified by the Government amendments, and I invite my noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Lord, Lord Lester, to withdraw their amendments. If they will not, I invite the House to vote against them.</p>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="09102929000179"></a><b><a name="91029-0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09102929000634"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> My Lords, first, I thank the Minister for a very comprehensive response to the debate. He will have noticed, as I did, that apart from the fairly modest and partial support of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, every single person who spoke in the debate was critical of and generally against Part 7 of the Bill. In my view, having listened to the debate, Part 7 is an example of gesture politics. It is a gesture in the direction of victims of crime, for whom we must all have sympathy because the state of anguish and offence that they may feel when an offender profits from a book or article written by him is a serious matter.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09102929000180"></a>However, it is no more than a gesture, because under these proposals the victim is not to receive a single penny of any proceeds that the Government will obtain under the new action that will be permitted. The Government admit that the new powers are to be used only rarely. Almost every time that the Minister has referred to these matters in detail, whether privately yesterday or today in this House, he has emphasised how very unusual it would be and in how few cases the proceedings suggested by Part 7 will result in proceeds being recovered.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09102929000181"></a>The proceedings which are described in Part 7 are hedged around with restrictions and qualifications, and to some extent that is welcome because it allows for the literary value of publications, and for the general public interest to be observed. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, has clearly pointed out&#151;and in this House, he has a particular knowledge of this field&#151;the uncertainty of application of these proceedings is too vague, and not proportionate to the mischief that is said to be involved. That is because of the vagueness that, almost inevitably, has to appear in the legislation.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09102929000182"></a>To say that the Government are attracted to it may be an exaggeration, but they are still resolute in their desire to have Part 7 on the statute book. The Government are not willing to modify it on the lines helpfully proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, despite their inability, which has been confirmed today, to show that there would be any European case law for the compliance of this part of the Bill, and the things that can take place under it, with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="91029-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09102929000183"></a>It is impossible to summarise the breadth, width and thoughtfulness that went into so many of the speeches that we have heard today, but in one way and another they all say to the Government, &#147;You haven&#146;t got it right, even if there is some basis for this sort of legislation. You should withdraw it&#148;. They are unwilling to withdraw it, and I feel that I have to divide the House on this matter. It is not my custom to do that while sitting on the Government Benches, which I have been on for at least as long as the noble Lords on the Front Bench. On this occasion, however, I feel that this has hardly anything to do with party politics but is a matter of principle. I feel that I should ask to divide the House unless, perhaps, the Minister does that the other way around.</p>

We had a lively debate in Committee. I was encouraged to return to the issue by the noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Henley, who reminded us that this is only part of the wider issue of the retention of DNA, and the regime that we need so that innocent individuals do not have all sorts of information, including photographs, retained inappropriately.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09102929000185"></a>Since Committee stage in July, the <I>Guardian</I> has this week carried out quite a lot of investigation into the scale of the retention of photographs. We were very surprised. We knew that there was a problem, but we had not realised that the sheer scale was as great as that uncovered by the <I>Guardian</I>. In Committee the Minister gave his main reason for rejecting the amendment. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09102929000329"></a>&#147;We are not convinced that the codes of practice are the appropriate vehicle for governing retention of all photographs taken by the police&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/7/09; col. 1574.]</p>

<p><a name="09102929000186"></a>I must ask him again: what is the appropriate vehicle? The PACE codes govern the retention of all evidence collected, of which photographs are one example, so there could be no more appropriate place than the PACE codes.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09102929000187"></a>Secondly, there is still the problem that there seems to be no statutory accountability of the three national police units that are responsible for the policing of domestic extremism, as they call it. We would call it the right to protest and demonstrate. The very unfortunate terminology of &#147;domestic extremism&#148; being applied to innocent people who do nothing more than go on a protest is a move that must be strongly resisted. It is only on the basis that they attend protests that such people are photographed. There is a very serious issue here, which is why we have returned to it on Report.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09102929000188"></a>I know that the Minister will say that we should wait for Denis O&#146;Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, to release his national review of the policing of protests. The Minister would be wrong. We do not need a review to know that the photographs of innocent people&#151;people who are not being charged with any offence&#151;should not be retained. For the Minister to quote the review of the policing tactics at protests is simply a red herring. Nor do we need a review to know that the present situation has got so out of control. Anton Setchell, who is in command of ACPO&#146;s domestic extremism unit, apparently said that people who find themselves on the databases,</p>
<ul><a name="09102929000365"></a>&#147;should not worry at all&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09102929000276"></a>However, people are worried. We have had a number of people listed on the so-called &#147;sus&#148; cards who were very worried about being on the cards, and who were very worried that their children had been photographed. There can be no excuse for the retention of these photographs past the point where police know whether they are going to charge anyone or not or whether any crimes have been committed, other than for the purpose of building up a database of innocent people, which begins to smack of a police surveillance state, of which we are all very wary.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09102929000189"></a>I hope that the Minister will have found it in his heart to agree that this amendment has merit. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="09102929000190"></a><b><a name="91029-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09102929000640"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, quite rightly said that I voiced some sympathy for her amendments when she moved them in July. I suggested that she should come back to them. However, I note that the amendment that she has moved today is significantly different from the earlier version. In July she was asking for photographs to be destroyed after a year if they are not being used, while that has now been reduced rather drastically to two weeks. It is possible that the noble Baroness has diluted the strength of her argument by producing quite such a tight timeframe. Nevertheless, the Minister, back in July, made a suggestion that a better method than amending PACE codes, which was one option, might be to work with ACPO to ensure that all forces are aware of the implications of the judgment in Wood, which found that the taking of photographs at public order events is not unlawful, but that the continuing retention of photographs will generally have to be justified by the existence of clear grounds for suspecting that the individual photographed may have committed an offence at the event in question.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09102929000191"></a>We would be interested to hear more details from the Minister about what steps the Government have taken in the months since then to engage with ACPO in this way. For the moment, I think we prefer that approach, and would prefer to hear whether the Government have done anything in that direction, rather than endorsing the noble Baroness&#146;s rather overrestrictive amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="09102929000192"></a><b><a name="91029-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09102929000641"></a>Lord Bach:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for raising this important issue again. However, it is an entirely different amendment to the one that she moved in July, and I will come to that in a moment. We share her desire to see these matters addressed, but are clear that the route to ensuring the proper use and retention of photographs is not more legislation, but compliance with the statutory framework that already exists. Without going into the details of the Data Protection Act, or the management of police information guidelines, surely the key principles are that the police, or any public authority, need to be very clear about the purposes and reasons for which they are taking, retaining and storing images of any individual&#151;protester or otherwise&#151;and that they need to justify those reasons.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09102929000193"></a>Proposed new article 3.4(a), contained in proposed new subsection (2) of the amendment states:</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1305"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09102929000330"></a>&#147;Where an officer takes a photograph or photographs of an individual who has not been arrested, those photographs must be destroyed as soon as possible, but at the latest within 14 days of the day on which the photograph was taken&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102929000277"></a>Is it seriously being suggested that the law should be changed so that whatever the circumstances, a photograph of someone who has not been arrested within 14 days after the photograph was taken should be destroyed? If so, that would be a fantastic advantage to those who have committed criminal offences&#151;they would be mad not to hide themselves away for 14, or 15, days, because, if they had not been arrested by that stage, the photographs that might well be valuable identification evidence against them would have to be destroyed. It is completely irresponsible to suggest that this amendment be implemented and become the law of the land. Although there is every justification in broad terms for bringing this subject back, this part of the amendment would lead to absolute chaos. Anyone who was guilty of an offence, where the evidence of identification was the photograph, could simply escape justice by avoiding being arrested for 15 days. That would be an absurd piece of law, which would mean that many criminals would escape justice for no good reason at all.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09102929000194"></a>The police may need to retain images for longer than 14 days for a variety of reasons: for evidential purposes, of course; the photographs may be of assistance in responding to complaints that are made against them or others; for legal challenges, or to tackle criminal activity. The retention of photographs is important for the complaints system. If we consider the G20 protests, the Independent Police Complaints Commission will have examined images taken by the Metropolitan Police when investigating complaints. Surely the noble Baroness and others would support retention of those images by the police, to ensure that any complaints were properly dealt with, but if the person involved had not been arrested within 14 days, those photographs would have to be destroyed forthwith. That on its own would be a reason for opposing this amendment. While the current legislative framework acknowledges the need for retention, it does not allow police to retain information without valid reason.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09102929000195"></a>It comes down to proper guidance and training, to ensuring that officers understand the guidance, and leadership to ensure that officers have this training. ACPO is already committed to ensuring that these issues are addressed in revised guidance that also picks up wider lessons from the reviews into the policing of the G20 protests and the Kingsnorth climate camp, and that training for public order commanders flags the importance of this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09102929000196"></a>The HMIC review on policing protest is due to be published later this year and there will no doubt be important learning for police forces to pick up from that thorough review. The Home Office will also be setting out in its policing White Paper, due out later this year, the key principles for the policing of protest and how they need to be embedded in policing operations. Part of that will touch on the use and retention of photographs. The retention of photographs has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Police will have to

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09102929000197"></a>The noble Baroness still thinks that PACE code D is the appropriate place to change the law. She knows that we disagree. She will be aware that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act governs the taking, retention and use of photographs of persons detained at a police station, as well as photographs taken on the street of people who have been arrested or detained by a police community support officer or given a fixed penalty notice. PACE code D also sets out the procedures for conducting identification parades to enable witnesses and victims to identify suspects. These powers are focused on evidence of either the identity of the person suspected of the offence or evidence of the offence in question. The amendment would extend the scope of the PACE code D provisions to all images taken by the police, including intelligence information. We are not convinced that the codes of practice are the appropriate vehicle for governing retention of all photographs taken by the police. Article 3.4 of PACE code D relates to the procedures governing the conduct of identification procedures when the identity of a suspect is known, not the retention of images. If this change to PACE code D were to take place, the effect would be confusing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09102929000198"></a>I have outlined why the Government are opposed to this amendment and, if introduced, it would bring in bad law.</p>

<a name="09102929000199"></a><b><a name="91029-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09102929000642"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, the debate was helpful and has narrowed down the issues. I can appreciate the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that while in principle the retention for a long time of innocent people&#146;s photographs is unacceptable, he finds 14 days too short a period. I accept the arguments that he and the Minister made whereby there may be a difficultly with 14 days, but the Minister is missing the point. It is one thing when the police are normally taking photographs of a suspect because they have actually committed an offence, but I was talking about all the photographs taken of people who have committed no offence, other than to exercise their right as citizens to take part in a peaceful demonstration. The Minister will no doubt say that some of them may have committed an offence and that the police may need to keep those photographs to identify them, but that is a hypothetical situation.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09102929000200"></a>Photographs are taken of vast numbers of innocent people as they enter and leave openly advertised public meetings or demonstrations. These images of people, who it is accepted are innocent, are put on force-wide databases&#151;and that is about chronicling campaigners&#146; political activities. It is that which is unacceptable.</p>

<a name="91029-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09102929000201"></a>I understand why a period of 14 days has not found favour on the Conservative Front Bench, but an important issue remains. It is so serious that I shall take it away and consider it further. Although I shall not press it today, I do not intend to leave the matter to rest, because the principle here is as important as that regarding the retention of innocent people&#146;s DNA. For that reason, I hope to return to the issue at some point. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Noble Lords may be aware that the Government have introduced a new two-tiered structure for the fee which data controllers pay to the Information Commissioner to be registered as a data controller. This replaces the existing flat-fee structure. The notification fee for tier 1 data controllers will remain at &#163;35 while the fee for tier 2 data controllers will be &#163;500. The higher tier will encompass all data controllers with 250 or more members of staff and a turnover of &#163;25.9 million or more, as well as all public authorities with 250 or more members of staff. We estimate that that represents around 5 per cent of all data controllers.</p>

<a name="91029-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09102929000203"></a>The new fee structure will ensure that the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office has the necessary income to fulfil its current and future data protection responsibilities, such as those being brought forward in this Bill. Schedule 19 as drafted contains provisions that allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to require data controllers to provide information to the Information Commissioner for the purpose of verifying that the correct annual notification fee is paid.</p>

<a name="91029-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09102929000204"></a>However, this information has to be provided only upon initial registration. There is currently no mechanism to require data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office of changes in circumstance that would place them in another tier. Section 20 of the Data Protection Act 1998 requires data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office of certain relevant changes in circumstance. Amendments 118 and 132 amend Section 20 to enable regulations to be made requiring data controllers to notify the ICO of any changes to their registrable particulars for the purpose of ensuring that the correct annual notification fee is paid.</p>

<a name="91029-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09102929000205"></a>We have drafted the amendment whereby organisations will not need to provide the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office with this information year after year whenever they pay their notification fee. Instead, they will need to provide this information only upon a change of circumstance. This will help to ensure that the bureaucratic burden on data controllers is minimised. I hope that noble Lords will agree to these amendments. I beg  to move.</p>

I note that the noble Lord said that the change should provide sufficient funds for all the things that the office is meant to do. I am not sure that it will, because we are putting more and more duties on to the Information Commissioner to protect us. He is a bastion of protection for the citizen. I suspect that these fees may need to be looked at again, but this is certainly a move in the  right direction.</p>

The current legislation delays the date that the order comes into effect until the day after it is made. A delay in the start of the sentence would result in a gap of at least 24 hours between sentence and supervision or monitoring of an offender. During this period, any further offending would not technically constitute a breach. This would mean that a high-risk young offender might be at large overnight or over a weekend, and free to commit further offences with no immediate redress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09102945000002"></a>The amendments in this group address the defect by providing for a youth rehabilitation order to come into force on the day that it is made, or on such later date as the court may specify.

However, it is important, when the Bill returns to the other place for consideration of the amendments made by this House, that it is properly drafted in all respects. We therefore support the amendments in this group, which are consequential on the removal of the former Clause 61. I make it clear that this does not change our position on the need for the freedom of expression section, and I would not be surprised if the House comes to debate this substantive issue again before long.</p>

However, we feel that this SI has consequences that the Government did not intend. The SI applies only to SENCOs who have been in post for less than a year, but there is an indication that the committee felt that all SENCOs should eventually gain this qualification. I ask the Minister how and when this training will take place. Will time away from their school duties be designated for special educational needs teachers? If so, who will replace them while they are training? If not, when are they expected to complete this qualification?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09102945000040"></a>The average SENCO may have other childcare commitments&#151;lesson development work will be just one of their duties. My understanding of the SI is that it is widely accepted that SEN provision is patchy&#151;but is this qualification the way forward? We must bear in mind the cost, not just in monetary terms but also in time. The figures given by the Government in the impact assessment do not reflect an honest picture of  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the cost and implications, nor indicate who will pick up the bill. Is it expected that those undertaking the qualification will pay for, or contribute to, their training? Does the Minister appreciate that these proposals may lead to a two-tier system, in which some SENCOs may be disadvantaged if they do not have this qualification, despite their years of valuable experience?</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09102945000041"></a>We on these Benches understand that this is a specialist field for teachers and that all support that can improve the quality of provision must be given. However, the Government&#146;s proposals yet again undermine the ability of head teachers to ensure that appropriate assessments take place and, where they identify a failing, to decide what appropriate training should take place.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09102945000042"></a>Our main concern is that this will become a retrospective necessary qualification for teachers who have been in the profession for a long time. If SENCOs then decide that they would rather retire than continue, this would create a vacuum in the profession. There is already a shortage of people coming into this specialised area of teaching. Will the Minister tell us who has drawn up this qualification, and who was consulted? Has there been a debate about the contents of the qualification, and will the qualification have a review period? If so, when will the review take place, who will conduct it and will the results be made publicly available?</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09102945000043"></a>Will the Minister also say on what grounds an impact assessment can be made when the Government do not know how many SENCOs there are? The SI estimates that 8,130 SENCOs will have to be replaced over a period of three years. Will the Minister explain how this figure has been reached?</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09102945000044"></a>We all want the best possible provision of education for all our children, in particular for the most vulnerable in our society. They need continuity, as well as expertise that is not always summed up in a qualification. We have, in our teaching profession, some of the most dedicated and committed SENCOs, who would no doubt undergo training to improve their skills; but they must not be put at a disadvantage because they do not have a qualification that the Government have indicated must be a requirement for all SENCOs.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09102945000045"></a>Although the ideals and sentiments behind this policy are good, and improving our educational system, especially for those who need the extra help, is a top concern, I am worried that it is an ill thought-out, broad-brush scheme which will ignore the micro-expertise of our head teachers and teachers. It will incur escalating costs with little real benefit, much like the Government&#146;s one-to-one tuition plan which is hurting SEN strategies in many schools by stretching resources and taking some of these pupils away from specialist SEN teachers. We would like the Government to show more trust in our education professionals and allow them to use their expertise and common sense. They should decide what their staff need and provide them with the support mechanisms to carry out regular assessments.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09102945000046"></a>In 2007-08, the Government&#146;s bi-weekly e-mail to head teachers, if printed, would have contained as many words as the King James Bible and would have been 40 centimetres thick. Do we really want to add an extra burden on this noble profession? I will listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

We have had some dyslexic children so we have met a lot of this at the sharp end. I want to echo support for the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and to say that we must be careful not to make the best the enemy of the better. We have a lot of dedicated people, some of whom may not be as good as others, but very often the personality matters more than the qualifications. Just having qualifications does not mean that someone is brilliant. Removing flexibility, which we need, and consistency, which is often the most important thing, and taking people away to get a qualification which may not be necessary, could be damaging for children. I do not see why we cannot trust our head teachers and other people in education to try to do their best for the children within the limited resources that we have. They may be financial limitations or the number of people available may be limited. Further to restrict it and limit their options would be foolish. I am concerned that we are trying to overbureaucratise something that is working, even if it is not perfect.</p>

Pagers that are constantly buzzing and repeating messages occasionally do not get picked up on time.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09102929000209"></a>The idea of SENCOs being properly trained is not one that I have an instinctive reaction against. The idea that we might be getting rid of qualified teachers who are doing the job properly will raise a few alarm bells. The question is how to bring the two together. SENCOs were seen as a great wonder worker when they were brought in, but it became quite apparent that many did not know what they were doing. Some have acquired experience and some will have an amazing range of qualifications and experience from various places which probably will not conform to any new regulation, but may mean that they are qualified enough to do the job. The Minister undoubtedly knows the answers so will she tell us how the Government will make an assessment of whether somebody is properly qualified by experience and perhaps some older qualifications, and how that can be brought into the current training scheme? Let us not waste money by taking people away or giving them an extra load if they know what they are doing. Effectively, is there a certain test of competence that could be built into the current qualifications that would mean that the person does not need further training at the moment? As we discover more about special educational needs, we tend in every piece of legislation to put a slightly greater load on the education system to deal with these problems. There is a greater expectation in the initial impact that something should be done. At the moment, we are a long way from catching everybody or getting the right amount of involvement early enough in the system. We are better than we were, but in my 25 years of experience we have improved this situation steadily by a very irregular series of steps. It is undoubtedly better now than it has ever been but it is still not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09102929000210"></a>Will the Minister say whether some consideration has been given to those who have acquired a series of core qualifications that are sufficient for the job as it currently exists and that the retraining process can take place when they are there? Because we happen to know how to deal with a dyslexic does not mean that we know how to deal with somebody with autism. To take those two: one is a subject I know best and the other I had to speak on at the beginning of this week. Another department answered that debate, so I understand why the noble Baroness will not have caught the passing shot from that debate.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09102929000211"></a>There is an ongoing process. If there is a way of addressing the fact that competent teachers should be assessed as competent and should not have to go through the training scheme or at least all of it, that would be a good thing. We must not forget that many people were appointed as SENCOs but have not had the right training. However, we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater. How we square the circle of being where we are now will be interesting to hear and I look forward to what the Minister has to say.</p>

I hope that I can answer the questions that have arisen in this brief discussion and I shall review <I>Hansard</I> to ensure that I have picked up all the questions.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09102929000213"></a>I shall start with a question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about the burden on the profession. We need to be clear that continuous professional development is very much the tenure of teacher training nowadays. We expect that when teachers finish their training qualifications, they will continue with their professional development. If a teacher becomes a SENCO, continued training and professional development in the area of special educational needs will be extremely important for them. A licence to teach will require a portfolio of skills development in the future and parents will expect teachers and SENCOs to have relevant skills and experience.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09102929000214"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, asked how far the Government are prepared to trust heads to know best. Our entire education system is dependent on the skill, leadership and contribution that head teachers make. We are incredibly indebted to them for the progress that they have made on behalf of our children. We must also listen to what head teachers and specialist teachers have said. It is important that there is more continuity, as the noble Earl said, across schools. That is why these measures have been brought in and why we want to see training and the status of SENCOs raised. This is part of achieving that. It is important that we make the training for SENCOs mandatory. We know that some, as noble Lords have suggested, have received very good training, but we also know that that provision is extremely uneven as others have received little or no preparation for the role that they are asked to take on. We need to tackle that and recognise the importance of the role that SENCOs

We want to support heads and governors to help strengthen their provision for children with special educational needs. These regulations directly address the concerns raised by the 2006 Select Committee and they are an important part of the commitment made in the Children&#146;s Plan in 1997 to improve SEN provision.</p>

<a name="91029-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09102929000215"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, was concerned about the credit given to existing teaching professionals who fulfil SEN roles. The awarding institutions which will be running the training will take into account prior learning, and qualifications will properly be taken into account.

I will be happy to write to him in detail on exactly how that will work. However, I want to be clear that the provision is about training for new teachers coming into post.

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09102929000218"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was concerned about cover for teachers during the training. Cover is essential and we have included it in the cost of the training. It is anticipated that about 12 days&#146; training will be needed outside the classroom, and cover will be built into the funding provided for that. There were concerns about the approach promoting a two-tier system. Newly appointed SENCOs will be the priority, but as greater clarity on the numbers emerges, we will look with the Training and Development Agency at the scope within assigned resources for supporting SENCOs who have been in post for longer. An enormous amount of work has been undertaken by the TDA, and as the numbers become clearer we can consider revising the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09102929000219"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, were interested to know how we will be reviewing the regulations. We will do so through the TDA, which will examine the scheme after a three-year period. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about who had developed the scheme. It was developed by the TDA and there was significant consultation with specialists involved&#151;head teachers and SENCOs alike. We will also look at the TDA to monitor the take-up of places. Already 700 have been taken up, with 2,000 more to be taken in January. That is a significant number. Our aim is to improve the skills, knowledge and confidence of a group of people who are key to the outcomes for children with SEN and disabilities. From 2010, the school workforce survey will help us to keep track of SENCO qualifications. That will give us a running commentary on how things are going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09102929000220"></a>I welcome the recognition expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that there have been improvements over the years, and I echo his clear statement that not enough has been done. None of us in government, or in this House, would for one moment think that enough had been done, but we are very much committed to making further improvements. Twenty per cent of pupils in maintained schools have SEN or disabilities&#151;a significant number of children and young people. A school&#146;s special educational needs co-ordinator has a vital role to play in meeting those needs. The SENCO also forms an important point of contact within the school for children with SEN and their parents. I can say that from personal experience when working with my daughter&#146;s SENCO.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09102929000221"></a>Serious concerns about the perceived low status of SENCOs within schools were expressed in the July 2006 report of the Education and Skills Select Committee. As a result of that committee&#146;s recommendations, there is now a requirement in law for maintained schools to designate an SEN. Hitherto, there had simply been an assumption that that would happen&#151;here we return to the noble Earl&#146;s concern about a lack of consistency. Regulations laid last November established a requirement for SENCOs to be qualified teachers. It does not mean that all staff working with SENCOs must be teachers, but the SENCO must be a qualified teacher. That is essential if they are to have the necessary authority to negotiate with qualified colleagues on differentiated provision geared towards children&#146;s individual needs. This is about raising the status of SENCOs.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09102929000222"></a>That in no way hinders non-teacher members of the SENCO team from continuing to play an important role in supporting the SENCO function. A further recommendation of the Select Committee was that SENCOs should receive appropriate training. Noble Lords here today have recognised that that is important and the right way to go. We know that some SENCOs have received very good training and I take this opportunity to commend the efforts of schools, local authorities and the individuals in this regard. However, there was no obligation to undertake such training, and it was therefore possible to take on the role of SENCO with little or no professional preparation. I do not think that that is the right way to go.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09102929000223"></a>Some SENCOs have received little preparation for their important role and some say that they have received no training at all. If we want to ensure effective educational provision&#151;we are all agreed that we do&#151;for children with additional needs and abilities, we must provide SENCOs with the training and professional skills they need. We believe that the best way to improve the skills of the workforce and boost parental confidence is by requiring those new to the role to obtain the nationally approved qualification within three years. We consulted on the regulations earlier this year. The majority of the respondents, who included SENCOs, head teachers, local authorities, governors, teacher unions and SEN organisations, supported the proposals now before us. The course should normally take one year to complete on a part-time basis, assuming that no credit is given for prior qualifications or experience, but the time could be shorter. Our draft regulations proposed a three-year

We believe that that will provide latitude there, a point which concerned the noble Baroness, Lady Verma.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09102929000224"></a>We will also examine ways to ensure that SENCOs who have been in post for some time benefit from the new training resources developed under the other work that the TDA is doing on our inclusion development programme, to which I have already referred. We know that it takes time for SENCOs to grow into their role. The new training is intended to enable those with less experience to get up to speed as quickly as possible. That is why we are not requiring those who have extensive experience or are working as a SENCO already to undertake the training. Instead, we leave it up to head teachers&#146; discretion whether SENCOs who have been in post for more than 12 months should be encouraged to take the course. SENCOs do an important job, as we all agree. They deserve our support, as do the children that they work with.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09102929000225"></a>The Government agree with the recommendations of the Select Committee, and we have taken action to address its concerns. The regulations, the professional training courses approved by the TDA and the funding that we have earmarked for the next two years will ensure that all SENCOs new to the role will receive the training and support that they need to perform a demanding and valuable job. I therefore hope that noble Lords will support the initiative.</p>

We are all agreed that SEN teachers play an incredibly important role, as well as often being main classroom teachers. I still feel very concerned because, reading the SI and the committee&#146;s report, my opinion is that when this is rolled out, those teachers will be expected to have that qualification, even though they have been SENCOs for a very long time. I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I shall read <I>Hansard</I> carefully. I hope that she is assuring us properly that only new people coming in will need that qualification&#151;ruling out completely those who have been SENCOs for a long time&#151;and evaluating them only on what may be their weak areas.

<a name="09102929000229"></a><b><a name="91029-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09102929000656"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I am raising an issue which to the casual reader of the Order Paper may look rather abstruse but which is in fact the very opposite; and it is an issue which has far-reaching implications both for patients and for the NHS. Medicines are used off label when they are not licensed for the particular indication to which they are applied. There are two main reasons why a license may be absent. It is either because the illness is so rare that the manufacturer is unable to recruit enough participants to take part in clinical trials; or else it is because the manufacturer has come to the view that the potential market is so small as to make the costs of conducting trials uneconomic.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09102929000230"></a>Many cancers, particularly some of the rarer cancers, are treated with a medicine used off label. There are also a number of less common auto-immune conditions for which the treatment is unlicensed. Rituximab is licensed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but doctors also use it to treat vasculitis, which is a disease affecting the blood vessels. Infliximab is licensed to treat Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis, among other conditions, but it is also prescribed off label for the treatment of Behcet's disease, which is a most unpleasant complaint that can involve ulceration and extreme exhaustion. Micophenolic acid is licensed to prevent organ rejection after a transplant, but it is additionally used to treat psoriasis and lupus.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09102929000231"></a>The use of those treatments outside their licensed indication is widespread because some clinicians believe that the unlicensed treatments can lead to better patient outcomes than licensed treatments, where those exist. Ironically, the fact that doctors may develop a strong belief in the efficacy of an off-label use can make it harder to conduct any registration trials necessary to secure an extended licence. That is because they would deem it unethical to randomise patients to a control arm of a trial if they are already convinced that doing so would not be in those patients&#146; best interests.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1324"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09102929000232"></a>As the Minister will know, NICE assesses the use of medicines only in their licensed indication. Because of that, there can be no NICE guidance for a drug's off-label use, and hence no mandatory funding direction at national level. That inevitably means that decisions about the funding of treatments outside their licensed indication are left to local discretion. That fact is one which works to many patients&#146; disadvantage. Although in a given PCT, the requests that come forward may be quite few, the treatments may often have a relatively high unit cost, which can throw budgets into some disarray. There may be little or no published information on the effectiveness of the treatments requested, which means that commissioners often have little to go on, and the decision collapses into a calculation of raw cost rather than a more considered assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09102929000233"></a>The commissioners at PCT level are typically not specialists, and many find it hard enough to make informed decisions about relatively common conditions, let alone rarer ones. There is something of a vicious circle here, because funding for treatments is not made available, as there is little published evidence in support of them, and that itself perpetuates the paucity of information.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09102929000234"></a>The result is an extraordinary amount of duplication in each of the 152 PCTs, which must each develop their own processes and maintain their own advisory committees to determine whether to fund a particular treatment. The people who suffer most, of course, are patients. For those who need off-label medicines, the postcode lottery is a stark reality, and health inequalities are accentuated, not least because the most articulate and well informed patients will typically negotiate their way through the system to secure a positive outcome.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09102929000235"></a>The Minister may have read the report published recently by the Rarer Cancers Forum, called <I>Off Limits, </I>which looked into the way in which acute trusts and PCTs determine requests for off-label use of medicines. There were some alarming findings in that report. Nearly a third of hospital trusts which responded to the audit said that they had no protocol in place for off-label treatments. That is a serious matter, bearing in mind that for cancer in particular, chemotherapy is a process which administers toxic substances into the bloodstream. Because there is a relative lack of evidence about the safety and efficacy of an off-label treatment, commensurately greater care needs to be taken over it. There are wide variations in attitude about this issue from trust to trust. Some trusts appear actively to discourage off-label use, while others acknowledge that it is a necessary ingredient of high-quality patient care. Perhaps the surprising thing is the number of trusts that do not appear to distinguish between on-label and off-label use at all and do not keep records of the requests they get. As they are vicariously liable for the outcome of off-label treatments, this seems a somewhat reckless attitude.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09102929000236"></a>Among PCTs, the picture is, if anything, worse. Almost three-quarters of PCTs reported that they operated protocols for determining off-label funding requests. However, 42 per cent do so by using the exceptional case process, despite the fact that the  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1325"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>National Prescribing Centre has said that this absolutely should not happen. Three PCTs&#151;North Staffordshire, Oldham and Western Cheshire&#151;said that they had a policy of never funding off-label treatment requests. This is arbitrary and unjustifiable. It may also be illegal in the context of the NHS Act. Perhaps the Minister would care to comment on this. It is certainly a situation that appears to run directly contrary to the NHS Constitution.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09102929000237"></a>At the heart of the problem is the absence of an information base about the uses of off-label medicines and the clinical outcomes achieved thereby. Somehow this needs to be overcome. I say that not least because of the need to guard against inappropriate off-label treatments. Perhaps the most worrying instance of this is the overuse of antipsychotic medicines in care homes to treat dementia. The <I>Psychiatric Bulletin</I> published a study two years ago that brought this issue to the fore, as did evidence presented to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia last year. Not only do such medicines carry safety risks, they also have unpleasant side effects, and there is clear evidence that people with dementia derive only limited benefit from them. The Department of Health is about to publish a report into this subject, and we await it with interest. I hope that it will cover two issues in particular: the need for care home staff to receive training in dementia care and the need for those to whom antipsychotics have been prescribed to have that prescription formally reviewed by a doctor on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09102929000238"></a>It is uncomfortable for me to admit that, in the context of off-label treatments, the split between purchasers and providers and the competition that exists between them serves to frustrate the delivery of the most effective care to patients. My own view is that the only way to tackle these difficulties satisfactorily is to put in place a collaborative commissioning arrangement, perhaps across each strategic health authority area, which combines the skills of both hospital specialists and PCT commissioners. A single commissioning committee, perhaps not unlike that which deals with specialised conditions, could be established in each strategic health authority to examine requests for off-label treatments. This would drastically reduce waste and duplication at PCT level, and it would also allow different local health economies to pool their expertise. However, the real benefit would flow over the medium term because once a certain number of requests for an off-label treatment had been reached, the committee could form a consensus opinion about that treatment, and that in turn could be used as a means of informing funding decisions in the future. Consensus opinions reached in this way could be made available to NHS Evidence, which would act as a conduit to inform decisions elsewhere in the country. Of course, there would need to be a mechanism for updating the content of a consensus opinion to take account of experience and any new research that emerges.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09102929000239"></a>I very much hope that this idea, or something like it, will commend itself to Ministers. I say this more in expectation than in hope, because in the department's paper published in November last year, called <I>Improving</I><I></I><I>Access to Medicines for NHS Patients, </I>it did seem that they had in mind some kind of collaborative arrangements

My firm view is that this dimension of drug prescribing in the NHS has been overlooked for too long. Someone needs to champion the whole issue and come up with a completely new model that is designed to ensure that patients across the country receive speedy and appropriate access to the medicines they need.</p>

I am grateful for that. I am a trained pharmacist. I did a degree a long time ago in the days when pharmacists were trained to roll pills&#151;that shows how long ago it was&#151;so my pharmacy is not as modern as it should be. However, I am also a recently appointed lay member of the General Medical Council, which gives me an interest in this debate. I congratulate the noble Earl on this debate. The timing is absolutely right. He is correct that this subject has been overlooked for too long. I was quite surprised when I looked at some of the material. This is not the area of public policy in which I specialise, but there are so many different, overlapping issues that need urgent attention that the time has come for it. I hope the Minister can give us some comfort in that direction.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09102929000241"></a>I shall go off-label in the debate and make two quick points. First, overprescribing in the NHS is still a problem. A sentence of reassurance from the Minister would be helpful. Secondly, we all understand that the escalating costs of the drug bill are a problem for us all. However, I do not think this issue is predominantly about cost. If everything recommended by the noble Earl was brought into being in good order in a reasonable time, it would not cost a lot, but it would improve the pathways of care for some patients throughout the whole United Kingdom&#151;I shall come back to that point. I do not think the Government can hide behind the fact that this will cost a lot of money, because it should not.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09102929000242"></a>In addition to the important areas that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to&#151;rare cancers and the antipsychotics issue that the Alzheimer&#146;s Society perfectly properly raised with us&#151;there are other cases and circumstances that the Government are already aware of. I shall refer to one of them, although I am sure there are others. It is the question of Lucentis versus Avastin in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. It is a particularly interesting case because the same company produces an expensive drug that treats colon and breast cancer and the even more expensive Lucentis, which is properly licensed for the treatment of wet AMD. There are practitioners who believe in soul and conscience and their best clinical judgment that the cheaper product would be as efficacious, but they cannot get past the bureaucracy of the extra cost for the NHS for the reasons that the noble Earl suggested. It is right to say that in rare conditions, such as rare cancers, you cannot get the critical mass to get statistical validity for the trials that are necessary for the licence. There are also perverse incentives for pharmaceutical companies within the licensing system. I do not blame them. Why should they license another drug when they have a more expensive licensed drug

It would cost them money to do so. There are issues around the licensing system that we need to look at.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09102929000243"></a>However, equality of access is the main burden of the noble Earl&#146;s powerful evidence to the House this afternoon. I concur with him. There are quite indefensible variations of treatment. I commend the Rarer Cancers Forum, an organisation of which I was previously ignorant. Its report is extremely well argued and well researched and repays careful study. It is very clear about the impact on patients who are suffering from rarer cancers. I did not realise that rare-cancer sufferers are quite a proportion of cancer sufferers. It is important not to forget that.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09102929000244"></a>The noble Earl made a very important point about NICE. It is hamstrung and cannot do much about this issue without a new look at the whole thing. I also agree that the lack of NHS protocols to ensure the clinical governance of off-label treatments is not satisfactory and needs attention. The report demonstrates that there is a wide variety of practice in the NHS, which is not satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09102929000245"></a>Some NHS trusts have vicarious liability, and as a member of the GMC I know that it has no rules with a locus in this argument.

There is, however, some pretty clear guidance in <I>Good Medical Practice</I>, a GMC publication, which is supplemented by a document called <I>Good Practice in Prescribing Medicines</I>, which also sets out quite clear guidance on how medical practitioners should conduct themselves when they prescribe a medicine for use outside the terms of its licence. They must, for example:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_112"></a><a name="09102929000359"></a>&#147;Be satisfied that it would better serve the patient&#146;s needs than an appropriately licensed alternative&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09102929000278"></a>and:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113"></a><a name="09102929000360"></a>&#147;Be satisfied that there is a sufficient evidence base and/or experience of using the medicine to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The manufacturer&#146;s information may be of limited help in which case the necessary information must be sought from other sources&#148;.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09102929000246"></a>It is perfectly possible, legal, right and proper that people using their medical judgments&#151;that is why they are trained&#151;should prescribe off-label medicines for treatments that they think are appropriate, but they should not be doing so casually and without being properly cognisant of the regulatory environment that is all around them. It is unsatisfactory for trusts not to support the people whom they employ to discharge these important responsibilities as medical practitioners.</p>

<a name="91029-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09102929000247"></a>There is a difference in practice north and south of the border. The Scottish Medicines Consortium is light years ahead of and much better organised than the situation in England, due partially to the fact that it operates on a much smaller scale and can get these things done an awful lot more expeditiously. I make the point facetiously. Nevertheless, we in Scotland seem to be more fleet of foot and able to move more expeditiously in determining some of these things. If the Minister has the briefing, will she reassure the House that there is dialogue, as I hope there is, between professionals, if not Ministers, about all this?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09102929000248"></a>Secondly, there is an international body of opinion and experience on which we can draw. The noble Earl made an important point about treatments for psychosis and drew very interesting comparisons between how we and our sister European nations deal with some of these technical problems. Arguably, their best practice could be looked at and we could benefit from that.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09102929000249"></a>I come back to where the noble Earl came in. There is no coherent framework of provision for these things at the moment, and this needs to be attended to. There is also a really urgent need for accurate and comprehensive information about off-limit prescriptions and treatments in future. It is not safe to leave the situation as it is, and I congratulate the noble Earl again on spotting this. It is a really important subject, and I hope that the Government agree.</p>

<a name="09102929000250"></a><b><a name="91029-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102929000658"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for calling this debate. Although we may be few in number, we make up for that in the quality of our contributions. Precious things come in small packages.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09102929000251"></a>I know that the noble Earl takes a keen interest in the Government&#146;s medicines policy; this is not the first time that we have looked at this complex issue. I will take a moment to set out its background. A marketing authorisation, or product licence as it is often known, defines a medicine&#146;s terms of use. The licensing system ensures that medicines are effective, safe and of good quality. As both noble Lords have said, however, there will always be clinical situations in which a prescriber may judge that the use of a medicine outside the terms of its licence is in the best interests of a patient based on the available evidence. This, as has been remarked, is known as off-label or off-licence use. Such practice is relatively common in the treatment of some cancers and other conditions, and decisions are normally taken by hospital doctors. They need to be taken in discussion with the patient concerned, and funding may sometimes need to be agreed with the patient&#146;s primary care trust.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09102929000252"></a>The use of off-label treatments in cancer presents a particular challenge because treatments are not licensed for cancer but for a specific type and stage of a cancer. The Rarer Cancers Forum&#151;I have looked at its excellent report&#151;has coined the term &#147;near-label&#148; to describe the situation in which such drugs are used off-label but in an indication that is near, or similar, to the licensed indication. However, because these near-label treatments are not licensed for such a use, they cannot usually be appraised in England by NICE, because NICE generally issues mandatory guidance on the use of a medicine within its licensed indication. To do otherwise risks undermining the licensing process, which exists to protect patients. This means that PCTs have to use their own processes for determining whether to fund these off-label or near-label treatments. In a way, how this operates is the nub of both noble Lords&#146; contributions.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09102929000253"></a>The issue of patients&#146; access to off-label treatments was dealt with by Professor Mike Richards in his report, <I>Improving Access to Medicines for NHS Patients</I>, which was published last November. Professor Richards reported that there are particular challenges for PCTs in taking such decisions, as the noble Earl described very adequately. He commented that better collaboration  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1329"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by PCTs would help better quality decisions to be taken on applications for funding, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, quite rightly said, funding is not always the only issue; how decisions are taken is also important.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09102929000254"></a>Mike Richards made a number of linked recommendations that focus on the manner and processes by which PCTs take decisions on new medicines and that, where there is no guidance from NICE, stress the need for PCTs to be proactive, transparent and rational in their commissioning decisions, to work collaboratively and to be better supported.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09102929000255"></a>Again, the noble Earl is completely correct when he says that the NHS Constitution includes the right to expect rational PCT funding decisions on drugs. He asked about the illegality of barring funding for treatments. PCTs must have arrangements in place to consider all requests. A blanket ban would leave them open to challenge in the courts.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09102929000256"></a>To help PCTs improve the quality of their decision-making so that patients can have confidence in these arrangements and therefore deal with the issue of postcode lotteries and unevenness of decision-making, we have commissioned a number of measures to support the introduction of improved local processes. We have produced a set of public-facing principles to inform PCT decision-making, which is about governance arrangements and procedures; a set of directions to PCTs making explicit their public law responsibilities to put in place processes for making decisions on new drugs and treatments, which should address the issue raised by the noble Earl; and, most importantly, a handbook of detailed good practice guidance for the NHS, covering funding policies on new drugs and processes for considering individual funding requests, which is a very important document. The National Prescribing Centre has embarked on a major programme of work to provide a bespoke and continuing training package for key PCT staff to help ensure that local processes are able to develop in the way that we, and our policy, believe that they should.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09102929000257"></a>The NHS chief executive wrote to strategic health authorities on 4 November 2008 asking them to review the way in which PCTs in their area collaborate to support effective decision-making on new drugs. Although this work is not specific to off-label use of drugs, it is very relevant to that issue as the same general principles should apply. The key part of this package is the handbook of good practice guidance, which was issued to the NHS in March 2009. It provides tools to help PCTs review their current decision-making processes about the funding of medicines.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09102929000258"></a>PCTs are likely to be faced with decisions about a range of medicines and treatments for rarer conditions where they and their local providers cannot reasonably be expected to have the full range of expertise. It is our view that PCTs must consider collaborating in these circumstances and collaborative arrangements already exist for many cancer medicines. Funding the off-label use of drugs is an area that might trigger collaborative decision-making and we would expect the good practice guidance to inform such decisions.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09102929000259"></a>I understand the concern of the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, about the report from the Rarer Cancers Forum, which alleged that, over the  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1330"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column 1330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>past three years, almost 3,200 cancer patients were forced to apply for funding from the NHS for near-label treatments. From what I have said, noble Lords will appreciate that the Government have a great sympathy with these concerns. It is difficult and complex to see how all PCTs and their provider trusts can be reasonably expected to have the full expertise or resources to make the full range of decisions on rarer and more complex cases. It is possible that the noble Earl&#146;s proposal may go some way to addressing that issue and I intend to take this question back to the department. I will let noble Lords know the answer.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09102929000260"></a>The National Prescribing Centre is engaged in developing ongoing support for PCT decision-making and, as part of this work, it has established that most SHA areas now have some supra-PCT activities to support local decision-making. However, I appreciate that that is not quite the point being made by the noble Earl.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09102929000261"></a>The noble Earl asked about antipsychotic drugs, which is an important and complex issue affecting people with dementia in all care settings. That is why we have commissioned the independent review on antipsychotic drugs, which we will publish next month. I will take the issues raised about collaborative commissioning back to the department and will explore them.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09102929000262"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, mentioned overprescribing. We are attempting to tackle this again through our quality and productivity challenges. Controlling the growth of the drugs bill is permanently on the agenda. The noble Lord also asked about Scotland. Every time I answer a question about NICE, I also have a note about how closely we work with Scotland and how much easier it is for it to be fleet of foot, to paraphrase what my brief usually says. The dialogue is ongoing and there is a lot of co-operation and collaboration between the teams.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09102929000263"></a>The noble Lord also asked about local decision-making. The department has always taken a cautious approach to mandating or encouraging the use of drugs outside licensed indications. Aside from obvious liability issues if there is an adverse incident, there is a real risk that national advice to use a drug outside its licence could undermine the established licensing process. While some off-label cases may be obvious, others may be far more complex, so it is difficult to draw a clear line about what the national level should be. Although not specifically intended for the small volume of off-label prescribing that takes place in the NHS, the measures that we are putting in place to strengthen and support local decision-making will be relevant to such prescribing as well.</p>

<a name="91029-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09102929000264"></a>Finally, while a good deal of progress has been made, we are not complacent. With the development of new drugs, more complex drugs and the applications of many different drugs, it becomes more important that these procedures and processes are transparent and in the best interests of the patient. We will continue to promote and encourage collaboration through the strategic health authorities. We will also continue to consider whether there is a need to provide further support to PCTs to enable them to effectively discharge their responsibilities in this area.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000004"></a>I should perhaps first explain that both sets of regulations relate to both business names and registered names. By business names, I mean the name under which any person, whether or not incorporated, carries on business in the UK. By registered names, I mean the name under which a company or limited liability partnership is registered at Companies House. This may or may not be the same as its business name or, indeed, its business names.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000005"></a>The UK has few restrictions on business names. There are restrictions over the use of certain words under, for example, the Medicines Act 1968 and the Architects Act 1997. Since the abolition of the business names register in 1981, the Secretary of State&#146;s prior approval has been required for certain business names. This requirement does not apply if the business name is simply the trader&#146;s surname or partners&#146; surnames with or without forename and/or initials or, if the trader is incorporated, if the name is not its registered name.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000006"></a>Under the Companies Act 2006, the Secretary of State&#146;s prior approval is needed for either a business name or a registered name that suggests a connection to Her Majesty&#146;s Government, a devolved Administration, a local authority or any public authority specified in  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations. The draft Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business Names (Public Authorities) Regulations, which we are considering today, specify 26 public authorities where prior approval is required for business names that suggest a connection to them.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000007"></a>Both Houses of Parliament are specified in the regulations, as are the devolved legislatures, government auditors and financial regulators. The other six specified public authorities are ones where the relevant government department has advised that there is a risk of harm to the public from persons purporting to be connected with them. Non-departmental public bodies are not listed unless they have functions under the Crown.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000008"></a>The reason for specifying a public authority is to prevent the unscrupulous from adopting names that suggest a connection to it in order to trick the public into revealing sensitive information. The 26 listed public authorities are only those where there is seen to be a real risk of a scam&#151;attempts to defraud and so on.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000009"></a>Someone wishing to use a name that suggests a connection to one of the specified bodies must ask it to indicate whether and, if so, why it has any objections to the proposed name, although, as is made clear in the regulations, in the case of seven bodies, the applicant must seek the views of another body. The applicant must enclose a copy of any response with the request for prior approval for the name. This ensures that the decision whether to approve the name is well informed.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000010"></a>The Secretary of State&#146;s prior approval is also required if a business or registered name includes certain words or expressions. The Committee will be pleased to know that the Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business Names (Sensitive Words and Expressions) Regulations 2009 has a list of those words and expressions. There are also six words for which prior approval is required for their inclusion in a registered name but not for inclusion in a business name. I will come back to this later.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000011"></a>These regulations, which replaced the Company and Business Names Regulations 1981, were made on 25 September and came into force on 1 October. We are considering them today as they will fall unless approved by Parliament.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000012"></a>It has been suggested that a list of words requiring prior approval is no longer necessary and that trade mark law and the law on passing off might somehow be sufficient. However, this civil law protects only the private rights of the person who alleges that their name is being impersonated; trade mark law and the law on passing off do not and cannot protect the public directly. That is the purpose of these regulations.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000013"></a>About half the sensitive words and expressions in these regulations were prescribed previously. The newly prescribed words and expressions are primarily those that convey authority or status. The purpose is not to protect a sector, body or person; the purpose is to protect the public. This is because names that include these words might be used to induce members of the public to pass money or personal information. We also prescribe the Welsh and Scots Gaelic versions of words where these are considered to create a similar risk to the public as the word does in the English.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000014"></a>The six words prescribed only in relation to registered names are &#147;Cymru&#148;, &#147;Alba&#148; and the related adjectives. Both these words are in widespread use in business names, without any evidence of harm to the public. However, we consider that, in future, they should be permitted only in registered names to companies and LLPs that satisfy both a pre-eminence criterion and one based on the location of the registered office.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000015"></a>The list does not include words associated with particular commercial activities. For example, it does not include &#147;college&#148;. This is because, since 1 October, it has been an offence to carry on business under a name that gives so misleading an indication of the nature of the activities of the businesses as to be likely to cause harm to the public. The words and expressions specified in these regulations are words and expressions that might be used to mislead as to the authority, status or pre-eminence of the business.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000016"></a>To conclude, I emphasise that the purpose of both these sets of regulations is to protect the public from harm as a result of being misled as to the authority, status or pre-eminence of a company, LLP or unincorporated business. They do not prohibit any names; rather, they make the prior approval of the Secretary of State a prerequisite. I commend the instruments to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000017"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09102930000172"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these two sets of regulations, which are to do with names that companies and limited liability partnerships are prohibited from using because, as he said, to do so could mislead the public. In that respect, of course we accept the regulations and welcome the intent to protect the public from harm.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000018"></a>I hope that the Minister will forgive me for slightly pulling his leg but, in the context of numerous pieces of legislation that we have debated in your Lordships&#146; House in recent years, I can recall frequently hearing Ministers dismissing amendments on the ground that they proposed lists, arguing instead for a comprehensive but simple set of principles against which something&#151;in this case, a proposed name&#151;should be assessed. Perhaps the Minister could comment on that and explain the process by which in this case two lists were arrived at, despite the Government&#146;s distaste for such things.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000019"></a>One of the problems with lists is that you can find that you have forgotten to include something that you ought to have included. For example, the Association of Colleges has drawn the attention of some noble Lords to a problem that could, in its view, have been resolved by adding the word &#147;college&#148; to the list of prohibited names&#151;the Minister has, of course, just referred to that. The association says that it is difficult to overestimate the damage that bogus colleges are doing to the good name of British education. It also points out that there is widespread concern that bogus colleges are set up with the express purpose of enabling prospective immigrants to bypass UK immigration controls and not to provide education and training. Will the Minister expand on the Government&#146;s dismissal of adding that word to the list, given that words such as &#147;polytechnic&#148; and &#147;university&#148; are already protected?</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000020"></a>It is interesting to observe that, over time, the process of checking the availability of names, when one is setting up a new business, has changed. Until about 30 years ago, one started with the register of business names. That was abolished in the late 1970s; thereafter, the place to start was Companies House. I have been recently involved in setting up a new business in precisely this situation and one is still advised that, even if setting up an unincorporated business, one should check the availability of the business&#146;s name at Companies House. Ideally, one might then register a company with the same name as the business at Companies House in order to deter others from  using it.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000021"></a>I hate to say this to the Government, because it might imply that what we are debating today has been overtaken by events, but the single most important place to reserve your name now is not Companies House but Nominet. Also, the single most important question in selecting a name for a new business is: is an appropriate domain name available as a web address on the internet? What control do the Government have, if any, over the unauthorised use of the prohibited names listed in these two sets of regulations in domain names, which, after all, can often be bought for a few pounds? It will be on the internet that the majority of fraudulent activity will take place in the future.</p>

As my colleague has said, there are still concerns. This seems to be a rather arbitrary list at times, particularly in relation to districts. The Minister referred to this in his introduction and perhaps he can explain it.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000023"></a>The Minister has already referred to the concern about colleges, which is fair enough, but an enormous number of bogus colleges still exist in this country. Indeed, in east London, for example, some of them are simply and solely shops with &#147;College&#148; tacked on to the front. People are induced to come to this country to study at colleges that are not colleges at all, which is bad for the reputation of the educational standards of our country. It is a desperate situation where students from overseas and from within this country come to colleges, supposedly to get a reasonable education or training, and find that what they are presented with is less than adequate. While the Minister has said that the Government are aware of this, I still do not see why there should not be a multifaceted approach of including named colleges in the list. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000024"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09102930000174"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, quite rightly asked why, given our normal aversion to lists&#151;I cannot think where he got that idea from, unless it was the subject of our recent debates together&#151;we have this list. It is because we believe that it is clearer to those who wish to adopt a name. This approach is set out in the Companies Act 2006, as approved by Parliament. It is an extension of that approach and we believe that it is right in today&#146;s circumstances. It may not be ideal but we believe, on a balance of what is best to protect the public, that there is value in the list.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000025"></a>Both the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, asked about colleges and I shall give a more extensive answer on that issue. From 1 October 2009, it has been an offence under the Companies Act 2006 to carry on business in the UK under a name that gives so misleading an indication of the nature of the activities of the businesses as to be likely to cause harm to the public. The new offence addresses the issue of bogus colleges in a more inclusive and immediate way. We therefore decided against adding &#147;college&#148; to the list of words for which the Secretary of State&#146;s prior approval is required for inclusion in either a company&#146;s registered name or any person&#146;s business name.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000026"></a>The issue of bogus colleges being used in visa scams and various other fraudulent activities has  been addressed by the creation of the new UK  Border Agency register of sponsors, which lists all organisations that the UK Border Agency has approved to employ migrants or sponsor migrant students. We have focused on that area specifically because it is where the major problem occurred. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, of businesses currently trading under names that include the word &#147;college&#148;. &#147;College&#148; is used not only by education providers but by many professional bodies&#151;for example, the Royal College of Physicians&#151;as well as by other businesses such as educational suppliers and, believe it or not, pubs. The vast majority do so without any suggestion of harm to the public. If &#147;college&#148; were prescribed, because of the savings provisions in the Companies Act 2006 all businesses that were lawfully using the word in their name on  30 September 2009 would be exempt from the requirement for prior approval. The exemption would also protect any bogus colleges already in existence. However, the new offence will catch all bogus colleges and so offers greater protection.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, rightly drew domain names to our attention&#151;in the 21st century, these are as key an asset to a business as the business name. A requirement for prior approval applies to the name used by any person to carry on business in the UK, including domain names. The noble Lord pointed out that for an unincorporated company there was a value in registering it, but I think that that was more by way of comment.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000028"></a>I hope that I have addressed all noble Lords&#146; concerns. I am grateful for their contribution to the debate. We are, I believe, all agreed that the rules for company and business names should be kept to a minimum. The purpose of the regulations is to protect the public from financial or other harm resulting from their being misled by a company or business name. The sensitive words regulations list words and expressions that might be used in names  to convey authority, status or pre-eminence. The public authorities regulations list only those where  an implied connection might be used to induce vulnerable persons to reveal private information or to make payments.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000114"></a><I>Motion agreed.</I></p>

The order amends the Legislative and Regulatory Reform (Regulatory Functions) Order 2007, which Parliament approved in November 2007 and which came into force on 6 April 2008.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000031"></a>The order forms an important part of the Government&#146;s programme of regulatory reform. Since 2005, the Government have worked to improve the way in which we regulate and enforce regulations in this country. The aim is to increase the benefits that regulations can bring&#151;and these are many&#151;without, I stress, imposing needless costs and complexity on businesses. In particular, the Government have embarked on a radical overhaul of administrative burdens faced by business. For example, we are on track to deliver a savings to business of &#163;3.4 billion under the current programme to cut administrative burdens by 25 per cent by May 2010. The Government have recently set a new target to cut the ongoing costs of regulation by a further &#163;6.5 billion by 2015, bringing the total savings to UK business to around &#163;10 billion by 2015.  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Government are also determined to drive better regulation at the EU level and to deliver a risk-based and proportionate approach to regulatory supervision and enforcement across the entire regulatory landscape. It is this last aspect of the reform&#151;proportionate and risk-based enforcement of regulations&#151;that the instrument before us today primarily addresses.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000032"></a>The order seeks to ensure that regulators apply a risk-based approach to regulation. This will enable them to direct resources, which are inevitably limited, to the areas of greatest need, while minimising burdens on businesses that pose lower risks and have good records of compliance. The policy agenda flows from the recommendations in the Philip Hampton report, <I>Reducing Administrative Burdens: Effective Inspection and </I><I>E</I><I>nforcement</I>, and the report of the Better Regulation Task Force, <I>Less is More: Reducing Burdens, Improving Outcomes</I>, both published in 2005.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000033"></a>The Hampton review recommended new approaches, known as the Hampton principles, to regulatory supervision and enforcement, while the Better Regulation Task Force developed the five principles of good regulation. These principles are that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed. The Government accepted these recommendations and introduced the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 to implement them. Part 2 of the Act gives effect to this. Specifically, Section 21 of the Act enshrines the five principles of good regulation into UK law, while Section 22 enables a Minister of the Crown to issue a code of practice, based on the Hampton principles.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000034"></a>The code of practice and the regulatory principles, however, apply only to regulatory functions listed in an order made by a Minister under Section 24 of the Act. Any person whose function is listed in the order, known as the listing order, must have regard to the code and principles in exercising the function. Both the draft code of practice, now known as the Regulators&#146; Compliance Code, and the original listing order were laid before Parliament in 2007. The debates were very positive and supportive. When the instruments were debated in Grand Committee in November 2007, your Lordships welcomed their developments and particularly commended the code as a move in the right direction.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000035"></a>Both instruments came into force on 6 April 2008. Since then, 46 national regulators as well as all the local authorities in England have been under a statutory duty to have regard to the code and the five principles of good regulation when they carry out specified functions. Since the code came into force, some progress has been made by regulators to embed the code&#146;s standards into their regulatory culture and processes. Many have reviewed, or are reviewing, their existing policies to meet the requirements of the code. For example, the Health and Safety Executive has published the changes that it has made, and plans to make, to comply with the code&#146;s obligations. The Environment Agency has taken similar steps, and many local authority regulatory services appear to have aligned their enforcement policies with the provisions of the code.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000036"></a>The introduction of the code and principles is bringing about some culture change among regulators. Business, too, is beginning to feel the positive impact of the better regulation agenda and continues to support the code. Our discussions with some of our international partners have also shown the extent to which our work in this area is setting an international lead. It is because of the significant benefits that the code and the principles can deliver for regulators and those that they regulate that the Government have decided, through the order before us today, to extend their coverage to more national and local regulators.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000037"></a>In particular, the order seeks to extend the code and principles to three new areas. First, there are the local authorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where they perform reserved regulatory functions. Unlike English local authorities, these are currently excluded from the application of the code and principles. Secondly, there are public sector regulators, such as Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, where they regulate business and third sector organisations. Thirdly, there are other relevant areas of national regulation, such as the money-laundering regulations, where the burdens imposed on business and the third sector can be significant.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000038"></a>Extending the code and principles to these new areas will ensure that the overwhelming majority of businesses and third sector organisations in the UK are regulated within the consistent and transparent statutory framework that the code and principles provide. This will ensure regulatory consistency and create a level playing field for most businesses across the UK. I stress that the order is a vital part of the Government&#146;s effort to reduce unnecessary burdens on UK businesses and create a more efficient and competitive economy. It is important&#151;even more so in the current economic situation&#151;that we reduce any regulatory obstacle to business competitiveness.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000039"></a>Of course, it also important to stress that better regulation is not about removing necessary protections; rather, it is about making regulation as simple as possible for everyone&#151;consumers, workers and business, as well the economy and society as a whole. The aim is to get the best outcome in the most efficient way, not to water down those outcomes. The order seeks to support regulators in a manner that ensures the optimal outcomes.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000040"></a>Finally, I emphasise the extent and depth of consultation with interested parties on the draft instrument. For over 13 weeks, officials actively consulted different stakeholders to seek their views on the draft order. Where necessary, officials met further with key stakeholders to discuss any concerns about the order. I am confident that the instrument enjoys the support of most key stakeholders. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000041"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102930000179"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining the order. Reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on both the public and private sectors is a worthwhile aim, strongly supported on this side of the House. To that extent, the order is welcome. However, in the <I>Making It Simple</I> annual review 2008, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, stated that the Government were on target to reduce the overall burden of regulation by 25 per cent. The Minister himself just referred to this.  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>How does he square that figure with the most recent burdens barometer produced by the British Chambers of Commerce, which found that the total cost of regulation to business since 1998 had risen to &#163;76.8 billion? Indeed, this is an increase of &#163;10.8 billion from last year.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000042"></a>The Better Regulation Task Force established five principles of good regulation, to which the Minister referred. Those principles were designed to be a useful toolkit for assessing and improving the quality of regulation. The principles, as the noble Lord said, are proportionality, accountability, consistency, transparency and targeting.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000043"></a>I make the following observation about the order, because it is drafted&#151;as many orders are&#151;simply as a series of amendments to extant legislation and, when read on its own, is completely incomprehensible. The first things that it comes to&#151;after the wherefores and whereases&#151;are amendments to the 2007 order, but you need to get hold of the 2007 order to know what it is all about. Even then, the lay man would be hard pushed to make head or tail of it. Does that not breach the transparency test? The Explanatory Memorandum is indeed helpful, but that is not quite the same thing. I ask the Minister how those who are in business, who are often untrained and inexperienced in reading and interpreting orders and legislation generally, would know whether it applied to them and in what way.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000044"></a>Turning briefly to the impact assessment, can the Minister tell me whether the figure of &#163;2.8 million for one-off costs is per regulator or across the whole country? As to the range of total benefits, which is stated as being from &#163;2 million to &#163;45.2 million, I observe that under any interpretation of the word &#147;materiality&#148; this is sufficiently wide to cause some scepticism. What does it mean and why is it so wide?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000045"></a>Returning to the order, I note that it is stated that the traffic commissioners have been assured that the code and principles do not apply to their functions of conducting civil or criminal proceedings. It would be helpful to have on the record the reason for this exclusion.</p>
<h5><a name="09102930000157"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09102930000046"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09102930000180"></a>Lord Cotter:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing this measure. Indeed, as has already been said, we cannot but approve of the aim to reduce the burden of regulation and bureaucracy on all people and businesses, particularly small businesses. However, one aspect that concerns these Benches is the difficulty of getting clarity as to exactly what is being proposed today in order that we may discuss it. That in itself is an area of concern.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000047"></a>Can the Minister give an assurance that, in order to achieve the aims set out, the order does not place too many burdens on small businesses? Trying to ensure that regulation is carried out in a proportionate and transparent way could have the reverse effect if small businesses, in particular, find difficulty in coming to terms with what they are being asked to do.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000048"></a>I believe that I am correct in saying that a review is proposed in 2011. How do the Government intend to carry out this review process? The Minister said that a   


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great deal of consultation took place before the order was introduced but, in order to assess the results such a short time after its introduction, many people will need to be consulted and asked for their views, particularly those with small businesses. I would be pleased to know exactly what effect the Minister feels this will have on small businesses. Will we hear back from them about how the better regulation system is operating?</p>

<p><a name="09102930000049"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09102930000181"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, I am not sure that I have the answers to all the questions, but I shall address those to which I do have answers.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked about the exclusion of the traffic commissioners&#146; judicial functions. The 2006 Act specifically excludes from the definition of regulatory function,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000143"></a>&#147;any function of conducting criminal or civil proceedings&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000116"></a>which means that, to the extent that quasi-judicial bodies are carrying out any function of conducting criminal or civil proceedings, such a function is excluded from the scope of the code. It is not the Government&#146;s intention to go beyond the specific language used in the Act.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000051"></a>I am looking for inspiration from behind me for an explanation as to why, according to the British Chambers of Commerce, the regulatory burdens barometer is moving towards stormy rather than fair weather. The UK now has the best ranked business environment in Europe and the fifth best in the world, according to the World Bank&#146;s &#147;Ease of Doing Business&#148; index, which analyses the regulatory environment of 183 countries. The Government have delivered more than &#163;2 billion in annual net savings by cutting out-of-date and unnecessary paperwork for businesses. That is &#163;5 million a day, every day. This is on track to meet the target of a 25 per cent cut and is expected to deliver &#163;3.4 billion in savings.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000052"></a>As to the point about the British Chambers of Commerce, it is a question of the methodology that it uses. There is another phrase in my brief but I cannot decode it; I think that I have some cryptographers working behind me.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000053"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, talked about the one-off costs per regulator. Those one-off costs are across the country, apparently, which I think answers another question.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000054"></a>A further point was made about the impact on SMEs. My understanding is that this will be beneficial regardless of the size of the business in reducing the regulatory burden. I can think of one area that I am sure impacts on most of us, which is to get it right when trying to open and close bank accounts and the amount of evidence that you are required to produce. There is certainly potential in that area. I hope that I am right in saying that the size of the business should not have anything to do with it. The aim and intention is at one with the Hampton review; the recommendations are exactly the same.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000055"></a>With regard to the point about the British Chambers of Commerce, although we agree with the methodology, we think that the figures that we have quoted about the savings are reliable, so we may have to agree to disagree on this. If I have not said it already, we have  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set a new and ambitious target to cut the ongoing costs of regulation by a further &#163;6.5 billion over the next five years.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000056"></a>I thank noble Lords for their consideration of this draft instrument. I emphasise that its aim is to ensure that national and local regulators apply a risk-based and targeted approach to regulation so as to improve outcomes and minimise burdens on businesses. Many UK regulators are already working within the statutory framework provided by the Regulators&#146; Compliance Code and to the principles of good regulation. This instrument will ensure that more and more regulators operate within the same framework. This is important because business, especially small businesses, needs an environment where regulation is effective and bureaucracy is minimised. In the current economic climate, I am sure that noble Lords would agree that this is more important than ever. It is also important because we can protect the environment, reduce accidents, protect workers and thus maintain an efficient and competitive economy only if we have appropriate and good-quality regulation that is properly and fairly enforced.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000057"></a>This instrument will bring real benefits to many groups: to regulators, because they will be able to target their resources more effectively; to business, because the costs of regulation will fall; to society, because rogue operators will be more effectively targeted and tackled; and to the economy, because removing burdens on business will enable the UK to retain its competitive edge in the global economy. On that note, I ask the Committee to approve the Motion.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000058"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09102930000183"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Lord Young of Norwood Green):</b> My Lords, the regulations before the Committee today implement the EU services directive into UK law. The regulations concern both the provision and the regulation of services. They are therefore relevant to service providers and to authorities with a supervisory or regulatory role in relation to services&#151;termed &#147;competent authorities&#148;. The directive represents a great step forward for the internal market in bringing down barriers to business in the EU and is a major achievement of better regulation across the EU.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000059"></a>Although the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment are already set out in the treaty establishing the European Community, services  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>businesses trying to set up or trade in the internal market have still faced unnecessary obstacles. Some countries have imposed rules discriminating against businesses from abroad. Businesses have also had to apply for different licences for each country or region in which they want to operate. These obstacles have meant that some businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises without the ability to pay local experts, have been unable to market their services abroad or have found it uneconomic to do so. Trade in services accounts for only 24 per cent of the trade in the internal market, even though services account for 70 per cent of EU GDP.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000060"></a>As noble Lords will no doubt be aware, the directive covers around two-thirds of the service sector as a whole. The directive excludes some services industries, such as financial services, healthcare, gambling and transport. This is due to the fact that EU legislation exists in some of those excluded areas already and that liberalisation was seen as undesirable for others. However, the directive still represents the horizontal piece of legislation that we were striving for. Details on scope are in Part 1 of the regulations.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000061"></a>The directive, which these regulations will put into UK law, has been incorporated into the EEA agreement. The regulations therefore apply in relation to the EEA states of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as the 27 EU member states.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000062"></a>There are four main elements to the directive, and thus to the regulations, which I will outline in the order in which they appear in the regulations. First, Part 2 of the regulations concerns the quality of services provided to recipients. To increase recipients&#146; confidence in buying services from abroad, all service businesses will have to provide consumers with certain information about the business and the service in question. The requirements are simple and should not present a burden for UK businesses as we anticipate that most of them will already be doing this as common practice. We hope that consumers will benefit from increased quality, competition and choice, and that this will result in a wider customer base for businesses offering services.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000063"></a>Secondly, Parts 3, 4, and 5 of the regulations set out legal requirements on competent authorities regarding their regulation and supervision of service providers and recipients. These provisions reflect the requirement in the directive that all such authorities across the EU remove unjustified, disproportionate or discriminatory legislative and administrative barriers to providing services. These could include requiring a prospective service provider to register with an authority or to establish premises in a particular country, in the absence of an adequate policy rationale. Part 6 of the regulations places several other requirements on competent authorities that will benefit both service providers and recipients. For example, authorities must recognise equivalent documentation and equivalent professional liability insurance from service providers and recipients from other member states.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000064"></a>Thirdly, the directive requires each member state to set up a point of single contact, which is termed the &#147;electronic assistance facility&#148; in the regulations and is provided for in Part 8. The electronic assistance facility  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be a web portal where businesses can find the information they need about operating in the UK and apply online for any necessary licences or authorisations that are in the scope of the directive. Other states are establishing similar facilities. This will greatly simplify the current situation where businesses have to spend time and money finding information from different places, often having to visit the relevant competent authority in the country where they wish to operate. In future they will be able to apply for and receive authorisation online.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000065"></a>This is a good opportunity for me to thank local councils and other competent authorities for their hard work in screening their processes and laws and preparing for the point of single contact. It has been a huge task, so my thanks go to them for their commitment.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000066"></a>The fourth element is enhanced co-operation between regulators across the EU, which is provided for in Part 9 of the regulations. Competent authorities will be able to communicate with each other through a secure web-based system called the Internal Market Information system, which my department is establishing now. Part 9 of the regulations requires authorities to provide information through the system to their counterparts in other countries regarding whether a service provider is duly authorised and other relevant matters. This will take the burden off the service provider to provide documentation repeatedly to different authorities. The system is also intended to ensure proper regulatory supervision of service providers and the services they provide across EU borders.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000067"></a>Effective implementation of the services directive across the EU is estimated to be worth about &#163;4 billion to &#163;6 billion per year to the UK economy, and about &#8364;30 billion per year to the EU economy. Member states must implement the services directive by 28 December of this year. The Provision of Services Regulations will also come into force on that date, and will apply to the whole of the UK. The devolved Administrations are amending their own legislation where necessary so that it complies with the directive.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000068"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that this is great news for UK businesses whether they want to export their services to Europe, purchase services from providers in other member states or take advantage of the streamlined processes here in the UK. The increased opportunities are also there for foreign businesses to invest in the UK, all of which in turn is great news for the UK economy. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000069"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09102930000184"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. I note from the Explanatory Memorandum that they set out rules relating to the provision of services and implement the services directive. If the directive works as we all hope it will, and if it is properly implemented across Europe, it should bring benefits to British businesses, which would be very welcome.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000070"></a>The objective of the services directive is to open up the single market by removing and reforming costly and time-consuming national standards and approval procedures. The Conservatives have been at the forefront of pushing for this in the EU Parliament. It will mean  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that service providers will be able to operate in all member states without prior authorisation or the need to set up a local subsidiary. However, I would not be fulfilling my task in opposition if I did not focus on areas of doubt, especially about where the regulations part company with the directive. I apologise to noble Lords because I have quite a number of questions, some of them rather technical. Before I go further, I should declare an interest: I am a chartered accountant and from time to time I provide management consultancy advice. I believe that those who provide such a service are covered by the regulations.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000071"></a>Having listened to the debate in your Lordships' House on Friday on the report of the European Union Committee, <I>EU </I><I>C</I><I>onsumer </I><I>R</I><I>ights </I><I>D</I><I>irective</I><I>:</I><I>Getting it </I><I>R</I><I>ight</I>, I was struck that it had certain threads in common with this debate. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000144"></a>&#147;if you try to buy insurance in Spain because you believe it is cheaper you are bunged back&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000117"></a>those were his technical words&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000145"></a>&#147;into the British website&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000118"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000134"></a>&#147;Some business practices are a greater inhibition to cross-border trade than the regulatory framework&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/10/09; col. 933.]</p>

<p><a name="09102930000119"></a>As the Minister explained, financial services are not included in the regulations. However, I raise the issue to make a broader point about cultural practices on which he may like to comment.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000072"></a>The British Chambers of Commerce has communicated with me, as I am sure it has with other noble Lords, and one of its key concerns is about the pace and quality of implementation of the directive across the rest of the EU. This would not be the first time that the UK had entered zealously into the spirit of an EU directive only to find that it had not been followed with such alacrity in other EU nations. What are the Government doing to ensure that we do not, once again, welcome foreign competition in but find our own businesses not so welcomed elsewhere? I have learnt that in most EU states the web-based points of single contact will work only in the national language. If true, it does not sound very encouraging. What work are the Government doing with other member states to develop the single points of contact so that they operate as they should?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000073"></a>Paragraph 3 .2 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000135"></a>&#147;It is our view that imposing obligations on all service providers (and not just those set out in the Services Directive) ... is a proper exercise of the power&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000120"></a>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but it appears that while here in the UK all suppliers, including those from outside the EU and EEA, are covered because the regulations extend beyond the requirements of the directive, in other countries suppliers from outside the EU and the EEA are not covered. Can the Minister confirm that this means that the directive does not create a level playing field elsewhere in the EU? If that is right, what representations have the UK Government made to the Commission to try to get this anomaly changed?</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000074"></a>I notice from paragraph 3.5 of the Explanatory Memorandum that the drafter has</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000146"></a>&#147;extended the provisions in Part 3 to cover a provider of UK origin supplying services to a recipient of UK origin&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000121"></a>Can the Minister confirm that domestic providers supplying services to recipients in their own countries&#151;for example, in France, Italy, Spain or Poland&#151;are not required by the directive to be covered? That is the implication. If that is so, is this not a somewhat blatant example of gold-plating?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000075"></a>I read at the top of page 4 of the department&#146;s <I>Guidance for Business on the Provision of Services Regulations</I>, published this month that, among other things, the services directive requires each EEA state to,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000147"></a>&#147;set up a point of single contact&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000122"></a>the web-based point of single contact to which I referred earlier&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000148"></a>&#147;enabling service providers to apply and pay for authorisations (to offer or provide services) online&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000123"></a>I remind your Lordships that this directive applies fairly and squarely to a number of already perfectly adequately regulated providers of services. I hope that the Minister can convince me that this wording &#147;and pay for&#148; is not simply creating another opportunity for yet another stealth tax on business, which this Government can seize upon with their usual keenness. </p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000076"></a>I have a number of technical questions taken in order from the regulations. Regulation 2 refers to specific sectors and/or instruments where the rules do not apply. Regulation 6 refers to the relationship with other Community instruments. Concerns have been expressed to me that the test set out in the paragraph, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000136"></a>&#147;A requirement imposed by Parts 2, 5 or 6 of these Regulations on a competent authority or provider of a service does not apply, if or to the extent that, the competent authority or provider cannot comply both with that requirement and with a requirement to which this paragraph applies&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09102930000124"></a>is a different test from that in Article 3 of the services directive.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000077"></a>Article 3 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000137"></a>&#147;If the provisions of this Directive conflict with the provision of another Community act governing specific aspects of access to or exercise of a service activity in specific sectors, or for specific professions, the provision of the other Community act shall prevail and shall apply to those specific sectors or professions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000125"></a>Can the Minister explain why the regulations do not more exactly reflect the directive?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000078"></a>In the definition of &#147;regulated profession&#148; under Article 4(11), the directive states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000149"></a>&#147;regulated profession means a professional activity or a group of professional activities as referred to in Article 3(1)(a) of the Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/35/EC&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000126"></a>The definition in the regulations restates this definition more or less, save for a change. The directive 2005/36/ED defines &#147;regulated profession&#148; as,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000150"></a>&#147;a professional activity, or group of professional activities, access to which, the pursuit of which, or one of the modes of pursuit of which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications; in particular, the use of a professional title limited by legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to holders of a given professional qualification shall constitute a  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mode of pursuit. Where the first sentence of this definition does not apply, a profession referred to in paragraph 2 shall be treated as a regulated profession&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000127"></a>However, the draft regulations express it as follows:</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000151"></a>&#147;&#145;regulated profession&#146; means a professional activity or group of activities</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000138"></a>(a) access to which, the pursuit of which or one of the modes of pursuit of which is subject (directly or indirectly) by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specified qualifications, or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000139"></a>(b) the pursuit of which is by persons using a professional title which is limited by legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to holders of a given professional qualification&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000128"></a>Once again, can the Minister explain&#151;perhaps not today but in writing afterwards&#151;why the regulations do not more accurately reflect the directive?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000079"></a>On paragraph 2(2) of Regulation 12, can the Minister explain why the words &#147;frivolous or totally without merit&#148; were not inserted after the word &#147;vexatious&#148; to bring the regulation into line with, among other things, the terms of the Illegal Services Act 2007?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000080"></a>In Regulation 32, there is no definition of &#147;electronic procedures&#148;, so does this include e-mail confirmation, or is it restricted to web-based solutions?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000081"></a>In paragraph 2(b) of Regulation 34, there is a reference to &#147;professional secrecy&#148;. Such language is not generally legally recognised in the United Kingdom. Can the Minister confirm that this means the equivalent of an obligation of confidentiality or legal professional privilege?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000082"></a>In relation to Part 7 and the obligations for information to be provided by competent authorities, what is the role of the devolved Administrations? The obligation under Regulations 36 and 38 relate only to the Secretary of State. The interpretation provision does not, for example, make reference to &#147;Scottish Ministers&#148;. Should it? In Regulation 38, the Secretary of State and the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs must jointly provide a facility which will become the point of single contact. What role is there for Scottish Ministers in relation to this?</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000083"></a>The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has specifically raised the matter of pedlars, and my noble friend Lord Lucas will in a moment ask for the Minister&#146;s assurances on that question, which is important. That committee also reported that,</p>
<ul><a name="09102930000152"></a>&#147;given the broad scope of these Regulations, it will be vital to their success that the Government ensures that all affected service providers are aware of the new requirements. The Government may therefore wish to enhance their efforts in this regard&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09102930000129"></a>I would be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that point.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000084"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09102930000185"></a>Lord Cotter:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing this measure. It is clearly very welcome at this time, when we have so many problems with the economy and in business. Anything that will help businesses to increase their opportunities is to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000085"></a>The points that have been made about a level playing field are quite fair. We must ensure that there will really be an open market and that things are as they are portrayed. However, concern has been expressed to me that, even in this country, we may not be fully

It is very important that, on the one hand, we see implementation carried out fairly elsewhere and that, on the other hand, in this country we are up and running and able to do so ourselves. We, too, need to be seen to be operating fairly.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000086"></a>Rightly or wrongly, a figure suggested to me is that only 10 per cent of businesses&#151;particularly, perhaps, small businesses&#151;are aware of this opportunity. Can the Minister assure me that awareness of the opportunity will be increased and widespread? It is suggested that only 10 per cent of businesses will be aware of it, so will the Minister consider at least how we can ensure that within this country those who are able to take the opportunities will be aware of them and thereby be able to engage in them?</p>

<p><a name="09102930000087"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09102930000186"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I start by declaring an interest. I run a business, publishing the<I> Good Schools Guide</I>, which is likely to be affected by this directive. I agree with my noble friend Lord De Mauley that it is important that businesses be told about this directive, and I note from the Explanatory Memorandum that some desultory contacts have been made with the major organisations. To get to the wide range of service providers, much more is needed. I suggest that it might go out with people&#146;s VAT returns, for example. A VAT return is an official document to which you can fairly well guarantee people will pay attention. It is a common method of communication on taxation and other matters. Certainly, the efforts made to date have not reached me in any form, and I hope that in the coming months I shall hear something from the Government.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000088"></a>My particular interest is in Regulation 45, which concerns street trading and its application to pedlars. Over the past few days there has been considerable correspondence between the secretary of the Merits Committee and the department, for which I am grateful. One part of that reads as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000140"></a>&#147;There are no organisations which represent the interest of pedlars, however, BIS is shortly to consult on the future of pedlar legislation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000130"></a>That means both that this is the department responsible for pedlars and that it does not know what the pedlar organisations are. A moment&#146;s consideration of all the legislation that has passed through this House and the other place over the past three years, started by a whole procession of local authorities, would have enabled the department to know exactly who the pedlar organisations were, who represented them and who worked for them. I have calmed down now but it made me astonishingly angry that the department either should have been so careless of the needs of those for whom it is legislating or was telling an out and out lie. I find it difficult to know which of those it was. It is astonishing: how can you say that you are in charge of pedlars and not know what has been happening in Parliament over the past three years and therefore know exactly who to approach? As I hope the department has found out over the past couple of days, the pedlars are well organised, they have a well established, representative system and they are quite capable of reacting to legislation.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000089"></a>The latest communication that I have received from the pedlars&#146; side of business reads as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000141"></a>&#147;The Opinion of Counsel for BIS dictates an arbitrary removal of the protection of a Pedlars Certificate from some currently lawful pedlars. We are informed that under the Services Regulation they will not require a Certificate. Implementation of the Regulations will immediately criminalise them under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 for not having legal authority (Pedlars Certificate) to carry out their activities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000131"></a>I do not know where this matter rests. I understand that I cannot press it to a Division today but, when we come to approve these regulations in the Chamber, I very much hope that the matter will have been settled between the department and its newly discovered friends, the pedlars&#146; representatives. I hope that we shall know that this section does not harm pedlars or, if it does, that the Government will say at that point what steps they intend to take to rectify the harm caused by their own omissions. If we do not get that assurance when we come to approve the regulations in the Chamber, I shall certainly press the matter to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000090"></a><b><a name="91029-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09102930000187"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, I thank all those who have contributed to this fascinating but somewhat complex and technical debate. I cannot guarantee that I shall answer every question precisely but I will ensure that, if I do not do so today orally, I will cover every point in writing. I think that the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, will agree that he posed a significant number of questions. However, with the assistance of those sitting behind me, I shall do my best.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000091"></a>I was asked whether other countries&#146; points of single contact will be ready by the deadline of 28 December. We know that plans for PSCs are well advanced in some other member states, including key UK markets such as Spain, the Netherlands and parts of Germany. Some other states appear less advanced according to the Commission. However, all EEA states are committed to introducing a PSC and the UK will continue to work to encourage progress.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000092"></a>I was asked whether other points of single contact would include English as a language. Some countries&#151;for example, the Netherlands and Denmark&#151;made a commitment to provide material in English, but not all countries have done so at this stage.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000093"></a>Another question was whether the UK has been working with other Governments on the development of the points of single contact? We have actively participated in Commission-led implementation working groups and in a number of bilaterals, and we co-sponsored two EU-wide events for PSC experts and advisers across Europe in November 2008 and in 2009.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000094"></a>I was asked about implementation in other member states and mutual evaluation. All member states are working to the same implementation date, making legislation in accordance with their own parliamentary procedures. As I said, plans for the points of single contact are well advanced in some other member states, including key UK markets such as Spain, the Netherlands and parts of Germany. In some others, arrangements will take a little longer. The UK will continue to work to support implementation at the European level.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000095"></a>I was asked what we are doing to ensure that other member states implement effectively. In terms of direct interaction with other member states, the UK has played a leading role in developing effective points of single contact, and early in the implementation process we encouraged other member states to develop PSCs which cater for business needs. We organised two events for PSC experts to share best practice, co-funded the development of a common branding for PSCs across Europe&#151;the EUGO brand&#151;and provided a website. Lastly, we have pushed other member states to consider promoting PSCs both nationally and across Europe. We continue to stress the importance of the full implementation of the services directive in other member states in meetings at EU level. In the six months after implementation, the first half of 2010, member states and the Commission will evaluate how far barriers to the setting up or carrying on of the business have been reduced, and a consistent approach is encouraged across the EEA. The UK is working with her European counterparts to ensure that the process is transparent and effective, while the Commission will report the outcome of mutual evaluation to the European Parliament and Council.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked why the information provisions are being extended to non-EEA providers. By applying the information provisions to all those providing a service in the UK, we are aiming to ensure a high quality of services for consumers and, in particular, to ensure that they have access to a minimum amount of information about the complaints procedure whomever they buy services from. We also want to avoid creating parallel regimes for service providers depending on where they are established.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000097"></a>On the question of conflict, when requirements on competent authorities do not apply, Article 3 of the services directive concerns the relationship with the provisions of other Community law. We have not copied out the wording from Article 3 in our regulations as it does not provide sufficient legal certainty, not least because the term &#147;conflict&#148; is open to interpretation. Regulation 6 has been drafted so as to transpose our understanding of a conflict in order to provide legal certainty. Our understanding is that a conflict will occur whenever a requirement in the services directive and a requirement in another Community instrument contradict each other to the extent that it is impossible to comply with both. This interpretation is consistent with guidance on the implementation of the services directive published by the European Commission, and it is a principle of Community law that exceptions in Community legislation must be strictly construed. Regulation 6 therefore requires a competent authority to do whatever is necessary to comply with the requirements in Parts 2 to 6 of the provision of services regulations and a requirement derived from another Community instrument. It will often be possible to comply with both requirements by taking a single action, such as complying with the stricter of the two requirements in order to ensure compliance with both. However, if it is not possible to comply with both, the requirement deriving from the other Community instrument will prevail.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000098"></a>The question arose of why the definition of a &#147;regulated profession&#148; differs from that of the EU professional qualifications directive. Regulation 4 is consistent with how the UK has transposed the Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/36/EC. There is a distinction between the two categories of professional bodies as reflected in the directive, and Regulation 4 makes this distinction clearer.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000099"></a>The requirement to pay for an application online was described as a stealth tax, but that is not the case. Many applications already need to be accompanied by a fee. It would be less helpful to businesses if they could apply electronically but then had to post the fee. </p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000100"></a>I was asked why the drafting of vexatious complaints does not include those which are frivolous or totally without merit. Regulation 12(2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09102930000142"></a>&#147;Paragraph (1)(b) does not apply to complaints that are vexatious&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09102930000132"></a>That is, service providers do not have to find a satisfactory solution to complaints that are vexatious, although they do have to respond to them. The term &#147;vexatious complaints&#148; covers frivolous complaints, so we thought there was no need to provide further wording in the drafting. We have set out clearly in the guidance that vexatious complaints may include complaints that are unsubstantiated or malicious.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000101"></a>I was asked about the role of Scottish Ministers in relation to the provision of a point of single contact. The Secretary of State and the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs must jointly provide a facility which will become the point of single contact. I am not clear about their role, so I shall cover it in writing as well; my apologies for that. What is the role of devolved Administrations in the obligation in Part 7 for information to be provided to the Secretary of State by competent authorities? The obligation under Regulations 36 and 38 relate only to the Secretary of State. The interpretation provision does not make reference to Scottish Ministers. In line with their equivalents in Northern Ireland and Wales, Scottish Ministers have agreed to have a single UK point of contact. It is therefore sufficient that the information specified is provided to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000102"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, raised the question of pedlars. The provisions were included in the draft regulations which my department made available for comment in May and June. My department notified the pedlar community of the proposals on the day that the draft regulations were published. Although some interest was generated and some questions were raised, no changes to the provisions were requested. My department will shortly consult on the future of pedlar legislation. The possibility of introducing a replacement scheme for pedlars solely of services which would be compliant with the services directive is addressed in that document. However, although it is difficult to ascertain, we believe there are very few pedlars solely of services and, as this regulation lifts a requirement on them, it seems unlikely that a replacement scheme is likely to attract much support.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000103"></a>On the possibility of criminalisation, we would say absolutely not. The regulations will ensure that pedlars who trade solely in services will no longer have to apply for a pedlars certificate. Street trader licences  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>apply to traders in articles; for example, traders in markets or fixed pitches. The regulations will not require pedlars of services to comply with the street trading regime.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000104"></a>The regulations propose to amend the Pedlars Act 1871 by removing the requirement for pedlars solely of services to be certified. The services directive requires EU states to remove any authorisation schemes which cannot be justified as non-discriminatory, proportionate and necessary on carefully defined grounds such as public safety and public security. In the Government&#146;s view, the pedlar certification scheme amounts to an authorisation scheme, which cannot easily be justified on these criteria. The changes will affect only a very restricted class of trader: pedlars who trade solely in services. The majority of pedlars in the UK who trade in goods will remain unaffected by the changes.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000105"></a>I hope that I have satisfied most of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. If he has any further concerns, no doubt he would be happy to address them in writing and we would try to respond further.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000106"></a>Noble Lords asked what the Government are doing to ensure that businesses are aware of the benefits and obligations in the regulations. We are carrying out a major communications drive to raise general awareness of the directive among businesses. It is of the utmost importance that we tell them about the benefits that will be available to them. If they are not aware, the resulting benefits will not accrue to the UK economy.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000107"></a>Our communications work involves a range of different channels. They include: attendance and presentations at conferences and business events; distributing messages via business organisations and trade associations; media features; and website and electronic communications. We are working closely with all the usual suspects; that is, the Federation of Small Businesses, the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce&#151;we are thankful for their continued support and efforts. In September, we emailed information packs to around 3,000 small businesses and a wide range of service providers via trade associations. We have specifically targeted 145 relevant trade associations and started to place articles

We have published detailed guidance on the regulations for business, available on the BIS website. We appreciate that there is a need for shorter guidance for small businesses. We have distributed flyers which summarise what the directive means for business, and the FSB has asked us to work with it to help produce its own short, snappy guidance for small businesses. We will continue to deliver messages about the benefits to business as much as possible over the coming months through speeches, events and media articles.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000108"></a>I think that we ought to take away the idea about VAT. I do not feel capable of responding yea or nay to that. However, we will take it away and respond in writing to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000109"></a>I doubt that I have covered every question, certainly not all those raised by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, but we will respond in writing. We will carefully scrutinise <I>Hansard</I> so that we respond to the right things.</p>

<a name="91029-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09102930000110"></a>I thank noble Lords for giving their time to the consideration of this draft instrument. I apologise for the length of my reply, but I emphasise the benefits and opportunities that these regulations will bring to businesses in the UK. I hope that they will go some way to help to boost the UK economy at a time when that is greatly needed. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09102932000003"></a><b><a name="91029-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09102932000085"></a>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09102932000004"></a>I am pleased to announce that implementation of the Armed Forces Act 2006 will be completed and the Act will come into force on 31 October. The legislation establishes for the first time a single system of service law across the Armed Forces. It preserves the important principle of a separate service justice system, reflecting the particular circumstances of the Armed Forces, and keeps the commanding officer at the heart of service discipline. It also promotes greater fairness, which in turn supports operational effectiveness.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09102932000005"></a>The new single, harmonised and modernised system of service law will apply to the personnel of all three services at all times, wherever in the world they are serving. It will also apply to some civilians, but only overseas and in specified circumstances.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09102932000006"></a>When the new legislation comes into force, a number of Acts of Parliament will be repealed, including the current Service Discipline Acts (the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957).</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09102932000007"></a>The Armed Forces Act 2006 was the largest and arguably the most significant piece of legislation the Ministry of Defence has ever put before Parliament. Its implementation has been a lengthy and complex process, but the new single system of service law that it has established will serve the Armed Forces well for many years to come.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09102932000008"></a>Guidance on the new service justice system is provided in the Manual of Service Law, which is now available on the Armed Forces Act 2006 website at the following link: <a href="http://www.mod.uk">http://www.mod.uk</a>.

<a name="09102932000015"></a><b><a name="91029-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09102932000088"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council was held in Luxembourg on 23 October 2009. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs (Meg Hillier), the Scottish Minister for Community Safety (Fergus Ewing), and I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the council.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09102932000016"></a>The council began in Mixed Committee with non-EU Schengen states, receiving an update from the presidency on arrangements for the first milestone test for the second generation Schengen information system  (SIS II). The UK stressed that the test should take place by the end of this year in line with the June council conclusions. The UK also stated that it was important to distinguish between a delayed and a failed test and that it would not accept a decision on the future of SIS II unless a test had failed.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09102932000017"></a>Next, the presidency presented an update on the current state of play on the implementation of the regulation establishing the visa information system (VIS), where technical problems would delay the launch. The UK does not participate in that regulation.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09102932000018"></a>Following Mixed Committee, the presidency invited the Commission to provide a summary of the fifth annual visa reciprocity report. While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we do maintain an interest in all visa issues, notably for full reciprocity with third country nationals. The council then exchanged views on the Canadian decision to impose visas on  


<notus-date day="29" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS109"></a><b>29 Oct 2009 : Column WS109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Czech nationals. The UK believes the Commission should continue to engage with the Canadians to broker a solution.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09102932000019"></a>The council reached agreement on the draft framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities, which aims to increase mutual trust in DNA and fingerprint data exchanged between member states by requiring a minimum standard of accreditation. The presidency hoped that the framework decision would be formally adopted at the November JHA Council.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09102932000020"></a>The council then reached a general approach on the proposal for a council decision to establish the European crime prevention network. This instrument will strengthen the network&#146;s ability to identify, exchange and disseminate crime prevention information and actions targeted at traditional or volume crime. Following receipt of the European Parliament&#146;s opinion on the proposal, the decision will come back to the council on 30 November for formal adoption.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09102932000021"></a>Under any other business the Commission presented its review of visa facilitation in the western Balkans. The UK does not participate in the part of the Schengen acquis that covers visa liberalisation, and will not be lifting visit visa requirements for western Balkan states when the Schengen zone liberalises its own requirements.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09102932000023"></a>In the afternoon, Justice Ministers adopted a council resolution on a road map for strengthening procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in criminal proceedings. The UK supported this pragmatic approach and the focus on practical measures as well as legislation. Justice Ministers also reached a general approach on a draft framework decision and an accompanying draft resolution on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. The UK congratulated the presidency on reaching agreement on this measure which will make a real difference to the lives of citizens.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09102932000024"></a>The presidency updated Justice Ministers on the progress that has been made at official level on the proposed framework decision on transfer of proceedings in criminal matters. The UK stated that its support of this measure would depend on amendments being made to the proposal, particularly provisions relating to jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09102932000025"></a>The presidency provided an update on negotiations and sought views with the aim of resolving outstanding issues on the framework decision on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting victims. The Commission stressed the importance of going further than the Council of Europe convention and welcomed the global approach to combating trafficking. It appealed, however, for higher levels of penalties and for greater assistance for victims. The UK supported the presidency compromise and, despite the UK having very limited extraterritorial jurisdiction, said that it had taken the decision to extend jurisdiction to cover UK nationals who commit trafficking offences abroad given the seriousness of the offences involved.

<a name="09102932000027"></a><b><a name="91029-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09102932000089"></a>The Minister for Trade and Investment (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> This year, GEW runs from 16 to 22 November. This is the UK's second GEW an initiative inspired by BIS and co-founded with the Kauffman Foundation in the USA. There will be more than 80 countries taking part in this years entertaining and stimulating week.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09102932000028"></a>Highlighting the importance of entrepreneurship is crucial for the future aspirations of millions of young people and the economic future of the UK. Entrepreneurs innovate, create jobs, increase economic growth and therefore help ensure a nation's competitiveness. They spot opportunities, take risks, have ideas and make them happen.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09102932000029"></a>GEW will help budding British entrepreneurs; by accessing international networks they will be able to brainstorm new ideas, enter new markets and find new resources. It will encourage the UK's young people to become entrepreneurs, through interactive events that engage those who would not otherwise have considered enterprise. And by connecting British youth with young people abroad, it should increase the level of cultural understanding in the UK.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09102932000030"></a>It is not just about entrepreneurs and business start-ups, the week will also encourage organisations across the globe to celebrate and recognise the wealth of talent that is evident in every business and to encourage their employees to start thinking about ideas that have a very clear and tangible business benefit.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09102932000031"></a>Last year, GEW was an enormous success and generated community interest in entrepreneurship; 644,000 people attended the 6,363 events. The single largest activity was the make your mark challenge which involved 56,000 students from schools and colleges. Around the world there were at least 25,000 events across 77 countries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09102932000034"></a>Today I am publishing a consultation response, which is the latest stage in the development of the new system we are introducing for the regulation of health and adult social care.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09102932000035"></a>The publication, <I>Response to </I><I>C</I><I>onsultation </I><I>o</I><I>n </I><I>t</I><I>he Draft Regulations </I><I>f</I><I>or </I><I>t</I><I>he Framework </I><I>f</I><I>or </I><I>t</I><I>he Registration </I><I>o</I><I>f Health </I><I>a</I><I>nd Adult Social Care Providers</I> sets out our response to our previous consultation on the draft regulations that will govern the new registration system<sup>1</sup>. It describes how the wording of the draft regulations we have today laid before Parliament has changed since the consultation process. It also details changes in the policy for a further set of regulations, which we intend to lay later this autumn.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09102932000036"></a>The draft regulations, to be made under the powers provided for in the Health and Social Care Act 2008, set out the detail of the new registration framework to be operated by the Care Quality Commission. This, subject to approval by Parliament, will be introduced for the NHS in April 2010 and for private and voluntary healthcare and adult social care from October 2010.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09102932000037"></a>Earlier this year, Parliament approved regulations made under these powers to regulate NHS providers against a requirement about cleanliness and infection control. Since 1 April this year, NHS providers have been required to register with the Care Quality Commission and comply with the requirement on cleanliness and infection control.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09102932000038"></a>These draft regulations laid today set out who needs to register with the Care Quality Commission (scope of registration) and what they need to do to register and remain registered (registration requirements).</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09102932000039"></a>The new approach will mean that patients and people using services will have the same level of assurance of the quality and safety of their care and treatment, whether it is being provided by the NHS, local government, private or third sectors</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09102932000040"></a>The registration requirements are designed to address the concerns of people using health and adult social care services, covering the topics on which they want assurance. They provide clarity about the essential levels of safety and quality all providers must deliver for people who use their services, without being prescriptive about how providers run their services.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09102932000041"></a>The registration system will operate alongside a wider quality improvement framework that encourages not just good care, but excellent care. The commission will have a role in contributing to ongoing quality improvement as part of the wider quality framework, particularly through its publication of comparable information in periodic reviews, and its power to conduct special reviews into areas of particular interest.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09102932000042"></a>This publication will be of interest to anyone providing or working in health and adult social care, and to patients and people using services, who are interested in how the reforms are going to improve these services.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09102932000045"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport has today laid regulations under the Local Transport Act 2008 which will allow the owners of private hire vehicles (PHVs) to use their vehicles to provide local bus services.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09102932000046"></a>The regulations will come into force on 27 November 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09102932000047"></a>Section 53 of the 2008 Act allows the holder of a PHV licence to acquire a special public service vehicle (PSV) licence from the Traffic Commissioner and to register a local bus service using a licensed PHV.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09102932000048"></a>It is likely that this new opportunity will be of particular benefit to those in rural areas where it might not be cost-effective for bus operators to run services using larger buses.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09102932000049"></a>The regulations apply in England (outside London), Wales and Scotland. Transport for London is responsible for making any regulations governing PHV-buses in London.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09102932000053"></a>Following the administration of Metronet in July 2007, its assets and obligations were transferred to Transport for London in May 2008 as an interim measure. The former mayor and Secretary of State for Transport tasked a Joint Steering Committee consisting of Transport for London (TfL) including London Underground Limited (LUL), the Department for Transport and HM Treasury with considering a range of options for the permanent structure of the Metronet contracts, with the objective of providing a stable and safe operational framework and delivering the modernisation, upgrade and maintenance of the tube infrastructure at an affordable price that offered value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

Some of these contracts have since been renegotiated to secure more favourable terms for LUL. Future contracts will be procured directly by LUL, including robust performance incentives and transferring risk where appropriate. LUL will remain responsible for all asset management decisions, but there will continue to be substantial private sector involvement through the contracts managed by LUL. A decision on the most appropriate contracting arrangement for the Bakerloo line upgrade (which has not yet started) will be taken nearer the time, reflecting lessons learnt from the earlier upgrades.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09102932000055"></a>LUL is investing in its management and organisational capacity and capability in order to meet this new challenge. Organisational restructuring within LUL has also created a clearer separation of client and delivery functions, with a defined sponsor for each project.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09102932000057"></a>Members of the new panel will be appointed by the mayor from a shortlist agreed with me. The mayor and I will also agree the panel&#146;s terms of reference. The panel will report to the TfL board and the mayor as its chair. The members of the panel will have experience in a range of disciplines including engineering, finance and project management, ensuring that as a whole the panel will be able to offer expert advice, opinion and challenge on all aspects of TfL&#146;s investment programme, including the ex-Metronet works.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09102932000058"></a>The panel will be able to review all aspects of project delivery including cost and programme deliverability. It will also review delivery of the investment programme at a portfolio level, including management and organisational capability and the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of delivery of the investment programme. The panel will report its findings directly to the TfL board, which will also receive a TfL management response setting out how the issues raised have been or will be dealt with. The panel will commission other reports as it or the TfL board consider appropriate. It will publish an annual report making overall conclusions on the delivery of the investment programme. Copies of all reports will be provided to me, in view of Government&#146;s significant contribution to the investment programme through the GLA transport grant which accounts for just under 40 per cent of TfL&#146;s total income.</p>

This equates to a reduction of  2.68 per cent year on year. This is consistent with the savings expected across the public service.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09102932000070"></a>In this economic climate the probation service along with all public services has to achieve efficiency savings. Probation boards and trusts have been required to review their structures, overheads, support services and efficiency levels. This funding will enable probation boards/trusts to review their staffing plans for 2010-11 which will benefit both the September 2009 graduates and the 305 trainee probation officers due to graduate in September 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09102932000071"></a>The additional funding will be targeted to increase confidence in community penalties and divert low risk offenders from short-term custody. Directors of offender management will be required to negotiate specific service improvements with individual boards/trusts which will be incorporated in SLAs/contracts for 2010-11 to ensure that this additional funding is targeted on front-line delivery. Detailed work will be undertaken by directors of offender management with areas/trusts to agree additional service delivery requirements and finalise individual allocations.</p>

The proposed reform aims to benefit businesses by providing a more targeted test to establish those companies whose profits should be considered collectively in establishing the rate of corporation tax that applies to them.

<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="09102932000078"></a><b><a name="91029-wms0002.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09102932000096"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration (Phil Woolas) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="09102932000079"></a>I am announcing today our intention to make changes over time to our returns policy to Zimbabwe, recognising the different categories of people currently living in the UK. This reflects developments in Zimbabwe following the formation of the inclusive Government led by Prime Minister Tsvangirai.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="09102932000080"></a>As Prime Minister Tsvangirai has set out, including during his visit to the UK in June, there have been some positive changes in the situation in Zimbabwe over the past six months. While a great deal remains to be done to institute the political and other reforms set out in the global political agreement, the indiscriminate violence which marred the elections of 2008 has abated. And the formation of the inclusive Government has led to improvements in the economy, schools and the availability of basic commodities. In response to this changed situation some Zimbabweans in the UK are considering returning home to help rebuild their country. I consider we should be doing more to help them.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="09102932000081"></a>On 1 February we announced enhancements to the assisted voluntary return (AVR) package for Zimbabweans. AVR packages are available for individuals of all nationalities who are within the asylum system. The standard package provides support to help them reintegrate into their home country, including &#163;4,000 for vocational training, assistance in setting up a business and a flight home. Since February the package for Zimbabweans has been supplemented with an extra &#163;2,000 of reintegration assistance. This includes an additional &#163;500 cash on departure, an extra &#163;1,000 &#147;in kind&#148; assistance for business set-up, a &#163;500 basic subsistence package and cholera prevention kits.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="09102932000082"></a>We are today changing the way we deliver our supplementary package for Zimbabweans such that the total value remains the same but, instead of providing the assistance in kind, cash payments will now be phased in over a six-month period through the IOM office in Harare. Making cash available to those who go home will support economic reform in Zimbabwe&#151;enabling people to return voluntarily and use their skills to support change and help rebuild Zimbabwe with capital behind them. The scheme will also be extended until 31 December and will be reviewed at that point.</p>

<a name="91029-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="09102932000083"></a>Alongside these changes to our voluntary returns package we have also considered carefully our position on enforced returns to Zimbabwe. We have kept this issue under review since the Home Office first deferred enforced returns to Zimbabwe in September 2006 and the courts have found that not all Zimbabweans are in need of international protection. The UK Border Agency will therefore be starting work over the autumn on a process aimed at normalising our returns policy to Zimbabwe, moving towards resuming enforced returns progressively as and when the political situation develops.</p>

the EU Council Directive 93/7/EC 1993 and the European Communities (Return of Cultural Objects) Regulations 1994, which set out procedures for mutual assistance between EU member states for the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of an EU member state. Such requests are handled by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The DCMS has received no requests for assistance from the Italian authorities in relation to Mr Symes under the EU Council Directive; andmutual legal assistance (MLA) in criminal matters. The Home Office UK Central Authority (UKCA) handles requests for mutual legal assistance where the assistance required is for use in an ongoing criminal investigation or for use in criminal proceedings. The UK is able to provide a wide range of assistance under the provisions of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005.

The guidance on the exceptional case procedure issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers makes it clear that records and profiles which have been taken lawfully will be removed only in exceptional cases. If a person thinks their DNA records should be removed from the database all they need to do is write to their local chief police officer setting out what they feel are the exceptional circumstances around their case that would qualify for their records to be removed.</p>

<a name="91029w0003.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_522"></a><a name="09102934000543"></a>The above calculation represents the effect of long-term exposure to fine particles. A similar calculation has not been done for PM10 since the evidence that it is a good metric for representing the effect of long-term exposure is much weaker than for PM2.5. (<a href="http://www">www</a>. advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/pdfs/finallongtermeffectsmort2009report.pdf).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_523"></a><a name="09102934000544"></a>Studies of short-term exposure to PM10 do suggest a link with increased mortality but the studies do not give direct information on the life lost per person. It is thought that those affected are probably already seriously ill but that many of the deaths are brought forward by several months, rather than just days or weeks.</p>

All applicants in Sierra Leone continue to be able to submit their applications and collect appropriate documentation in Freetown. Responsibility for decision-making on visas, however, has been transferred to Banjul as part of the UK Border Agency's &#147;hub and spoke programme&#148;. This is a global strategy to improve the quality and consistency of visa decision-making by consolidating decision-making in a regional hub, thus allowing consideration of an application in a different location from that in which it was registered.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_527"></a><a name="09102934000550"></a>The change was primarily driven by the need to improve the consistency of decision quality by transferring it to a larger specialist team in Banjul. However, we expect there will be an estimated annual saving of around &#163;60,000.</p>
