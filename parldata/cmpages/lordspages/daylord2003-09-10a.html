<a name="30910-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Clinical Trials: EU Directive</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In so doing, I remind the House of my non-financial interest as chairman of Cancer Research UK.
<P>

<a name="30910-01_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="30910-01_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what progress they have made in resolving the problems highlighted by medical charities and National Health Service clinicians in relation to the implementation of the European Union Directive on Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="30910-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, a joint Medical Research Council/Department of Health project is exploring in depth the challenges identified by those undertaking publicly funded trials in the consultation on the draft implementing regulations. The Government are considering changes based on all the responses to the consultation. My noble friend Lord Warner has written to my noble friend Lady Hayman.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply, particularly given the seriousness of the situation before the intervention of my noble friend Lord Warner. Will my noble friend confirm that the Government recognise the crucial role that non-industry funded clinical trials play in this country as distinct from the rest of the EU? Will he give an undertaking that the extended timetable that I believe is now available will be used to ensure that high quality publicly funded or charitably funded clinical trials, which have been of such benefit to patients in this country, will be safeguarded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I recognise the importance of non-industry-funded health research carried out in this country. There is now a somewhat deferred timetable with regard to work on the directive. That provides additional time to take on board the very forceful representations made by Cancer Research UK and, indeed, by other bodies, and to get the matter right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, clearly very great concern has been expressed by the medical and research community, not least by Cancer Research UK and the MRC. This is yet another example of an EU directive where the Department of Health has been <P>


<a name="column_288"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>caught on the hop. Is it not high time that the Department of Health got a rather better radar screen so that it can pick up these directives when they come through via UK representation in Brussels and make representations while a directive is going through, not afterwards?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept that the Department of Health is not sufficiently sensitive to issues as they arise in respect of European Union directives. A directive that seeks to protect patients across Europe, and is highly desirable in those terms, is relatively straightforward in the majority of countries where most research is carried out by commercial organisations. As my noble friend indicated in her Question, the directive has particular implications and difficulties for the very substantial amount of research that is carried out by non-commercial organisations in this country. Therefore, we have a particular interest in the matter and have made forceful representations on it. In the additional time that is now available we are taking on board the representations that we have received. We are extremely hopeful that we shall arrive at a directive which is fully consistent with the needs of this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, recognising the justified excellent reputation of non-industry funded clinical trials in this country, will the Minister assure us that in future all clinical trials, whether publicly or industry-funded, will include all age groups because at the moment many exclude people of 65 and over with terrible results?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, that is an important point. We are aware that research can be skewed if not all age groups are represented. I fully take on board the point that the noble Baroness makes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, despite what the Minister said, is this not a prime example of an EU directive that brings with it massive burdens for those who carry out clinical trials and no benefit whatever for patients? Will the Minister explain what the point is of a harmonisation measure if it adds nothing either to the validity of trials or, indeed, to patient safety?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I contest the noble Earl's point that the directive fails to add to patient safety. The directive is driven by the needs of patients. As has been indicated, in other countries the need for the directive may be even more pressing than in this country. However, we do not wish to be complacent about research in this country. We have the most excellent record. The noble Earl will recognise that 10 per cent of the world's advanced medical research is carried out in this country. It is a very important part of our provision. But that does not mean that in all forms of medical research we do not make the needs of the patient a priority. The measure we are discussing will help in that regard.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister noticed that there are defects in our system that may endanger patients and if he was aware of that, why on earth did not the Government bring forward domestic legislation to deal with it instead of waiting to be bossed around by people in Brussels who are mostly concerned with defects in other countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, when a defect, as the noble Lord identified it, occurred with regard to our own circumstances in the case in North Staffordshire some two years or so ago, we took appropriate measures to rectify it. But, as he will recognise, research is carried out on a European-wide basis, and other countries too have enviable records with regard to their work. It is appropriate that we should have harmonisation across Europe, given the fact that the medical profession contributes to European-wide medical advance through such research.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord remember that every clinical trial in this country is looked at by local medical research ethics committees, which approach it from the point of view of the people who will take part in the trials? Have the Government pointed that out to the European Union&#151;because I do not think that every country in the EU has that type of protection? I should have thought that that alone should make us exempt from the directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I cannot go quite so far as the noble Baroness wants in assuring her that such a contribution would then make us exempt from the directive. But she is absolutely right: our concern about ethics, through the local control that she has identified, is an enormous strength in our provision of medical research. We have presented to Europe, in the discussions on the directive, all those facets of our outstanding record with regard to medical research.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, given the rigours with which clinical trials are conducted in this country, and the evidence that patients in trials do better overall than those who are not entered into trials, are the Government taking on board the representations from intensivists and others dealing with critically ill patients, where there are very real problems in obtaining consent to entrance into a trial by routes other than the conventional one; namely, the prior consent of patients? That group of patients, if not included in clinical trials, may well not receive advances in care in the long term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has introduced an additional point of considerable importance. It is not directly covered by the directive; nevertheless, she is right&#151;we do need to pay particular regard to that group of patients. I can assure her that the department does so.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they consider BT's system for answering queries and complaints by way of recorded voices to be in the best interests of the consumers.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, like many companies, BT uses automated call management systems. Companies believe that this is the most efficient way of dealing with incoming calls. Oftel has no powers to control how businesses operate their call management systems and so any complaints should be brought to the attention of senior management within the company concerned&#151;in this case, BT.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that expected reply. However, I cannot think that the Government can absolve themselves from all responsibility for the public service which has been privatised. This Question arose, of course, from personal experience. I arrived home on a Thursday to find that both telephones were not working. After an hour and a half, I got through to an unfortunate man in Cardiff&#151;who, I regret to tell your Lordships, had never heard of Forfar. He assured me, however, that on Monday&#151;this was Thursday&#151;someone would come along to see what was wrong with the line. This duly happened. I found out that the engineer lived half a mile away and could have come on Thursday had he known about the problem. So it is quite obvious that these systems are not working and the Government need to take an interest in the matter. I do not know whether they have a golden share, but I can assure the Minister that they still have some influence.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord has not drawn this issue to the attention of the senior management of BT, as I advise him to do, he has taken my advice very rapidly indeed through his Question. I am sure that we all sympathise with the difficulties that he faced, which I imagine are not a unique experience in this House. However, BT has been a privatised company for a considerable period of time. Its senior management must answer for the ineffective service that he has identified on this occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, could the explanation for the noble Lord's terrible experience be that the call centre operative who said he was in Cardiff was really in Bombay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, that then presumes that the call centre in Bombay would have understood Forfar rather better than Cardiff. That may not be the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I suggest to the Minister that there is a public issue here; namely, the mental health of the nation, given the number of <P>


<a name="column_291"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people ringing up and getting totally frustrated. This is seriously deleterious to the mental health&#151;not to speak of the spiritual health&#151;of the nation. Best practice is for the caller to be told where he is in the queue and how long he has to wait. It is a simple procedure. I do not know whether BT does that, but it helps to lower the aggression level a little.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the whole House clearly appreciates the right reverend Prelate's constructive suggestion. Let us hope that more companies involve themselves in relieving this pressure&#151;although I would counsel the right reverend Prelate against suggesting that our mental health is too fiercely damaged by these trials and terrors, because I fear that we have probably all experienced them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may remind the House that I was a director of British Telecom for some years. I also carried through the provisions of its denationalisation, which led to better services and lower prices and included a provision for competition. Surely the Minister should have reminded the noble Lord that in a competitive, free-market situation, which there is in telephony in this country, there are enormous choices for consumers. Perhaps he will also intervene on my behalf with the right reverend Prelate to see whether I may be informed as to where I shall be in the queue in having my prayers answered next Sunday when I am on my knees in one of his churches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the first part of the question, the noble Lord is right that there is competition in the provision of such services. But I believe that most of us who have trouble with a company believe that it should be for that company to improve its procedures, not only on our own behalf but on behalf of all its customers, rather than go through the sometimes laborious exercise of transferring our custom elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30910-02_para0"></a>As to the competition between the efficacy of British Telecom management and higher powers, I give way to the noble Lord and his experience in that matter.

<P>
<UL>How they will ensure that both Parliament and public are fully involved and consulted during the process of BBC charter renewal.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, the Government will announce how they intend to conduct the charter review before the end of the year. I can give a commitment now, however, that the process will be <P>


<a name="column_292"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>both wide-ranging and thorough, that public debate will form a critical element of the review and that there will be opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I welcome that reply and hope that the statement of how the Government intend to conduct the review will be made in the form of a parliamentary Statement so that it may be scrutinised in both Houses. Is the Minister aware that there is considerable public concern that charter review in the hands of this Government needs to be fully transparent? There are grave public concerns that it may well be a combination of payback time by politicians with a grievance and "pay-for" time for commercial interests. Therefore, the BBC and its integrity need to be fully protected during the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord was good enough to write to me on this subject at the end of July and to issue his letter to the press. Therefore, I assume that he can take some credit for fomenting public concern. But the basis on which he wrote to me and the concerns that he expressed are entirely inappropriate. There is no question of there being a payback time. The Secretary of State has at all times made it entirely clear that she rejects any attempt to confuse our desire to correct any statements made by the BBC with the charter review process. We shall maintain the BBC's independence and we shall not be influenced by matters taking place now. In answer to the noble Lord's other questions, our process, of course, will be entirely transparent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate what my noble friend has just said about the crucial importance of the independence of the BBC. However, assuming that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is not asking for a referendum to obtain public support for any renewal of the charter, is there not a danger that the renewal may occur during the course of a general election, which at present is supposed to take place in about 2006? In those circumstances, will the Government consider bringing forward the date of the charter renewal rather than risk it being involved in the type of party-political conversation that we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord McNally?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I know even less than my noble friend Lord Barnett about when the next general election will be. However, the last charter was granted in 1996 for a period of 10 years. We have made commitments, particularly in relation to the licence fee, for that period until the end of the charter review. I do not believe that any strong reasons exist for changing that period now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, when the charter is renewed, would it be possible to slip into it a little piece requesting the BBC to return the main news bulletin to nine o'clock every evening?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there are two documents: the charter, which is about eight pages <P>


<a name="column_293"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>long; and the agreement, which is about 16 pages long. I do not believe that either of them goes into the type of detail to which the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, refers; nor do I believe that they should.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, that leads beautifully to my question. Granted the overwhelming importance of the charter in constitutional terms, the agreement is none the less the document that deals with the nitty-gritty of day-to-day broadcasting. Can the Minister give us any assurance about parliamentary discussion of the BBC agreement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes, my Lords. I can certainly say that there will be parliamentary discussion of the BBC agreement. It is a constitutional oddity that, although there is no requirement for the BBC charter to be considered by Parliament, there is a requirement for the agreement to be considered by the House of Commons because their Standing Orders require anything which affects communications across the sea&#151;that is, the BBC World Service&#151;to be considered by Parliament. But, of course, we intend to go very much further than that.
<P>

<a name="30910-02_para1"></a>The detail of parliamentary scrutiny is at least in part a matter for Parliament. However, we certainly recall that in 1996 the previous government said that there would be an opportunity for each House to debate the document. They undertook that if either House were to demonstrate that it found the charter or the agreement unacceptable as drafted, the government would consider whether changes were necessary and, if so, would withdraw the documents and prepare new drafts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew15"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, in his first reply to my noble friend, the Minister&#151;I believe that I quote him correctly&#151;made a reference, first, to correcting mistakes by the BBC and, secondly, to preserving the independence of the BBC. Does he agree that there is, if not a contradiction, a certain potential tension between those two remarks? Does he also agree that the Government are not an impartial judge of impartiality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my remarks about correcting mis-statements were a direct response to an accusation made publicly by the noble Lord, Lord McNally. I made it clear that they have nothing to do with the charter review process or the independence of the BBC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, will the charter or the agreement define the balance of power and authority between the governors and the executive of the BBC, and can we be assured that that matter will be a subject of discussion in this House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the question of what detail is a matter for discussion in this House is, at least in part, as I said, a matter for this House&#151;a matter for Parliament. My understanding&#151;I could <P>


<a name="column_294"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be wrong on this; I have not read the documents recently&#151;is that the issue of the role of the governors is a matter for the charter and not the agreement. However, I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, if I am wrong about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the BBC is the only one of our media which is not beholden in some way to proprietors, advertisers or the government? As that is so, is it not clear that it is the only truly independent voice&#151;one of our few successful institutions&#151;and that any aspect of charter renewal must preserve that distinct position, which has been of outstanding benefit to our country over the past 80 years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with what my noble friend Lord Sheldon has just said. That is why I have already said that we shall, at all costs, maintain the independence of the BBC. That is why, in relation to the charter review, I also said that the process will be wide-ranging and thorough and that it will include a public debate and opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny. I believe that those are the assurances which my noble friend seeks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Eden of Winton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister have some sympathy with the BBC with regard to its charter requirement to maintain a proper balance and to be even-handed in all respects? For example, with regard to the Prime Minister's speech yesterday to the TUC, which version would the BBC have been correct in reporting&#151;the robust version handed out in the official statement or the weaker, wetter version, being what was actually said to the TUC?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that it would be at all appropriate for me to comment on the BBC's treatment of the Prime Minister's speech. But my understanding is not the same as that of the noble Lord, Lord Eden.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, in looking forward to charter renewal, do the Government agree that if the BBC was fully under the remit of Ofcom&#151;an independent regulator&#151;the current row leading to the Hutton inquiry would not have escalated in the way that it has?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is a hypothetical question on which the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is entitled to form her own views. I shall not anticipate the form which the charter review will take or the role of Ofcom in any final BBC Charter or agreement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, do not the Minister's replies make an unanswerable case for the recalling of the Puttnam committee, particularly because the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, is extremely good at sequels?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I realise that sequels are often very popular but, on the whole, <P>


<a name="column_295"></a>

<UL>What responses they have had to the consultation papers issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department on 5th June and the Legal Services Commission on 2nd July on proposed changes to the general civil contract for both private solicitors and not-for-profit organisations.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, we received some 250 responses to the department's consultation paper on the future of publicly funded immigration and asylum work. The Legal Services Commission received 17 responses to its paper on proposed contractual changes. We are currently collating and analysing the responses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, would it be fair to say that the opinion of the organisations representing asylum seekers, including the Law Society and learned counsel instructed by the Refugee Legal Centre and by the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association, was that the proposed limits of five hours' advice on preparation of an application and four hours on an appeal are wholly unrealistic and irrational; and that the manner in which they were prepared may have been unlawful?
<P>

<a name="30910-03_para0"></a>Does the Minister agree that because of the procrustean time limits imposed on representatives, some genuine refugees will be sent back to their countries of origin to face torture and possible death? Does he accept that some of the best practitioners are likely to give up because they will not be able to deliver an adequate service; and if that happens that the LSC may be in breach of its duty under the Access to Justice Act? So will the Government withdraw these proposals and get the LSC to enter into consultation with providers on setting benchmarks and on other means of reducing the costs of legal aid?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I shall seek to pick about two questions from the five asked. The noble Lord is quite right on the first point, that the proposal to put a cap on the level of legal aid expenditure on individual asylum cases did not meet with strong support from lawyers. That was perhaps not surprising. Nevertheless, it opens up a serious issue that must be looked at by the Government and by the legal profession as to how one copes with the fact that legal aid expenditure on immigration and asylum has doubled since the year 2000 and that the average cost of each case of legal aid has doubled since the year 2000.

<a name="30910-03_para1"></a>There was no illegality whatever in the process by which that consultation paper was put out. Of course, as ever, we are giving serious thought to the responses. But there is no doubt that government have to act in this area in order to fulfil their responsibility both to the taxpayers in giving value, to ensure that the legal aid system is protected for the benefit of others and to ensure that there is a fair hearing for people who claim asylum in our country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, while accepting the need to ensure value for money, has my noble friend grasped that the cases which solicitors will hesitate to accept will be the more complicated ones because they will not be able to do justice to those under the new regime? Will that not be likely to lead to the more complicated cases falling to the non-profit-making organisations; and does my noble friend consider that that will contribute to speeding up the hearing of asylum cases, which is the very laudable intention of the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, clearly where remuneration is on an average cost basis there is always a question as to whether work is displaced to other providers. Obviously, the Government were aware of that kind of issue when they put forward the proposals for consultation. I come back to the essential point that it is not just the level of spend that has been rising on legally-aided immigration and asylum work, there has been clear evidence of abuse of over-claiming, some evidence of touting for business and some evidence of poor quality work and advice.
<P>

<a name="30910-03_para2"></a>As well as the points addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, the consultation paper also looked at how to bring in accreditation for lawyers in order to ensure that the work of those firms which provide first-class, high-quality advice services to asylum claimants is replicated and that those who do not provide good quality work do not continue to be state-funded in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, during the passage of the Access to Justice Act 1999 we on these Benches pointed out the undesirability of having a single pot of money to fund all forms of legal aid. Does the Minister accept that we have been proved right and that increases in criminal and immigration spending have led to real cuts in civil legal aid, which has been cut in cash terms by 15 per cent over the past three years? Is it not right that this should be funded separately and that civil legal aid should be ring-fenced from the increases which have resulted from increased spending on criminal and immigration cases?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I do not, because the realities of life are that, whether or not one puts things into separate pots, there is ultimately one pot which is the Government's overall resources from taxation and other sources; and governments have to make judgments about how to deploy that. The reality is that it is not just legal aid on immigration and asylum that has been rising but legal aid expenditure generally. We <P>


<a name="column_297"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>now spend £1.9 billion per year on immigration and asylum; only a few years ago&#151;in 1997&#150;98&#151;we spent £1.5 billion. So there has been general pressure.
<P>

<a name="30910-03_para3"></a>The other point in this respect of which the House should be aware&#151;lest there is any danger of an impression that we are mean, cheap or resistant to supporting appropriate justice and hearings for asylum claims&#151;is that I cannot find another country in Europe with anything like the quality of legal aid and advice given at initial hearings compared to this country. Austria, France, Germany and Italy provide no effective legal aid system at initial hearings.
<P>

<a name="30910-03_para4"></a>So, while there is a need for reform, we should not get carried away with the view that we are looking to, in a sense, do other than uphold justice and fairness for asylum seekers while fulfilling a duty to getting economy out of the system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-03_spnew14"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Is the noble Lord aware that there is a very noticeable difference between efficient and inefficient firms? Some clearly run a case for as long as possible even though it is absolutely hopeless while others deal with matters very smartly in a very short period of time and probably save taxpayers a huge amount of money. Is not the answer proper supervision by the Legal Services Commission?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Countess is absolutely right. There are some instances&#151;I shall not detail the firms&#151;where it is quite clear that the quality of work is not good, there is over-claiming and unmeritorious cases are being pursued. She is also right that a proper system of regulation&#151;the accreditation system I referred to previously&#151;must be part of the answer. Therefore, we are moving towards implementing that aspect of the proposal in the consultation paper, which found substantial support from many who responded to the invitation to consult.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister realise that his answers work in exactly the opposite direction to the object he has just enunciated; namely, proper and good legal advice? My own firm&#151;I declare an interest&#151;has a legal aid franchise for immigration and asylum work. In a typical case, it takes my colleagues 10 to 12 hours to deal assiduously with an immigration application. The maximum amount of time to be permitted, if these proposals go through, is three hours. I put this dilemma to the Minister. In that position what would he do? Would he abandon legal aid&#151;and a great many firms are on the point of doing that&#151;or would he skimp the work, which the good firms are unwilling to do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I would look at some of the current practices by which legal time is spent on immigration and asylum cases. For example, if someone is a minor or has some mental incapacity <P>


<a name="column_298"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there is a real benefit in having a lawyer present at the initial interview. However, we have not been able to identify much added value provided by having a lawyer sitting watching an interview between a Home Office official and an applicant for asylum. The research evidence does not show that that provides much benefit. Indeed, in most cases firms that claim for time put in on such cases often send a junior person rather than a qualified lawyer but, of course, claim the full rate.

<P>

<a name="30910-04_para1"></a>To ask the Government what is their response to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency into Iran's nuclear weapons development.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="30910-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, the United Kingdom has long-held concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions. So do others, as was made clear recently in the statements by the G8, the EU and EU/US summits. The House will wish to know that the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently under discussion by the board of governors in Vienna. Her Majesty's Government hope that the board will adopt a robust position on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Can there be any doubt that the mullahs' regime in Tehran, which uses terror at home and sponsors it abroad, is trying to deceive the world over its nuclear weapons programme, which was revealed to the world last year by the National Council of Resistance of Iran? May I take it from what my noble friend said to me that the United Kingdom is going to back demands by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency that the mullahs honour their international obligations and immediately permit intrusive and unannounced inspection of their nuclear facilities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I hope that my initial Answer made it clear that the fears expressed about Iran's nuclear capability have not been allayed. I can tell the House that I met Dr El Baradei, the director general of the IAEA, in Vienna only last week and naturally we discussed this matter. He has, as the noble Lord indicated, grave concerns. I hope that a robust response will come forward from the governors. I can also tell the House that I have agreed to meet the director general again, if possible, to discuss the matter further before the next governors' meeting, which is due to take place in November this year.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, did the noble Baroness note the statement by Foreign Minister Kharrazi asking for unspecified assurances from the IAEA before Iran will agree to sign the additional protocol which is necessary to allow the thorough inspections which are clearly warranted? This is in spite of the fact that this is a standard text that has been adhered to by some 35 other countries without difficulty. In the meanwhile, have there been any sites that the agency would like to have inspected to which a visit has been denied in the absence of the protocol? In the light of Iran's withdrawal of the ambassador in the United Kingdom, what influence does the noble Baroness think the UK can have in persuading Iran to comply with her international obligations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I have noted the points made in relation to Dr Kharrazi and it is our view that Iran should sign the additional protocol forthwith and without any conditions. I have made that clear to Iranian ministers when they have visited this country. As to the withdrawal of the ambassador, that was on a matter quite unconnected with this issue but I can tell the House that the ambassador is now back in London and I am very pleased that he is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Corbett of Castle Vale, is right&#151;I hope that he is&#151;and this leads to an ultimatum to Iran to allow in the inspectors, and if that produces no co-operation from Iran, can the Minister tell us what would then be the next step? What sanctions are there to bring to bear on Iran? Would the British Government be prepared, for instance, to draft and propose a resolution at the United Nations raising the question of Iran's non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I wish to be very careful on this matter because, as I have indicated to your Lordships, this is under active discussion in Vienna at the governors' meetings. I do not want to anticipate the outcome of a meeting which is clearly one where a number of different countries have differing points of view and we must try to reach international consensus.
<P>

<a name="30910-04_para2"></a>Let me try to be a bit more helpful. If we do get a robust response from the governors, and if Iran continues to take no notice of the points of view put by the IAEA, there will be a further meeting of the governing body in November this year. That was why I indicated that I hoped I would be able to have further meetings in the intervening period between now and then. Of course there is a possibility that this matter might be referred to the Security Council but I and, I am sure, others hope that Iran will do the sensible and right thing and engage properly with the requests of the IAEA.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the robust line being taken. Does the noble Baroness agree that if, in the case of North Korea, it is <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>felt necessary to address some of the security concerns of that extremely disagreeable regime at the same time as pressing very hard on its nuclear ambitions, when dealing with a much more sophisticated government like the Government of Iran it might be a good idea if the United States was also prepared to address some of their security concerns? Does she have any idea what the United States might be prepared to do in its relationship with Iran if Iran were to sign the additional protocol?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, it is always very difficult to draw direct comparisons; nobody knows that better than the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. If the Government of Iran have particular points that they wish to raise that are matters of genuine concern about their security, it is only right and proper to listen to those concerns. There is no secret about the fact that we have a different analysis of the way in which to encourage Iran to be part of the international community from that held by our friends in the United States. Where we disagree with the United States we try to persuade them that the role that we are adopting of engagement with Iran&#151;critical engagement, certainly, but still engagement&#151;is a better way of encouraging it to comply with international norms. Of course we will try to persuade the United States to encourage rather than disengage in the way that, regrettably, has perhaps been the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 39, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-05_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) The power under subsection (7) is not to be read as limited to the specification of an existing document."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-05_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4 have a similar purpose. They relate to Clauses 3, 15, and 21 which all include powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations referring to published codes of practice to which authorities are to have regard. These powers are crucial to our aim of basing the new capital finance system on independent codes of practice and accounting standards. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that any revised editions of such codes are also covered by the regulations and thus apply immediately and automatically.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para2"></a>Much attention has already been focused on Clause 3 during Parliament's consideration of the Bill. It is the clause that underpins the prudential borrowing system. Authorities are required to determine their own affordable borrowing limits, and, in doing so, may be required to have regard to codes of practice specified in regulations. In the draft regulations under the power, we have of course specified the Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities, an often-read document, which is being specially prepared by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, CIPFA.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para3"></a>The regulations under Clauses 15 and 21 also refer to CIPFA codes. Clause 15 is a power to specify general guidance and in this case we have named CIPFA's Treasury Management Code. The code is already widely used by authorities and sets out practice in such areas as investment and the management of debt.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para4"></a>Clause 21 deals with the accounting practices to be followed by authorities and enables the Secretary of State to specify proper practices. Here the regulations identify two other well established CIPFA codes: the Statement of Recommended Practice and the Best Value Accounting Code, which together lay down the basis of local government financial management and accounting.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para5"></a>We always intended that the regulations should refer automatically to new editions of these codes as they are published. It would be undesirable to have to make amended regulations whenever one of the codes was reissued. That could create uncertainty about the legal status of a new edition of a code. Also, any need for each revised edition to be approved by the Government might cast doubt upon our commitment to accounting practice as the basis for the capital <P>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>finance system. Our policy here has the full support of local government and has been endorsed in another place.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para6"></a>This is an important issue, and we have recently reviewed the drafting of these three clauses. We now consider that the treatment of new editions of the codes should be clarified. These technical amendments therefore expand each clause to state that the references to codes are not limited to the existing editions. They simply ensure that the original policy intention is properly and effectively implemented. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I have no objection to the amendments. But the more a Bill lists what might be included in provisions, the more one is in doubt about the things that are not listed. Although I understand what the Minister is saying, I find the approach quite difficult. If the Secretary of State specifies that an order or provision is wide open, let it be so, rather than suggest that it is in some way limited. Sometimes I find this approach more confusing than helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I know that the noble Baroness rarely gets confused. We think that we have clarified the situation. I take the point that she makes, but I do not think that it has great bearing on the issue.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para7"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 35, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-05_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30910-05_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we have discussed the amendment twice: in Committee and on Report. My final remarks on Report were that I thought it likely that we would return to the matter, so here we are; we do not like summer holidays to get in the way of a good discussion. On Report the Minister said that the difficulty with the same amendment being tabled was that he had nothing new to say. But it seems to us that if you have a simple formula, you should stick to it. That is why we have made no attempt to look for different words.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para11"></a>Clause 11(2)(b) would enable the Secretary of State, by regulation, to snatch all or any part of a local authority's capital receipts. We know that the purpose behind that would be to pool those resources and redistribute them to other authorities not prudent or fortunate enough to have access to their own receipts.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para12"></a>There are three reasons for our concerns about that. The first is that debt-free councils could lose only what they have been able to raise from disposal of their housing stock. There are not many of them, but they feel very strongly that they have managed their affairs well and should not be penalised in that way, by ministerial whim.
<P>


<a name="column_303"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para13"></a>Other local authorities which are not in the same position may still need to support the provision of affordable housing or to maintain property that they still own. We made the point previously that to strip local authorities of such capital receipts jeopardises their ability to maintain their own property.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para14"></a>Under the Government's plans to create thousands of new homes, the money collected from these authorities is a drop in the ocean. But for small-scale development these receipts, in good hands and prudent councils, would potentially provide great flexibility.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para15"></a>The Minister has made the point on several occasions that some local authorities&#151;those that would benefit from the redistributed resources&#151;do not have such capital receipts, to which we must ask: why not? The policy for discounted sales to tenants, which the Labour Party did not much like for quite a long time but then embraced, has been available to all authorities for many years now. It seems hard that those who have implemented the policy vigorously and obtained capital receipts should have to support those who may have been less enthusiastic and more dilatory in their ability to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we support the amendment because we oppose the provision that it would ameliorate. To continue the theme of my earlier remarks, and to be utterly clear, we would have preferred to say that the Secretary of State may not make provisions through regulations that the whole or part of a capital receipt be paid to him. Perhaps that does not affect the thrust of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para16"></a>The Bill is about freedoms and flexibilities. The clause seems to give with one hand and to take away with the other. I am aware that the Government said during the passage of the Bill that the provision is perfectly reasonable on the basis that receipts arise because the grant originally came from the Government. But some authorities received negative housing subsidies for decades and many have invested in their housing stock the income that they have received from lettings.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para17"></a>My analogy is that, if I give a gift, I do not expect to be able to say after 15 years or so, "You did jolly well: the stock market went up, you invested and got more than I thought you might get, so give me some back". If you make a grant and hand over money, in an environment where noble Lords on all sides say that local authorities should have greater freedom, autonomy and discretion, let the money follow what the mouth says. We support the noble Baroness's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lady Hanham and what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said. I support particularly the point that the Bill is supposed to be about freedoms and flexibilities for local government. Although it gives some flexibilities and freedoms, there are one or two issues on which local government, as a united front across all parties, feels that more is being taken away <P>


<a name="column_304"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than is given. This is one such issue. I hope that the Government, even at this late stage, could think again about this aspect of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it is quite right, the theme of the Bill is freedoms and flexibilities. Although we are dealing with the same issue as we dealt with previously, and my answers will be the same, the arguments in favour of amendments are getting slightly weaker. My arguments are as robust as ever. The noble Baronesses would have difficulty arguing the case that they have just made to certain local authorities, and certainly to the tenants of some local authorities. But this is an important part of the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para18"></a>The amendment seeks to remove the Secretary of State's power to pool capital receipts. This would mean that many authorities would not get the resources they need to meet pressing demands for housing. Therefore, it is plainly unacceptable to the Government. My noble friends and I have said before that the redistribution of housing capital receipts has been, is, and will continue to be, a fundamental principle of housing capital finance. We believe that it is right that a portion of the proceeds from the sale of council housing be recycled for use in areas where housing need is greatest.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para19"></a>As has been explained before, the current arrangements are that local authorities are required to set aside a portion of their housing capital receipts. The flaw in that arrangement is that debt-free authorities are exempt from the requirement to set aside any portion of their right-to-buy receipts. Not having to set aside a portion of the housing capital receipts means that they are not contributing to the redistribution system that lies at the heart of the housing capital finance regime. Indeed, they may retain the receipts and use them for whatever purpose they wish.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para20"></a>For the avoidance of doubt, I repeat that an authority with debt is not necessarily good and an authority that is debt free is not necessarily bad&#151;and vice versa. There is nothing intrinsically good or bad about being debt free: it is sometimes an historical accident of finance. The fact remains that debt-free authorities have been able to use certain money more than once and for expenditure other than on housing. We are determined to channel that money into housing.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para21"></a>I also wish to make the point, which I believe was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that these funds are not necessarily generated by good management of the council&#151;by good planning, for example. They are raised because tenants are exercising their right to buy. As the noble Lady said, some authorities are more dilatory than others. However, if the local authority stops people exercising their right to buy, there is an adequate system of appeal. The local authority must obey the law, and rightly so.

<a name="30910-05_para22"></a>On the other hand, some authorities have not done as well as others because their stock is rubbish and their tenants do not want to buy it, even at the knock-down prices that they are offered. It is therefore not fair to say that authorities have not done well if they have not generated enough receipts. That is an unfair portrayal of local authority housing, which is very uneven throughout the country. The authority has no influence on the disposals. It does not manage them. Therefore, the authority should not be able to claim credit for them. The disposals are solely in the hands of tenants who exercise their right to buy.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para23"></a>We believe that redistribution must apply to all if it is to be fair to all. It is unacceptable that some authorities should have more access to resources than others, regardless of their need, simply because they happen to be rich in right-to-buy receipts and are debt free. Without redistribution, local authorities with debt, lower capital receipts and a greater housing investment need will lose out. That is irresponsible and it would be quite indefensible to allow that to happen.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para24"></a>The current means of redistribution based on set-aside will cease to be available when the new capital finance system is introduced. Pooling is the mechanism that will replace it and redistribute housing capital receipts for all local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para25"></a>I am aware&#151;and I make no apology for this&#151;that these are exactly the same arguments that I used on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, the case is virtually the same, although I believe that the noble Baroness introduced a weakness by chastising authorities with low capital receipts by saying that it is their fault because they were dilatory in the selling. The selling is not theirs to control; it is the tenants'. Perhaps the stock is rubbish and the tenants will not take it off the local authorities' hands.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para26"></a>My arguments have not changed, because we think that it is right that the resources generated by the sale of council housing stock be recycled and made available for the areas of greatest need. The amendment would remove our ability to do that. The alternatives, as I have told the House before, are higher taxes, less investment in housing or cuts in other programmes. I have not heard from either of the proponents of this amendment which one of those three they recommend. Clearly, they are not prepared to put their names to higher taxes or to stand up in this House and say, "Let's have less investment in certain areas". They are certainly not prepared to stand up in this House and name the areas of local expenditure that should be cut to pay for their amendment&#151;and I am not surprised.
<P>

<a name="30910-05_para27"></a>If the amendment is pressed, the noble Lords who tabled the amendment are duty bound to say which alternative they would put in its place. They are not prepared to do that, so I hope that they will not press the amendment. It has been round the course several times. Some parts of local government think that the measure does not offer 100 per cent freedom of flexibility but there is a general view that it is very close to that. It is good governance and good use of public <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>funds placed in areas based on housing need. That is all that this is. It is not confiscation, but a method of re-directing money to areas of the greatest housing need. With all due respect, I do not understand how anyone can seriously oppose that policy.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I can and I do, and this is the third time that I have said that. I used very similar arguments in my speeches about this matter on other occasions. "Redistribution" is a word that probably falls better from the Minister's lips than from mine, as does "pooling".
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para0"></a>The Minister's case for redistribution is that the money goes to authorities with greater need, but we would argue about where that is. In these days, local authorities need key workers, and key worker accommodation. There are many areas that are perhaps not quite as destitute as others, but where key worker housing is absolutely imperative. It is important that they have the capital for that and we would expect to see capital receipts used for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para1"></a>The measure removes a flexibility. It removes the flexibility for authorities that have receipts to use them for affordable housing for specific needs. I am almost certain that, under the Deputy Prime Minister's mantle&#151;his sustainable communities&#151;everything in the future will go one way. The decisions about where key worker housing goes will have little to do with individual local authorities and everything to do with the Deputy Prime Minister. The little pot of gold that might helpfully be used by local authorities would be taken away by paragraph (b).
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para2"></a>I disagree with the Minister about some authorities being more dilatory than others, because some authorities never promoted the right to buy and the sale of housing stock. It should have been promoted, because many people needed the issue to be put before them so that they could consider it. Some authorities are still not as energetic as others. Sometimes that is with good reason&#151;blocks of flats, for example. Some authorities have not been as assiduous as others. They have not recouped the capital receipts that they might otherwise have done.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para3"></a>We have trotted round this field now on three occasions. All that I can do is to seek the opinion of the House on this matter.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 25, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS OF THIS PART
<br>
 The provisions of this Part may only be applied to those local authorities that have been identified by the Audit Commission as at risk of overspending their total budget by more than 10 per cent."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-06_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we object to Part 2 because it potentially applies to all authorities, although the problems it would address affect a tiny minority. The amendment would restrict the potential effect of Part 2 to those authorities identified by the Audit Commission as likely to overspend their budgets by more than 10 per cent. According to the Audit Commission's latest report, Stewardship and Governance, that would bring 6 per cent of local authorities into the possible remit of these provisions. The amendment does not say that these provisions will apply to those 6 per cent of authorities; it says that these provisions can only apply to those 6 per cent of authorities.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para14"></a>I should like to remind your Lordships of some of the reasons as to why we are so concerned about Part 2. Throughout the passage of the Bill we have argued against the inclusion of these provisions. We have argued on the basis of principle; we have argued on the basis of practice. Both those lines of approach have failed to make any impact on the Ministers opposite, who have refused to recognise the disastrous message that this provision sends out to local authorities. If Ministers do not believe that to be the case, perhaps I may quote from the evidence of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives to the Select Committee on the draft Bill.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The prevailing attitude of mistrust of local government, however, is revealed once again in the Bill's clauses on financial administration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30910-06_para16"></a>In previous debates, the Minister went so far as to describe as irresponsible the suggestion that this provision should be challenged. He said that it was irresponsible of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to suggest that just because an authority does not get into trouble does not mean that it should not have a higher level of reserves. I refer your Lordships to Hansard, 16th July 2003, col. 901.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para17"></a>But that is precisely what it means. That is why we argue that these are local judgments. In its evidence to the Select Committee, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA)&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, referred in his first amendment&#151;stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"specifying a 'minimum level of reserves' for local authorities is impracticable and should be left to local judgment and good professional practice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para18"></a>
In making that statement it was well aware of the findings of the Audit Commission. The point was directly addressed in evidence to the Select Committee. CIPFA stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I think the latest Audit Commission figures which have come out show that approximately 90 per cent of local authorities have adequate balances, the other ten per cent are judged by the auditors to have inadequate balances. However, when you look at the pattern of local authority spending . . .  between 20 to 40 per cent of local authorities do overspend on individual directorate <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_310"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 310</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>levels in a year, virtually none of the local authorities actually end up having to reduce services as a result i.e. they have enough in their balances to cover those in year differences against actual budget".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para19"></a><P>

<a name="30910-06_para20"></a>Whether what is defined by the Audit Commission as an inadequate reserve actually leads to problems in practice is not relevant; it is key. The evidence is that in the vast majority of cases there are no problems. That is the evidence given by CIPFA. But it is not just CIPFA that has a problem with this provision. The Society of County Treasurers, in its evidence to the Select Committee stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The proposals for the Secretary of State to specify that local authorities maintain their reserves at a minimum level would seem to be particularly problematic and unnecessary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para21"></a><P>

<a name="30910-06_para22"></a>What about the Audit Commission? Surely, it must be in favour of this power. Its evidence to the Select Committee stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To date Auditors have resisted making recommendations about minimum levels because it is rightly the responsibility of local authorities to determine this for themselves based on a risk assessment of their operational and business models".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para23"></a>Remember those words from the Audit Commission:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rightly the responsibility of local authorities to determine this for themselves".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para24"></a>On these Benches, we agree with the Audit Commission. On these Benches, we agree with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. On these Benches, we agree with the Society of Country Treasurers; we agree with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives; and we agree with the Local Government Association.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para25"></a>We have tried a number of lines of argument with the Government. Most of the time they have failed to address the specific arguments that we have put forward. For example, in Committee and on Report, we suggested that the provision in Clause 26(2) would be ineffective because it only enables intervention at the end of a financial year&#151;after the damage has been done. The Government have not addressed that.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para26"></a>We also queried the suggestion that the powers would be held in reserve. How does that commitment square with the insistence of the Government that they are taking these powers to deal with a large number of authorities identified by the Audit Commission as having inadequate reserves? If the powers have been taken to address that particular problem, surely they will be deployed against a large number of authorities, even if we know that, in practice, the vast majority will come to no harm.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para27"></a>We put the argument that making short-term decisions to protect a level of balances could cost local authorities an enormous amount of money in the long term. Ministers have not addressed that. There are so many arguments against this provision that we could come up with new ones all day.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para28"></a>Clause 26(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the case of a controlled reserve, it shall not be regarded as appropriate for the balance of the reserve at the end of the financial year under consideration to be less than the minimum amount determined in accordance with regulations made by the appropriate person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-06_para29"></a><P>


<a name="column_311"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Throughout the debates on these clauses, Ministers have insisted that local authorities must have adequate reserves to meet unforeseen problems that might emerge during the year. But what they are committed to here is a minimum level of reserve at year end. Why do they need a minimum level of reserve at the end of the year? What if local authorities decided that problems over school funding were so severe in a year that they wanted to do something about it? They may have no particular spare cash, but they may have money in reserves which they may want to give to schools during that year. However, as the year progresses, the risk declines and they do not have to call on their reserves. Therefore, at the end of the year, if they chose to, some money could be given to schools from reserves. That is the freedom for local government. Whose judgment should it be that that money is better kept in councils' coffers than spent on services that they are there to deliver?
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para30"></a>In our previous debates, the Minister said that this provision will come into play only where an authority ignores the advice of its chief financial officer. But it is quite within the bounds of possibility for that to happen. A chief financial officer's duty is to protect the financial standing of the council. A leader's duty, for example, with regard to children's services, is to ensure appropriate levels of funding. Money is extremely tight. These judgments are finely balanced. At the end of the day, because the Government lay different responsibilities on councils, they might reach different views.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para31"></a>I am trying to be helpful by showing that these issues are not quite as black and white as they are presented. We think that this clause should be removed. We disagree with it fundamentally. It is against local authorities of all parties. This is Third Reading and the amendment would put in the Bill a restriction on the possible scope of the exercise of this provision. People in local government object to the breadth of a power that even the Government admit they do not wish to apply generally. Why not limit the scope of the power to those authorities that are on course to overspend? On that basis, on the latest Audit Commission figures, that would bring about 6 per cent of authorities within the scope of these powers.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para32"></a>Ministers opposite have a great deal of experience and political wisdom. I hope that they will accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is tabled. It moves the argument forward in a practical way and makes the best of a bad job. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30910-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we support this amendment. The noble Lord listed those organisations and individuals with whom his Benches agreed in their criticism of the provisions. I would add to that list the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh. I am sorry he is not in his place. At an earlier stage of this Bill he asked whether the Government really wanted this power because it would be so difficult to exercise. However, difficulty for the Government is not one of the problems I seek to address in supporting the amendment and opposing the provision in the Bill <P>


<a name="column_312"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>which it seeks to dilute. I said at Report that autonomy in local government, as elsewhere, requires capacity building. The more provisions in place which say, "Here is your freedom and flexibility but we retain a reserve power to take it away", the more that undermines autonomy. It undermines the capacity of individuals whom we seek to attract into public service which as we know, is a huge issue.
<P>

<a name="30910-06_para33"></a>Chief finance officers do not get where they are through being irresponsible. If anything, they are a pretty cautious breed. I prefer to see authorities relying on the judgment not just of the politicians but also of the professional officers&#151;I use the term professional in every sense of the word. I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, thinks that as many as 6 per cent of authorities might be on course to exceed the 10 per cent limit. I thought that this was a pretty smart clause because it will probably mean that almost no authorities will come within it. This is based on my limited experience of observing other authorities. This amendment is an interesting and fruitful way to reduce the impact of this clause, with which we, the LGA and CIPFA do not agree. We support this amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate why noble Lords have tabled this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has made the point that it is perceived as an unnecessary burden on well managed authorities. I shall explain very carefully why we are continuing to resist this amendment to the new clause. I must set out why Part 2 needs to remain of general application and&#151;this is important&#151;why the particular form of the new clause makes it an undesirable addition to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para0"></a>We have argued throughout that the powers and duties in Clauses 25 to 29 should apply to all authorities. I will come to Clause 30 later. We are not doing this because we wish to impose additional duties on authorities. These duties need to apply to all authorities because no criteria for selection will reliably identify the authorities that are in danger. The well run authorities with sound finances and sound procedures will automatically be complying with these duties and will feel no extra burden. The authorities that the noble Lord leads and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has worked so tirelessly for, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and many others, will experience no additional burden. But authorities change, and we regard these requirements as too important for their application to depend on anyone's assessment of the past performance of the authority or forecasts of its future.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para1"></a>All these clauses do is require authorities to comply with good practice. Most authorities already do so, but we have set out on a number of occasions during these debates the evidence that has led us to conclude that this good practice must be backed by statute. The need for sound finances is all the greater when major new financial freedoms are being given. Let me say again that the Government regard the provisions of Part 2 as an essential complement to the freedoms given elsewhere in the Bill and in particular to the prudential system.
<P>


<a name="column_313"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para2"></a>Turning now to the specific requirements of the new clause, the trigger for the application of Part 2 will be identification by the Audit Commission that the authority is at risk of overspending by more than 10 per cent. Assuming that was a practical proposition for the Audit Commission&#151;and that is a very big assumption&#151;what would be the implications of this risk for the finances of the authority? Say there was a risk of overspending by less than 10 per cent&#151;say 8 per cent&#151;but the authority only held reserves of two per cent of its budget. The authority would be at serious financial risk, but the new duties and powers of Part 2 would not be available.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para3"></a>Perhaps a real life example would help noble Lords to focus on this issue. When the chief finance officer of Hackney issued his Section 114 report in October 2000 he estimated an overspend of between £14.5 million and £22 million. The reserves were £6.5 million. The general fund budget for the year was £264 million. The reserves were therefore insufficient, but the projected overspend was less than 10 per cent of the budget. The Audit Commission, even if it could have foreseen that development, would not have identified Hackney under the new clause. So the Part 2 provisions would not have applied in one of the most serious financial crises to have hit a local authority in recent years. On the other hand, authorities at risk of overspending by more than 10 per cent might hold reserves adequate to cover this risk. There would be no reason to put them on what would certainly be seen as an Audit Commission blacklist.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para4"></a>The amendment runs into precisely the objection to crude rules of thumb that we have been accused of in Government. The advice on reserves that a chief finance officer will give under Clause 25 will be tailored to the circumstances of the authority. As the noble Baroness said, these chief finance officers are very wise people. And we have made clear that Clause 26 will not be used to impose blanket minima, but will be applied only to specific authorities. If a minimum was set under Clause 26, we would only do that after considering the advice of the chief finance officer and any observations of the auditor.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para5"></a>I would now like to turn to Clause 30. Clause 30 is a facility that helps authorities in serious financial difficulty deal with their problems. It has received a warm welcome in local government and from the LGA in particular. But the new clause says that it would only be available to authorities on the Audit Commission blacklist. Yet unforeseen financial crises can hit any authority. A major legal case, for example, might be lost unexpectedly and the authority be unable to cope with the damages awarded. It would be absurd to deny an authority the benefits of Clause 30 because it had not been put on the blacklist. This is another example of the perverse effects of this amendment. I seriously caution the noble Lord to think long and hard about those perverse effects.
<P>


<a name="column_314"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para6"></a>To sum up, this amendment does not achieve its aims. It does not accurately identify the authorities in financial danger. It risks prejudicing the financial reputation of authorities with sound finances, and it denies most authorities the benefit of Clause 30. It would be a highly undesirable change to introduce into the Bill, and I hope the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will rethink this carefully and agree to withdraw their amendment. I fear its consequences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I am very disappointed in the Minister's reply. It shows how out of touch he is with local government since he came to the Government Front Bench. Local government has changed a lot in the last two or three years, due to the policies of this Government. We have comprehensive performance assessment. I am a leader of a local authority as well as a Member of your Lordships' House. I see an auditor who looks after Essex County Council and all the district authorities in the county and meets with them about once a month. This is something new. We discuss the finances and the problems of that authority with the Audit Commission, so a report goes straight back all the time. Therefore, all the authorities in the land have a regular assessment of what they are doing, almost monthly. That is very new and operates in such a way as to make one feel that one is having an exam every month by the Audit Commission, which I do not feel is necessarily the right way to run local government.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para7"></a>This is the part of the Bill that local authorities dislike the most. Local authorities are increasingly being told by the national government how they should spend their money and what they should do. That has inevitable consequences for council tax. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, argued in his first response about higher taxes, but this clause means higher taxes. Once we start off with one or two authorities, all authorities will be affected. Authorities are told how much they have to give schools and how much they have to have in their reserves, and the consequences are higher council taxes. Judgments about council taxes are much better left to the local authority. Decisions on levels of reserves are better left to the local authorities and their professional advisers, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para8"></a>The Minister's reply was disappointing. It shows that he does not really understand the unhappiness that local government feels about this part of the Bill&#151;which is supposedly about freedoms and flexibilities&#151;or the effect that CPA has had on the monitoring of local authorities, or how different the situation is now.
<P>

<a name="30910-07_para9"></a>The amendment that we have tabled would at least limit the scope, and one hopes that it would be less than 6 per cent. The scope that the Government wish to take in the Bill is very dangerous. The amendment would limit the possibility of damage. I wish to test the opinion of the House on the amendment.

<a name="30910-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am sure that this amendment is of some discomfort to the Minister and the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee and Lady Maddock.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord proceeds, perhaps I may say that we are at Third Reading. The Companion to the Standing Orders is very clear on what it is permissible to do at that stage. We have been breaking that rule for the past hour. There are several amendments in the Marshalled List which cannot remotely fit in with what is said in the Companion. To bring in an entirely new clause tests the patience and the general proprieties of your Lordships' House beyond endurance.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para1"></a>Could someone advise us on whether we have abandoned the Companion and self-regulation and that a free-for-all is permissible at all stages of a Bill or do we have rules in this House? Could we have an answer to this question before we proceed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the question is that there is no one who can stop it except the House itself. We are a self-regulating House, which is not doing so at the moment. This may be a matter to be considered by your Lordships' Select Committee, which is looking at certain matters regarding the speakership.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para2"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Peston. I am becoming increasingly fed up with the fact that Third Reading is being turned into Committee: the same arguments are being deployed. Unless some really new matter has arisen, to introduce a new clause seems to be outside the terms of the Companion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, if Third Reading is being turned into Committee, is that not in part because we are not exercising our right to vote at that stage so that business is not disposed of at an earlier stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My Lords, I support what the noble Earl has said. I remember that there were far <P>

Because so much material is being introduced, people are now keeping the real fight to Report stage: everything is being delayed by one stage. I believe that is where some of the problem lies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I point out that Paragraph 6.132 of the Companion states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The principal purposes of amendments on third reading are: to clarify any remaining uncertainties; to improve the drafting; and to enable the government to fulfil undertakings given at earlier stages of the bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-08_para3"></a>It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, can tell us how his amendment fits into any one of those three points. It is not clear to me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may now proceed. With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, he might have waited to see what the amendment was about. He used the phrase "a totally new clause". In the first two or three lines I am going to explain the past history of the matter in Committee, on Report, and why it is entirely reasonable that we should suggest this proposed change at Third Reading having regard to the fact that the Committee stage was held in the Moses Room where no votes are taken. Report introduced a new element when the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, gave a commitment to a review. It is simply now a question of trying to make the review statutory. I believe that it is an entirely appropriate point to raise at Third Reading and I hope that I shall be allowed to get on with it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I am truly sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. I am sure he believes that he is acting in our best interests, but unless the English language has lost all meaning it is incompatible with the Companion and with self-regulation and proceeding in a proper way, to which most of us have devoted our time
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para4"></a>I apologise to the noble Lord in one respect. His amendment arises at a relevant time to raise a matter generally. The point I make is even more general. Several other amendments are about to be moved which also break the rules. I am totally in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff. The trouble is that there is no one in the House who appears to be willing to take responsibility for dealing with the matter. It is ridiculous that Back-Benchers such as myself and the noble Lords, Lord Tordoff and Lord Barnett have to raise the issue. There should be someone else who pronounces so that the House can return to its proper way of behaviour. All I can do is to go on record as deploring what appears to have happened to your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the amendment almost certainly falls within Paragraph 6.132 of the Companion, which states,

<FONT SIZE=3>There have been uncertainties about this matter throughout and we have had to continue to adapt to them. Noble Lords have raised a very valuable point about not being able to vote at Committee. One stage of the Bill is truncated in terms of testing the response of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Peston may have been referring obliquely to me when he said that someone should stand up. If I had any marginal uncertainty, the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, urged me vigorously to stand up.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para6"></a>I was not prepared to give any advice on this amendment to your Lordships, should it have been wanted, but my noble friend Lord Peston referred to two subsequent amendments. On this amendment, would it be a prudent course to note the various stances adopted and to bear in mind that there is currently a Committee on the Speakership of the House? If my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Barnett feel it appropriate, they might wish&#151;if they have not already done so&#151;to make representations there. It may be convenient for your Lordships to hear the advice I am tendering on the basis of advice that I have received from the Clerks.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para7"></a>The other two amendments that might have been challenged&#151;perhaps it is convenient to deal with them all now&#151;are Amendment No. 13 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and Amendment No. 19 in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. The Clerks have given careful attention to the matter and they have come to the conclusion, and advised me, that neither Amendments Nos. 13 nor 19 fall foul of the rule in paragraph 6.133 on page 126 of the Companion.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para8"></a>Amendment No. 13 introduces a new issue. It has not been disposed of at an earlier stage, so it does not fall foul of paragraph 6.133 on the advice I have received because it deals with the conditions of local authority workers. Amendment No. 19 is different from the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, on Section 28. Some of your Lordships feel that Third Reading is not the time or place for amendments, but that is a different view.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para9"></a>That is the advice I have received from the Clerks, which I am transmitting to your Lordships. It does not relate to the amendment or point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, but I respectfully suggest that if one got to the substance of the matter, recording and inwardly digesting the view of my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Barnett, which might be taken up by the Committee on the Speakership, that might be a convenient way of attempting some progress.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House for recognising that the strictures probably do not apply to Amendment No. 6. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who indicated briefly that he was prepared to accept the same view. In the course of moving the new clause I hope to justify the view he took.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para10"></a>This is the third attempt on this side of the House with the support of the Liberal Democrats to remedy what is widely seen as a major lacuna in Part 4 of the Bill which deals with business improvement districts. Almost all of those concerned with the issue have welcomed Part 4, which was heralded by the Prime Minister in a major speech to local government in April 2001. It is certainly welcomed on all sides of the House.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para11"></a>Part 4 establishes a new procedure whereby business ratepayers can vote to pay an extra levy to fund specific improvements in a defined area of their town. If the vote is carried, then all will pay, subject to any exceptions spelt out in the scheme; that way there are no free riders. But only the occupiers of property have such a vote. If the vote is carried then only occupiers&#151;that is to say ratepayers&#151;can be made to pay.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para12"></a>Part 4 does not give any vote to the occupiers' landlords; the property owners. They can contribute, and those who choose to pay do so, but those who choose not to pay are free to enjoy any benefits of the improvements without contributing to the cost. That is a familiar problem, which I call "free riders".
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para13"></a>Yet it has been comprehensively acknowledged by the Government at every stage of the Bill that property owners are often the prime movers in BID schemes. It has been perfectly clear that most schemes would not get off the ground without substantial owner leadership and financial support.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para14"></a>I come to the point that I believe is behind the complaint of the noble Lord, Lord Peston. In Committee amendments were tabled and debated at length to include property owners in Part 4. They were resisted by the Government&#151;I hope I shall summarise the arguments fairly&#151;because they were seen as a new tax on property owners, the introduction of which would require a considerable new administration that would fall mainly on local authorities, which collect the rates and the occupiers' levy. They would have to set up registers of land ownership and establish who should pay the BID levy and so on. I hope that that is a fair description of Ministers' arguments.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para15"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, went further, and threatened that if the amendment were carried and the House insisted on writing it into the Bill, the Government would simply move to remove Part 4 altogether and the BID proposals would be stillborn. So we did not press the amendment; indeed one would not have been able to do so in the Moses Room.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para16"></a>On Report, another tack was tried. It was accepted that the provision could not be introduced in the Bill for the reasons spelt out by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, but amendments were tabled to give power to add to the owners' levy by order so as to avoid having to come back to Parliament for fresh primary legislation. Ministers liked that even less; introducing a new tax by statutory instrument appeared to offend them grievously.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para17"></a>Instead, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, offered a review of the experience of BID schemes with the implication that if it is established that the exclusion of <P>


<a name="column_321"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>owners from any statutory rights and obligations under the BID scheme is harming the scheme, and if a case is made out for including them, that could be the subject for further legislation. The promise of a review was reinforced in a full letter of 25th July from another Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Nick Raynsford to Sir Ian Henderson, who is the chief executive of the British Property Federation.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para18"></a>The prime purpose of the new clause is to make the review a statutory obligation, so in a sense it follows directly&#151;if I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Peston&#151;as a consequence of what was offered on Report. I hope that it would be held to fall within the Standing Orders. It also takes the opportunity to provide for an independent person to conduct the review and for a shorter timescale for the review than that set out in Mr Raynsford's letter.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para19"></a>Mr Raynsford's letter spelt out the timetable envisaged by the Government. I hope that the House will bear with me, because it needs to be spelt out in full:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The review . . .  will have three stages. Firstly it will examine the ways in which the BID pilot projects have engaged property owners in the setting up of the BID and how effective this has been. This first stage will take place in the autumn of 2004 when we believe some of the BID pilots will be established. However, the review cannot simply examine lessons learned from the pilots because the pilots are receiving particular support and advice. Therefore the second stage of the review will examine how successful BIDs are at engaging property owners when they are evolving independently. This part of the review will take place throughout 2005 when we expect to see some BIDs established which have not been involved in the pilots . . .  the third stage of the review will seek to measure the continuing involvement of property owners in BIDs once the initial results from their investment are evident. This means that BIDs that have already been established will be monitored throughout 2006, with the review drawing to a conclusion in January 2007".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-08_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30910-08_para21"></a>That is gold-plating the review and taking an extended period before there can be any question of coming back to legislate to fill what many see as a great lacuna in the Bill. It is not acceptable to the property interests, who are the people who are primarily developing the BID process. I am very grateful to Mr Raynsford and to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for arranging a meeting on Monday at the ODPM where those matters were discussed with some of the representatives of the organisations involved. At the meeting, the property and retail sectors told the Minister that a large number of BIDs are planning to start collecting their BID levies from April 2005, covering the billing year 2005&#150;06. From that date, it should therefore be apparent whether landlords are being involved and involving themselves in the BID planning process. Clearly, they told Ministers, that would give a good indication of whether a broad cross section of landlords are contributing funding, sitting on the BID boards and generally participating. If they are not, it was said, surely it would be prudent for the Government to take remedial action as quickly as possible rather than waiting until 2007 for the conclusion of the extended review process. One must also bear in mind the inevitable delay after that while <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation is considered, while there is consultation on it, and when it can be introduced and taken through Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para22"></a>So what this new clause is proposing is that the review should be complete by the end of September 2005, compared with the Minister's date of January 2007. That would be followed by a report within three months. I feel that that is a perfectly adequate time to conduct a proper review.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para23"></a>The second point is that an independent review seems to me desirable to avoid any suspicion that the review would be coloured by the department's much-trumpeted reluctance to envisage having to introduce an owner levy. It seems to me&#151;although I am sure that whoever is appointed by the ODPM to carry out the review will do his best&#151;that it has taken a very firm view on this and would in effect be reviewing its own decisions.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para24"></a>The third point&#151;and this is the one that I think Ministers really do have to take on board&#151;is the question of making it a statutory review. This proposal reflects the fact that occupiers&#151;which include, for example, the retailers and the occupiers of offices and bodies such as the British Retail Consortium&#151;are deeply disappointed that there is no formal mechanism for requiring property owners to contribute to BIDs. They say that a statutory review would carry more weight in occupiers' negotiations with landlords to make voluntary contributions. The message would be that there is to be a statutory review. If landlords do not contribute voluntarily, then Parliament and the government of the day will consider whether they should be required to contribute compulsorily.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para25"></a>The strength of the message that a statutory review conveys would also provide those enlightened landlords who are prepared to participate with a greater degree of comfort that the issue of landlords' contributions remains one that the Government and Parliament are monitoring. The British Property Federation reports that many landlords in its membership are looking for a clear steer from Government that they will monitor the problem of free-riding from other landlords. A statutory review provides the clearest signal that that would be the case.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para26"></a>None of us mistrusts Ministers' good intentions, and there is no suggestion to that effect; not a bit of it. It is that with this new clause incorporated in what will be the Act, it will be much easier to convince doubting owners to stick with the BID process. That will help to ensure that the Prime Minister's aspirations for BIDs will actually be delivered. If those seem familiar words, they are quite deliberately put. It is turning aspirations into action and delivery.
<P>

<a name="30910-08_para27"></a>I cannot for the life of me see why the Government should not accept this new clause as it stands. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support my noble friend on Amendment No. 6. He has been very consistent through the course of these proceedings in trying to find a way whereby landlords can be harnessed into the BIDs process. I say to the <P>


<a name="column_323"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Peston, that a consistent theme throughout our consideration of the Bill has been how to harness owners into the BID process so that they are a committed part of it. A number of ways have been tried. This proposal seems to have all but the Minister's blessing for the review to be completed by an earlier date. I very much hope that the Government will accept that this is a sensible and time-rational way forward and accept the amendment so that we can move on with the support of everyone, including the landowners, who are very willing to be involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness has just said, property owners&#151;landlords&#151;are offering to pay money. I hope that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, will accept that offer with open arms. To do anything else would be bizarre.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_time0"></a><H5>4.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, notwithstanding the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, it would probably be bizarre to accept the amendment at this late stage of the Bill. Although it is a very seductive proposition&#151;all these people queuing up wanting to pay money&#151;at the end of the day, I do not think that it would work out quite like that. I shall not go over the issues that we addressed previously. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, stuck to the issue&#151;that the new clause has been tabled essentially because, not to put too fine a point on it, no one takes my word in Hansard. As Ministers' statements in this House are obviously not acceptable to businesses, they want this provision on the statute book. On the other hand, on the issue of owners and taxation, as I hope I made clear in Committee and at Report stage, one cannot introduce a new tax by way of statutory instrument. That would require much more fundamental legislation and major changes in, for example, the sanctions which we discussed in Committee.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para0"></a>We do not think that the amendment is necessary simply because, as I said, I gave assurances both in Grand Committee and on Report that the Government will undertake a review of the role of property owners in BIDs. Conversely, we would be stupid to look a gift-horse in the mouth if, as a result of introducing the BIDs&#151;which everyone fully accepts is a first-class idea&#151;there were a way of including property owners. The idea was not in the Bill initially, but to exclude it would be to look a gift-horse in the mouth. So we want to have a review, and we will have a review.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para1"></a>I detected a certain tone in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I should perhaps say that my ministerial colleague Nick Raynsford is the policy Minister responsible for this matter. As the noble Lord is a former Secretary of State, he knows how the system works. I am not the policy Minister on this; I am simply here to speak for the Government on behalf of my colleague in another place. Nick Raynsford met the noble Lord during the week, and he has written to interested parties outlining the review process. So the lead policy Minister has written to the industry, and I have made statements in this House.
<P>


<a name="column_324"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para2"></a>I have been told to my face that we may not be in government when the review comes round&#151;but so what? The civil servants are going to be there. The policy enunciated will still be there&#151;the policy will not change. The Government have given a firm commitment on the Floor of this House. That can always be repeated in another place by means of Parliamentary Questions; there is no problem about that. There has also been a firm commitment in writing to the industry. We think that that is sufficient. We do not believe that a statutory obligation to do that should be necessary to persuade property owners that we are telling the truth and mean what we say.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para3"></a>The amendment seeks to limit the time period for the review to September 2005. We believe that that would undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the review. The British Property Federation, in previous discussions, has pointed out that the review must examine the way in which property owners are engaged in BIDs&#151;or business improvement districts, for those watching us on the telly, which I suspect is nobody.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the BBC keeps telling us that the House of Commons is back. To the BBC, the House of Commons is Parliament. That is how it works, is it not? I should not have said that. I did so only because I did not want to use the jargon. I shall repeat the sentence. The British Property Federation, in previous discussions, has pointed out that the review must examine the way in which property owners are engaged in BIDs&#151;business improvement districts&#151;over a couple of years to ensure that they do not renege on promises of support when the initial wave of enthusiasm dies down.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para4"></a>The form of the review that we have proposed seeks to meet those concerns. The first phase of the review will evaluate the BID pilot projects and other voluntary BID schemes to see whether property owners are being effectively engaged with business improvement districts at an early stage. We are already preparing to begin this first phase which will start in the autumn of 2004 and conclude in 2005. During 2005 and 2006 the review will focus on the business improvement districts that are up and running and that are preparing to begin. We do not realistically expect that more than a handful of business improvement districts will be up and running until 2005. One must be realistic. This is quite new. Therefore, that phase shall be vital to ensure that a thorough review takes place. The noble Lord's amendment would make that time too short.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para5"></a>The third stage of the review will focus on BIDs that have been up and running for 18 months to 2 years to check that property owners are still involved. However, if after stage two of the review, or even stage one, it becomes clear that there is almost no proper engagement of property owners in BIDs, continuing with stage three may not be appropriate. We are willing to be flexible in that respect. However, we are <P>


<a name="column_325"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not willing to commit to a timetable before the outcome of the first stages of this review can be anticipated.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, asked, as does the amendment, that an independent person be appointed to conduct the review. I was present at the meeting on Monday. I have not checked any of the notes, but so far as I know we did not discuss the independent person, because nobody offered to pay for them. I note that the appointment would be made by the Secretary of State&#151;the Deputy Prime Minister. The argument could be, "Well, if we have appointed him, we are going to have to pay the salary and the fees". Where is the independence? I have to be careful. Nobody offered to put a kitty together to pay. Already our word is not taken on the Floor of the House that we will conduct the review. There is an insistence to put that into the Bill. Our faith is being questioned. This is not a personal matter between myself and the noble Lord, but that is the bottom line. The industry wants the matter on the face of the Bill. We could argue until the cows come home over how independent this person should be and who should pay for him. It should not be ourselves, because we would be held to be paying for that independent review, which would, therefore, not be independent.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para7"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will have overall responsibility for co-ordinating the review, but a steering group of interested parties will be convened to oversee its progress. The representatives on this steering group have yet to be confirmed but I can assure the House that they will include property interests, business interests, as well as those with regeneration and town centre management experience. We will be happy to publish progress reports at the end of each stage of these reviews, a copy of which will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will be made available to the public.
<P>

<a name="30910-09_para8"></a>We have every intention of conducting this review methodically and fairly. I have said before that at the end of the day we would be stupid to look a gift horse in the mouth if there was a way of allowing the property owners to be involved. It was impossible to do that in this Bill because it would be a new tax involving the whole system of collection, whereas the existing system based on the rates of the people who tenant the properties is already there. We are building on an existing system with no new infrastructure. My right honourable friend the Minister for Local and Regional Government, Nick Raynsford, and I have both given clear assurances. I repeat them today on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister. I see no need for this amendment. I make no criticism of the effort to put these views on the record. Therefore, I hope that this will be taken as gospel by the property interests in that I mean what I say. If I go tomorrow, the person following me will say exactly the same things.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, in a brief reply I wonder if the Minister would go just one stage further? Would he offer to publish interim reports as the review proceeds, so that if after the first wave it appeared that <P>


<a name="column_326"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 326</B></P>

<A NAME="30910-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall repeat what I said. We have talked about a three-stage review, where we publish progress reports at the end of each stage. I cannot promise any more than that. I believe that I am being wholly reasonable. We will have representatives on a steering group to oversee the way the review is going&#151;with property interests, business interests, and those with town centre management experience. What more can I offer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I recognise, as a former Treasury Minister, that, subject to the inevitable Treasury constraints on this sort of matter&#151;we had a brief word about that in Monday's meeting&#151;the noble Lord and his colleague Mr Raynsford have gone probably about as far as they can. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the importance of this matter is all about putting the argument to doubting property owners. With the reinforcement that he has given, and with his putting the name of the Deputy Prime Minister behind it, I hope that the property interests concerned might be prepared to take that as a sufficient guarantee that their interests will be properly safeguarded by the review. In these circumstances it would be churlish to press the matter to a Division, although I came into the House firmly prepared to do just that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30910-10_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I can see happy, smiling faces around the Chamber. I wonder why that is.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para3"></a>In Committee, the issue was dealt with by my noble friend Lord Rooker. He congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on a brilliant amendment. He also said that that was followed by five brilliant speeches in support. As noble Lords are now well aware, the Government have now tabled our own amendment to that brought forward by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Sheppard of Liverpool, to reflect the all-party support that there appeared to be behind the thrust of those amendments.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para4"></a>I shall speak briefly to the amendments that we are proposing and then say a few words, hoping that I shall do the subject justice. Amendment No. 7 would amend the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and provide mandatory rate relief at both the occupied and unoccupied rates for registered community amateur sports clubs&#151;CASCs&#151;under Schedule 18 to the <P>


<a name="column_328"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Finance Act 2002. Registered CASCs can also have this relief increased at the discretion of local authorities. That means that in many local authorities there will effectively be 100 per cent relief.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para5"></a>Sports clubs that do not meet the requirements for CASC registration and therefore mandatory rate relief will still remain eligible for discretionary relief. The decisions on those matters will rightly be a matter for individual local authorities. This will be good news for CASCs that play a valuable and influential role in promoting the health and social cohesion of their local communities, but have been unable to receive mandatory rate relief because of the complexities of charitable registration. I am sure that registered CASCs will welcome&#151;and have already welcomed&#151;the certainty that mandatory rate relief would provide through this much simpler route.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para6"></a>I am delighted that the Government have taken the initiative here. We deserve credit for recognising the important part that sports clubs play. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, on their role in highlighting and underlining the importance of the matter. I also congratulate and thank my noble friend Lord Pendry. He discovered the important precedent that set us on this course. The move has been welcomed by the chief executive of Sport England. It has been recognised and welcomed by the Central Council for Physical Recreation. I pay tribute to their efforts over the years in arguing that case. I have volumes of correspondence going back over many years when I was leader of a local authority. The authors of that correspondence tried to persuade me to do something about the matter. The Government have acted decisively and great benefit will flow from that.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para7"></a>This morning I talked to the treasurer of St Peter's Cricket Club, a humble organisation which pays some £1,200 a year in rates to Brighton and Hove Council. Next year the £1,000 that it will save will be invested in its pavilion. I hope that that is replicated across the country. Derek Betts, the club's treasurer, a very careful man, tells me that the £1,000 will bring enormous benefit and enable the club to expand and extend its "colts" activity, from which my son benefits. If replicated country-wide, that kind of activity would be of enormous benefit. Credit is due to all those involved in the matter. I thank all those who argued the case for the measure. On this occasion we ought also to thank the Treasury for its magnanimity. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, this is a red letter day for amateur sport in this country, not just because many millions of pounds will be retained by clubs such as St Peter's Cricket Club, Hove, as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, indicated, but, much more importantly, because it will encourage tens of thousands of amateur sports clubs to register as CASCs.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para8"></a>It is worth reminding the House that this has been a four-year campaign and that this is the crowning of it. The first and crucial achievement occurred in the <P>


<a name="column_329"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Finance Act 2002 when, for the first time ever, a new category of body was created&#151;community amateur sports clubs&#151;with exemptions from tax closely akin to those of charities. As we know, the one thing that was left out was mandatory 80 per cent rating relief. The amendment is not merely beneficial in itself&#151;the measure will, of course, go on from year to year&#151;but it will also unlock the uncertainty and scepticism that have, as I say, held back tens of thousands of small clubs from registering. I believe we all agree that amateur sport is not only one of the crowning cultural achievements of this country but is perhaps a greater source of local and communal pleasure than anything else.
<P>

<a name="30910-10_para9"></a>I, too, give unstinted thanks to the noble Lords, Lord Bassam and Lord Rooker. The amendment has no enemies and at previous stages of the Bill they dealt with the matter extremely adeptly. I thank the civil servants who were involved in the matter. We have had an extremely fair and constructive hearing from the DCMS and, latterly, the Treasury. I thank the Treasury. As has been said, it had to agree to the measure and it must safeguard the public purse. I thank all noble Lords in this House, not a single one of whom has been anything but supportive of the measure. Finally&#151;in many ways this is the most important thanks to give&#151;I thank the sports fraternity, led, as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said, by CCPR. I should like to mention Nigel Hook. All in all, this is a great day and, what is more, it is a better amendment than mine because it deals with the extra 20 per cent above the 80 per cent mandatory relief and makes clear that CASCs will be entitled to the extra 20 per cent. I shall not move my amendment when we reach it. I vent a small cheer and give considerable thanks.

<A NAME="30910-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, I also wish to congratulate all those involved in the long-running campaign, especially my predecessor, John Greenway, whose tireless work on the issue in another place has paid dividends today. I, too, congratulate the Central Council of Physical Recreation and add to the tributes paid to Nigel Hook, who is retiring. This is a red letter day for him. His encyclopaedic knowledge of sport and his enthusiasm are second to none. I pay tribute to noble Lords on all sides of the House, not least to the important work done over the years, characteristically diligently, by the noble Lord, Lord Pendry. I also pay tribute especially to the work done by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. I thank the Ministers and the officials who accepted our case. It is a classic example of the maxim that if at first you don't succeed, try, try and try again.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para0"></a>This is, I hope, the first in a series of campaigns to raise the profile of sport. From these Benches we want to ensure that the importance of sport and recreation is re-established at the centre of the political agenda and is recognised as relevant to the objectives of every government department.

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>team in local government for working so constructively to support 80 per cent mandatory rate relief for CASCs.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para1"></a>Today's victory goes to the heart of our vision for sport at the local level. It is about volunteer retention; engagement with local communities; youth involvement; the participation of the disabled in sport. It is about social inclusion and the goal of a healthier nation. It is not about today's Olympians; it is about where tomorrow's Olympians are to be found. It is an important step towards wider participation at a time when, despite, £1.6 billion going into sport from the lottery over the years, participation over that time has risen by only 0.3 per cent. That is why the litmus test of this amendment and this initiative is to increase the active membership of community amateur sports clubs. I hope that we shall be able to rectify the now unusual position that Northern Ireland faces of being worse off than the rest of the United Kingdom in respect of rate relief for amateur clubs.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para2"></a>In the spirit of welcoming the Government's U-turn, perhaps in conclusion the Minister can continue the spirit of co-operation and of cross-party support which should always be in the nature of the links between sport and politics, and announce today that the Government do not intend to pocket the tax from the proposed London Olympic lottery game but reinvest that tax directly into the success of the Games in London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pendry: </B>   My Lords, I support this important amendment and I add my voice to those who have congratulated the Government on listening to those of us who have argued for years for mandatory rate relief for voluntary sports clubs.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para3"></a>I was particularly pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, confessed at Report stage that he was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not aware of the 65 per cent mandatory relief in Northern Ireland"&#151;[Official Report, 16/7/03; col. 932.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-11_para4"></a>with regard to voluntary clubs. He said that he would review the situation, which he did. I pay tribute to the excellent work of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who has been a great campaigner on the issue for many years, as has the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. Our congratulations must go to them. The CCPR and Nigel Hook have also been mentioned. His voice has been loud and clear on the matter. I do not wish to say much more except that common sense has prevailed. I refer to the benefits that accrue to the people of Northern Ireland as a result of this mandatory rate relief and to the local and wider communities. As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, Northern Ireland now has some catching up to do as a result of the amendment. I welcome it wholeheartedly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-11_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, while supporting the amendment, I should like to ask the Minister one technical question. Who will pay for the rate relief? Will it be the general taxpayer or business?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Billingham: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister replies to that I add my congratulations to everyone who has been involved in what is, as has been said, a <P>


<a name="column_331"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>red letter day for sport. When I joined the House relatively recently, I found that a huge campaign had been mounted by people who are present in the Chamber today. I pay tribute to them and recognise the work that has been done by noble Lords. I pay tribute also to the Ministers. The measure is an important example of co-operation throughout the House. The House has shown me what a good friend it is to sport. Every debate we have ever had has shown a complete consensus on all sides. Not only do we realise that sport is fun&#151;many of us have enjoyed it and continue to enjoy it, surprisingly, far past our teenage and our early years. We also know the other benefits that accrue from it, such as health and social inclusion. For all those reasons, this is a marvellous piece of work.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para5"></a>I do not want people outside this Chamber to read Hansard and think that this issue is of interest only to men. I want to say thank you on behalf of all the women and girls. They, too, love their sport, and I want it to be seen both in this Chamber and outside that they welcome the amendment. It is a marvellous achievement and I congratulate everyone concerned.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para6"></a>But the next thing I want to say to the Minister is: now we must make it work. We have had some bad press on community amateur sports clubs and we have to put that to rights. People have been disheartened, discouraged and frightened by what they have seen as the red tape involved in setting up community amateur sports clubs. Let us join together and make sure that we send this message out now: that is in the past. The future is much simpler, much more proactive and much more likely to benefit all our communities. I thank everyone who has been involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is nice, as a Minister, to be the recipient of congratulations, and the congratulations that have been generally disbursed are well merited. I, too, wanted specifically to mention Nigel Hook. He is to retire shortly and, in a sense, this is almost a parting gift. I know from contact with him that he is extremely grateful for what has occurred.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para7"></a>I take the point that this provision must be made to work. I suspect that those in the local authority sector, the CCPR, Sport England and everyone else will want to see it work, and work well. It deserves to. It will bring immense benefits to those clubs that operate at the lowest possible level. In my local authority area, some 20 sports clubs will benefit from this. This is a city with a population of a quarter of a million. We can see, if we extrapolate that, the enormous benefits that will accrue across the country.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para8"></a>The question was asked: who will pay for this? In the end, does it much matter? I can tell the noble Earl that there will not be a cost to business. The money will come from general taxation. But, in general, business has a role to play in sponsoring and supporting sport, and it does that very well indeed. That will be reflected financially, I suspect, in the way in which the formula works. That is how these matters usually operate, and certainly that is how we intend to see it work.

<a name="30910-11_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30910-11_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 10.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para15"></a>Governments of all persuasions have accepted that rating revaluations may produce significant increases in rate bills for individual ratepayers and that, therefore, a cushion should be introduced to avoid sudden and significant increases in such bills. That concept is not opposed by the amendments that I have tabled.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para16"></a>The Government are tightening the current rating system by introducing self-financing for transition within each financial year. The Bill also calls for any shortfalls in any year to be recovered by changes to the unified business rate in later years, thus removing any chance of predictability ratepayers may have for their forthcoming rate liabilities. That makes the system a whole lot more complicated.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para17"></a>The Government intend to achieve this precise balance for transitional arrangements through two mechanisms, or through a combination of the two. The first mechanism is to balance the cost of cushioning rate bill increases by delaying reductions in rate bills when a ratepayer has not experienced an increase in rateable value. That is otherwise known as downwards transition.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para18"></a>The second mechanism is to make a simple, overall surcharge on the uniform business rate in order to pay for the cost of transition for ratepayers. I believe that this second approach is fairer to ratepayers if the cost of the surcharge is spread over the lifetime of a rating list rather than set every year.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para19"></a>The amendments do not&#151;and never have done&#151;fundamentally challenge the notion of self-financing. They merely seek to redress the unfairness of the means of making transitions self-financing&#151;which the Government have admitted will include the system of downwards transition. Downwards transition means that, following a revaluation, ratepayers whose rateable values change by less than the national increase in rateable value will find themselves subsidising more successful ratepayers whose rateable value has increased, often as a result of their location in a growing business area. Independent research suggested that this policy cost ratepayers £1.3 billion in denied rate reductions between 1995 and 2000. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that that is <P>


<a name="column_333"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fundamentally unfair and that it affects most harshly the very ratepayers, estimated by independent research to be in the hundreds of thousands, who are for the most part in small or medium-sized enterprises which find rates a disproportionate burden.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para20"></a>The amendments instead seek to facilitate alternative arrangements for transitional arrangements in England, identified by the independent report, The future of business rating transition in England, produced in time for this Bill, in February of this year. The report concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Compared with the current system, implementing any one of these schemes"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-11_para21"></a>the schemes that I have put forward&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would have the advantages of speed of implementation, robustness, fairness, transparency and affordability",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-11_para22"></a>in comparison to the Government's proposals.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para23"></a>The amendments would enable a government to avoid "downwards transition" through allowing a surcharge in the uniform business rate to be phased in over more than one year. That gives the flexibility that the Government need to avoid making transitional self-financing in each and every financial year and allows the Government a practical opportunity to avoid downwards phasing.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para24"></a>I wish to stress that my amendment would address the lack of flexibility that the Bill imposes on the Government. I was party to a mistake in 1988, when we did the same thing and left no flexibility at all. That had to be corrected in 1992; the Government had to redress the situation. I fear that the present Government are making the same mistake as we made in 1988.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para25"></a>My final point relates to the question that I asked on the previous amendment. For months, in the negotiations that we have had with the Government, they have turned round to us and said that there can be no money from the general taxpayer. The system that I have proposed is self-financing over a five-year period together with interest. It requires some investment from the general taxpayer in the first one or two years, which is then recouped; so at the end of the fifth year there has been no cost to the general taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="30910-11_para26"></a>In his response to the previous amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, confirmed that the general taxpayer would be the person who bore the cost of the relief for sports clubs. That is a new and important step forward. It means that the Government will use general taxation for the benefit of some sectors. I also refer the noble Lord to the local retention of business rates. That, again, is being supported by the general taxpayer. Here, I propose a system that is not going to cost the general taxpayer any money over a five-year period. It will initially, but all that money will come back. It is better for business; it is more equitable for business. The amendment is strongly supported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Rating Surveyors' Association and the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30910-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I briefly want to support my noble friend Lord Caithness as regards the <P>


<a name="column_334"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. I remember very well the last revaluation of business rates that took place. All I can recall is that not only was the issue terribly complicated, but it was very widely misunderstood and resented by business.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para0"></a>Having seen the four pages in the Bill that deal with this matter I think that there will be even more resentment. I do not suppose that anyone will be able to understand it, however hard they try. This seems to be an easily understood method of ensuring that a revaluation involving changes to people's tax, either up or down, is implemented in a way which shows fairness&#151;which I do not think that the previous revaluation of rates ever absolutely managed to demonstrate. So I think this is a very neat way of dealing with the issue, and I very much hope that it will have the Government's support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, we, on these Benches, at previous stages of the Bill supported the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in his efforts to deal with this very difficult issue. We continue to do so at this stage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para1"></a>The situation is particularly disappointing because the House of Commons' Select Committee inquiry into this Local Government Bill warned the Government about fettering their ability to contribute to the costs of transition. It pointed out the difficulties that the Government could get into if there was a downturn in business. But this Bill completely removes their ability to support transitional relief.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para2"></a>As the noble Earl said, it is disappointing that the Ministers at ODPM have not been able to persuade the Treasury as they did with sport because I consider this to be a similar kind of issue: it is about local matters, it is about small local businesses. We all know that our successful large businesses started as small businesses. I regret that the Government feel unable to keep an open mind and to give themselves the ability always to support small businesses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, Clause 64 assures ratepayers that there will be a transition scheme to accompany future revaluations. The existing provision in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 simply confers a power to establish a scheme, but does not impose a duty to do so. Business, including the CBI, has stressed the necessity of transition schemes.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para3"></a>The details of a future scheme&#151;the annual increases and decreases in bills&#151;will be decided in the run-up to the revaluation concerned, when the impact on individual rateable values will be known and more certain. But, as we stated in the White Paper Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services, any future transition scheme will need to be self-financing. There is no reason why the general taxpayer, as opposed to the ratepayer, should meet the cost of transitional relief. Accordingly, Clause 64 requires that the total rate yield for any year is not to be affected by a transition scheme.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para4"></a>The clause allows for flexibility in how schemes may be structured so as to be self-financing. The methods likely to be used include having a transition scheme <P>


<a name="column_335"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which balances the rates lost through phasing in increases in bills against the rates gained by phasing in decreases. Such phasing of decreases in bills as well as increases has been a feature&#151;as I am sure all noble Lords will acknowledge&#151;of past schemes.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para5"></a>In addition to providing for a scheme which balances rate income lost through phasing in increases and rate income gained through phasing in decreases, this clause allows for an addition to rate bills generally as a means of making good the loss of rates resulting from phasing in increases in bills.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para6"></a>This clause also allows for a scheme which is funded by a combination of phasing in decreases and an addition to rate bills generally. This will allow us to put in place a fair and workable scheme.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para7"></a>The effect of these amendments is to make transition revenue neutral over a five-year period&#151;instead of year by year as set out in the Bill&#151;with the Treasury making a contribution to the cost of the scheme in the first years. The Treasury would need a way to recover in later years what it had paid in the early years. The Exchequer would also need to recover interest on what it had paid out in the early years of the scheme, and would need to recover a sum to offset the effects of inflation between paying out the sums concerned and recovering them. All this would make for a complicated calculation&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said that it would be simple&#151;which would also introduce an element of uncertainty for ratepayers.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para8"></a>A five-year revenue neutral scheme would be much more complicated to operate and far less intelligible to the ratepayer than a scheme which was revenue neutral year by year. Furthermore, it is our view that it is difficult to see any reason for such a scheme. Why should the general taxpayer in effect give a loan to ratepayers at the start of each transition scheme?
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para9"></a>Transitional relief means that we are easing the burden on ratepayers. We do not believe that the general taxpayer should cover the cost of this. It seems fair to us that ratepayers in general should pick up that bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para10"></a>An attempt to make a scheme revenue neutral over the five-year life of a list would mean that at each revaluation complex estimates would need to be made in advance of announcing any transition scheme. If at the end of the fourth year it was discovered that the Treasury had not recouped the money it had contributed in the early years, rate bills would have to be increased to balance the scheme. That would create uncertainty for the ratepayer.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, asked why the general taxpayer should not pay for the transitional relief. As I have made clear, this scheme could cost billions of pounds. That would be a heavy burden on general taxpayers. He cited the previous amendment in aid of his case. The cost of relief to sports clubs will of course be far less; more importantly, it will be of tremendous benefit to non-profit-making bodies. Businesses, by their very nature, do not fall into that category. The cost of the relief granted is significant <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>but minuscule by comparison to the potential costs of the general taxpayer funding the transitional relief proposition contained within the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para12"></a>I hope that, having listened carefully to what I have said&#151;although we may still disagree on this issue&#151;that the noble Earl and the noble Baronesses who have spoken in favour of the amendment will think again and withdraw it today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-12_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, I listened with great care to the noble Lord. I have to say to the noble Lord that it is only the Government&#151;not the practitioners, not industry and not businesses&#151;who think that their proposal will be less complicated than the one that I have submitted. Virtually everything the noble Lord said refers to the Government scheme and not to our scheme. Our scheme is more certain for businesses. It is much fairer for businesses. The Government's scheme will certainly cause mayhem. As a chartered surveyor I would say to the Government, "Thank you very much". Many of my colleagues will make a huge amount of money out of this by advising businesses. I want to do them out of some of that money. I want to make the scheme simpler, more straightforward and more transparent. I want to get rid of the uncertainty that the Government are creating.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para13"></a>The noble Lord said that the general taxpayer should not contribute. Overall, I totally agree. The general taxpayer will not contribute under my scheme. By the end of the five-year period, all the money, together with interest and inflation, will be reclaimed by the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="30910-12_para14"></a>I am very grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and my noble friend Lady Hanham. This is now the occasion to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 43, line 7, at end insert ", provided that such change does not alter the ratio between the top and bottom band.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
(4B) The power under subsection (4A) shall not be used to alter the ratio between the top and bottom bands set out in subsection (1).""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-13_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment would not restrict the Government's power to vary the number of council tax bands. It would simply retain the current ratio between the top and bottom bands. That would mean that householders in the top band would continue to pay three times as much council tax as those in the bottom band.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para4"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to provide householders with a degree of protection against steep rises in council tax, which is escalating to unprecedented levels. In 2003, council tax breached the £1,000 average. Even the Government have now recognised that council tax rises of the level that we have witnessed over the past three years are unsustainable.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para5"></a>In Committee, we debated at length the motivation behind the introduction of council tax. It was originally devised as part property tax and part tax on services. It was never designed to be based solely on the capital value of a property. That is why there is a structure of discounts based on the number and type of occupancy.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para6"></a>The discounts have nothing to do with the value of a property; they are based on an assumed reduced take-up of services. It is important that some consideration of service uptake is retained when planning any alterations to the tax system, so that we do not burden council tax payers with inflated charges based solely on property values. That is why the 3:1 ratio was originally introduced and why it is important that we make provision to ensure that it is retained. Let us also be clear that any threat to the existing 3:1 band ratio is a threat not necessarily to the wealthiest but often to those carrying the largest levels of mortgage debt or the lowest levels of disposable income.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para7"></a>On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, agreed that there is no direct correlation between the capital value of a property and the householder's income. Many properties with a high capital value might be owned by elderly retired people with low levels of disposable income, or by families with large mortgages and therefore relatively high levels of debt.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para8"></a>Property is a poor indicator of ability to pay. If variations in the number of bands mean a shift in the tax burden on to those householders occupying properties of higher capital value there will be problems&#151;particularly with the elderly, who already find it very difficult to meet their council tax bills. Several groups of elderly people have got together to oppose council tax.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para9"></a>The amendment does not seek to inhibit the Government from shifting around the balance of council tax payments through the introduction of new <P>


<a name="column_340"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bands. It simply seeks to put a cap on the Government's tax-raising powers. We believe that householders will appreciate that measure of protection. We do not believe that householders living in the same billing authority area will welcome the prospect of paying five times as much council tax as their neighbour because their house is five times more valuable. If that is what the Government have in mind, I think that there will be some very concerned people out there. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we discussed the issue at various stages of the Bill. We do not support the amendment. As many know, we do not particularly support council tax. I do not see that it will help at all. My main concern as regards revaluation is to consider some of those at the bottom end of the scale, particularly those in park homes and so on, who have had tremendous problems. If the Government are trying to look at bands, I do not think that the amendment would be very helpful or that it would ameliorate any of the real problems that we have with council tax. I am afraid that we do not support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, having just heard the three key words "ability to pay" from the Tory spokesman, if I had a sense of humour I would wish that the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, had been here. "Ability to pay"&#151;from the party that brought in poll tax. Come off it. I know that a decade is a long time in politics, but one must remember that council tax was introduced because of the absolute disaster of poll tax, where there was nothing like ability to pay. Now I am being lectured by the Conservative spokesman about ability to pay and local government finance. I am not taking that, for a start.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para10"></a>Having got that off my chest, I shall address the noble Lord's points. I accept that the amendment is narrow. There is not much new to say about the matter, but we must put it on the record. The amendment relates only to the Secretary of State exercising his powers to change the valuation ratio of 3:1 between the bottom and top bands. As I said previously, most people who pay council tax do not have a clue about the ratio between the top and bottom levels of council tax.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para11"></a>The amendment would mean that however council tax was fixed, the person with the biggest house in the area&#151;at the highest band, well above the lowest band&#151;would never pay more than three times the amount paid by the person in the house with the lowest value. There could be an argument about the issue; it has never been seriously debated. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, there are not too many cases of people in the top band and those in the lowest band living next to one another. I do not think that it is generally the case, so it is not a question of people paying five times more than their immediate neighbour.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para12"></a>When we discussed the issue on Report, I said that there was nothing new to say. I shall make the point in figures, which the noble Lord did not use. I fully accept what I said previously: occupancy of a property is not <P>


<a name="column_341"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a sign of the ability to pay or of a person's income. I do not retract those points, which are valid. A person whose house is, say, at the bottom of band H, valued at £320,000, would pay three times the council tax of someone whose house was valued at the top of band A at £40,000. Much to my regret, in some ways, there are thousands of dwellings worth much less than £40,000, and much less than £20,000, in parts of this country. Where someone in a dwelling valued at £20,000 or £40,000 lives a few streets away from a house valued at £320,000&#151;it need not necessarily be next door&#151;the poll tax ratio would be only 3:1 but the property value ratio would be 8:1. It could be a lot higher than that.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para13"></a>I repeat on the record that we have no plans to change the ratio. If the amendment were agreed, we would not be able to change the ratio to reflect more closely the relative values of the bands. We would be stuck with the ratio established in 1992. On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, conceded, at column 983, that he was not fully wedded to the existing ratio of 3:1, which he now seeks to set in concrete. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, at the same column, that there needed to be a careful review of the number of bands and the ratio between them. It was a duet. By and large, the message was, "We are not fully wedded to the status quo". Noble Lords did not come up with an alternative, although the alternative offered today is highly restrictive.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para14"></a>On Report, noble Lords expressed concern about the owners of houses in band H. But we are also concerned, as we must be, about those in houses in the current band A that are worth very little&#151;a lot less than £40,000. Even if no additional bands were created above the current band H, the amendment would prevent us creating an additional band below band H, for which the tax payable could be less than one third of the amount paid by those in band H.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para15"></a>Although, from the noble Lord's perspective, the amendment looks satisfactory, it would be highly restrictive if we wanted to propose going below the £40,000 level for the many thousands of people who, rightly, see their property as bearing no relation to the upper figure for band A.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para16"></a>I understand noble Lords' concerns about the exercise of powers, but constraining them in such a way is not a sensible way to proceed. Any change to the banding schemes, whether by re-valuing the bands, adding new bands or changing the ratios between bands, must be made by order, which is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in the House of Commons. If the Government were minded to do that, it is not something that could be slipped through without a debate and a vote. That would be the right way and would provide proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para17"></a>I repeat, however, that we have not yet decided whether we will change the ratio. It does not make sense to limit our powers in this area, especially as we know that the existing ratio does not reflect the relative spread of values.
<P>


<a name="column_342"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para18"></a>Although it is churlish for Ministers to say this, I must put on record the fact that the amendment is technically defective, because the actual power to change the ratios is Section 5(4)(a) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, not the new subsection (4A) inserted by Clause 77 of this Bill. That is a minor matter because if the will of the House were such that we should proceed, we could put that technical matter right. I make the point only in passing for the information of noble Lords. By the way, that is not an invitation to nip along and table a manuscript amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para19"></a>No decision has been made to change the ratio, but the amendment would be highly restrictive as drafted because it would prevent us from introducing a band below £40,000. It is right for us to be concerned, as we all are, about property owners at all levels. I understand the Opposition's concern about people in big houses who may be on poor incomes. I fully accept that. Nobody would argue that people should move from their family house, which may be full of memories. There is no reason for that to happen if people can maintain the property. Nevertheless, people with low incomes present a real problem.
<P>

<a name="30910-13_para20"></a>I fully accept that living in bigger, more expensive houses does not necessarily indicate an ability to pay. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the way to go about changing the situation because it would stop us doing something for people living in really poorly valued properties. That is one area that we certainly want to examine, but no decisions have been made.

<A NAME="30910-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that we should go over old history, but I want to return to why we introduced the community charge or poll tax. It was because there was a revolt against rates. I remember going to meetings where 500 or 600 people were unanimously jumping up in protest against the rates. We are reaching that stage with the council tax. In great chunks of the country, the community charge or poll tax was actually lower than the rates&#151;although not everywhere, which was one of the problems. However, in some parts of the country, people were actually paying less than they were under the old rate system. That was certainly the case in Essex.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para0"></a>There were problems. People were outraged about rates. I accept that people did not like the community charge, but we are now getting the same thing about council tax. The Government do not realise that. I attended a meeting with 200 or 300 people aged 65 and over, all of whom were revolting against the council tax. This legislation could gradually push council tax higher and higher, not only through extra expenditure, but through revaluation or a change in the bands.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para1"></a>I was minded to table a rather more complicated and sophisticated amendment. I thought that I should keep it simple, but perhaps I should have tabled a more sophisticated one, because then the Minister would not have been able to make the same comments.

<a name="30910-14_para2"></a>It is vital for the Government to realise how unpopular council tax is becoming and that something must be done about that. If we are to have new bands, putting some people into the higher bracket, after seven years of a Labour Government, it could be that the Conservative Party now cares more than the Government about people's ability to pay. That is why we are trying to protect those people. It is important to test the views of the House on this issue.

<a name="30910-14_para5"></a>Clause 92 [Power to charge for discretionary services]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 52, line 7, at end insert "except in cases where a surplus is generated and reinvested in the discretionary service for the purposes of increasing provision of the service or to raise the quality of the existing discretionary service"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-14_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30910-14_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment would deal with some of the practical, not to say philosophical, difficulties thrown up by the current drafting of the clause. The clause prevents a local authority from making a profit from charges for a discretionary service. That is wrong in principle and difficult to police in practice. We listened to the arguments made at other stages of the Bill's progress, and we remain convinced that there will be substantial practical problems with giving effect to the provision as it stands.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para8"></a>The amendment would address some of those concerns. It would enable local authorities to over-recover the costs of provision of a discretionary service but only for the purpose of reinvestment in the service, in order to improve it or widen take-up. After all, the bottom line for all of us is service improvement. Let us not close off one obvious avenue to achieving that.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para9"></a>I remind your Lordships that we are talking about discretionary services, services that local authorities are under no obligation to provide and consumers are under no obligation to purchase. We welcome the introduction of a power to charge for such services. Without that power, the services would probably not exist. Local authorities are hard pressed to meet their statutory commitments, without the added pressure of delivering non-statutory, loss-making services.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para10"></a>My strong belief is that local authorities would be inclined to make much greater use of a power that enabled them to improve a service, without having to subsidise it from somewhere else. They would be able to use the power more effectively. We accept that the purpose of the power is, primarily, to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of our communities and that it is not intended to provide a further income stream for local authorities. However, in order for local authorities to remain a high-quality service and meet the requirements of promoting the well-being of our communities, it is clear that, in some instances, they may wish to over-recover their costs in order to invest in service improvements, either to raise the quality of service provision or to increase the capacity of the service.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para11"></a>We should not miss the opportunity in the Bill to enable local authorities to improve the quality of their discretionary service provision. The message that the <P>


<a name="column_346"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill sends to local authority managers is that they must make a loss and guard against the prospect of creating a surplus. That seems nonsensical.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para12"></a>In Grand Committee, the noble Lords on the Government Front Bench suggested that amendments previously tabled had been designed to push local authorities into unrestricted commercial activity. I hope that those noble Lords will not construe the new amendment in that way. We seek to make clear and explicit the freedoms that are hinted at in the Bill. On Report, there was a suggestion, born of experience, I think, from the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, that flexibility in defining "costs" could provide sufficient room for manoeuvre in the clause. There was, undoubtedly, a good deal of truth and practical sense in that proposition. However, given that it is primary legislation, finance people, however clever they may be, will find it difficult to change new investment to costs. We are concerned with improving service delivery and widening provision. I cannot see why we should not make explicit what is implicit and say to local authorities that they may over-recover their costs, but only for the purpose of improving the service. That is a more honest and straightforward way of dealing with the power.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para13"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, mentioned the dangers of allowing authorities to enter into unrestricted commercial activity. On the face of it, it is a reasonable argument. None of us wishes to see local authorities putting themselves into financial difficulties because they have lost money as a consequence of delivering discretionary services. However, that is not the danger that the Minister sees. He seems to be content for local authorities to lose money, and the clause does not prohibit that. Perhaps the Minister is alert to a more subtle danger that some of us may have missed. Perhaps there is a danger in allowing local authorities to make money. That is ruled out in this clause. Again, let us remind ourselves that these are services which no one has to purchase and which local authorities do not have to provide.
<P>

<a name="30910-14_para14"></a>As well as the principal objections that we have to this measure, we are also concerned about how it will work in practice. What will happen if the take-up of the service is greater than predicted and local authorities make a surplus? Will they be penalised? Will they have to pay back any profit? To whom will they pay the money? Surely, the most sensible and practical way forward would be to oblige any profit to be reinvested in the service. That is what we are suggesting in this amendment. I hope that noble Lords will support this pragmatic approach. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, we have a great deal of sympathy with the principle underlying the amendment. As the noble Lord said, it would be quite difficult to guarantee that no profit will be made on a service over a year. It may be that the Minister can tell us that regulations will deal with that situation should it occur. At this stage, I wonder whether the wording is <P>


<a name="column_347"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sufficient to carry out the intention of the amendment. However, we support it in principle. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I began to feel that probably there was not so much difference between us. However, I shall go through the issue carefully. It was interesting that the noble Lord addressed some of the points we made at earlier stages of the Bill. I am grateful to him for that.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para0"></a>Amendment No. 12 appears to allow authorities to invest in their discretionary services with the aim of increasing both the take-up and the quality of the service concerned. We have no problem with that. Under the power, as currently drafted, any such reinvestment would count as a cost of the service and would reduce any surplus, thus helping the authority to achieve the duty in the clause. In other words, standard accounting practice already achieves one of the objectives which perhaps lies behind the amendment. If it is the case that it is seeking to allow only such investment, the amendment would be unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para1"></a>However, the amendment goes further than that. It would absolve authorities of the need to comply with the duty in Clause 92(3). It would allow all best value authorities to engage in a restricted form of trading, irrespective of performance&#151;not something that I think we, across the Chamber, would agree with&#151;and without the necessary checks and balances envisaged in the trading powers set out in Clauses 94 and 95. It would permit something without those checks and balances which I think we are agreed should be in place. It would permit a form of trading by the back door.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para2"></a>The provision on charging at Clause 92 is not about allowing authorities to enter into commercial activity in their discretionary service provision. The purpose of providing a new general power to enable best value authorities to charge for discretionary services is to encourage them to enhance their existing services and to develop new ones that will help to improve the service provided to their community. That is probably a shared objective. It is not our intention, through this new power, to provide a new source of income for authorities, but it should allow them only to cover their costs.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para3"></a>I appreciate that in Committee some concerns were expressed about whether an authority would be acting ultra vires&#151;a point, I believe, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock&#151;if its income exceeded its costs by only a very small amount. Clause 92 gives local authorities flexibility in terms of costs and charges. The concept of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"taking one . . .  year with another",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-15_para4"></a>is well precedented&#151;for example, with NHS trusts and in the Audit Commission Act 1998&#151;as a way of establishing the idea of balancing the books without having detailed prescription either in the Bill or in secondary legislation. Any over or under recovery, resulting in a surplus or deficit of income in relation to costs, would be addressed by an authority when setting its charges for future years, so that, over time, income equated to costs.
<P>


<a name="column_348"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para5"></a>We do not want this clause to operate in a heavy-handed way at all. I made that point at an earlier stage. We understand the spirit behind this amendment, but it does not address the issue properly&#151;again, a point on which I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, was uncertain. I can give an assurance that we do not want the clause to operate in a heavy-handed form. The heart of the proposed amendment is defective, despite the noble Lord's efforts to ensure that it would work properly. We cannot permit a form of trading to be established by a back-door route. We permit that in other parts of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para6"></a>Having heard that explanation, I hope that on this occasion the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment because we are not a million miles apart on this.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_time0"></a><H5>6.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for that reply. I agree that we are not many miles apart. At an earlier stage I quoted&#151;I shall not quote again&#151;the situation regarding archaeologists, who are being withdrawn from local authorities because they are unaffordable. If costs can be recovered through commercial activity when houses are being built and so forth, that service could continue. That is the type of instance to which I referred.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para7"></a>I have noted carefully what the Minister said today and on previous occasions. Obviously, it is all on the record. It is important and I believe that the Government acknowledge the problem. I was interested to hear the Minister say that reinvestment in the service is obviously a cost and that it can therefore go down as a cost in the way in which it is presented. With those assurances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 13, I shall clarify what has been a serious misunderstanding at previous stages of what it is that I am trying to achieve. The amendment simply extends the right of social workers to exercise their conscience in a situation which seriously compromises their profound belief that children should be adopted by a mother and a father.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para11"></a>I implore those who oppose my amendment&#151;who may speak against me today&#151;to give reasons why some professionals are protected by a conscience clause and why this particular group of professionals cannot enjoy the same freedom. Dawn Jackson and Norah Ellis are the cases that I cited in previous debates. Of course, there are others; I heard of another only today. They worked for Sefton Borough Council Social Services Department. Between them they have 46 years experience of childcare. They are specialists in adoption; they have dealt with the most complex and difficult cases over all those years, and they have exemplary records.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para12"></a>As mothers, as very practised social workers specialising in adoption and as committed Christians, based on practical evidence they believe profoundly that a child fares better and is more secure when placed with a mother and a father, who, preferably, are married. There has been considerable misunderstanding during earlier stages, but absolutely nothing proposed in my amendment invalidates gay adoption. Parliament has decided that issue: gay and lesbian people may adopt children. Although I oppose that proposal, I nevertheless accept the will of Parliament. I repeat, my amendment does not invalidate that change in the law.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para13"></a>However, just as teachers can refuse to teach religious education or take a religious assembly, just as medical professionals can refuse to carry out or assist with abortions, why cannot a social worker enjoy the same right? Nor will my amendment result in stigmatising anyone. Doctors exercising their conscience about not performing abortions does not stigmatise those who have abortions. Teachers exercising their conscience do not stigmatise children. Social workers exercising their conscience who in every other respect are doing an excellent job, would not stigmatise others. At a time when there is a serious lack of good experienced social workers, those two ladies&#151;and we know of others&#151;have been hounded out of their jobs in a specialist area of adoption. The Green Paper presented to Parliament yesterday referred to the need to do more to attract good, experienced social workers. Norah Ellis and Dawn Jackson had exemplary careers in adoption services. My amendment is too late for them&#151;they were hounded out of their jobs&#151;but it would prevent others from experiencing the same cruel fate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, on her tenacity in relation to this question. However, I am sorry that she has brought this matter to the House at this late stage and I hope that the House will reject her amendment. I know that the noble Baroness disagreed with the <P>


<a name="column_350"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 350</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decision of Parliament in relation to the Adoption and Children Act passed last Session although she has said she accepts the decision. The issue is expressly about the issue of a clause of conscience for social workers rather than whether unmarried couples&#151;whether of the same or the opposite sex&#151;may adopt. One must consider the issue she has raised in the overall context of why Parliament passed the Adoption and Children Act in the previous Session. We had a very serious consideration of these issues.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para14"></a>The outcome for many children in care has been very poor. The statistics seem to show that half of young people in prison under the age of 18 and 26 per cent of all prisoners have been in care at some stage. Up to 20 per cent of all care leavers experience some form of homelessness within two years of leaving care. More than half of young people leaving care at the age of 16 and over are unemployed. Some estimates put that proportion as high as 80 per cent. We know that for many of those young people adoption would have been a much better option. The outcome for adopted children is so much better than for those children left in care despite the enormous work of those in the care setting. We also know that there have been long problems with the adoption process. Thankfully, the Act passed last year together with associated changes has improved the system of adoption no end. In 1996, the total time spent in care before final adoption was three years and four months. That is a long time in anyone's mind but in the experience of a young person, it is often an eternity.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para15"></a>The question of unmarried couples was a very crucial issue in the debate on improving adoption procedures. The fact was that before the passage of the previous Act, single people could and did adopt. In such circumstances, if a single person was in a relationship with another person, whether of the same or opposite sex, that person was also assessed by social workers. Before the Act of last year was passed, that partner could not adopt. As a Minister responsible for that Bill at the time, I was impressed with the views of young people who had been adopted in such circumstances. They argued that they would feel more secure if both partners could adopt jointly. This House agreed and passed the necessary legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, may shake her head but it is important to set the context in which to make a judgment as to whether her amendment ought to be accepted. One cannot consider the question of a conscience clause in isolation from decisions that this House made after intense and passionate debate less than 12 months ago.
<P>

<a name="30910-15_para16"></a>No one has the right to adopt. The paramount interest must be the child. I am convinced that the changes we made were in the interests of the child. Frankly, this amendment is retrograde and against the interests of the child in adoption procedures. Whether one considers an issue of conscience by social workers in this regard to be on the same level as that of doctors in relation to abortion or teachers in relation to the teaching of religious education is a matter of individual judgment that each noble Lord must make. If we look at the history of adoption, for many years <P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>single people have been able to adopt. Whatever the sexual orientation of their partner, if that person applied to adopt a child, their partner would also be assessed. I do not believe that the issue of conscience in relation to social workers is of the same order as the two examples she gave on doctors and abortion and teachers and the teaching of religious education. The amendment of the noble Baroness would set a worrying precedent and make administration of the law on adoption very difficult for the relevant public authorities. I have no doubt that if it were passed, it risks reducing the pool of prospective adopters. For the sake of children for many years to come, this House should reaffirm the decision made in the previous Session and reject this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I oppose this amendment for the very close reasoning given by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. I shall not reiterate parts of the reasoning. This is advanced as a conscience clause. It is a conscience clause that qualifies implementation of those provisions of an Act of Parliament contrary to the spirit of the enactment. As such, it is indeed the motivation. It is a wholly unacceptable position. That Act was brought in after a pretty tough dispute in your Lordships' House. I supported the provisions. My noble friend opposed them and we both have an interest to declare. I certainly declare mine. The reasons for retaining my position could not have been better put than by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. The amendment expressly recognises an aversion to homosexuals as adopters or unmarried couples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it does not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, it does. In terms. If my noble friend would like me to give way, I shall give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, indeed it does not. Just like the doctor who does not wish to be involved in aborting babies, the amendment refers to the profound beliefs of social workers in the way in which children should be placed. I made a specific point when I said it does not stigmatise homosexuals in any way. My amendment just protects the right of the social worker not to be given that work to do.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_time0"></a><H5>6.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I hear what she says and shall try to deal with it in a moment, but I really cannot deal with interruptions from a sedentary position&#151;they make it quite impossible to make a speech.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para0"></a>If one looks at the terms of the amendment, it is manifestly plain that it recognises an aversion to unmarried couples as adopters which extends, against the background of the whole debate in this House, to homosexual couples. Before this, a single homosexual could adopt. The amendment totally ignores the absence of any evidence of any untoward conduct by a single homosexual adopter in the past. That was a <P>


<a name="column_352"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter that carried some credence when your Lordships considered the subject in a strenuous debate, argued by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, with my noble friend Lady Blatch arguing against him.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para1"></a>The amendment also ignores the stringency of the vetting procedure, and another matter that was of considerable importance in the debate&#151;the plight and interests of those thousands of children in care who seek the benefit of a home, education, prospects for a happy life and so forth.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para2"></a>It is understood that it is the intention to take the opinion of your Lordships' House with a free vote on these Benches. That is why I have spoken at a little length today, and I seek your Lordships' indulgence for having done so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Richardson of Calow: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support the amendment. Your Lordships will know that I wholeheartedly agree with the adoption provisions, and I have spoken many times on the matter in this House. Some people have very strong convictions and I believe that their employment should not be put at risk because of them, although I do not share that viewpoint in any way.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para3"></a>My primary reason for supporting the amendment is to safeguard the rights of those couples described under proposed subsection (2)(a) and (b) who offer themselves for assessment. They have a right to be assessed without prejudice, whether acknowledged or unacknowledged, by those who do the assessment. They have a right to be judged by criteria that are as objective as they can be, and which would be better preserved if those with strong conscientious objections over the matter were allowed not to be put in the situation of having to make that judgment.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para4"></a>I support the amendment, which would benefit not only those with strong religious convictions but, primarily, those who need to be assessed in a proper way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I join the debate with some regret, as these matters have been debated at considerable length on many occasions.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para5"></a>I shall deal with two points. First, in moving her amendment the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said that those of us who oppose her do so on a misunderstanding of her intent. I believe that we do not do so, but that we understand entirely what the amendment seeks to do. It seeks not to overturn your Lordships' decision on same-sex couple adoption but to undermine it in practice. That is as unacceptable as seeking to overturn it.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para6"></a>We all know that principles have to be put into action. Anyone who has read at length the Climbie report will know what life is like in a social services department, particularly in a children's unit. The amendment would enable social services departments, which are already working beyond capacity in many cases, particularly in children's work, to keep on their staff people who absent themselves from part of their work. The net effect would be that all children would suffer.
<P>


<a name="column_353"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para7"></a>The most dangerous thing about the amendment&#151;as I said when we discussed it in previous debates&#151;is the precedent that it sets that the beliefs of staff and social services departments take precedence over the needs and wishes of users. If noble Lords have read the Climbie report at any length, they will know what a dangerous precedent that would be. Tremendous work is being done in the social work profession to move in a way that is completely contrary to that.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para8"></a>Secondly, I want to address a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson of Calow. I hold her in high regard, as I have done throughout all our decisions, and I have had similar thoughts to those that she has expressed. Ultimately, much though it pains me to disagree with her, I believe that she is wrong. I came to my conclusion after spending time reading a lot about the history of adoption and fostering in this country. During the passage of the adoption Bill, I spent considerable time talking to people who were coming to terms as adults with the effects of decisions made on their behalf by people who thought that they were acting with the best of intentions.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para9"></a>Adoption is always an expression of the views and philosophy of the society of the time. If one goes back into the history of fostering and adoption, one comes across instances where people of undoubted good faith and intentions made decisions because of their beliefs on matters of race and religion. From our standpoint now, we can see that those decisions have had the most damaging effect on children.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para10"></a>I am haunted by many of the letters that I received throughout the passage of the adoption Bill, but one in particular sticks in my mind. A man was trying to figure out why as a child he was moved on from a very happy placement. He said that the only reason he could possibly think of was that his foster parents were Jewish and that he was not; he wished that he had been left in that happy situation, Christian though he was&#151;and still was when I spoke to him&#151;rather than being moved.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para11"></a>I have no doubt that in the course of our debates we were right to stick with the principle in Clause 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 that it is the best interest of the child that is paramount. That is why I believe that the amendment moved by the noble Baroness is not only wrong but dangerous. I therefore hope that noble Lords will retain the decision that we have made on at least six occasions when we have discussed the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-16_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the question of the rights of the individual conscience against the state is one that has absorbed some of the finest minds in our cultural tradition over some 2,000 years and more. Distilling all that into a few words is something of a challenge, but I believe that I can see something of a distinction, to which my noble friend Lady Barker referred.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para12"></a>Where, as an individual, one is commanded to do something that one thinks is sinful, one must not do it. But when one is taking part in the provision of a public service, as my noble friend Lady Barker said, the users <P>


<a name="column_354"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 354</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also have rights. There the principle of the rights of conscience, although it cannot ever be extinguished, must be handled with a good deal more caution and balance.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para13"></a>I have had to think quite hard about this because a great many of the changes imposed on universities by successive governments have involved me in doing things against which my conscience protested. In some cases I have managed to make the cup pass from me by the exercise of some ingenuity. But I have taken the line throughout that a public service is to an extent a seamless robe, and if one cannot do what is required in that service, then one must resign from it. Since the Education Act 1988 I have been several times very near doing that myself. But I would not have claimed the right to exercise my individual conscience to refuse to perform a service which I then knew had to fall on long-suffering colleagues who were desperately overworked already and who in many cases might dislike it almost as much as I did.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para14"></a>The point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson of Calow, was one of great brilliance, but not therefore necessarily a point of truth. It is a point which only a very great and sensitive mind could have made. But if one thinks, for example, of the first women to attempt to enter public and political life, they also had to face assessment from people who took a very dim view indeed of the political powers of women. I believe that they were right in deciding&#151;and my grandmother was among them&#151;that it was much better to face down these dangers at the earliest possible stage because equality would never be achieved until one took the bull by the horns, faced down the dangers and the hostility and defeated them.
<P>

<a name="30910-16_para15"></a>I believe that the women who took that attitude were right. They suffered a good deal in doing it, but I believe that the suffering was shrewdly and deliberately chosen. I wonder whether these cases have some parallel element.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, this has been a valuable discussion, revisiting an issue which has been debated twice already within the confines of this Bill, in Grand Committee and on Report. It would be unkind of me not to join in the congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Batch, on her tenacity. I appreciate that and also her sincerity in these matters. But, like the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is clear in her intent. She accepts the will of Parliament in these matters. She well understands that the impact of her amendment, were it to be carried by the House, would undermine the will of Parliament. I believe that is the case and that that view is generally shared in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para0"></a>At each stage of this Bill we have explained why the clause is inappropriate. We continue to resist the amendment for reasons that I intend to spell out very clearly. As we all appreciate, Amendment No. 13 would ensure that no person working for or on behalf of a local authority shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal <P>


<a name="column_355"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requirement, to participate in adoption placements or processing adoption applications to which they have a conscientious objection.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para1"></a>This refers to cases where children are to be placed for adoption with an unmarried couple or with one person who is in fact part of a couple living together as partners in an enduring family relationship. It also covers the processing of these adoption applications.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para2"></a>The Adoption and Children Act 2002 allows for the first time unmarried couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, to apply to adopt a child jointly. However, as we all understand, it has long been possible for a person in an unmarried relationship to apply to adopt as a single person.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para3"></a>The Adoption and Children Act does not therefore raise any fundamental new issues, so we do not believe that there is any need to make special provision for conscientious objections as a result of the change to enable unmarried couples to adopt jointly. Arguably, the key benefit for children of the change in the 2002 Act is that it enables a child adopted by an unmarried couple to have the permanence and security of having two legal parents. I believe that all Members of the House would welcome that.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para4"></a>The new clause raises employment issues that are more suitably addressed by the Employment Equality (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003, which were approved by both Houses on l7th June. These regulations will prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in employment and vocational training.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para5"></a>Local authorities have a duty to maintain an adoption service in their area that meets the needs of those who may adopt a child. This includes unmarried couples and individuals who are in fact part of a couple. As many noble Lords have said, the clause would make it more difficult for local authorities to provide a service and to meet their duties and could well lead to delays in the assessment of prospective adopters able to meet the needs of children waiting for adoption. I do not believe that anyone sees that as a desirable outcome. The Government believe that it is unacceptable to risk vulnerable children losing out on the chance of, or experiencing delays in, finding a new family.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para6"></a>I believe that the comparison drawn with conscientious objection to abortion in earlier debates is unhelpful in that conscientious objection to participating in an abortion procedure often raises strong ethical issues around the sanctity of life whereas objecting to non-married couples adopting is about judgmental attitudes on the lifestyle of individuals and their personal choices. There is a profound difference in that, which seems entirely inappropriate to the present.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para7"></a>As I said at the outset, I do not doubt the noble Baroness's sincerity and I certainly do not doubt her tenacity. But I hope that, having listened to the arguments, the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw the new clause.

<A NAME="30910-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister most strongly for at least not doubting my sincerity and motivation for tabling the amendment. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, do doubt my sincerity. They have attributed to me motivations which I find deeply hurtful and which are simply wrong. I want to protect people like Norah Ellis and Dawn Jackson, the lady I heard about today, and others whose jobs are now at risk. In fact, what those two ladies experienced was frightful. It was discrimination against them because of their beliefs, which I understand from what the noble Lord has just said gave&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-17_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I speak on behalf of my noble friend Lady Barker. I never understood her to be referring to the noble Baroness's intentions. I have checked this reading with my noble friend. She acknowledges the noble Baroness's sincerity completely. What was being discussed was the effect of the amendment. Even after Pepper v Hart the mind of the mover is not the sole guide of the courts to the intention of Parliament. I believe that my noble friend Lady Barker is right about what will be taken to be its intention. I admit that the noble Baroness believes otherwise, but this is simply a difference of opinion between us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl will receive a very apologetic letter from me tomorrow if I am wrong, but I remember the noble Baroness saying that she did not think that I was invalidating the previous Act of Parliament, but that my intention was to undermine it. That was personal against me. I shall read Hansard and I promise a profuse apology if I misinterpreted the noble Baroness.  
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para8"></a>My motivation is that, just like medical professionals, the professionals involved in adoption have a strong belief on two grounds. One is practical, and is supported by evidence that my noble friend said does not exist. I have not chosen to engage that argument because it was lost when the decision was taken by Parliament to allow same-sex adoption. However, I invoked the other argument: that their religious beliefs are such that they would find it in all conscience difficult to engage in processing and/or assisting in same-sex adoption.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para9"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson, and I are not usually on the same side, but I thank her for what she said because she introduced a different argument. It would be difficult for someone holding strong views who was well known in the authority&#151;as indeed they were in Sefton Borough Council&#151;to be assessed knowing that someone had a prejudice or a belief. We can argue about the words. They would not feel secure that they were being judged or assessed fairly. That is a powerful argument for which I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para10"></a>Many of the comments made are not acceptable as arguments. There are no fewer abortions simply because some doctors do not perform them and some professionals in the medical world do not assist with <P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them. That is managed in the health service, just as it could be managed in the world of social services. There is always more work than there are people to carry it out, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said. Therefore there is always a choice of work for these fine, exemplary workers to be put to and to allow them to exercise their conscience not to be involved in such work.
<P>

<a name="30910-17_para11"></a>It was not my intention to undermine the will of Parliament, but I oppose this level of intimidation against good, honest people; highly experienced social workers working in the interests&#151;as they feel&#151;of children. They should not be discriminated against simply because of their belief. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

 "PARISH COUNCILS (MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT) ORDER 2001
<br>
(1) The Parish Councils (Model Code of Conduct) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3576) shall cease to have effect.
<br>
(2) This section shall come into effect on the day on which this Act is passed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now return to an amendment that we first debated on Report. We do so because, as that debate showed, at stake are some interesting issues which we believe require further consideration. I should hope that we would all agree that parish councillors do an enormous amount of good work for their communities, often for little recognition or reward. They do this because they are public-minded citizens with a real sense of community who wish to make a positive impact on their localities. The bottom line is that we need more people like that. We want to encourage people to become parish councillors and not frighten them off.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para1"></a>As it currently stands, the parish councils' code of conduct requires all parish councillors to register interests, including their property, their employment and their business interests. It also requires them to register the interests of their spouses and relatives. Registering an interest is different from declaring an interest. It involves making a written and public statement of interest up front and in advance regardless of the likelihood of those interests ever having any bearing on any issues ever discussed or likely to be discussed within a parish council.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para2"></a>Parish councillors are not parliamentarians dealing with major issues of state; they are for the most part responsible for important but very strictly local issues. A comprehensive register of interests is ridiculous over-regulation. That is why we object to it. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that parish councils are seething hotbeds of corruption and fraud doing major damage to the economy and infrastructure of this nation. On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, quoted some examples of misconduct. No one would minimise the seriousness of any form of misconduct in public life, and I unreservedly support him in condemning those activities. However, if I remember the figures correctly, after investigation, 83 councillors were subjected to a period of disqualification. That means that, in a 12-month period, of approximately 20,000 parish councillors, less than half of one per cent were found guilty of any, and sometimes minor, misconduct. I may have the numbers slightly wrong, but I think that the point is clear. That is the scale of magnitude of wrong-doing with which we are dealing.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para3"></a>No one disputes at all the need for probity in public life. The question is whether noble Lords believe in the concept of balance. Should we regulate to eliminate the possibility of any risk under any circumstances and in every situation? Or should we try to make regulation proportionate to the risks involved? I favour the latter option, first, because there are costs involved in regulation, and those costs must be balanced against the level of risk against which they seek to offer protection. Secondly, all regulation potentially has the capacity to damage the institution or body regulated. In the case of parish councils, that is an outcome that we should all deplore.

<P>

<a name="30910-18_para4"></a>In May 2002, the University of Aberystwyth published an ESRC report on community governance in England and Wales. That report found that nearly 40 per cent of parish councils did not have enough councillors to fill their seats and that the situation had been in decline for more than a decade. However, the report concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It has been suggested to us that one factor behind the lack of candidates is that being a parish councillor is seen as an onerous task with little reward, and the introduction of the new code of conduct may prove a further disincentive".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-18_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30910-18_para6"></a>For the most part parish councillors are giving up their time for free to address very local issues. They do so because they are committed to the community ethic. We need to encourage more people to take that view. What the Government have done through the introduction of this code has had the opposite effect. It has made a bad situation worse and threatens to undermine one of the oldest institutions of government in this country. I hope that the Minister will consider this amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, we made our position very clear at other stages of the Bill. We on these Benches believe that if one puts oneself forward in any way for public office, one opens oneself to public scrutiny. I have listened to the arguments time and again, such as the fact that it may be a small council and councillors are not paid. With respect, I do not think that that is relevant. The important thing is that one is speaking and making decisions on behalf of others. All we are asking is that people use their common sense and declare where they are coming from and what possible interests they might have in the matter they are discussing.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para7"></a>Earlier this week, this House again addressed the issue of what one should declare as an interest. I think that a certain amount of common sense comes into this. I have briefly reread the requirements. A lot of fuss has been made about this, but I am clear that if someone wants to make decisions in public service on behalf of others, then the public have the right to know exactly where that person is coming from and what their interests are. If people are not prepared to do that, then it seems to me that they are not really very community-minded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, having served in the past on a parish council, for about 20 years, in one small Somerset village, I strongly support the amendment. In moving it, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, drew the key distinction between registration and declaration of interests. I hope that the Government listen to all his other arguments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, essentially the new clause seeks to remove parish councils from the ethical framework of behaviour that was established in the Local Government Act 2000. I am astonished that at Third Reading the matter is on the Order Paper. It seeks to remove parish councils from the model codes of conduct that followed that legislation by simply revoking the code that currently applies. I agree that <P>


<a name="column_361"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>separate codes have been established for local authorities, police authorities, national park authorities, the Broads authorities and the parishes. They cover everybody. Why should there be an exemption for one group of people who have put themselves forward to serve on those bodies? That could not possibly be justified. We would almost be saying that any level of behaviour goes for that sector. That would be unacceptable to the public. It should be unacceptable to Parliament. Also, the public would not have a test by which to judge the behaviour of people whom they elect.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para8"></a>I accept that there are difficulties. Earlier this year I was hoping to vote for the first time in a town council myself, but there were only 10 candidates for 13 places, so there was no possibility of voting. I am not aware&#151;I have not inquired&#151;and I have seen no evidence that it was this code that was the cause of that. The public have the right to expect that all the people who are taking decisions on their behalf that may affect their daily lives observe the highest standards of conduct. I cannot see the problem about operating the code. All parish councils are statutory consultees on planning issues. Some parishes have budgets of tens of thousands of pounds. I appreciate that the variation in parishes and the size of their budgets is enormous. However, some are very large, but why should the small ones be exempt? They are making the same kind of decisions&#151;true, for a smaller area&#151;but there is no good argument that they should be exempted.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para9"></a>It is astonishing that when that legislation was before Parliament and I was elsewhere in the Government&#151;this was not the key matter that I was dealing with&#151;the National Association of Local Councils, which represents the parish councils, pressed for their inclusion within the new ethical regime. I have not read the debates so I do not know whether that was opposed in this place, but the idea that the parishes should be pulled out now, just as the code is starting to operate, is nonsense. Much of the new code is similar to the previous code that was put in place in 1990. I have not personally checked that, but that is my information.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para10"></a>The main difference is that the new code requires registration of interests and the standards board provides an effective means to enforce it. In some ways the introduction of the standards board should probably have solved all of the problems for people in public life. When allegations are made against them for all kinds of spurious reasons, the standards board is there as a back-stop to make sure that we have a proper independent judgment over the operation of the codes. I understand that half of the allegations so far sent to the standards board relate to parish councillors. I cast no aspersions about parish councillors on that matter&#151;there are an enormous number of them compared to county councillors and district councillors. I do not know the precise figures.
<P>


<a name="column_362"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para11"></a>The effect of the amendment would repeal the current order. It does not repeal the power of the Secretary of State to introduce an order. If the amendment were pushed&#151;I sincerely hope it is not&#151;I hope that it will not be carried. If it were, I suspect the Secretary of State would introduce a new order the following day, because his powers to produce an order are not affected by the amendment. There might be an argument over the will of Parliament et cetera, saying that parishes should not be covered. The other place would smartly send the matter back here. It is true that there are people who do not like the idea of answering a few personal questions as a result of seeking public office. The balance has to be made by them. It is their personal judgment. That is why the overwhelming majority of people have accepted the code. I have no figures about the number of parish councillors who have been removed for refusing to sign&#151;but it has to be a tiny percentage. It is the norm to sign up. To remove it for only one part of public life would send completely the wrong signals to the public. All of the other types of councils are covered, including the police authorities, the national park authorities and the Broads authorities. Why do we not have an amendment to exempt some of those bodies? Why just the parish councillors? We have had no explanation for that.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para12"></a>It is true that there have been a few noises, but people should not become the mouthpieces for a few noises. We are dealing with legislation. The proposal would send the wrong impression to the public that there was an ethical code of behaviour that people in public life were expected to operate, but with certain groups exempted. That cannot be justified. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, one cannot justify that across the garden fence or in the local shop one could say "it does not matter with our councillors. We do not have to know where they are coming from, what their interests are, irrespective of the decisions that they might be taking". I repeat that they are statutory consultees on planning applications. That is in some ways one of the most sensitive areas that people can deal with.
<P>

<a name="30910-18_para13"></a>I find it difficult to believe that the Conservative Opposition is serious in this matter, because it would send wholly the wrong signals to the public in exempting parish councils from the ethical codes of behaviour. I hope that it is not pushed to a vote, and if it is I hope that it will be voted down.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I made it clear in proposing the amendment that no-one should be absolved from declaring an interest&#151;that is what the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said in her contribution. People should always declare an interest if they have any kind of involvement in the subject that is being talked about&#151;whether it is here, a parish council, or wherever.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para0"></a>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he was not the Minister at the time. When the Labour Party was first elected I was the vice-chairman of the Local <P>


<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government Association. I spent much time with the then Minister, Hilary Armstrong, discussing this legislation. At that time no-one envisaged a virtual castle in London with the national standards board presiding over very minute complaints&#151;mostly about people calling each other four letter words. If there was an issue of real corruption then it should be considered by the board. The process was set up differently from that which was expected by local government. That is why parish councils and others did not mind coming in&#151;they thought that there would be some local mechanism. In fact the measure does enable in other parts of the Bill more local discussion of very small complaints&#151;which is what should have been done from the beginning. There were problems with the legislation from the start, which this Bill rectifies. I am content with that.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para1"></a>However, parish councils are different. I am now an elected county councillor. I have 10 parish councils in my patch. They are much like the "Vicar of Dibley". The matters that they discuss are mainly litter and the sports field. The borough council normally takes planning decisions contrary to the views of the parish council anyway. It is the borough council that takes the planning decisions. The legislation that affects the parish councils was a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It has put people off from standing for parish council. No-one should be absolved from declaring an interest in any subject in which they have some involvement. But for parish councillors to have to list every asset that they have, when they are never going to be discussed at a meeting is ridiculous. Therefore I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME="30910-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 15:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 114, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-19_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "GOODS, FACILITIES AND SERVICES
<br>
 In section 19 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c. 50) (discrimination in relation to goods, facilities and services), after subsection (3) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"(3A) In subsection (3)(h), the services of a local authority shall include those it provides to its elected and co-opted members.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-19_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment would insert a new clause pursuing a matter that was dealt with at a previous stage of the Bill. As one noble Lord said earlier, it would avoid embarrassment by seeking an assurance from the Government.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para6"></a>The amendment proposes to extend the Disability Discrimination Act to local authority members. My noble friend Lord Addington has tasked me to state why I have not extended the proposal to all elected representatives. I take his point that this is a local government Bill. However, I hope that in his response the Minister can give us some hope on this point.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para7"></a>The amendment implements the outstanding recommendation of the Disability Rights Task Force that local councils should be placed under a duty not to discriminate against disabled councillors, including a duty to make reasonable adjustment. The Government have said that they will address the matter as soon as legislative time allows. I hope that legislative time is galloping towards this.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para8"></a>I am surprised to learn from the Disability Rights Commission, which supports this proposal, that over 13 per cent of local councillors in England and Wales have a disability. It must be a given that we want to encourage the involvement in the public services of all who have a contribution to make and that, by failing to ensure that those with a disability can overcome that disability through facilities and services, society itself risks losing out by putting barriers in the way of tapping all available talents. It is also a given that discrimination is wrong.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para9"></a>I refer to such matters as communications support&#151; providing materials in accessible format. I am told of one town councillor who could not hear debates properly after renovations to his council chamber. The other two noble Lords who, like me, have experience of a new chamber, not at local government level, will know that it can present a considerable problem if it is designed so that the public can hear but members cannot hear one another.
<P>

<a name="30910-19_para10"></a>I hope that the Government will soon publish a draft disability Bill. I know that at a previous stage the Minister said that this issue would be a matter for the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and proposed to raise the matter with him. I hope that we can be assured today that the draft disability Bill will include provision to plug that loophole. If we receive that assurance, I shall be happy to accept it and shall not need to take the matter further on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I have not put my name to the amendment, but I want to make it clear <P>


<a name="column_366"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we support it. Had I been quick enough, I would have added my name, but I was not. I want to make it clear that it receives all-party agreement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I hope that my remarks will be welcomed. It is certainly my intention to be helpful on this amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para0"></a>We argued earlier, and we stick to the point, that we feel that the amendment is unnecessary. But we understand and appreciate the motive behind it. Like the noble Baroness, I have been in council chambers which have appalling audio systems. They are a positive barrier to debate and are very unhelpful, particularly to those with a hearing difficulty. It is right that local authorities address the needs of those members of the authority who have any form of disability. We recognise and support that point.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para1"></a>As the noble Baroness has said, the issue of discrimination against disabled councillors was raised in 2000 by the Disability Rights Task Force. In responding to its report, the Government undertook in 2001 to extend the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to local councillors.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para2"></a>We believe that it would be wrong to make piecemeal changes to the disability legislation. As the House is now aware, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions intends to publish a draft disability rights Bill later this year. We gave a commitment at Committee stage that my right honourable friend the Minister of State would write to those who raised concerns during the course of that debate. I am happy to say that, in response, the Secretary of State has confirmed his intention to legislate on this matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para3"></a>We believe that the disability rights Bill will be the correct legislative vehicle to consider extending the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act. The Disability Rights Commission agrees with us in that regard and has made it plain that it prefers that as the best means of addressing the issue. So we are at one with the spirit behind the amendment. We accept the points that have been made and we intend to deal with them in the forthcoming disability rights Bill. Obviously, we hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that response. Part of the way through the Minister's speech, I thought that I should have to ask whether he had intentionally put a full-stop between "we will legislate" and "there will be a Bill". But he said at the end, as I understand it&#151;I say this in terms so that he can contradict me if necessary&#151;that the draft disability rights Bill will be the vehicle to deal with the issue. Yes, the Minister is nodding his acknowledgement that that is the case. On that basis I am glad to enable us to move on. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 118, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-20_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "REGULATION OF COSMETIC PIERCING AND SKIN-COLOURING BUSINESSES
<br>
(1) Section 15 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 (c. 30) (regulation of tattooing, ear-piercing and electrolysis businesses) is amended as follows.
<br>
(2) In subsection (1) (requirement for person carrying on business to be registered), for paragraph (b) (ear-piercing) there is substituted&#151;
<br>
"(aa) of semi-permanent skin-colouring;
<br>
(b) of cosmetic piercing; or"
<br>
(and in the side-note for "ear-piercing" there is substituted "semi-permanent skin-colouring, cosmetic piercing").
<br>
(3) In subsection (2) (requirement to register premises where business carried on)&#151;
<br>
(a) for "ear-piercing" there is substituted "semi-permanent skin-colouring, cosmetic piercing", and 
<br>
(b) for "pierce their ears" there is substituted "carry out semi-permanent skin-colouring on them, pierce their bodies".
<br>
(4) In subsection (5) (local authority may not require particulars about individuals whose ears have been pierced etc.), for "or whose ears he has pierced" there is substituted ", whose bodies he has pierced or on whom he has carried out semi-permanent skin-colouring".
<br>
(5) After subsection (8) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"(9) In this section "semi-permanent skin-colouring" means the insertion of semi-permanent colouring into a person's skin."
<br>
(6) Schedule (Section (Regulation of cosmetic piercing and skin-colouring businesses): transition) (which makes provision about transition) has effect."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-20_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments are to meet a government commitment to give local authorities outside London specific powers to regulate cosmetic body piercing and micropigmentation businesses. London local authorities already have such powers under private legislation.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para9"></a>The new clause would amend the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 to bring cosmetic body piercing and micropigmentation businesses under the regulatory framework of registration and by-laws that already apply to ear piercing, tattooing, acupuncture and electrolysis.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para10"></a>Under that framework, local authorities would be able to require cosmetic body piercing and micropigmentation businesses to register with them and observe by-laws on hygiene and cleanliness for preventing the transmission of infection. For example, businesses would be required to use sterile instruments for each client. It would be an offence to trade without registration or breach by-laws.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para11"></a>The term "cosmetic piercing" is used to include cosmetic body piercing and ear piercing as these are both forms of skin piercing to allow the insertion of jewellery into the skin. This is the approach taken in the London legislation. "Semi-permanent skin colouring", which means the insertion of semi-permanent colouring into a person's skin, is used to include micropigmentation and related activities such as semi-permanent make-up and temporary tattooing. The use of this umbrella term should stand the test of time should further activities of this kind come into fashion.
<P>


<a name="column_368"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para12"></a>The schedule allows a smooth transition when the new legislation is adopted by local authorities. In brief, the transitional provisions provide that the amendment does not affect persons and premises already registered for activities under Section 15 of the 1982 Act&#151;for example, tattooing, ear piercing and electrolysis; the amendment does not affect pending local authority resolutions to apply Section 15 of the 1982 Act in their area; where a local authority has already resolved that Section 15 of the 1982 Act should be brought into force in their area for tattooing, ear piercing and electrolysis, the local authority will be automatically enabled to apply the registration and by-laws regime to cosmetic piercing and semi-permanent skin colouring; and a person and premises already registered for ear piercing shall be counted as registered for cosmetic piercing unless cosmetic body piercing is subsequently provided when a new registration would be required.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para13"></a>This is a serious issue and it is only the lateness of the hour that prevents me giving your Lordships some samples from my The Wildcat Collection catalogue of sophisticated body adornments, which has been on my bookshelf for a considerable number of years. I can show noble Lords that there is no part&#151;and I mean no part&#151;of the human anatomy that cannot have fitted to it a sophisticated body adornment. I do not have the guts to read out some of the details, but my noble friend on the Front Bench has been having a look. I have only one copy of this and I shall not put it in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para14"></a>I just want to make clear that we are talking about a very serious issue. I once did a TV programme, which is where I picked up this catalogue, and one consultant at one hospital&#151;Wolverhampton I believe&#151;gave examples of having to dig out of bodies some of these sophisticated body adornments&#151;which is the phrase I shall always use&#151;from the most unlikely places. He had been quite surprised himself but he knew that it did not all stop at nipple rounders or spiked nipple collars. There were polo locks and nostril studs and all kind of things. There is a warning on some of the items that they are not suitable for genital piercing&#151;although most of them are&#151;which applies to both males and females. It requires the utmost care. In this case one can take one's own CD and they will do the piercing for you in air-conditioned premises. The prices are obviously a little out of date&#151;I would not dream of reading out some of the prices&#151;and quite modest. As I say, the catalogue has been on my bookshelf for some years.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para15"></a>People choose to do this. One issue I raised on Report was that of young children whose mothers were having them pierced, probably for their own gratification in a way. There is nothing intrinsically wrong or unhealthy in that as long as it is done under proper conditions. There is no question about that; no one says that anything is wrong. The evidence is that the legislation can work in London and we think that the time has come for premises to be more regulated, hence the Government have tabled this amendment. I am only sorry that there is not time to say where all the <P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the very welcome reception of this amendment. It was originally moved in the House of Commons by my honourable friend Philip Hammond. After vague promises there we reintroduced the amendment here to see whether we could get those promises firmed up. I am delighted that the Government have seen the sense and, indeed, the necessity of ensuring that these various piercings are carried out under regulated circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para16"></a>On Report I cited the case of a young man who had diabetes. No medical history was taken because there was no necessity to do so. And because no one was performing particularly capably in the premises where the piercing was carried out, he died. He got septicaemia. That was a desperately unhappy outcome of his trying to make himself look better.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para17"></a>I am delighted that the regulations will be put in force. The Minister was kind enough to write to me about the perplexing question of consent. As the Minister said, not only can mothers have their children's ears pierced, but on the other hand it would be the mothers who would give consent if they were asked for it. So that is a difficult area. I understand that this issue is covered by common law&#151;for example, the assault of a person. So that if there was a complaint made it would, by definition, be something that could be dealt with, although it would probably have to be dealt with by civil prosecution. None the less, this is a huge step forward. I thank the Minister on behalf of my honourable friend, who has been sitting up there for a very long time. I think it is fair to say that he has given up at the one moment when he might have been given credit for the actions that he has taken. I thank the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30910-20_para18"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B>   moved Amendment No. 18:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 118, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-21_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF LOCAL AUTHORITY EMPLOYEES
<br>
(1) No employee whose employer is a local authority or local authority company shall be required to work on both a Saturday and the immediately following Sunday if that person has the care and control of a school-age child.
<br>
(2) On whichever day the employee is not required to work under subsection (1), he shall not be required to work at any time during that day.
<br>
(3) The Secretary of State may by regulation provide for&#151;
<br>
(a) exemptions or exceptions to cover emergencies; 
<br>
(b) rights of enforcement and redress for employees through courts or tribunals either already existing or to be established for this purpose;
<br>
(c) criminal sanctions.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_370"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 370</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), any adult with whom a school-age child customarily lives as part of his or her family has the care and control of that school-age child and where more than one adult qualifies under this test each of them has the care and control.
<br>
(5) In this section&#151;
<br>
"employee" and "employer"&#151;
<br>
(a) in relation to England and Wales, and Scotland, have the same meaning as in the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18), and
<br>
(b) in relation to Northern Ireland have the same meaning as in the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996;
<br>
"local authority" means a local authority in any part of the United Kingdom, including the Common Council of the City of London but excluding a parish or community council;
<br>
"local authority company" means a company through which is exercised a power conferred under section 95;
<br>
"school-age child" means a person who has attained the age of five but has not attained the age of eighteen." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-21_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have brought back Amendment No. 18 because a number of your Lordships have indicated that they feel it to be important; indeed, some have even suggested that it should be tested against the opinion of the House.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para2"></a>The amendment has now been revised by the addition of a subsection (3), which addresses some of the objections raised at earlier stages of the Bill, especially those relating to emergencies and emergency services. Those noble Lords who support the amendment believe two things: first, that local authorities should be setting a good example in respect to family friendly employment practices and that it is entirely appropriate that they should be asked to give a lead by Parliament in doing so; and, secondly, that children of school age should not be deprived of the time, love and care of their parents on both of the only two days of the week when they are not in school.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para3"></a>Research shows that children of school age, on average, will do better in school and in later life if they have the opportunity to spend time with their parents, doing things together, learning by example and having a normal happy family life. Surely, one day a week is not too much to ask for.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para4"></a>Children of school age who are left on their own all day when they are out of school are vulnerable. They are liable to join the gang at the end of the street or to get into trouble in one way or another. These things can, through boredom, be precursors to substance abuse and anti-social behaviour. Children need time with their parents. Yet there is clear evidence that family life is under increasing pressure today from the seven-day week. There is an increasing consensus among working fathers and mothers and their children that parental time at weekends, when the children are not in school, is an important issue which needs to be addressed quickly by the Government.
<P>


<a name="column_371"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para5"></a>That is emphasised by the comprehensive summary of research published last week by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. I give your Lordships one quotation from that research:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Despite the plethora of new legislation and policy on families and work, and the need for some of these new employment laws to 'bed down', there are two areas where Government needs to consider further interventions. Long hours of work and Sunday and weekend work by parents of school age children need further consideration".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-21_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30910-21_para7"></a>On Report the Minister said, sadly, that my amendment is inconsistent with the Government's general approach to better regulation. That is, we regulate only when there is an identified problem that cannot be solved in any other way. Well we now know, since last week, that this is an identified problem, a serious problem that has been identified by thorough research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in conjunction with London University. Will the Government either accept the solution I propose in this amendment or else come up with some other solution to the problem?
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para8"></a>I know the Government are under pressure from local authorities to reject this amendment and I understand that some local authorities are so short-staffed that they have enormous difficulty in servicing all the demands of their care services including, particularly, those involving young people. But surely the solution is to staff the social services properly rather than to damage the nation's children? Damaging the nation's children is what we are doing by depriving them of family life.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para9"></a>Of course this will cost money, but if the present situation is leading to damage to the nation's children, albeit that that damage may not show for many years, is it not economic good sense to make the necessary investment now? The harm done to children by parental deprivation does not show up immediately but that does not mean that it will not come back to haunt us in the future. The effective care and education of the nation's children is crucial to the future of our society. I urge the Government and the House to take this amendment seriously.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para10"></a>I want to make one more point. The Government have already made a commitment to monitor how existing legislation is working and to commence a review in three years' time. However the existing law relates only to parents of children under six years old, it does not specifically cover families with children of school age. I sincerely hope the Government are prepared to take action on weekend working for families with school-aged children long before 2006, but whether or not they do, will they at least undertake to widen the monitoring and the reviewing of these issues so that it includes all families with school-aged children? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, enthusiastically and to congratulate him on his persistence. He listened to the arguments throughout the Committee stage and he has modified his amendment, which allows for those occasions when emergency services or unavoidable events require somebody to work Saturday or Sunday.
<P>


<a name="column_372"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 372</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para11"></a>One argument that has been made to me is that almost nobody is required, I mean forced, to work on a Saturday or a Sunday. For those who believe that argument then the amendment is harmless. But if it is not the case and parents of young children are forced, required by the local authority, to work on Saturday and/or Sunday and are given no right whatever not to do so, then it seems to me that the amendment has force, and in that case it has my support.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para12"></a>There is much wringing of hands about young families, dysfunctional families, families that are not coping very well. Governments have set up endless committees, think tanks and task forces. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, is constantly telling us about what the Government are doing to make life easier for parents bringing up children and how children should be our prime consideration. That is what the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has said throughout, that the consideration should be for the health and well-being of young children. For some the weekend, Saturday and/or Sunday, is very precious time with their children and it does seem to me that the amendment is a permissive amendment asking for the right of parents of small children not to be required and/or forced to work on one of those two consecutive days, Saturday and/or Sunday.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para13"></a>There are many families where those are the only days they can work and, indeed, want to work. There are many people who live alone, and working at weekends is one way of getting out and meeting people. There are ways and means of covering it. For areas such as care homes, which I know are particularly sensitive areas, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are as critical as Saturday and Sunday. Every day of the week is a critical day, and we are saying simply that parents of young children should not be forced. If they are, then it means that they would be denied and discriminated against for employment if they could be required to work on one of those days. They could not take the job unless they were allowed the right not to accede to that request. They would be discriminated against in the workplace and that would be wrong. I support the amendment wholeheartedly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I rise to ask a question. I have followed this debate and I have been puzzled about it throughout. I understand why the amendment refers to a local authority, because we are discussing a local government Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has also referred to local authorities giving a lead, which is a quite separate matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-21_para14"></a>Am I to understand that what the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is really saying is that this ought to apply to all firms in the British economy? Is that what he really wants? I assume he must be arguing that because I cannot imagine that it would only be the children of local authority employees who would suffer if their parents were not there. So what he is really asking for is something much more fundamental; namely, that all firms in the British economy should have to have a law of this kind applied to them. That may well be right.

<a name="30910-21_para15"></a>Certainly I am as sympathetic to the care of children as anybody could possibly be. In the case of my own children&#151;well, I had an easy life as a professor&#151;I was always available. Students got neglected but my children always came first. But the fact is that if our economy is to have any hope in the world whatsoever, to start to move in this direction would be a devastatingly costly exercise. It is all very well to put it forward, and I am as sympathetic as one can be, but to do it within the context of a Bill of this sort, given the fundamental principles involved, seems to be entirely inappropriate, not because the aim is not what we would like to achieve but simply because we are talking about massive costs. I would be very interested in what the Institute of Directors and the CBI would say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord, Lord Peston, have any evidence of what those costs would be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I believe, and I know from speaking to noble Lords opposite&#151;the Tories&#151;that there was a time when they believed in the working of the free market, and essentially I take the view that when we live in a free market economy the free market outcome is prima facie the correct outcome. Every so often when I say that to them they all look at me with horror, but the fact is that that used to be at least the Conservative view. I do not commit the Cross-Benchers to anything.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para0"></a>My general view is that imposing burdens on the economy, bearing in mind that the overwhelming majority of people in this country work in the private sector, is something that we ought at least to be careful about.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para1"></a>As I said, I rise not because I do not accept the argument, I am extremely concerned about parents not being there for their children, but the consequences of this proposal are absolutely massive and I would wish to pause before we place this on the statute book in a local government Bill simply because we are discussing a local government Bill. I do not want to be negative in the sense that I do not agree with the sentiment. I do agree with it wholeheartedly, but I am genuinely concerned about the principle rather than the specific.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I rise to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Peston, on the skill and elegance with which he evaded the question asked of him by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, which was where was the evidence for the massive cost to which he said this would give rise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord, Lord Elton, actually saying that this would be costless? Is he saying that the business firms that do employ people over the weekend are idiots, that they do not know what is in their best interests, and they are somehow going out of their <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way to ill-treat their employees? The argument is ridiculous. All I am arguing is that the free market outcome is prima facie the correct outcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, that was not actually the point on which the noble Lord was addressed. The question was, what was the evidence for the massive nature of the costs to which this gives rise. I am being prompted, but I cannot hear the prompts, so I shall continue unsullied by help or hindrance.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para2"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in a crusade that he has pursued for decades. It started in the days of "Keep Sunday Special", when he attempted to keep free an area of the week when people could count on being free at the same time as the others in their family. That attempt failed. The noble Lord is now trying to secure a time when children at school can be free at the same time as one of their parents, if one of their parents wishes.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para3"></a>I follow the noble Lord, Lord Peston&#151;to his surprise&#151;in thinking that, in principle, the proposed measure is a good thing. I would like to see it as accepted practice among all employers. The Bill applies only to local authorities, but, on the grounds that it is good to pilot any such innovation, this is a good, concise, contained area in which to do so.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para4"></a>I regret that the issue has arisen so late this evening, because my noble friend opened his remarks by saying that he had been advised to test the feeling of the House. I suspect that, on this matter, there is more dirigisme on the other side of the House than there is on this, and that it will be directed at seeing that the amendment fails. I would not like it to do so without recording my warm support for any move that strengthens the bond between parents and children in a society that is becoming increasingly corrosive of that link.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may briefly, and without repetition, support the spirit of the amendment. For the very same reasons as were so well put by my noble friend Lady Blatch, which need no repetition, I hope that the opinion of the House shall not be sought tonight on the amendment. There are problems of costs to the local authorities. The essence of the problem arose when the House accepted Sunday trading&#151;this is a spin-off.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para5"></a>There is a wider dimension, to which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred, that requires consideration. If the noble Lord divides the House, I will go with him, but I hope that he does not. I will go with him as a humanitarian gesture which is worthy of support. But I think that it is premature, if I may say so.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para6"></a>I ask the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, to consider one matter to which I draw attention. Look at subsection (3)(c). Why on earth should the criminal law be introduced as a sanction for enforcement when the funds go to the wretched Treasury? What you want is a process of civil law compensation whereby, if the local authority breaches the code or regulations, the person involved says, "Look here, I have suffered damages worth x&#151;say £50, £100 or £150&#151;will you <P>


<a name="column_375"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pay me?" If they say "Yes", that is the end of it. If they say "No", he goes to the registrar of the local county court and says, "I want more". The registrar would listen to it all and say, "No, they have given you quite enough; you must pay all costs; so there is a sanction" or "They have not given you enough; I will give you more" and then pay all the costs. The injured person gets compensation by a civil process.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para7"></a>What on earth is the use of giving the Secretary of State powers to introduce criminal sanctions? I ask that that may be taken into account. I have given notice to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, by his series of secretaries in Cambridge or somewhere, that I was going to take this point, so I hope that it does not come as a surprise. If he divides, I will support him as a humanitarian gesture, but, with respect, I think that he would be unwise to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, as I said on Report, in principle I support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. That was the attitude taken in the House of Commons. I do not think that any noble Lord, particularly those who have children, would not say that weekends are extremely precious, and that they are a very precious time to be with one's children. But to start by saying that all local authorities will have to agree to any request not to have to work on both Saturday and Sunday, without us having some idea of the implication, seems too far-stretched to be included in legislation.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para8"></a>It is well worth exploring the implications of the proposal. My noble friend Lord Hanningfield, the leader of Essex County Council, who has canvassed the idea, believes that the measure would cost potentially millions. He said billions&#151;I have changed the "b" to "m"&#151;but he may well be correct, and I may be wrong as a former leader of a local authority. Under the circumstances, it would be unwise for the measure to be embarked upon in that way.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para9"></a>Somebody needs to take a grip on the matter and see whether the measure is possible. It ought to be possible within the terms of flexible working, which is already part and parcel of employment law. Good employers, under special circumstances, ought to be able to grant such freedom. But I do not know whether they can grant it perpetually to people who have taken on a job that says they will work at weekends. We need to consider that.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para10"></a>I told the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that I would agree in principle&#151;I did so during the previous debate. I hope that he will accept that as a sensible stance by someone who is basically very supportive of the measure but worried about the practicalities. Like my noble friend Lord Campbell, I hope that the noble Lord does not push the amendment to a vote today. But I hope that it does not get lost in a welter of ministerial bromides, and that it is taken seriously. If possible, in the not-too-distant future, someone&#151;not only the Rowntree Trust, which is a valuable organisation&#151;should investigate the implications of <P>


<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this proposal. We could then balance them with the cost to local authorities of children being on the streets. That work needs to be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-22_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches have difficulty with this amendment. My noble friend Lord Russell dealt with it at a previous stage and I will not follow him in referring to the Irishman's pig. At some point, I will ask him what that was all about. However, I follow him in his comments. Our preferred approach is not to look at the prescriptive allocation of particular days of the week. I would be far happier to see what is clearly an important issue addressed in the round.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para11"></a>This matter does not only concern weekdays and weekends. There are hours during the week when many parents operate in an almost child-free or childless zone. They hardly see their children during the week. The issue is much broader than just weekends.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para12"></a>Although local authorities should set a good example, I am unpersuaded that it would be appropriate to impose this arrangement on a sector that is actually a pretty good employer. Earlier in this debate, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, mentioned local authorities being against the proposal. Certainly, as others&#151;especially the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;have said, there should be a huge investigation into the implications.
<P>

<a name="30910-22_para13"></a>I cannot resist mentioning an article about the French school system that I saw in the Independent two or three days ago. Many French schools still require attendance on Saturday mornings, and many children prefer that, because the alternative is spending time with their parents going to the supermarket. I am sorry that we cannot support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister replies, I would like to say that I am very happy to support at least the principle of the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Northbourne. He has frequently spoken about the need for quality time for the whole family. He was too modest to mention his admirable speech on the Second Reading of the Anti-social Behaviour Bill, when he drew attention to the "Dad-deficit for boys". That is an important factor in keeping them&#151;or not&#151;on the straight and narrow path. Neither did he mention the importance for a significant minority of the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para0"></a>Good employers are already doing what my noble friend wants in many cases. That is particularly true of small employers and farmers, with whom I am more acquainted than with most other types of employer. As has already been said, it is most desirable that local authorities should give what lead they can. I suspect that some of them up might actually find themselves saving overtime payments. The policy would also give <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trade unions a lever with which to improve the situation of all employees. With those words, I hope that the Minister will give us a favourable response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, does not the essence of the problem lie with these wretched supermarkets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   Indeed, my Lords, shops and other sales outlets are the ones most likely to require their workers to work both Saturday and Sunday.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, before I get into the meat of the issue, it is worth reminding your Lordships that we are discussing the Local Government Bill. I echo the words of congratulation that have already been given to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for his tenacity in bringing forward this amendment. It has already been debated twice&#151;in Grand Committee and on Report. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is a tireless campaigner in this field and he should be congratulated on that. As a parent with three young children, I certainly approve of and endorse his campaigning. Listening to what he and other noble Lords have had to say on this subject, I have a great deal of personal sympathy for his position.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para1"></a>It has been a mature debate. As it has moved on, all the other important considerations have been introduced into it&#151;considerations such as whether it is right that it should apply only to one sector of employment and whether it is right that it should be imposed on the sector of employment that is best conducted&#151;local authorities. Local authorities are good employers and are flexible in their working practices. We all know from our rich years of experience&#151;in Kensington and Chelsea, Essex or wherever&#151;as local authority representatives that local authorities have been very good about introducing innovation in childcare and support for those who care for young children.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para2"></a>This has been an important debate, but issues such as cost, impact and the perversities of the proposition, which were well aired on Report, I think, or in Committee, when the noble Earl, Lord Russell, made a telling intervention, must be taken into account. I am one of those who would like, in principle, to be able to support the amendment but find that I cannot. We need to see how the current legislation works. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, it has not been in place long. As a government, we are well on the road to introducing and ensuring that there are flexible working arrangements and ensuring that nobody is discriminated against unfairly and that family-friendly practices are put in place. It is right to see how those things work in practice and progress, as we always should, on the basis of evidence. It is for that reason that I look forward to 2006, when there will, no doubt, be a thorough review of the way in which the legislation has worked. It is at that stage that some of the considerations to which the noble Lord has drawn attention in moving his amendments will be best addressed.
<P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para3"></a>I appreciate that that is some time off, but it is right that we have a monitoring strategy in place. We ought to work closely with the employers, whether they be in the local authority or the private sector, so that we can assess the impact of the legislation and how it has worked and see how best practice has operated and how flexible working practices have worked.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para4"></a>I do not think that I will tread on the toes of too many ministerial colleagues if I say that we would welcome the opportunity at that stage to see whether the matter is an important consideration. That, in itself, will enable the local authority sector to review the impact and consider whether it is an appropriate way forward and will provide the opportunity for employers generally to consider other issues, such as cost, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred. Cost is not an insignificant matter. My noble friend Lord Peston made the point forcefully that, although it is a highly desirable direction for public policy to follow, we must balance it with the cost of implementation and the perversities that occur occasionally through implementation.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para5"></a>I hope that the noble Lord does not feel that he needs to press the matter to a Division this evening. That would be unfortunate. However, as Ministers, we have the issue at the front of our mind. We undertake to consider it at a later stage, and we keep it under review at all times. I am grateful to the noble Lord for bringing us back to the matter with his trenchant persistence, on which he is to be congratulated, and for his tireless campaigning in the field. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, that is a fair point. I did not respond to it. It goes without saying that it would make good sense to do that. It would be in the spirit of the legislation that we have introduced in the past few years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. I shall follow the lead given by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and make a humanitarian gesture, by telling your Lordships that I do not intend to test the opinion of the House. The reason, simply, is that I do not think that I should win.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred to the immense cost. Everybody talks about the high cost, but I think it is just a question of good management, although the matter needs considerable research. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, introduced the interesting idea of having a civil remedy, rather than a criminal remedy. That needs exploring further.

<A NAME="30910-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brightman </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 75, line 40, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-23_para10"></a><P>

"(2) Subject to the general principle that the institution of marriage is to be supported, a local authority shall not encourage, or publish material intended to encourage, the adoption of any particular sexual lifestyle.
<br>
(3) This section does not prohibit the provision for young persons of sex education or counselling services on sexual behaviour and associated health risks."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-23_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, although it may not be very obvious at first glance, this amendment is, in substance, a drafting amendment, but it is an essential one. The only purpose of the amendment is to clarify what would otherwise be an ambiguous situation. Section 28&#151;to use the familiar description&#151;prohibited a local authority from promoting homosexuality. What was meant by promoting is irrelevant for present purposes. I believe that it has a dictionary meaning of encouraging, but that does not matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para12"></a>Clause 120 states that Section 28 "ceases to have effect". The question arises: what exactly is the result? Let me take a simple analogy. Suppose that there is a notice on a garden lawn: "It is prohibited to walk on the grass". Suppose that notice is removed. What is the result? What are walkers being told? They are being told that it is no longer forbidden to walk over the grass.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para13"></a>So with Section 28, which states that a local authority is prohibited from promoting homosexuality. Section 28 is repealed. What is the message? A local authority is no longer prohibited from promoting homosexuality. That is clearly not the intention of the Government. The Government try to meet the ambiguity point by saying that local authorities can undertake only those activities for which they have specific powers. Therefore, no more need be said.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para14"></a>But that response is flawed. It overlooks the fact that, as a matter of law, rights and powers&#151;I do not mind which word is used&#151;can be created not only expressly but also by implication. If a course of action is prohibited by statute and then the prohibition is removed, what was previously prohibited is, by implication, sanctioned. If Clause 120 stands on its own, without any explanation, the result is that what was previously prohibited&#151;the encouragement of homosexuality&#151;is, by implication, now sanctioned.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para15"></a>If the situation is not clarified and there is a law case, I can see the case wending its extensive way to the House of Lords&#151;all for the want of a few words of clarification, which Parliament can so easily provide. Perhaps I may take your Lordships to the wording of <P>


<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my amendment, for my suggestion of a way of resolving the ambiguity point. I have done it in a way which I hope will cause no offence to anyone. It does not alter one line of the Bill. It begins with the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the general principle that the institution of marriage is to be supported."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-23_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30910-23_para17"></a>Those words are lifted verbatim from Section 1 of the Family Law Act 1996. They can be removed by the Commons if the Government do not like them. The amendment continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A local authority shall not encourage, or publish material intended to encourage the adoption of any particular sexual lifestyle."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-23_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30910-23_para19"></a>The Government may say that the words "sexual lifestyle" lack definition. I do not mind. The Commons, with their highly experienced parliamentary draftsmen, can no doubt think of a better terminology. My wording, or their better wording, will preclude the implication that what was previously prohibited is now sanctioned.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para20"></a>My amendment concludes with the important words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This section does not prohibit the provision for young persons of sex education or counselling services on sexual behaviour and associated health risks."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-23_para21"></a><P>

<a name="30910-23_para22"></a>That is inserted merely to make sure that I am not interfering with sexual education.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para23"></a>I am not a politician. I have no experience of local government. I am only in your Lordships' House ex officio because I have spent my life in the law and ended up as a judge. I am convinced that it is my duty to advise your Lordships that an uncertainty exists. If the Bill is returned to the Commons with my amendment, they can resolve the ambiguity in whatever way they please. I must advise your Lordships that the ambiguity should be removed.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para24"></a>I may be asked why I am moving an important amendment so late in the day. The answer is that that is what the Companion tells me to do. Third Reading is the proper time to clarify any remaining uncertainties in the Bill. I do not know whether there will be a Division on my amendment, but if there is, a vote for the amendment is a vote for clarity. A vote against&#151;and I intend no offence&#151;would be a vote in favour of ambiguity.
<P>

<a name="30910-23_para25"></a>I conclude by reminding the House of the words of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in a debate on the drafting of statutes. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is essential for reasons of legal certainty and the rule of law, that legislation should be drafted as clearly as possible and in a manner which reflects the objects and purposes of Parliament in using its sovereign power to make the law of the land".&#151;[Official Report, 21/1/98; col. 1591]

<P>

<a name="30910-23_para28"></a>My problem is that, if the amendment had said, in ordinary language, that the local authority should say that the right way of living is with a family in marriage, I would have been content. That would have been in accordance not only with the Christian faith, of which most of us are members, but with the Islamic faith and the Jewish faith. The amendment, as I read it&#151;though I may be totally inept&#151;does not ordain that the encouragement for the children should be to understand the importance of marriage, whether they be Christians, Islamic, Jews or whatever. That is my problem. Therefore, I have a difficulty with the amendment, but perhaps my difficulty is ill conceived.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-24_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, on having shown the patience of Job in waiting for the right moment for the amendment to come out. He has been waiting for the resolution of the debate on Section 28 and has had the amendment on the Order Paper without moving it all through the progress of the Bill. He has sat through many hours when his amendment has not come out and, so far as I know, has not breathed one word of complaint. That is an example to us all.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para0"></a>However, I am not convinced that the noble and learned Lord is setting out to meet a genuine danger. If one considers the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the guidance drafted by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn in conjunction with a great many other people, one can see that a great deal has already been done to plug the gap that the noble and learned Lord believes is there. However, I shall leave the detail of that to the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para1"></a>The second part of the amendment says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a local authority shall not encourage, or publish material intended to encourage, the adoption of any particular sexual lifestyle".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30910-24_para3"></a>I would not have chosen the word "lifestyle", but the sentiment is exactly right. It is not the business of schools to do that. How we should live is a matter that is to be resolved by individuals and by collective conscience in groups. It is not the business of schools to teach that one way of living is right and another is not. If that had been the whole of the amendment, even though I believe it to be unnecessary, I would have been perfectly content to see it on the statute book.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para4"></a>However, my problem is with the first words of the amendment, that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the institution of marriage is to be supported".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30910-24_para6"></a>Your Lordships know my own personal views on marriage. One thing that I have against it is that "till death do us part" is not long enough. But I do not feel entitled to take legislation to enforce my particular preference and conscience on other people. A great many people, among whom I would include my two sisters-in-law, for whom I have great affection, have a genuine conscientious objection to the state of marriage. However, they live together in a union&#151;or, <P>


<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in one case I regret to say used to live together in a union when she was alive&#151;as true, as loving and as faithful as any that I can think of. Qualitatively I can see no difference between those types of union.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para7"></a>It is very dangerous to start using the law as a kind of hortatory device to support marriage. In fact it sounds very often as though in medieval theology marriage had been not a sacrament but a penance. The more people think of it as a sacrament the more I would have thought that they would have had reservations about using the law and financial incentives to support it. To use financial incentives to spread a sacramental grace is simonious and that, metaphorically, expresses some of the objections that I feel about the idea of using the law to encourage marriage. It is a matter for the individual conscience and it ought to be undertaken with a whole heart, complete will and genuine intention or not at all.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para8"></a>The amendment could possibly have the inadvertent effect of discouraging things which need to be done in cases where marriages have not worked; for example, the provision of women's refuges for people who have had to leave marriages which very patently are not working. I am certain that never for a moment was that the noble and learned Lord's intention, but without an exhaustive trawl through statutes, for which I have not the resources, I cannot be sure that that would not be its effect. If it is, I hope that it will not happen.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para9"></a>I said at earlier stages of the Bill that people feel committed to each other in unions by different things, not necessarily by the ceremony of marriage, even if they have gone through it. One or two noble Lords may possibly remember that I mentioned a couple with whom we had dinner 15 years ago and who were both coming out of a failed first marriage and hesitating before commitment to a second. They discussed with each other at some length what would make them feel that they had made a commitment to each other. They decided that it would be when they took one subscription instead of two to their favourite learned journal.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para10"></a>It so happens that by sheer chance I met that couple again at a party last Sunday evening. I asked them what they had done about it. They said that they had taken out a single subscription to that journal and that the editor had been furious. Here, what stands in the way of family values is not liberalism but commerce. That is a point which we could all afford to take. They had got married but they said that it was not the marriage which gave them their sense of commitment and the sense that they were a union; it was that they had only the one copy of the journal so if they ever parted one of them would be without the back numbers and without one of the basic resources of living.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para11"></a>I do not know how many other ways there are in which people may feel that they are committed to each other, but they are truly legion. If one looks at people who have gone through the ceremony of marriage one may see two complete strangers. By contrast, as recently as last weekend I was having dinner with a couple who were obviously, in any inward and <P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spiritual sense, as completely a married couple as I have ever seen. They had a private language; they understood each other instantly; they would react to something I said as one person. Both of them are still in the process of freeing themselves from marriages to other people, but in any inward and spiritual sense, those people are as married as any couple who have been through a ceremony I have ever met.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para12"></a>So I believe that simply enforcing, encouraging or even using the power of the state to give primacy to a ceremony is a mistake. It is taking the letter and not the spirit. There are many instances that the letter killeth and the spirit gives it life which, not being a Christian, I quote in a metaphorical sense. But in a metaphorical sense I believe that it is a truth and that is why we on these Benches have difficulty with this amendment. For a party with liberalism in its philosophy, it is a matter for the individual conscience.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I rise to ask a question. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, said that his purpose was to produce clarity where there would otherwise be confusion. In my case he has produced confusion where, until he spoke, I thought the matter was clear. As I understood it, some years ago a reactionary House of Lords passed an amendment, Clause 28, which was viciously anti-homosexual and prohibited what it called the promotion of homosexuality. The law was changed.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para13"></a>As I understood it, a few weeks ago the House removed that provision and returned the law to where it was. That is the whole story as far as I am concerned. There is no confusion whatever. Will the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, tell us whether, if he passes his amendment, we will return to banning the promotion of homosexuality? I read his amendment as reintroducing Clause 28 in a different form of words.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the point about lack of clarity in the Bill will not be overlooked. Probably not lawyers, but ordinary people tend to think that if one removes a prohibition one gives a permission. Since Clause 28 was so notoriously anti-homosexual&#151;I entirely agree with that point, it was a disgraceful clause&#151;removing it, of which I am greatly in favour, suggests an ambiguity about the entitlement of teachers.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para14"></a>I was persuaded by my noble and learned friend in his exposition of that ambiguity, but I find a certain contradiction in proposed subsection (2) between,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the general principle",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para15"></a>and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall not encourage, or publish material intended to encourage, the adoption of any particular lifestyle".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para16"></a>Marriage is a particular sexual lifestyle. If it is to be supported then that is to encourage a particular sexual lifestyle.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para17"></a>I would be happy with the amendment removing any possible ambiguity if it started after the comma, so that it read,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a local authority shall not encourage, or publish material",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para18"></a><P>


<a name="column_384"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and so on. That would rule out any preference that a teacher might have, whether for marriage, homosexuality or any other sex style we would like to imagine. I am a believer in marriage, but I do not make any distinction among my five children between the two who live with partners unmarried and the three who are married. They are all my children and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, although I never know quite how to refer to them.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para19"></a>The first proposed subsection is the trouble. Nevertheless, there is an ambiguity in the Bill as it stands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, is right in one of his assumptions: if in law there has been a prohibition measure&#151;like him I scanned the dictionary, and it subsumes encouragement of homosexuality&#151;and it is removed and there is no substitute, that means that it is a legal activity. The promotion of homosexuality becomes permissible and legal. To that extent the noble and learned Lord is right.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para20"></a>I believe that I was wilfully misunderstood when I tried to put something in place of accepting the abolition of Clause 28 to give the power to parents to make judgments about the materials used and the content of sex education outside the national curriculum and the degree to which they believed it was appropriate for their children. That was denied me. As I say, I believe that it was wilful misinterpretation. I have read and reread the debate, which was all about my subverting Clause 28 and reinserting it by the backdoor and all the rest of it. I thought that it was straightforward support for parents and a straightforward provision to protect children from the worst form of sex education and the worst form of materials used for sex education.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para21"></a>I have one difficulty which has already been mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock. I very strongly support the first line of subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the general principle that the institution of marriage is to be supported".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-24_para22"></a>However, there is a difficulty with the second part of the subsection, which equates marriage with all other lifestyles. Consequently, the two parts of the provision almost contradict one another.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para23"></a>I unashamedly want to distinguish marriage from other forms of sexual lifestyle. Not only do I think that marriage should be supported; the Government and the Prime Minister believe it should be supported. The Foreign Secretary is on record as making very strong statements of support for marriage and as advocating marriage as the best arrangement, not only for bringing up children but for ensuring the cohesion of society. I support it very strongly and I should like to see the distinction. If no such provision goes to the other place, the other place will have no opportunity to consider the basic dilemma. A prohibition has been removed but nothing has been put in its place.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para24"></a>So I want to put on record my view that there is a difficulty and ambiguity in subsection (2) of the amendment. However, if the noble and learned Lord, <P>


<a name="column_385"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Brightman, wishes to seek the opinion of the House, I should like to think that there will be support for it. He will have my support because I think that the provision will keep the debate alive in another place and that it will allow further thought to be given to what should be put in place of the abolished Clause 28. That is why I shall support the noble and learned Lord.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_time0"></a><H5>8.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I have put my name to the amendment. I do not wish to delay the House. I am sorry that this debate has, in my view, degenerated into another ongoing discussion about homosexuality, because I do not think that that is what this amendment is about. For me&#151;one may think rather naively&#151;the problem is much simpler. I believe that this amendment is about a tolerant and inclusive society. We know from the enormous lobby that many of us received that there are many in this country who are very deeply worried about the abolition of Section 28. I do not happen to be one of them. However, those people, whether they were right or wrong, were terrified that their children and grandchildren were going to be put in a situation where there was some sort of promotion of homosexuality or other kind of sexual lifestyle indoctrination.
<P>

<a name="30910-24_para25"></a>We know that that is not the case. However, I believe that every government have the responsibility to act not only for those who vote for them but also, once they are elected, for all citizens. I think that the Government should show more concern for that enormous chunk of the population who are deeply worried about this situation. That was one of the reasons why I wanted to support the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. I also support the point that he made about the uncertainty which was created by negativing a positive statement without in any way making clear what we mean.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly in support of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and in search of illumination. I would be grateful if he would tell me if I am not right in thinking that the first line makes the rest of subsection (2),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the general principle".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-25_para0"></a>In other words, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway can be reassured that the principle is already established, as the noble and learned Lord told us, in the Learning and Skills Act. So the noble Earl, Lord Russell, can be reassured that this is no new introduction in law of proselytization for marriage; it is a repetition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of that. I think I made the point in 1996.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I regret that I was not perhaps awake at the moment that the point was made, or perhaps my memory is not as good as the noble Earl's. As it is not a new point, there is no point in objecting to it as though it were. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has achieved what he <P>


<a name="column_386"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>set out to do&#151;to remove an ambiguity. If that were not removed there would be an inequality of treatment between different potential lifestyles. I am glad that there is a prohibition, subject to the provision in the first line of paragraph (2), for the promotion of particular lifestyles, because nobody has talked about the lifestyle of young people who count sexual conquests as Red Indians used to count scalps.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para1"></a>This is a heterosexual as well as a homosexual matter. There are all sorts of lifestyles which are bad, not merely medically&#151;as covered by paragraph (3)&#151;but spiritually, and I would not wish to see them promoted. Therefore, to prevent all such promotion, subject to the general principle that the institution of marriage is to be supported, is an admirable clarification of the intention of the law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this has been a useful debate and many noble Lords have contributed. I hope that my notes will cover all of the issues raised. This amendment comes a little late in the day. That is not a criticism, but just in the sense that we are at Third Reading. The arguments on this amendment seem to have changed since Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para2"></a>Amendment No. 19 concerns the repeal of Section 28 as we know it. It seeks to place a broad duty on local authorities to prevent them from, with the exception of supporting the principle of marriage, promoting any particular sexuality across any of their functions. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, said quite clearly in Committee that his only purpose in tabling the amendment was to avoid a difference of opinion between this House and the other place, which would delay the Bill and mean further argument about Section 28. I am very glad to say that that is not the situation in which we find ourselves.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para3"></a>I remind noble Lords that we saw at Report that the view of this House is quite clear on the repeal of Section 28. The amendment to repeal was defeated by 180 votes to 130. In view of such a majority, it seems odd that we are again debating the noble and learned Lord's amendment given that it was originally put forward as a compromise. However, I shall turn now to the substance.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para4"></a>Over the summer we have considered the amendment carefully, but as we explained in Committee, we do not believe that it offers advantages beyond the straightforward repeal of Section 28, which is currently enshrined in the Bill in Clause 120. Indeed we believe that the amendment has some disadvantages.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para5"></a>As we made clear in Committee, the new clause is unnecessary as far as sex education is concerned. The main responsibilities fall to schools and we have in place an adequate framework of protections. Indeed, the approach in the new clause with regard to sex education closely reflects that of the existing sex relationship education guidance which says, in paragraph 1.21, that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"pupils should be taught about the nature and importance of marriage for family life and bringing up children, but that there are strong and mutually supportive relationships outside marriage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-25_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_387"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para7"></a>Paragraph 1.30 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"teachers should be able to deal honestly and sensitively with sexual orientation, answer appropriate questions and offer support and that there should be no direct promotion of sexual orientation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-25_para8"></a>There are, however, wider considerations. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, pointed out one of the problems with the proposal in his contribution in Committee when he questioned what he described as the "monopolistic provision" for marriage in the proposed new clause. I appreciate that the promoters consider that the new clause simply repeats provisions in the Family Law Act passed under the previous administration, to which reference has been made. I also recall that in Committee the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, said that his intention was to avoid causing offence to anyone. I believe him entirely. However, it is clear to us that this new clause would in fact be offensive to many people&#151;not just homosexual couples but unmarried heterosexual couples as well.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para9"></a>It is also worth pointing out&#151;this reinforces the points that have been made&#151;that the Family Law Act had as its primary purpose dealing with the fallout from breakdown and disputes in marriage and domestic relationships. The general principle regarding the institution of marriage is arguably relevant in dealing with divorce and separation and legal aid for mediation&#151;the matters with which the 1996 Act deals. It does not follow that it is a "freestanding" provision that should underpin all of a local authority's functions, which is what the intent of the amendment appears to be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. My understanding is that the Family Law Act has never been implemented. Is that right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer that question; I shall take advice on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I believe the position is that Part 3 of the Act has not been implemented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I was just about to say that several Acts have parts that are never implemented. I shall certainly check whether that is the case with the Act we are discussing. However, that does not alter the point that I am making and does not obviate the paragraph that I have just read out which I shall repeat. As I said, it is worth noting that the Family Law Act had as its primary purpose dealing with the fallout from breakdown and disputes in marriage and domestic relationships. The general principle regarding the institution of marriage is arguably relevant in dealing with divorce and separation and legal aid for mediation&#151;the matters with which the 1996 Act deals. But it does not follow that it is a "freestanding" provision that should underpin all of a local authority's functions, which is what the intent of the amendment appears to be.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para10"></a>I also appreciate the efforts that the promoters have taken in order to ensure that the measure would not obstruct local authorities in their responsibilities for <P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sex education and sexual health. However, the very fact that they have done so in the second limb of the amendment indicates the main problem associated with their approach. It is a recipe for confusion and uncertainty for local government about what would fall inside or outside the prohibition. That is very important. There is a seductive argument that would lead us along the path of saying that if we accept that authorities should not be promoting a particular lifestyle choice&#151;and we do&#151;we should not object to the law saying so. As I say, it is a seductive argument but I believe that it is one we should resist.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para11"></a>We have given local authorities the powers to be community leaders&#151;a role that we have asked them to develop for the benefit of all the people living in and using their areas and services. Local authorities know that they should act responsibly. They should, indeed, not be promoting any specific lifestyle choice. But equally they should be able to provide services that meet the needs of all members of their communities, including those who may already feel quite marginalised. We should be wary of inadvertently making that task more difficult. We believe that despite its good intentions the amendment has the capacity to cause unnecessary confusion about exactly those kind of issues. For those reasons I hope that the noble and learned Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30910-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, one lesson that I have learnt this evening is the danger of leaving a drafting amendment to Third Reading. Then, there is no possibility of meeting by means of a few words objections to the actual terminology involved. Leaving a drafting amendment to Third Reading means that you have burnt all your boats except the one that you are in, which is sinking. So, in future, I shall always introduce my drafting amendments on Report, whatever your Lordships may say about it.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para12"></a>I did think of doing that during the debate on Report, but the clock said 11 o'clock and there had just been a Division which had taken up a great deal of time. I felt that it would be unfair to burden your Lordships with a debate on drafting at that stage. I intimated, as your Lordships can read in Hansard, that I intended to introduce this proposal at Third Reading. I have learnt my lesson.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para13"></a>I said again and again in introducing the amendment that I was not wedded to any particular wording. I made it absolutely clear, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, pointed out, that my only purpose was to get the amendment to another place so that Members there could put their skilled draftsmen on to it and achieve a terminology that would suit both Houses.
<P>

<a name="30910-25_para14"></a>If the amendment were rejected, as I said earlier, that would be a vote in favour of ambiguity. If I divide the House, a vote in favour of the amendment will at least be a vote in favour of certainty, because the whole of this can be put right in the Commons.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 79, line 6, after "58," insert "65A(2),"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-26_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30910-26_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, with this amendment we will briefly debate Amendment No. 27, which inserts the words on the Order Paper into Schedule 6, page 114, line 10.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para9"></a>During the conclusion of the Report stage in the summer I indicated that the statement being made that day by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on education funding would include a proposal relevant to this Bill, involving a minor amendment to education legislation. I wrote subsequently to the noble Baronesses, Lady Hanham, Lady Hamwee and Lady Maddock, and to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, explaining the Government's intention in more detail, and my letter was placed in the Library of the House. The amendment as now presented for consideration by your Lordships' House has since been extended, as I shall explain. Representatives of local education authorities and head teachers have also been consulted about the amendment over the summer.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para10"></a>The amendment is concerned with Sections 45A and 45B of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by the Education Act 2002. Under those provisions, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the National Assembly for Wales have a reserve power to set a minimum schools budget for a local authority where the authority's proposed schools budget is considered inadequate in all the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para11"></a>First, as advised in my letter, the amendments bring forward by one month to 31st December the schools budget deadline by which local education authorities in England are required to notify the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and their schools of their proposed schools budget for the following financial <P>


<a name="column_391"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>year. We intend to announce the provisional local government finance settlement in the middle of November. That will make it possible for local authorities to decide by the end of December what schools budget they will propose. The effect will be to give schools much greater certainty about their funding earlier in the year, so that they can plan more effectively for the following year.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para12"></a>Secondly, these amendments change the deadline by which the Secretary of State for Education and Skills or the National Assembly for Wales must give notice of their intention to use the reserve power, to 14 days from the schools budget deadline instead of 14 days from the date of each individual authority's notification of its proposed schools budget. That will ensure a common timetable for the consideration of all authorities' proposed schools budgets.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para13"></a>In short, it is a technical adjustment to the calendar for making the very important decisions on the large expenditure&#151;by both central and local government&#151;of the schools budget for this country. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his comments. Unfortunately, I missed the first part of his speech. We have reservations about the timetable. All governments&#151;there is no difference between Conservative and Labour governments&#151;often give promises about the timetabling of announcements of the grant to local authorities. There have been many years when, for example, Parliament has closed for a week before the Queen's Speech in the middle of November&#151;that is very likely to happen&#151; so announcements for local government finance are made 10 days later than originally planned. I gather from officers of the Local Government Association that already there are discussions about the statistics used in making the grant announcements.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para14"></a>Given such factors, it could be early December before the announcement is made&#151;for reasons that the Government might say they cannot control. It will then be impossible to deliver school budgets by the end of December. We all want to support schools as much as possible. But a 1 per cent increase in expenditure in local authorities means a 4 per cent rise in council tax. Most authorities are determined to do all they can to avoid increasing council tax. That might mean not being able to pass money to schools, because it depends on how the grant settlement works out. In Essex last year, council tax had to be increased by 5 per cent virtually to reach the target for schools alone. We are not prepared to do that again, so the schools budget will depend very much on the settlement.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para15"></a>There is also a technical problem as regards local authorities: their budget meetings do not take place until early February. Although they might indicate what they will give schools, they must decide the rest of the budget, and it will not become council policy until early February. Although there will be government indications of what they expect to give schools, it will not be a cast iron guarantee unless the Government expect all councils to change the dates of their total budget processes before Christmas.
<P>


<a name="column_392"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para16"></a>We would like those issues clarified. What happens if the Government cannot give the grant settlement at the time that has been mentioned? What happens if the grant settlement means huge increases in council tax, which councils will not agree easily? What happens to legal procedures in councils when the final budget decisions are not taken by a full council until early February? I see that the Minister has been joined by a Minister from the education department and I would be grateful for some clarity about how the system will operate, especially if the Government cannot keep to the deadlines that they have announced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is lucky that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is not behind him waving the Companion.
<P>

<a name="30910-26_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, raised important points about the practicality of the policy, which I shall not repeat. We have always opposed this reserve power for the Secretary of State to intervene in the education budget. However, in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, I acknowledge the additional time that local authorities will have to prepare their budgets. Perhaps the key issue is the one that has not been addressed&#151;whether the Government will follow through on their assurance to give local authorities more guaranteed, longer-term funding and fewer year-to-year changes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I will read this. It says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For use if pressed only. Question: How can this amendment work if there is a delay to the provisional local government financial settlement? Local authorities will not have time to decide their proposed schools budgets",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-27_para0"></a>which is exactly the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.
<P>

<a name="30910-27_para1"></a>I will now read the three paragraphs that follow:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government is firmly committed to bringing the date of the provisional local government finance settlement earlier. We will be doing everything possible to ensure that the provisional settlement for 2004-5 is made as early as possible this year. We plan to announce the provisional settlement by the middle of November.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-27_para2"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>In addition, well in advance of the provisional settlement, we will also be providing local authorities with key information on the minimum increase in funding per pupil to be provided and the floor increase in resources for local authorities which will underpin that guarantee.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-27_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>By bringing these announcements forward, we will be providing authorities with adequate time to set their proposed schools budgets by 31st December".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-27_para4"></a>I cannot make it any clearer than that. That is as firm a commitment as I can possibly give and I think that it answers the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, as I said, what happens if the opening of Parliament happens at that crucial time? The figures are crucial. They must be available in mid-November; otherwise it will not be possible to set budgets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, as I have discovered in the past six years, Parliaments may recess, but <P>


<a name="column_393"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>governments never do. However, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, raised a fundamental issue&#151;I am now thinking on my feet. He made a point about the proximity of the announcements and the Queen's Speech, the date of which I do not have a clue about. It is right that these announcements are made to Parliament; otherwise, there is a row, because large amounts of public expenditure are involved. I would hope that in a commonsense world, with the type of change that we are proposing&#151;bringing information to school heads and local authorities earlier&#151;we could make whatever announcements were necessary to the relevant people at the right time to enable them to do their job of budget planning.
<P>

<a name="30910-27_para5"></a>I am not saying that we would usurp Parliament, because that would be ridiculous, but I quite understand the problem of proximity. I would hope that it would not stand in the way of wrecking what would be a new system. Obviously, getting the information by the middle of November is crucial for local authorities making their budgets by the 31st December deadline. I fully accept that December is not a full working month because of Christmas and the New Year. However, these are practical problems for which the Government are duty bound to find solutions, rather than saying, "We couldn't do it".
<P>

<a name="30910-27_para6"></a>If the information is available, we have to make sure that it is published. We must do that for the sake of the 24,000 or so schools in this country, so that their heads have more certainty and clarity and so that the budget planners in the local authority can organise their budgets. I fully accept that.
<P>

<a name="30910-27_para7"></a>I have taken the problems on board. I will make sure that I put to my colleagues in the ODPM responsible for this side of local government&#151;as opposed to the education department&#151;how fundamental it is that we keep to the points that I made in the three paragraphs earlier, which were headed,

"(5A) Regulations may not be made under this section unless a draft has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.
<br>
(5B) But, in the case of regulations other than the first set of regulations under this section, subsection (5A) does not apply if it appears to the Secretary of State that by reason of urgency they should be made without being approved in draft.
<br>
(5C) Where by virtue of subsection (5B) regulations are made without being approved in draft, the regulations&#151;
<br>
(a) must be laid before Parliament, and
<br>
(b) cease to have effect at the end of the period mentioned in subsection (5D) unless they are approved during that period by resolution of each House of Parliament.
<br>
(5D) The period referred to in subsection (5C)(b) is the period of 40 days&#151;
<br>
(a) beginning with the day on which the regulations are made, and 
<br>
(b) ignoring any period during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.

(5E) The fact that regulations cease to have effect by virtue of subsection (5C)&#151;
<br>
(a) does not affect the lawfulness of anything done before the regulations cease to have effect, and
<br>
(b) does not prevent the making of new regulations."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-28_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is the Government's sole amendment to the Bill. It is the response to the reports by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. I am grateful to the Select Committee and, in particular, to its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, for the committee's work on the Bill. The Committee will see, in the Select Committee's 21st and 23rd reports, that we have had several courteous and reasonable exchanges about the appropriate level of parliamentary control of regulations made under Clause 2 on freedom of movement for workers.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para13"></a>The amendment is a compromise between the Government's position and the Select Committee's original recommendation. The amendment takes up directly a suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, in his letter to me dated 9th July. Because of that, I hope that the Government's amendment will be generally acceptable to the Committee. For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with the issues, I shall briefly explain the Government's position on the compromise suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, and accepted by me in the form of the amendment.
<P>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 397</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para14"></a>It is the Government's intention, in line with our declared policy, to bring regulations under Clause 2 into force on 1st May next year. The regulations will grant the right to freedom of movement for work to nationals of all eight states affected by the treaty's transitional provisions. The regulations will take the form of an amendment to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para15"></a>The Government took the view that the negative procedure was the appropriate level of parliamentary control for two reasons. First, the EEA regulations were adopted under the negative procedure, and, secondly, Parliament will have the opportunity during the passage of this Bill to debate the issues of principle underpinning the regulations. Nevertheless, the Government are willing to accept the Select Committee's judgment that the freedom of movement of workers will continue to be an issue of political interest. In turn, that justifies a greater degree of parliamentary control over the regulations than the Government originally envisaged. However, as I made clear in my published response to the Select Committee's recommendation, the Government are concerned that the procedure chosen should not impair our ability to react appropriately, if it becomes necessary&#151;contrary, of course, to expectations&#151;to apply safeguards. If we encounter disturbances in the labour market or find that the regulations are being abused, the Government may need to act swiftly. The affirmative procedure is not compatible with that swift action.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para16"></a>Public and parliamentary interest is likely to be most acute when the regulations are first made, since these will fully liberalise access to our labour markets for citizens of the eight states concerned. Subsequently, regulations are likely to be of a technical nature. Even if those subsequent regulations were used to apply some form of safeguard, that safeguard could only be temporary. I am sure that your Lordships will recall that the accession treaty limits the application of safeguards to a maximum period of seven years after the date of accession.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para17"></a>At its most extreme form, the safeguard would simply return us, for a temporary period, to the immigration regime operating today for workers of the eight states concerned. However, a safeguard might well take a more limited form than that. It is for that reason I suggested, in my response to the Select Committee, that the first regulations might be subject to affirmative procedure with subsequent regulations subject to the negative procedure. The most important incidental effect of this would be to allow the Government to apply those safeguards swiftly should the need arise.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para18"></a>Although the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, was not attracted to this compromise proposal, his letter to me conceded that some account could be taken of situations where that swift action might be necessary. The mechanism that he suggested&#151;the so-called delayed affirmative procedure&#151;is acceptable to the Government. It is embodied in my amendment, which proposes that regulations under Clause 2 would be <P>


<a name="column_398"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses. However, where, by reason of urgency, the Government need to act swiftly, my amendment would allow the Secretary of State to bring regulations into force prior to the resolutions of both Houses. The Secretary of State would then need to secure resolutions within 40 days. Without them the regulations would lapse at that point.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para19"></a>In drafting the amendment, we have followed closely the recent precedents in the European Parliament(Representation) Act 2003, Sections 13 and 18. Subsection 5(B) of my amendment makes clear that the urgency procedure cannot be used for the first set of regulations. In proposing the amendment, I have sought to meet fully the concerns of the Select Committee while retaining in situations of urgency the ability of the Government to apply safeguards swiftly. That is a good compromise. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, for suggesting it. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   We are agreeable to this amendment with just one or two caveats which I should like to explain. The Minister has helpfully set out the background, which is that they want to allow nationals from accession states to come here and work freely. They expect that there will be no considerable impact from that decision. However, the Government are prudent. Just in case they are wrong&#151;I refer to the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's letter&#151;and the proposed regulations give rise to market difficulties, they want powers to make new regulations. The excellent Select Committee on delegated legislation examined the issue closely and said that at first flush these powers should be by affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para20"></a>The Minister has explained that flexibility is needed "to act swiftly". Hence, this compromise, with the first regulations being subject to affirmative procedures and subsequent regulations being subject to the negative procedure. However, I notice that the chairman of the Select Committee, in his last letter to the Minister, suggested a late approval formula. I am unsure as to whether that coincides exactly with what the Government are now proposing, but it sounds near to it.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para21"></a>That is how we have reached this position and why the amendment has been proposed. I just need to ask about the word "swiftly". Will the Minister describe the circumstances of "urgency" and "swiftly"&#151;she has used those words several times&#151;in which suddenly it becomes necessary for the Secretary of State to say that there are market difficulties, and so forth? It is quite a difficult situation to envisage and I just wonder how it would shape up. We hope that the Government's relaxed attitude is the right one even though other countries are not following it. An influx of skilled workers is enormously welcome and greatly helps the growth and dynamism of this country.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para22"></a>The general view seems to be that numbers will not be large. However, some elaborate research by reputable think tanks is coming to different views. <P>


<a name="column_399"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lombard Research says that the UK could become the target destination for a wave of East European workers and that there would be surging immigration, which it welcomes. So do I, if they are skilled people. They are less welcome if they turn out to be the Mafia. The Government are taking a bold view and one that we support. However, I hope they turn out to be right and that they are also right to have these prudent back-up arrangements. They are right to monitor closely the situation as it unfolds.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para23"></a>In agreeing to this amendment I would like reassurance that the monitoring will be real and constructive and that Parliament will have an opportunity to see how things unfold. My wish would be that regular reports from this monitoring should extend not only to job movements and job flows but also to trade flows and investment. I say that not to hinder or protect our own arrangements against the new accession states. I say it to encourage and reinforce their position so that we do not forget their interests and do not allow them to be too battered down by the European Commission's rather threatening intention to monitor them to see that they have complied with the 80,000 page acquis.
<P>

<a name="30910-28_para24"></a>We should be their friends and their supporters. I have always wanted this country to be much more of a champion of the smaller states than it has been so far. We do need to be kept informed. There needs to be real monitoring to justify the powers given and taken under this Bill. In order to keep the Government up to the mark and to fulfil these aims we may need to put down an amendment at Report. In the mean time, we are content with this compromise. We believe it is a sensible one and should go forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   From these Benches we have already welcomed the Government's imaginative decision to ensure that the nationals of the states which accede next year will have freedom of movement into the UK. This is something of a gamble but we believe it is an intelligent one which will benefit this country. Quite clearly though, as the Minister has indicated and the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford has suggested, things could go wrong. Therefore we understand why the Government put forward a safeguard.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para0"></a>I am not sure how the monitoring to which the noble Lord referred would be undertaken given the flow of people across the boundaries of the European Union after accession. I am not sure what sort of statistical information the Government will get as to flows from the new member states. It may be that the Minister can tell us something about that today or will write to us to give us some indication to enable us to think about this before we return at Report.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para1"></a>I wish to commend the Minister and our own Delegated Powers Committee on the way in which the interaction between the committee and the Government in the last few months has led to this amendment. It is to the credit of the House, to its committee and to the Government that we have been able to find a solution which has ensured a safeguard but which has also <P>


<a name="column_400"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensured that a proper measure of parliamentary control shall remain. That is why I have great pleasure in supporting this important amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   I thank both noble Lords for their welcome of the government amendment. The fact is that we want nationals to be able to move freely; we do not believe that there will be a considerable impact, but if something unexpected were to happen, we have to have the ability to act quickly.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked whether I had met the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf. The answer is yes. When the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, said that he wanted affirmative procedures, the Government felt that it was appropriate to have those procedures initially but that we might find it more appropriate to have negative procedures should we need to reimpose any restrictions. The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, believed that that would represent a loss of parliamentary control, and it was he who suggested the so-called delayed affirmative procedure. The Government accepted the suggestion made by the noble Lord, as the chair of the committee.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para3"></a>I take the liberty of telling your Lordships that I have spoken to the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, on the matter. Although he was unable to speak on behalf of his whole committee, on an individual basis he believed that the Government had met the points that he raised. Of course, he has not been able to consult his committee on the matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, wanted to know in what circumstances the problems we are discussing might occur, and raised a point about monitoring. Research suggests that it is very unlikely that there will be a large-scale influx following enlargement. The establishment of new formal mechanisms to monitor the labour market is probably disproportionate; instead, it is proposed to make use of existing sources of data and information, and to use largely informal mechanisms to consult stakeholders inside and outside government.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para5"></a>I understand that the Department for Work and Pensions will continuously monitor a range of existing statistics of labour market performance&#151;of GDP, numbers claiming benefits and other such relevant material&#151;which would indicate a possible disturbance to the UK labour market that might be sufficient to justify considering reintroducing restrictions. I hope that that answers the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell. If there were a real disturbance in our labour market, we would monitor it through those mechanisms and we would hope to track it in that way. If necessary, we would then be able to use the suggestion of the delayed affirmative procedure.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para6"></a>I do not have any specific examples for the noble Lord. I hope that he will forgive me, but specific examples might be taken to represent a definitive list, whereas I hope that the indications that I have given are sufficiently broad and flexible to meet the exigencies that might arise. I hope that the House <P>

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-29_para14"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ORDERS MADE UNDER THE ACT
<br>
(1) The powers of the Secretary of State to make orders under this Act concerning conditions of service or directions to fire authorities shall be exercised only after a declaration published by him that an emergency exists or is likely to exist.
<br>
(2) In this section, "emergency" means a natural disaster or other event or series of events affecting the fire service or its operation which is or may be, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, likely to disrupt supplies of energy, or which presents any other serious threat to human welfare, the environment, the political, administrative or economic stability or the security of any place or locality, or in which the use of troops is permitted.
<br>
(3) In his declaration the Secretary of State shall state the nature of the emergency."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-29_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I regret having to deal with this rather important issue at five minutes past 10 tonight. I believe it is a very important amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para16"></a>My noble friends and I would like this new clause included in the Bill at the very beginning. The Minister is well aware of the fact that I and a number of other noble Lords do not much like this Bill. The Minister knows perfectly well why we do not like it. That was made very clear on Second Reading. As it stands, the Bill gives the Secretary of State power to impose terms and conditions of employment on members of the fire service workforce. These powers are required, apparently, despite the fact that the recent dispute has been settled by an agreement acceptable to both sides.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para17"></a>On Second Reading the Minister referred to Article 6 of the European Social Chapter, which requires states to take steps to ensure the effectiveness of the right to bargain collectively. He also referred to Article 8 of the ILO Convention 151 which states that settlement shall be sought through negotiation between the parties. He argued then, and has since <P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>argued throughout the passage of the Bill, that although its terms do indeed give powers to the Secretary of State to impose terms and conditions&#151;something which my noble friends and I regard as a breach of the Government's commitment under the European Social Chapter and ILO conventions&#151;the Government would use these powers only in extreme emergency if, as he put it, it was necessary to do so in order to maintain or enhance public safety.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para18"></a>Moreover, the Bill has a sunset clause: it is time-limited. At the end of the time it will be consigned, as he put it, "to the rubbish bin".
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para19"></a>I say at the outset that while I may not like this Bill I have no doubt at all about the right of the Government to get their legislation through Parliament. In the light of what the Minister said in Committee, we acknowledge that in certain circumstances it could well be necessary for the Government to have powers of the kind envisaged in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para20"></a>Despite our concern to try to maintain workers' rights&#151;particularly the hard fought-for and won right to have terms and conditions decided by collective bargaining by the union to which most belong&#151;we are not endeavouring to wreck the Bill. We believe the Minister when he says that the Government hope never to have to utilise the powers in the Bill; that it is entirely a temporary measure and simply will not be there when the sunset is reached.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para21"></a>The problem is that that is nowhere stated in the Bill except for the sunset clause. We want to ensure that the Government have the emergency cover that they need while at the same time ensuring that there is adequate protection for the rights of the workforce. It seemed to us that the best way of doing that would be to spell out the circumstances in which the powers in the Bill would be used. So our amendment says that the powers will only be exercised after a declaration is published by the Secretary of State that an emergency exists or is likely to exist. In his declaration he would state the nature of the emergency. Subsection (2) of our amendment spells out as clearly as we can, utilising wording which I believe exists in other legislation, precisely what is meant by an emergency such as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a natural disaster or other event or series of events affecting the fire service or its operation which is or may be, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, likely to disrupt supplies of energy or which represents any other serious threat to human welfare",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-29_para22"></a>and so forth.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para23"></a>That seems to me to give the Secretary of State the emergency cover that he needs and is in line with what the Minister said in Committee was required. As I have said, we do accept what the Minister has said about the limited nature of the Bill and the extreme reluctance of the Government to utilise the exceptional powers that it gives the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30910-29_para24"></a>Good intentions may be fine, but nothing like that appears in the text of the Bill. This is legislation and governments and Ministers change. A future Minister, perhaps not of this Government, may feel quite differently and he would then have at his disposal powers which he possibly would be only too happy to use. An external event plus media clamour and the <P>


<a name="column_403"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sunset clause could disappear. These seem very unlikely events, but we are concerned to safeguard employee rights while at the same time meeting the valid points that the Minister made in Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the House for not being here earlier. I had forgotten where my speaking notes were; fortunately I happened to find them. In opposing the amendment, the sincerity and motivation of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, who is perhaps the only Member of your Lordships' House with extensive practical experience of the bargaining procedures and who has sat judicially under the chairmanship of the High Court judge on the Central Arbitration Committee, is not called into question; nor indeed is that of any noble Lord disposed to support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para0"></a>At the outset, may I seek to establish common ground? The Government must have their business&#151;yes&#151;but only after due scrutiny by both Houses. There was no due scrutiny of the Bill in another place, as was spoken to with total accuracy by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, on Second Reading. None of the amendments on the Marshalled List was considered in Grand Committee, at which the usual attendance&#151;apart from the odd Minister&#151;was six for three days, which is not a very satisfactory method of due scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para1"></a>There will be insufficient time today, through no one's fault, for due examination of the amendments. Clause 1 as drafted fails to express, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, sportingly and fairly recognised in Grand Committee, the true intention of government as he explained it to the House regarding the exercise of powers of the Secretary of State. It is therefore common ground that Clause 1 cannot stand unamended. If not amended, must it be left out under Amendment No. 27, which, if moved&#151;which I hope will not be necessary&#151;could well attract the support of noble Lords in favour of Amendment No. 1?
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para2"></a>The question arises&#151;to which I shall not speak at this stage&#151;whether Clause 1 should be amended to apply only to emergency situations as proposed by Amendment No. 1, or whether two regimes should be set up: one for an immediate emergency and another where there is no such emergency, as proposed by Amendments Nos. 2 to 7, and Amendment No. 13, to which I do not speak. But the conflict between those disparate approaches inevitably involves my opposition to Amendment No. 1.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para3"></a>Putting that aside for a moment, let us deal with the substantive objections to Amendment No. 1. As such they are serious, and, with respect, they warrant your Lordships' attention. The amendment limits the powers of the Secretary of State to make orders and give directions only in an emergency situation. It heralds the introduction of a novel, intricate, complex structure of amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 10 to 18, 14 to 18, 20, 22 to 25&#151;which would inhibit the due exercise of requisite, plenipotentiary powers of a Secretary of State having instant effect in the event or likely event of a terrorist attack, and that is not <P>


<a name="column_404"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>acceptable. It also heralds Amendments Nos. 28 and 29, which inhibit enforceability of orders and directions given by the Secretary of State in a state of emergency, which is wholly inept. Of course they must have immediate effect. It precludes the Secretary of State from giving directions on the essential reorganisation and restructuring of the fire brigade services which must ensue when there is no state of emergency, to prepare against the state of emergency of terrorist attack or the likelihood of such attack, when one day it shall inevitably arise.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para4"></a>The requirement as to a declaration of an emergency such as a terrorist attack or the likelihood of such attack to be made by the Secretary of State, based on advice and intelligence which may not be disclosed, would not be in the public interest. In such a situation, which could occur at any time and any place, the Secretary of State must retain plenipotentiary, emergency power and must be trusted. Speaking for myself, I trust him or his successor, whoever that may be, of whatever party, to exercise such powers in good faith and with propriety.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para5"></a>Amendment No. 1 and the implementation proposed in the amendments under the name of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, afford no effective means and no attempt at any effective means to seek to avoid disruption of the fire brigade services by collective action in any emergency situation as defined by subsection (3).
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para6"></a>I said that I would make a shortish speech. I end with one question which I believe is a fair one. On any objective analysis, could any government accept Amendment No. 1 as it stands or as proposed to be implemented?

<P>
<A NAME="30910-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, we clearly failed dismally in Committee to make clear to the Government how unusual and unique we find this Bill. This Bill is presented almost as though it were an extension or a return to the 1947 legislation passed by the 1945 Labour government. It is not that in any way. It introduces into industrial relations a set of particular and special provisions which are at this moment to apply to a section of the fire service. That is again something unique. As far as I know, all previous general restrictions of this character, for example in the First World War and the Second World War, applied across the board. However, the Government are selecting the fire service&#151;members of the National Union of Fireworkers&#151;for these special provisions. It is that argument, as much as anything else, which we have been trying to press upon the Government. We have dismally failed.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para7"></a>The amendment is one of a series which asks the Government to look more closely at what they are doing, and to see if they cannot postpone the measure, giving a general consideration to their purpose, which is what we tried to do at Second Reading. Will the Government look at particular aspects of the Bill and limit its application in various ways? The Minister, when talking about the Bill at various stages, made a <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>number of replies in answer to our attempts to make him describe the circumstances in which the powers under the Bill would be invoked. It might be that he would rule out certain circumstances, if not rule them out on the face of the Bill, but that was not the case; or he might say that the Government were thinking more of using the Bill in certain areas.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para8"></a>The Minister made a number of statements. We are asking him to think again about those statements. Most of those responses suggested that there would be some kind of emergency in existence before the Government would use the Bill. We have taken from his statements to that effect&#151;if one looks at subsection (2)&#151;a range of circumstances which cover virtually every kind of emergency. If we have left some out, then let the Minister tell us, and we shall put them in. We say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In this section, 'emergency' means a natural disaster or other event or series of events affecting the fire service or its operation which is or may be, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, likely to disrupt supplies of energy, or which presents any other serious threat to human welfare, the environment, the political, administrative or economic stability or the security of any place or locality, or in which the use of troops is permitted.".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30910-30_para10"></a>So we try in this amendment to spell out what would be the broad circumstances in which one could reasonably argue, in the light of what he had said, that there was an emergency situation. I asked the Minister to look at that, and he said that he was thinking that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a crisis situation will have required the Bill to be used".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para11"></a>Unfortunately, at that stage I thought that he might continue and define what that crisis would be, but he clearly reflected on the awful matters that he had in his mind and thought that he should not tell us. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If I started thinking aloud and giving examples of what might happen, I could be accused of giving horror stories".&#151;[Official Report, 3/7/03; col. GC 266.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para12"></a>That is extreme, is it not?

<P>
<A NAME="30910-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord, when he refers to the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, referring to col. 50 of the Grand Committee, where, from memory&#151;I have it noted somewhere&#151;the Minister said, "Look, it isn't the intention to use this Bill, other than in a state of emergency. We don't want to have to use it".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, I am talking about col. 262 of the Grand Committee Hansard. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, stated that the Bill was about taking,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prompt action in order to protect the public".&#151;[Official Report, 3/7/03; col. GC 262.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para13"></a>He also stated at col. 265:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am not saying that there is a legal use of the word 'emergencies', but the Bill is a temporary measure. It is time-limited and would be used only"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para14"></a>in a crisis situation.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para15"></a>I do not suppose for a moment that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, would deny that most of the circumstances in which he considered the Bill might be used fit our definition of an emergency. The trouble is <P>


<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that that is not the only thing he said. In responding to the question of whether the use of the Bill was to be confined to an emergency, he said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is a long stop designed for a quite specific purpose of dealing with the recent dispute . . .  if the timetable that has been negotiated is not maintained".&#151;[Official Report, 3/7/03; col. GC 261.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-30_para16"></a>In other words, such a situation could occur next week or the week after if the Government decided that the union was not co-operating sufficiently with the timetable of negotiations for the next stage of the 2003 agreement, or if the Audit Commission decided that insufficient savings were being made. That seems to me to be a quite different set of circumstances. There might not be a dispute. There certainly might not be industrial action. I say all this in the hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, will reassure me. The Bill could be invoked because the Government considered that insufficient savings had been gained in the next stage of the productivity deal. That is a quite different set of circumstances from a crisis.
<P>

<a name="30910-30_para17"></a>The amendment is an attempt to get the Minister to tell us something more about the extent to which, in any meaningful sense of the term, the Government intend to invoke the Bill solely in an emergency. If that is the case, why cannot they accept our amendment?

<A NAME="30910-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I should like to say four things about the nature of this amendment, which has been very carefully thought about and, in fact, argued about, among the movers of it. First of all, on our express wishes, it stands alone in the groupings because it has nothing to do with most of the other amendments to Clause 1. It is nothing to do with ballots. It is nothing to do with abolishing the right to strike and so on. It stands alone and it refers to a series of defined emergencies, disasters or crises&#151;whatever one likes to think of them as&#151;which have been built on a certain amount of study of previous statute. It refers to disasters which in the opinion of the Secretary of State are likely to occur, which we thought included terrorism but also a whole series of other things. We ask in the third part of the amendment for a declaration which need state only the nature of the emergency in general terms. I am happy to give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, how can it stand alone if it makes no provision for resolution of a terrorist attack? How can it stand alone without the means of resolution?
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I am much obliged to the noble Lord. He will understand the point when he reads Hansard and will see that the amendment stands alone. It covers threats of terrorism, but a great many other things too:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any . . .  serious threat to human welfare, the environment, the political, administrative or economic stability or the security of any place"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para0"></a>in the jurisdiction, or a situation in which the use of troops is permitted.
<P>


<a name="column_407"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para1"></a>The reason why the amendment contains those various elements is as follows. The Water Act 1989 gives emergency powers where there is a threat of disruption of energy. The civil contingencies Bill which the Government are gradually putting into the processes of Parliament&#151;and which I hope will be enacted fairly soon&#151;includes the serious threats referred to in the amendment, very carefully set out; and the position in which the use of troops is permitted is covered by the Emergency Powers Act 1964, and indeed by powers under the prerogative. Those, we thought, were proper precedents to which we could implicitly refer in building up some description of emergency. Some of us thought&#151;I am not sure that we all agreed on this&#151;that the restructuring of the fire service was for the big Bill that is to follow the White Paper, although it will be in the Government's mind. The White Paper having been published, it cannot be absent from the Government's mind and policy.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para2"></a>Having reached a broadly common position on those matters, we then looked with enormous care at what had been said in Grand Committee&#151;about which the populace at large is, unhappily, largely ignorant&#151;and at what happened in the other place, which to us is in a way the most important.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para3"></a>When the Bill was presented for Second Reading in another place on 8th May, my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister said that he was reluctant to produce it. I want to refer to government statements in another place and in this House, because the amendment is a genuine attempt to understand the Government's position in the light of what they have said about their wishes&#151;not from snippets; if I quote any matter which is thought not to be in context I shall be happy to read out the context. The Deputy Prime Minister said, quite naturally at the time, that although he would have preferred not to introduce the Bill,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"after 12 months of negotiations and three separate pay offers, the fire dispute has reached deadlock. Legislation is therefore necessary in the public interest and to protect public safety".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 8/5/03; col. 856.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para4"></a>On 1st May, he wrote to the Joint Committee on Human Rights:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would even now prefer the matter to be settled by agreement and without my intervention. However this appears unlikely . . .  I am seeking the powers in the Bill because settlement cannot be achieved through negotiation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para5"></a>That was the first position.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para6"></a>The second position, when the Bill came to this place, was that a settlement had been reached. Government spokesmen&#151;if I may put it in this phrase&#151;accentuated the fact, which in our view is a normal fact of life in collective industrial agreements, that a large number of matters still had to be worked out under the settlement. It would be a remarkable settlement that did not have to have matters worked out under it. The settlement referred to the procedure for doing that in the national joint council Grey Book.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para7"></a>I want as fairly as I can to quote what has been said by my noble friend the Minister in this connection. I shall not repeat at length the quotations cited by my noble friend Lord McCarthy. My noble friend Lord Rooker <P>


<a name="column_408"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has been the government spokesman on this Bill on all important matters, and therefore I can only quote him. At Second Reading on 19th June, he said that the Government preferred a negotiated settlement. He went on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is so that they can move forward in partnership to help deliver a modern fire service, which can prevent fires from starting in the first place and save more lives when responding to fires that occur".&#151;[Official Report, 19/6/03; col. 1015.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30910-31_para9"></a>We entirely accept that statement of policy. My noble friend went on to say that the settlement was dependent on further negotiations on some key issues. He later said that one primary object was to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ensure that the public is properly protected. That is why we intend to proceed with the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para10"></a>Then he put the issue slightly more widely, as my noble friend Lord McCarthy said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I can assure the House that the Government would exercise the powers that the Bill would confer in respect of conditions of services only if we considered it necessary to do so in order to maintain or enhance public safety; and if negotiations failed to produce an agreement".&#151;[Official Report, 19/6/03; col. 1015-6.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30910-31_para12"></a>When the issue came to Committee my noble friend Lord Rooker made the two propositions that my noble friend has referred to. I want to quote him exactly. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am not saying that there is a legal use of the word 'emergencies' but the Bill is a temporary measure. It is time-limited and would be used only in circumstances that would almost amount to an emergency".&#151;[Official Report, 3/7/03; col. GC 265.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para13"></a>Then at col. 266 he referred, as my noble friend said, to the Bill being used and orders being made in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a crisis situation which will have required the Bill to be used".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para14"></a>Then he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have to repeat the fact that it would be quite exceptional circumstances in which we had to operate the Bill. We make no bones about it. I have used the words that the Secretary of State would have to impose a solution to a dispute because he would consider that to be in the public interest".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para15"></a>He said that if the parties agreed to arbitration,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would want to intervene at that point to exercise his powers to fix or modify conditions of service if there was a realistic prospect that the parties could, by seeking arbitration, resolve their differences".&#151;[Official Report, 3/7/03; col. GC 282-3.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para16"></a>Then in col. 204 on 14th July, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The point I am making is that the Bill would be activated only if a disaster arose of another dispute occurring with no sign of being settled in which case the Secretary of State&#151;he has made this absolutely clear and we make no apology for it so there is no surprise in that regard&#151;would impose a settlement as a way of drawing a line under the dispute".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para17"></a>I pause to point out that the likelihood of a disaster arising is quite clearly covered by our amendment. We took account of that passage when we drew it up.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para18"></a>In col. 205 the Minister said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would take several months to process the current agreement so that it becomes fully operable. Therefore, we need this as a backstop. I am not saying that there are any blank cheques here. It is not an agreement just because two parties agree that we pay the Bill; that is a conspiracy against the public. To that extent, we would not actually foot the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para19"></a><P>


<a name="column_409"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That passage came after&#151;and this is what I think the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, was perhaps implicitly referring to; I apologise if I am wrong, but I thought it was&#151;an intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But if the parties do not agree with what we"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para20"></a>meaning the Government&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"want them to do, we shall impose the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para21"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That is entirely the case. The noble Lord expressed the matter perfectly".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para22"></a>He said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"parties could have a sweetheart agreement",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para23"></a>and that if they did and that it offended government financial arrangements they would say,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sorry, we are not paying the bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para24"></a>But in that same context he said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if they reached an agreement which was absolutely contrary to the financial settlement for the department and went against what had been agreed previously, we would say, 'Hang on a minute'. As I say, the Bill is intended for use in an emergency situation".&#151;[Official Report, 14/7/03; GC 204.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-31_para25"></a>He also added they would allow the Secretary of State to ensure fire authority assets paid for by the public are available to those providing emergency fire cover in the event of further strikes.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para26"></a>I appreciate the point that the Minister of course had a view about the serious matter of the parties reaching an agreement of which the Government did not approve. We come to that in a later amendment. In that sense, there is a link with that later amendment but no other. Most of those passages rely on the intimation that the Government would wish to use their orders under the Bill in a crisis or emergency or&#151;to use the exact words&#151;"almost an emergency" situation. If we have got it wrong in subsection (2) of our amendment and the description of likely emergencies or forthcoming emergencies is inadequate, I will be happy to accept any manuscript amendment now from the Government, or indeed to have them put down their own form of words on Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="30910-31_para27"></a>I think that the amendment is a fair representation of, at least, the core of the Government's position. We do not think&#151;we will come to this on later amendments&#151;that that being absent from the Bill is satisfactory. Nor do we think, especially in the light of a decision, to which I shall refer, in your Lordships' Judicial Committee on 10th July, that statements of Ministers as to the Government's intention, however genuine, proper, honest and straightforward, are the same as legislation. The House of Lords judicially has recently had great moment, in a constitutionally vital case, to refer to that difference. I do not go further with it now; it will come later. I support this amendment and I hope it will be taken seriously as an attempt to bridge a gap which otherwise makes the Bill a very dangerous precedent as far as industrial peace is concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbrook: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway in his opposition to <P>


<a name="column_410"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 410</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this amendment. It seems to be restricting the powers of the Secretary of State in the Bill to an emergency situation. This is unnecessary in this particular case and therefore I support my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, without seeking to wind anybody up, this is the second time today, on the second Bill today, that words I have used in Hansard are not taken at face value and there has therefore been an attempt to put them on the face of the Bill. The previous attempt was by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, on business improvement districts. It is exactly the same point: "Minister's words are not worth tuppence ha'penny; we are all not serious; and what is more, we come and go, other people take our places, and therefore our words are worthless".
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para0"></a>I want to be able to address the points in the amendment, which I do not think is necessary at all. We have looked hard at this over the summer&#151;or what has passed for a summer. We cannot see any justification for amending Clause 1 in this way. I recognise that the amendment responds to some of the discussions in Grand Committee. Inevitably it would, because of the quotes that have been used. Obviously the amendment introduces a trigger that would mean the powers in the Bill under Clauses 1(1)(a) and 1(1)(b) could be used only after the Secretary of State had declared that an emergency existed or was likely to exist. The definition of emergency runs wide, as we have heard explained: natural disasters, threats to human welfare, administrative or economic stability, and circumstances in which the use of troops is permitted. I can see that there is a common thread and I acknowledge that the definition would cover many, some might even claim all, of the circumstances we have faced over the past year.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para1"></a>However that points up the problem with that kind of provision. It is difficult to be really sure that it covers all eventualities and therefore it inevitably leads to uncertainty and the opportunity, I might add, for unreasonable arguments and challenge at the time it is used. That is what is at the root of this amendment: it provides an opportunity for unreasonable arguments and challenge to stop the operation of the Bill. The Government have been quite clear: we want to be able to take practical action if the dispute flares up again. Good progress has been made in the negotiations, so far as I am aware. I checked today: there are amicable discussions going on. That is good; that is what we expected from professionals on both sides. However, we believe that it is in the public interest for us to be able to take action if it does flare up again. There are strong arguments against allowing any dispute to drag on without conclusion&#151;arguments that run from the possible effect on public safety to the demands placed on those in the Armed Forces who have been deployed to provide alternative emergency cover. We believe that it is not necessary to put those issues in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para2"></a>There are strong arguments for allowing the Government to determine the terms on which a dispute of the kind that we saw earlier this year should be settled. That is not to say that the Government know best, but that it is they who must pick up the bill. <P>


<a name="column_411"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We have responsibility for public safety and public finances. That is why we think the Government are in the best position to determine the kind of situation in which a dispute could be settled.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para3"></a>Only in a very serious situation, taking all those factors into account, will we use the powers. As my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister said, we do not want to use the powers in the Bill, but we feel that we need to have them just in case. We have said all along that we hope we will not have to use them. We have no secret plans to use them; nor have we plans to bring about circumstances causing us to use them. We have no agenda whatever, but we think it would be irresponsible not to have the powers, in the light of the circumstances of the past 12 months
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para4"></a>Defining in advance every possible circumstance that might constitute a sufficiently serious situation&#151;what the amendment calls an emergency&#151;is a step too far. We do not want to get anywhere near an emergency before taking action. If there were an emergency, people would ask us why we had not taken action sooner. I cannot therefore accept the amendment and I invite my noble friends to withdraw it.

<A NAME="30910-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether my noble friend has sat down, but perhaps I may ask him a question. He said that the words of the amendment would allow for a successful challenge in the courts. If, in the terms of the amendment, the Secretary of State made a declaration, which may be no more than one or two lines, about the likely disaster, emergency or crisis that he foresaw&#151;that is all he has to do&#151;what would be the nature of the likely successful challenge in the courts? I am sure that my noble friend has had advice on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, first, I do not know, and, secondly, I had already sat down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-32_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lords who contributed to this short debate on what I regard as one of the most important items of the Bill's Report stage.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para5"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, I would have thought that the wording that we have produced, particularly in subsection (2), entirely meets his problem about the possibility of a terrorist attack. The amendment was deliberately worded to do precisely that.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para6"></a>I am very disappointed by the Minister's response. He says that the amendment indicates that we do not take the Minister seriously, but we tabled the amendment in the first place because we have taken him seriously. I moved similar amendments&#151;perhaps not so precise&#151;in Committee. When the Minister told the Committee that it was necessary to have these emergency powers, I said quite precisely that I understood that it was necessary to have emergency powers but that was nowhere stated in the Bill. I said that for that reason my noble friends and I would <P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider the matter and try to table an amendment to meet the valid argument that there must be powers to deal with an emergency.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para7"></a>Throughout the Committee, the Minister referred repeatedly to the possibility of a crisis or emergency. It was in order to meet those points that we drafted this amendment and decided to proceed on that basis. I am very sorry to learn that, although our intentions were clearly to meet the Government's position, they have not been acknowledged by the Minister. However, I fear that there is no point in pressing the issue further at this stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 3, at end insert "if requisite in the public interest of immediate implementation in a state of emergency"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-32_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30910-32_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will also speak to Amendments Nos. 3 to 7 and Amendment No. 13 as a package. I acknowledge with gratitude the support of my noble friend Lord Northesk on this occasion from these Back Benches.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para11"></a>The object of this package of amendments is to set up two regimes, as already explained. The first regime, in a state of immediate emergency, affords plenipotentiary powers to the Secretary of State to impose conditions of service and to give directions to fire authorities. It also removes inhibitions as to the exercise of such powers under subsections (3) and (8) of Clause 1 of the Bill. In other words, it makes a more extensive exercise of power in an emergency than exists at present. In that context, Amendment No. 9 would appear to delay the exercise of such powers in an emergency and could well appear to warrant clarification.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para12"></a>In the other regime, when there is no such state of emergency, conditions of service may be imposed only by virtue of Amendment No. 6 in implementation of the regime proposed by Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, and the powers to make orders under Clause 1(5) are removed. The giving of directions to the fire authorities is made subject to consultation as provided by proposed new paragraph (b) in Amendment No. 4. Of course, that is when there is no state of emergency. When there is a state of emergency, there is plenipotentiary power.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para13"></a>Why the need for these amendments? The main objection to Clause 1 is that, when there is no state of emergency, the Secretary of State may impose or threaten to impose conditions of service by decree without having had any resort to collective bargaining. According to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#151;not when I was a member of it&#151;House of Lords Paper 118, a significant risk of violation of Article 6 of the European Social Charter and Article 8 of the ILO Convention No. 151 is involved, of which the Deputy Prime Minister was informed by letter on 8th April this year. That is the main objection.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para14"></a>The subsidiary objection is a matter more within the remit of my noble friend Lady Hanham than myself. It arises from the giving of directions to the fire authorities, if there is no state of emergency. My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said at Second Reading that, since the 1970s,

<a name="30910-32_para16"></a>There is a muddle. It is no fault of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that there is a muddle, but the fact is that it relates to the means of implementation under this Bill and the Local Government Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, frankly conceded on the second day in Grand Committee that he could understand that,

<P>

<a name="30910-32_para18"></a>It is late at night, but if noble Lords take the Bill in one hand, they will see that Amendment No. 2 would limit the emergency situation by inserting the phrase,

<a name="30910-32_para19"></a>Amendment No. 3 would remove the inhibiting provisions of subsections (3) and (8) of Clause 1, which should not apply in a state of emergency but should apply if there is no state of emergency. Amendment No. 4 makes it plain that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-32_para32"></a>Indeed, the origins of subsection (1D) in Amendment No. 7 really stem from an intervention made by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, who has some experience in these matters, which I do not have.

<a name="30910-32_para33"></a>Subsection (1E) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any award of the tribunal shall be binding on the parties and on government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-32_para34"></a>That is the essential essence of the proposals as a package, which are made in support of the proposal to set up two distinct regimes. In other words, the proposal is to strengthen the powers of government&#151;totally plenipotentiary powers&#151;in an emergency without qualification, but, with the sole exception of Amendment No. 6, if there is not an emergency, to put it simply, to retain the excellent bargaining structure. That is the simple idea. I am afraid that it was not quite so easy to draft simply.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para35"></a>I shall conclude. One must accept that Clause 1, as drafted, does not truly represent the Government's intention and may not stand unamended. Intentions of government as to implementation must be set out in the Bill. Of course, we all accept what the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, says in good faith. There is no question of that. I am not getting at that. We have here a duty of due scrutiny. We must take a Bill as we find it. I do not think that we need to bother very much about what any other Secretary of State would do. To be perfectly frank, I think that whatever they did they would do it very well, honestly and fairly. We have got a job to do. The Bill must be drafted to represent the actual and true intention of government. The main reason why I am insisting on this, is not for the purity of draftsmanship, it is because of the putative resort to the imposition of conditions of service where there is no immediate emergency. It is against my whole erstwhile professional background of appearing sometimes for trades unions, sometimes against them. It just will not do as it stands. Although it may not be used, the threat is a form of a Sword of Damocles hanging over the whole process of collective bargaining. This is why I assert that the Bill must be amended.
<P>

<a name="30910-32_para36"></a>I just want to say one more thing. The broad sense of the debate in the other place on the 20th March which heralded the introduction of this Bill, would appear to favour further consideration of amendments, of arguments deployed in your Lordships' House. If one reads it carefully, inevitably there was unease about this. This is no exercise in confrontation with the Government or with the other place. One has to accept that the Bill has not yet commended itself to the <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall seek to do justice to the noble Lord's group of amendments. I am not seeking to jump the gun, but I may touch on Amendment No. 5, to which he referred and which is linked with Amendment No. 8, although that amendment is the property of the Conservative Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para0"></a>This group is largely concerned with placing conditions on the Secretary of State's power to make orders under the Bill. Noble Lords will be aware that the purpose of the powers is that in the event of a further dispute the Secretary of State can take action to remove the cause of the argument. If it becomes necessary for the Secretary of State to use the powers&#151;and we very much hope that it will not&#151;he must be able to intervene decisively and without undue delay so that the argument does not drag on, as it did in the past 12 months. Placing preconditions on the powers, however well intentioned, would make that more difficult and could even call into question the Secretary of State's ability to exercise the powers, as I shall explain.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para1"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 are in part concerned with restricting the use of Clause 1(1) to states of emergency. They would allow the Secretary of State to use his powers under that subsection in a state of emergency, but the recent fire service pay dispute was not deemed a state of emergency, even when the country was at war. Local disputes that may stem from the dispute are certainly unlikely to constitute a state of emergency.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para2"></a>The Emergency Powers Acts 1920 and 1964 allow the Queen to issue a proclamation of a state of emergency if it appears to Her Majesty that there have occurred, or are about to occur, events of such a nature,

<P>


<a name="column_416"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para3"></a>We do not want a state of emergency to exist at all. If it were to do so, for example, as the result of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack, I would hope and expect firefighters to act responsibly regardless of whether they were engaged in an industrial dispute and to protect the public. I know from his remarks on Second Reading that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, shares that view. Noble Lords will recall that there were numerous occasions during the dispute when firefighters left their picket lines to attend emergency calls when lives were in danger. We would expect nothing less, and we pay tribute to the work done in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, has previously indicated that he believes that powers such as those in Clause 1(1) should be exercised only in a state of emergency. During the Second Reading debate, he recalled the emergency legislation passed during the Second World War and indicated that the Bill could have been justified by the circumstances pertaining at the time of its introduction in the other place&#151;that is, the conflict in the Gulf. Circumstances have clearly changed since the Bill's introduction in the other place, although our Armed Forces are of course still at risk.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para5"></a>As I said in Grand Committee, it would not be right for us to have to wait for a state of emergency before the powers in the Bill could be exercised. It would not be acceptable to the House or to those outside this place if the dispute were to flare up again, further strikes were threatened, and all that the Government could say was, "We can't sort this out because there isn't a war on". As I have explained repeatedly, this Bill is to tackle a specific circumstance, which is not a state of emergency.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para6"></a>With respect to collective bargaining, in relation to Amendments Nos. 4 and 6, the other conditions under which the Secretary of State may make an order under Clause 1(1)(a) are when collective bargaining has broken down and mandatory arbitration has either not been applied for or the results of the tribunal have been ignored or rejected.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para7"></a>The difficulty with the proposition that collective bargaining would have to have failed before the Secretary of State could exercise his powers is that it is a matter of judgment whether collective bargaining has failed. There is not necessarily one single point in a dispute that marks with absolute certainty the point at which collective bargaining can be considered to have failed. For example, it could be argued strongly that collective bargaining did not fail during the recent dispute, given that the two parties eventually reached an agreement. Most reasonable people would accept that there were a number of occasions during the long dispute when the prospect of a negotiated settlement seemed extremely remote and where the sort of decisive intervention that the Bill will allow would have been appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 6 and 4, if accepted, would theoretically provide an opportunity for the employers or the union to challenge the Secretary of State's exercise of power on the grounds that in their view <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>collective bargaining had not failed. At the very least that could delay the Secretary of State's intervention with the result that a potentially damaging industrial dispute could drag on or that firefighters would not get a pay rise.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para9"></a>As regards the other conditions suggested in Amendments Nos. 6 and 4, namely, the issue of the award of a mandatory arbitral tribunal, that should have been ignored or rejected before the Secretary of State can use his powers. Amendment No. 6 refers to Amendment No. 7, which would provide for the establishment of an independent mandatory arbitral tribunal for the resolution of disputes concerning the conditions of service of members of the fire brigade. Disputes would be referred to the tribunal only if collective bargaining had failed. The failure of collective bargaining would be determined by the parties or ACAS. The award of the tribunal would be, as the noble Lord said, binding on all parties and the Government.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para10"></a>The issue of arbitration was raised by a number of noble Lords during Second Reading debate and in Grand Committee. We indicated then that the Government had some difficulty with it. That is still the case. It would go against the whole purpose of the Bill. If the two parties to negotiation cannot agree, the democratically elected Secretary of State with responsibility for the provision of an effective fire service and for the public funding of that service, should step in and make a settlement. I agree that that would require some hard decisions and those could not and should not be handed over to a third party.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para11"></a>The issues which caused the most difficulty in the fire dispute are those such as how the fire service should move from a prescribed national fire cover standard to a locally risk-based approach to fire cover; and what are the implications for staff, especially shift patterns? These are not necessarily issues for arbitration. Ultimately, one cannot arbitrate about policy questions such as the right basis for fire cover. One can arbitrate about some of the implications, but it is hard to see how even the best independent arbitrator would be better placed to make informed judgments than those directly involved in managing the fire service or those in government who have the policy responsibility for it. We are prepared to make the hard decisions ourselves if we have to, not just hand them over to someone else.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para12"></a>Amendment No. 7 also states that any award of a tribunal would be binding on the Government. That raises the question of whether the Secretary of State would still be able to discharge his powers under Clause 1(1)(a) to fix or modify conditions if this interfered with the decision of a tribunal and the award of the tribunal was binding on the government. However, as the Government are not a party in the resolution of disputes concerning the conditions of service of members of the fire brigade, it would be impossible for the award of a tribunal to be binding on them. The drafting in this respect is flawed.
<P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para13"></a>As regards Amendment No. 4, it also requires the Secretary of State, save in states of emergency, to consult before directing fire authorities in the disposal and use of their facilities and property under Clause 1(1)(b). If it became necessary for the Secretary of State to use the powers, he must be able to intervene decisively and without undue delay so that lives are not put at risk. He may need to do that in circumstances which do not amount to a state of emergency as defined in other legislation mentioned earlier, but where the public are still at risk. However well-intentioned, and I accept the good intentions on this point, placing pre-conditions on the powers would make that much more difficult.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 and 13 would effectively remove the provisions in subsection (3) which require the Secretary of State to submit any proposals on the conditions of service for fire brigade members to any negotiating body that appears to exist. I assume that the noble Lord wishes us to read this amendment in conjunction with Amendments Nos. 2 or 4, which makes it impossible for the Secretary of State to use these powers in subsection (1) save in a state of emergency.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para15"></a>I explained earlier why we cannot accept the amendment, which restricts order-making powers to a state of emergency, and, as Amendments Nos. 3 and 13 would not be desirable without this pre-condition, I regret that I cannot accept them either. 
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para16"></a>I have a final point to make about Amendment No. 5, to which the noble Lord referred. It takes a different, more direct approach. It seeks to make collective action taken at the instigation of a trade union unlawful, first, if it disrupts fire brigade services, and secondly, if it inhibits performance of an order made under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-33_para17"></a>I can only repeat what I have said on numerous occasions. We do not intend to change the general law on industrial action in relation to the fire service. Whatever the cause of any collective action, if the proper steps are taken the existing legislation will offer some protection for those taking the action. That will remain. The Government do not intend to use the Bill, which we have consistently said is limited in its purpose, to make changes to industrial relations law. With that in mind, I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on the matter and withdraw his amendment.

Assuredly I would wish to reflect on much that he said. There is one matter where it would have been right on an old brief, but the question of whether collective bargaining ends has been dealt with as a result of a discussion some time ago.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-34_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope that I can be reasonably brisk. The Minister will know from our discussion in Grand Committee that we have a number of considerable concerns about the Bill, not least of which is how it would be implemented if it had to be implemented in the face of some considerable intransigence from the Fire Brigades Union. If the Bill has to be used it will not be used with co-operation but as a result of lack of co-operation.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para8"></a>At the end of the day it seems that there is nothing to stop the unions from striking yet again. Nothing in the Bill gives the Government any comfort at all about how to react if the worst comes to the worst and no one pays any attention to what the Bill says.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para9"></a>It has long been argued that the fire service ought to be in the same position as the police and the armed services. There ought to be no-strike clauses in relevant procedures or legislation to reinforce the Government's hand if they have to use this legislation. Perhaps the Bill is currently not the right place for such provision. I know that the matter has been considered and may be dealt with in the White Paper, but that will not help if this legislation has to be used.

That is the first way&#151;there are other ways&#151;in which it is not true that the measure does not affect the right to strike. They could be sacked and a tribunal could say that it was fair to do so. Breach of contract will apply and that will be the end of that.

<A NAME="30910-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I put this not as a question but as two clear points. First, we now have repeated on Report what was said in Grand Committee&#151;that the Opposition's official policy is to militarise the fire service, place it in the same position as the Armed Forces and abolish its right to strike. That is now clear and I am grateful that it has been made clear because it is a distinct difference from the Government, whose intention is not to affect the right to strike&#151;although, as we shall later argue, unhappily, their Bill does not reflect that intention. However, the Opposition are clear: they want to conscript the fire brigade. That is the first point.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para11"></a>The second point is very serious for the noble Baroness. She made very similar points in Grand Committee&#151;where we had a jolly little debate on one of her amendments. I asked her then more or less the following: "Does that mean that you denounce the ILO conventions which plainly state that, apart from the police and the Armed Forces, it is an offence against international law to abolish the right to strike of other groups of workers?" It is true that there is extensive ILO jurisprudence on the matter&#151;jurisprudence in the sense of the Committee on Freedom of Association.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para12"></a>I asked that question some time ago, and the noble Baroness has had time to think about it. Yet she does not mention the ILO. Presumably, however, impliedly, she <P>


<a name="column_421"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>now confirms that it is Opposition policy to denounce that right in international law under the ILO. And it is not just under the ILO; it is also the Council of Europe, the European charter and a number of United Nations documents as well.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para13"></a>The noble Baroness has also had the chance to do some reading. It just so happens&#151;and I want to refer to this work later, not in extenso but in general terms&#151;that she has had the opportunity to read a piece of scholarship that sets this all out in enormous detail. I refer to the book, published this July by Oxford University Press, which seems to take the Minister's fancy, by Dr Tonia Novitz, called The International and European Protection of the Right to Strike. I do not suggest that the noble Baroness should have read it. One of the marks of these debates is that people do not read things. It is not her fault and she is not alone, but she might have considered the point. She wants to militarise the fire service and denounce the ILO. That is a clear distinction from government policy and, whatever I say about this Bill, I recognise that distinction. I think it deplorable that the Opposition of this country, who believe&#151;well, they may not believe it, but who think&#151;that they may one day form a government, come out with that stuff. It is disgraceful.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord refers to the concept of my party, or the party to which I adhere, of conscripting the fire brigades. I know of no such policy. I have always made it plain that the individual right to withhold or withdraw labour would always be maintained and preserved. I made it plain, although it may not have suited the noble Lord to understand, that I was referring to collective action taken within this union because of the danger to the public and the public interest. It had nothing to do with conscription and I was totally prepared to accept the imposition of service in any time of emergency because it would be necessary&#151;but not otherwise. It is not fair of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, to have read out all sorts of passages from the Oxford book on the matter to my noble friend Lady Hanham. Neither she&#151;I suspect but do not know&#151;nor I know of any policy of our party as was suggested by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall concentrate on Amendment No. 8. I dealt with Amendment No. 5 in the context of the noble Lord's views, but as the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 8 is the key amendment. It provides that an order under Clause 1(1)(a) could include provision about membership of trades unions and about disciplinary offences. Since firefighters currently enjoy an unfettered right to join a trade union, this amendment could only constrain that right. I understand that the intention behind this amendment is to put members of fire brigades on the same or similar footing as police officers.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para14"></a>Police officers are prevented joining a trade union by virtue of Section 64 of the Police Act 1996. Police officers are also subject to the Police (Conduct) <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Regulations 1999, which include a code of conduct covering various matters such as attendance at work. Any breach of the code&#151;for example, taking strike action&#151;could ultimately lead to dismissal. The central issue here is the so-called right to strike. I remind noble Lords that there is no statutory right to strike in the UK. However, there is no practical way to prevent someone withdrawing their labour or to force them to work. So a ban on strike action would be pointless. The so-called right to strike is given by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. This provides statutory immunity for striking workers and their trade unions so that they are protected from legal action for breach of contract provided the industrial action is in response to a trade dispute and has been subject to the proper balloting and notification procedures. In addition, the ability to strike is seen as an important part of the freedom to associate under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para15"></a>I accept that it is a matter of judgment whether fire-fighters, like the police, perform a role which makes it necessary to interfere with the basic right of any working person to withdraw their labour. Our judgment remains that they do not. We have made our views on this point absolutely clear in our White Paper, Our Fire and Rescue Service, which stated in paragraph 7.25 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"employees' ability to take lawful strike action should only be withdrawn in exceptional circumstances. While some may well argue that the experience of the recent fire strikes provide precisely such circumstances, the Government has no plans at present to remove from employees in the fire and rescue service existing freedoms under the law to take industrial action. But it will keep the position under close review".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-34_para16"></a>Under any circumstance, I do not think the kind of powers that would be conferred by Amendment No. 8 would be an appropriate way to deal with these matters. I could certainly not support the idea of the Secretary of State legislating in an order about such fundamental things as trade union membership.
<P>

<a name="30910-34_para17"></a>So far as the second limb of this amendment is concerned, the Secretary of State already has the power to make regulations about discipline in the Fire Services Act 1947 (Section 17). The recent White Paper explained that we intend to abolish the current military style regulations and replace them with a new framework based on ACAS best practice guidance. We do not need another power here. Therefore, Amendment No. 8 is unnecessary and I hope that, on reflection, the noble Baroness will not press it.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, on a point of information I ask about a straight question of fact. Are the Government planning to abolish those regulations and the promotion regulations before the end of the year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, we shall legislate following the White Paper. We have produced a White Paper which precedes legislation. There will be a Bill but I do not know when it will come before the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, <P>


<a name="column_423"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway for their interventions. Irrespective of what happens with this amendment, the question still remains of how the Government will implement their legislation if they have to. The right to strike remains and therefore a strike can take place whether or not the Government decide to implement the Bill. A strike can take place if the Government decide to implement the Bill. Therefore, the Bill remains unimplementable in the face of intransigence. That is one of the big flaws in the legislation. If people do not agree with what the Government are saying and do not want to go along with that, it is almost impossible for the Government to have their way.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para0"></a>However, I hear what the Minister says&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the Bill is a means for the fire-fighters to get the money in the event of a dispute. In certain circumstances we want to pay them the money. The argument that the Bill is unimplementable is abject nonsense. It will give the Secretary of State the power to get the payments to the fire-fighters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I did not intend to end on a note of disagreement. However, under the Bill the Secretary of State could put forward any scheme at all. The Bill states that he can impose pay and conditions of service, but it does not say what they are unless there are to be further Explanatory Notes attached to the Bill stating that the Secretary of State would implement only the pay as agreed at the present time. However, that is not stated in the Bill. As I read the Bill, the Secretary of State could decide not to accept a pay deal and to impose a completely different pay deal and try to implement other conditions of service. That might not be at all acceptable to the Fire Brigades Union, but that is how I read the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the whole point is that if there was a deal, there would not be a dispute. We laboured this point in Grand Committee. I said that the Secretary of State would not be using the power to reduce firefighters' pay. We discussed this. It would be a means of his being able to get money to the firefighters which the dispute was stopping.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, on the basis of what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-35_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope that I can introduce this amendment even more briefly. Again, it goes to the heart of whether, and how, the provision would be implemented. It is clear that the Bill will be implemented only at the end stage, when everyone is exasperated and has lost the plot.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para4"></a>At the end of the day, it would be worth the Secretary of State testing the views of the Fire Brigades Union by a postal ballot before implementing the deal. That is what the amendment suggests. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I am worried about this amendment. I have let my noble friend know my views. Irrespective of whether my amendments hold or fail, this amendment has to be qualified. As it stands, it would delay plenipotentiary powers of immediate effect in the event of a terrorist attack. So it would require a drafting qualification to make certain that these provisions should not apply in the event of an emergency.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para5"></a>Then, we are getting again towards the two regimes, which at the moment the Government are not willing to accept. But if the Government are not willing to accept that, I suggest that they have to take on board my concern about the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for his intervention. That is precisely the Government's argument: that the postal ballot would take time without getting anywhere.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para6"></a>The powers in the Bill, as we have said on many occasions, are designed to deal speedily with a situation in which the normal process of negotiation has broken down. We also made the point in Grand Committee that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have available the up-to-date information to carry out such a detailed ballot. Although the latter part of the amendment requires fire authorities to supply the Secretary of State with relevant information to carry out a postal ballot, the amendment gives no time limit within which the fire authority should comply. Should the fire authority wish, it could delay the process to such an extent as to render it useless.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para7"></a>Even if the Secretary of State did carry out a postal ballot on an order modifying or fixing conditions of service, it is not clear what we would do with the results of the ballot. The amendment does not say what should be done with the results, and to that extent it has little meaning.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para8"></a>If the purpose of Amendment No. 9 is to seek consultation from fire brigade members, that is already provided for through consultation with the negotiating body, which will include representatives of fire brigade members, under Clause 1(3).
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para9"></a>As I have explained previously and as we have said on many occasions, the powers in the Bill are not for generalities but to deal with a specific set of circumstances surrounding the strikes earlier this year. Against that background, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, if one gets to the stage of needing to use this Bill, it is possible that negotiating bodies will no longer be the people with whom one is considering doing any deals. That will have all broken down. It might very well be that what the Secretary of State wants to introduce could be perfectly acceptable to members of the Fire Brigades Union. There has always been a question about how many people support the action. The only way that the Secretary of State will ever be able to find that out is in a non-emergency situation. I accept that it is technically a fault on that basis, if we are now accepting that there are two sides to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para10"></a>The fact of the matter is that one might get very different results from postal ballots than from negotiators. It seems to me perfectly proper for the Secretary of State to have that ability if he wishes. One could easily limit the period in which the information had to be provided about the personnel. If that is a technical hitch, it could easily be amended. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-35_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McCarthy </B>   moved Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-35_para12"></a><P>

"(1A) The Secretary of State shall publish a code of guidance explaining the conditions under which or situations in which he is likely to wish to make use of his powers to make orders under this Act, and such code of guidance shall create no legal rights or duties but shall be taken into account by the courts in relation to any order."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-35_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now change the emphasis. We have been trying to get the Government to say a little about the circumstances when they would bring the Bill into action and when they would say that it was an emergency. We have been concentrating on emergencies. Now, we shall try a slightly different approach in the hope that we might get somewhere. The amendment talks not of limitations but of a code of guidance, explaining the conditions in which the Secretary of State is likely to make use of his powers to make orders under this Act and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such a code of guidance shall create no legal rights"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-35_para14"></a>so it is different in that respect&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or duties but shall be taken into account by the courts".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-35_para15"></a>That is an attempt to transfer into the field of the fire service the concept of guidance, advice or statutory codes of practice.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para16"></a>There are many statutory codes of practice which specify all kinds of things. For example, there is the code of practice that deals with how to conduct legal ballots or what to do to comply with the health and safety law or to avoid discrimination. Many codes of practice tell the parties, the individuals, the employers and the workers concerned what their legal rights and liabilities are and a very great deal about how the Act is designed to work.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para17"></a>Strangely enough, so far as I know&#151;and I should be very pleased for the Government to get up and say that we have this wrong&#151;the Government do not propose to provide guidance to the parties on this quite <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unusual, if not unique, experiment in legislation. Therefore, we are suggesting that they might like to do that. For example, they might like to say something. They might reprint the words of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, about what an emergency situation is. I was very surprised to learn that he did not think that the last fireman's strike was an emergency. I do not know what an emergency would be. The way the Government criticised the union&#151;and of course they are perfectly entitled to do that&#151;one would have thought that it was an emergency situation. After all, there was a sense in which the country was at war. The problem, the Government said at the time, was that it was time that the soldiers who had been sent to Iraq came back or that it was time they were circulated around. We could not go on like that. That was a very large part of the Secretary of State's argument.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para18"></a>Therefore, if we could have a return to those themes and be told the circumstances in which the Government would think it was an emergency, that would be extremely useful for the parties. It would certainly be of use to the parties if there was something&#151;not on the face of the Bill&#151;about the circumstances in which the Government would use these orders if there was no sign of industrial action. I had thought, before the Minister made his speech in Committee, that we could more or less assure ourselves that government would not use this Bill, which is to deal with an emergency situation, if there had been no sign of a strike. In most of the ways in which he developed the argument, there is a strike, the strike has been going on for quite some time. They may even have got to the point where they have made a settlement, but that is not enough. We would like to know why it should be that, when there is no industrial action in prospect, this legislation should be introduced. Would it be introduced only in the sense that the Minister might propose something, but would not necessarily bring out an order until he could size up the situation?
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para19"></a>There is, of course, the question that has been raised&#151;and again I think it would be very useful for the parties involved to be told&#151;as to how far and in what circumstances the Secretary of State might bring out his orders, even if there was an agreement. I know that the Minister referred in Committee to circumstances where the parties had got together and there was some settlement that was a carve-up, in which the two sides were agreeing things and expecting the Government to pay. But surely something more could be said about the kinds of ways in which an agreement would produce not peace, quiet, placidity and acceptance, but an order?
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para20"></a>As I said in Committee, there can be occasions, very often there are, when the parties to a complex negotiation agree two-thirds of it, but they cannot get the last bit done, they cannot get the words done. Those words are not necessarily critical, they may be thought to be more important by one side or the other, but what they really want is time, and they might take that dispute, that issue, out of the negotiations. They might say, "We will come back to that in six months. It is something that we do not want to discuss any <P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further. We will sign what we have got." Is that the kind of situation&#151;surely not&#151;in which the Secretary of State could suddenly say, "Well because you have not agreed everything, I will introduce my order."? I would not have thought so, but maybe it is, and if it is, then I think it is possible that we ought to have an understanding.
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para21"></a>I go back to the point that I made in answer to the previous amendment. The Government go on about the fact that this is not changing the right to strike. You can argue about whether it is changing the right to strike and the extent to which it is changing the right to strike in relation to the trade union. We are talking about whether the trade union is inducing a breach of contract. But as I say, think of the worker. How can the Minister say this, if he is paying attention?
<P>

<a name="30910-35_para22"></a>Suppose the employer says, "I will sack these people. This is a statutory duty. I can sack people if it is a statutory duty because it is not a breach of contract. It is unlawful. They are preventing me from carrying out the statutory duty." He sacks them. They then have to crawl all the way to an industrial tribunal. It takes a long time with conciliation and mediation. They are on the stones. You cannot say these people have not had their right to strike abridged. They are on the stones, they have lost their jobs. Eventually they go to a tribunal and the tribunal says, "That is perfectly true, we have authority for this, after all Lord Denning said that there is no immunity for an authority to break its statutory duty. So if that is the case then there is no immunity for the workers who forced it to fail in its statutory duty." So the union loses. So the union goes to the EOC and the union goes to the Court of Appeal and it keeps going and all this time the workers are sacked and if more workers come out in support of these workers they are sacked as well. The strike has been broken by dismissals, by sequential, growing dismissals. How can you say that that does not abridge the right to strike? That problem does not arise for any other group of workers in England. Of course you cannot say that.

In particular, the Government should come clean about how the Bill seriously undermines workers' right to take industrial action.

<FONT SIZE=3>that they will produce some explanation&#151;call it a code of guidance or something else&#151;that will tell those poor devils what is in train for them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend's amendment. As I am sure the Minister is well aware, it is usual to have codes of practice issued in connection with legislation. That is all that the amendment proposes. As he is well aware, the legislation is not terribly popular. I have received letters from the FBU opposing it. If a code of practice is issued indicating how the Government see their powers under the Bill and how they intend to proceed, it might render the whole exercise slightly more acceptable, which needs to happen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. However, the problem that my noble friend put involving industrial action will be very simply remedied, because the Government can easily accept Amendments Nos. 11 and 25&#151;I hope that the Minister will&#151;and put the matter right. It is a very simple point, but we shall come to it then.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para1"></a>I wish to address the golden thread of merit in the amendment that appears in the last few words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such code of guidance shall create no legal rights or duties but shall be taken into account by the courts in relation to any order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-36_para2"></a>I hope that the Government and their Chief Whip will understand the importance of those words. They are the normal formula that has appeared in many statutes. I shall not go over the same ground as my noble friend; there are all sorts of merits in a code of guidance. He outlined perfectly well the role that they can usefully play in negotiation. To be "taken into account by the courts" is the normal formula that means the court can take judicial notice of the code and solve any evidential problem, just as it does with the ACAS code.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para3"></a>The thread of merit goes further in view of what the Minister has said earlier about challenge in the courts. He said that Amendment No. 1 could be challenged in the courts. When I asked him how that could be done, he said that he did not know. This is a very important constitutional moment. If I were a critical chap, and if the Minister were paying attention to the point, I might say that when a Minister of the Crown tells the House that a form of words could be challenged in the courts and is then asked how that would be, to which he replies, "I do not know"&#151;of course I have sympathy with him as it was not in his brief&#151;that would usually be the occasion for a Statement at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para4"></a>The great merit of this amendment is that it cannot possibly meet that objection. It has been well recognised that such a code of guidance is not creating rights or duties, which means that it is not legally binding on the Minister, but that the courts may take judicial notice of it. Therefore, there is no question of a challenge in the courts for the code of guidance and it would, as has already been said by both my noble friends, also have the great merit of being able to resolve situations that might otherwise lead to a more provocative dispute.

<a name="30910-36_para5"></a>I therefore hope that the Minister will take very seriously the idea that, once again, instead of merely telling us the Government's intentions, all of which we totally believe, they will put something about those intentions in the Bill. What the Government say is not law, but what the Bill or Act states is. We shall return to that in other amendments.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para6"></a>I very much hope that on this occasion my noble friend the Minister will give a favourable view towards doing something of the kind suggested by the amendment.

<A NAME="30910-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I am going to disappoint my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, because we believe that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para7"></a>The Secretary of State is under a general duty to act reasonably and proportionately and the Secretary of State has made it clear&#151;as have we, on many occasions&#151;that the powers the Bill would confer are designed for a very specific set of circumstances. The Secretary of State is not going to decide suddenly to use the powers for an alternative purpose. Even if he did, the Bill places a duty on the Secretary of State to consult with either the negotiating body for orders under Clause 1(1)(a) or with persons affected by an order under Clause 1(1)(b) before using his powers. So the Secretary of State can respond to new, developing or unforeseen circumstances but no one can be taken entirely by surprise.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para8"></a>As the code of guidance suggested in Amendment No. 10 would create no legal right or duty, if the Secretary of State decided he did want to exercise his powers outside the code of guidance, he could simply amend the code. So the amendment would introduce a very blunt and ineffectual tool in curtailing the use of his powers&#151;which I assume is what is intended&#151;compared to the existing duty to consult.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para9"></a>The amendment states that the code could be taken into account by courts in relation to any order made by the Secretary of State, but as noble Lords know, any order made by the Secretary of State under this Bill would be open to judicial review anyway, whether a <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>code of guidance existed or not. It is right that judicial review remains the ultimate safeguard against an unreasonable use of this power.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para10"></a>We suggest that this amendment adds nothing helpful to this Bill and request that the noble Lord withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, that is not entirely a surprise, but it is remarkable. The Minister says that the amendment is unnecessary because the Secretary of State is a reasonable man. Are we not all reasonable men? However, he cannot tell us the criteria that he will use to apply his reasonability. He is just a reasonable man. If he were unreasonable, he could be taken to court. However, people want to know what is going to happen before it happens. They do not want suddenly to be told that this or that is happening.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para11"></a>The Minister says that people will not be taken by surprise entirely, and that they will have some idea, because the Bill has a specific purpose. We have often been told that in the course of this debate, but we are not told whether that specific purpose comes in when there is a strike, when there is no strike or when any of the many and variable situations that will take people entirely by surprise occur.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para12"></a>So I do not see how, when the Bill is an Act, the Government, whether or not they accept the amendment, will not have to produce something. Every Bill that I have ever got involved with has had something from some ministry&#151;it is usually highly glossy and expensive&#151;telling us what the Bill will do and giving some guidance. This will be a unique&#151;and reasonable, of course&#151;Bill. Not only will there be no code of practice, for the first time; there will be nothing but silence, while we wait for the reaction of the reasonable man.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para13"></a>I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H2><center>(Ninth Day) Wednesday, 10th September 2003.</center></H2>
<H4><center>The Committee met at half past three of the clock.</center></H4>
[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Ampthill) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-36_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  With the agreement of the Committee, I do not propose to waste time reading out something which we have now heard eight times over; we may proceed straight away to Clause 163 and Amendment No. 245.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para16"></a>Clause 163 [Entry and search of premises after arrest]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-36_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 245:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 88, line 42, leave out subsection (9).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-36_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30910-36_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: As the Deputy Chairman has rightly reminded us, we now have the joy of a ninth day in Committee on the Bill, which I think we all hope will be the last such day.
<P>

<a name="30910-36_para19"></a>Clause 163 provides for the entry and search of premises after the person in question has been arrested. The clause lays out conditions for search and entry, the relevant offences that relate to the power to search and details of what may legitimately be seized during that search. Subsection (8) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The powers conferred by subsections (2) and (5) may be exercised only if a police officer of the rank of inspector or above has given written authorisation for their exercise".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-36_para20"></a>
As one might expect, we entirely support that subsection. It seems sensible for authorisation to be given before any entry and search is made after the person in question has been arrested. In such circumstances, there is none of the urgency of the type that we have already discussed in relation to searches at the time of arrest itself. However, our query relates to subsection (9), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But the power conferred by subsection (2) may be exercised without authorisation under subsection (8) if&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-36_para21"></a><P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-36_para23"></a>
I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the committee what sort of situations that provision is intended to address. Why does the Bill include one subsection ensuring that a search after arrest must be by authorisation only and then, in the following subsection, allow a search without senior officer <P>


<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>authorisation? We read the Explanatory Notes, but they took us no further forward, so I hope that we may receive some clarification today from the Minister. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   It is popular when discussing such criminal justice matters to object to anything that might authorise a fishing trip. In fact, it is a bit of a ritual to do that, so I shall do so now. I am also interested that subsection (10) states that subsections (8) and (9) do not apply in Scotland. Presumably, that is because the matter is already dealt with in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  I shall be glad to give the clarification that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, seeks through this probing amendment. Let me turn directly to her question of why, having provided the basic power of prior written authorisation, subsection (9) appears to allow for exceptions.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para0"></a>Let me give an instance of why we think that to be necessary. One can envisage the circumstance in which the police find a person who is wanted for, say, a bank robbery in Portugal, at address A and the person indicates that he is willing to co-operate with the police and that there is further evidence or money at another address&#151;just further down the road, for example. In those circumstances, as a consequence of having to obtain prior authorisation, one would significantly reduce the likelihood of being able to seize the evidence or proceeds of crime.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para1"></a>However, although such a power is necessary, there must clearly be safeguards against it. In drafting the clause, we have again sought to follow provisions in our domestic legislation. Section 18(5) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 makes almost identical provision allowing a constable to conduct a search before the person is taken to the police station, without obtaining authorisation. There must be safeguards against the abuse of such a power, and there is therefore a further safeguard in the police code of practice, which has been open for consultation during the summer.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para2"></a>Chapter 3, paragraph 4.4 of the draft code states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If authorisation has not been obtained . . .  an officer of the rank of inspector or above must be informed that a search has been made, as soon as practicable after it has been conducted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-37_para3"></a>
That information will be supported by the normal action after a search, which includes making and filing a record of the search and explaining the grounds under which it was made. That is spelt out in the code of practice in paragraph 4.13. For those reasons, we believe that the provision is necessary, albeit circumscribed in the way I described.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para4"></a>As for the question posed by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, there is no legality for the undertaking of fishing trips in such circumstances. He is of course absolutely right to say that the situation is different in <P>


<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scotland; I shall speak in considerably more detail to that later when we discuss subsequent amendments, if the noble Earl will bear with me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I understand that there may be circumstances in which it is desirable to have a power to search without obtaining previous authorisation, but should it not be on the face of the Bill that that should be done only where it is impracticable to obtain authorisation? Otherwise it would leave too much open if you could simply go ahead and then notify the inspector. Where it is practicable to consult an inspector before a search is carried out&#151;that may even be done orally rather than in writing; an inspector will surely be at least at the end of a radio or mobile telephone&#151;should it not be a requirement that such consent should be obtained?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   It would clearly be technically possible to do what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, suggests, but one of the themes running throughout the Bill is an attempt to use and to build on police and criminal evidence procedures. This is not only for the purpose of reducing parliamentary draftsmen's time&#151;which is not an issue&#151;but it is essential that, as far as possible and where it is appropriate, to have similar codes and practices so that the police may deal with a matter using similar procedures. It will increase the likelihood of errors not being made where there is no need to do so if one follows PACE practices and a code which is built on PACE. For that reason&#151;particularly when it is reinforced by the commitment that the Government have given to clarification&#151;I do not believe there is a danger.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </B>   Is there not a possibility of obtaining authority retrospectively? If this exception is not to lead to fishing expeditions, why could it not be approved by an authority subsequently that it was necessary in the circumstances to conduct a search expeditiously and without prior permission? That would ensure that it was an exception and that some discipline was placed on an authority; otherwise it could make the excuse that it was in a hurry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   In practice, as regards the requirement to notify an inspector or a more senior officer after the event has happened, in a sense it will be difficult to authorise something that has already happened. It is germane that if circumstances arose in which there did not appear to be any good reason for a subsequent search taking place without authority&#151;I am thinking on my feet here&#151;the inspector or other senior officer would have to draw attention to the fact that the evidence was possibly suspect because it had not been carried out necessarily in compliance with PACE.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para5"></a>If, on reflection, I can add anything further, I shall be happy to write to the noble Lord, Lord Lamont.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Does my noble friend agree that it is quite impossible for a Bill of this kind, which we hope will become an Act, to specify all the possibilities <P>


<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that could arise? What is happening now so far as the Bill is concerned is that a possibility is being covered by a number of subsections. This is most important.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para6"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 3.40 to 3.50 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I was put off by the constant ringing of the Division Bell. My simple question is whether my noble friend agrees that it is quite impossible in a Bill of this kind or any Bill to rehearse all the possibilities that may exist. Here, there is a certain degree of implicit understanding of the procedure. Having said that, does he agree that the Bill establishes a practice and, from that, certain events follow? I believe that what has been expressed here is the possibility that constables will not be able to follow the procedure envisaged earlier in the Bill and that is why this particular provision has been inserted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am not sure that I can agree with my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis because good scrutiny sometimes makes one feel that one is not trying to answer every single eventuality, which we sometimes seek to do, as we should.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para7"></a>Speaking more seriously, the inspector will clearly have a duty to write down the grounds for the search on notification of the search and he would also check that against the officer's report of the search. I was saying that officers would be used to following those procedures as they are the same as those in PACE and the PACE codes of practice. We are currently consulting on the code of practice, but as yet we have not sensed that anyone feels that it was inappropriate to mirror PACE in those circumstances. I return to the initial point that, although this is a rarely used power, it is necessary to have such a power for the kind of circumstances that he instanced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-37_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. He is absolutely right to say that there should be some consistency between the practice of PACE and the practice within this Bill in the sense that it is helpful for the police to know the correct form of procedure so that they follow it. It is equally important for there to be consistency in order to assist practitioners and those who may fall foul of the law to know what good or bad practice may be.
<P>

<a name="30910-37_para8"></a>It was important that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised the issue about areas where it may be impractical to achieve consent. Those areas are the only ones governed by this. I want to look further at that, but I assume that it would be the case that if evidence were gathered in a way that contravened the PACE rules, one would not be able to use that evidence anyway in a court of law. We have been trying to obtain the explanation from the Minister and to ensure that we have considered the issues properly, as he said. The Committee stage provides the opportunity to probe and seek clarification. I believe that he has given us that. I shall look more carefully at the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, but, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30910-37_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30910-37_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled Amendment No. 247 because we have some concerns about the provisions of subsection (2) which states:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In relation to those cases the Secretary of State may by order apply the provisions mentioned in subsections (3) and (4) with specified modifications".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-37_para16"></a>
That seems rather curious. It seems to imply&#151;we assume this is wrong&#151;that Sections 54, 55, 56 and 58 of PACE will not otherwise apply to persons arrested under the Bill. Presumably the protections contained in those provisions should be set out specifically in the Bill. They would include, in particular, access to legal advice and to translators&#151;Section 58&#151;where necessary in the interests of justice. Therefore, I am unclear why in extradition proceedings the arrested person does not have the same protection under PACE as anyone normally arrested. I assume that that is simply a case of misreading the Bill or of thinking that there is a meaning that is not there at all. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on what appears to be an alternative procedure unique to extradition hearings. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for introducing this amendment because it gives us a chance to clarify the position. I should like to reassure her that the concept of "with specified modifications" is very minor in the context of the Bill. The noble Baroness is right to query the point as, indeed, did the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, although it is important to point out that the Committee's comments were made in respect of a completely different part of the Bill which we have yet to reach. We regard the issues in this part of the Bill as very minor indeed.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para0"></a>Clause 170 allows for some specific provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and its Northern Ireland equivalent to be applied in extradition cases. The power to apply these provisions with specified modifications is necessary simply to take account of the fact that we needed to distinguish between extradition cases and normal domestic ones. All these sections in PACE and the Northern Ireland equivalent refer repeatedly to the terms "offence" and "serious arrestable offence". Sections 54(4)(c), 52(6)(a), 58(a), (b) and (c) of PACE are just a few examples.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para1"></a>One of the key findings in the judgment of Rottman, which is the case that has caused us to spell out police powers on the face of the Bill, was that PACE in its unmodified form could refer only to offences committed in the UK or over which the UK takes extra-territorial jurisdiction. A reference to an offence in PACE cannot refer to offences committed overseas. <P>


<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Accordingly, unless we make these minor modifications, these sections of PACE cannot apply in extradition cases, which would deny important safeguards to fugitives, as the noble Baroness indicated.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para2"></a>That is why we believe that we need the power to apply the relevant sections of PACE with specified modifications. However, I can reassure your Lordships that we will be applying the appropriate sections with only the minimum of modifications required to make them work in the extradition context. I can say that with considerable confidence because if your Lordships care to look at the police code of practice which we put out for consultation earlier this month, you will see that all of it is covered in Chapter 1.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para3"></a>The draft codes cover all these areas&#151;including the right to have a person informed when arrested and the right to legal advice&#151;in considerable detail and mirror very closely what happens in domestic cases. We would, of course, welcome any comments on the draft code, but I hope that the Committee will be reassured that by the inclusion of the words "with specified modifications", we are not seeking to make any substantive changes.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para4"></a>The sections in PACE and the Northern Ireland equivalent that we are talking about provide important safeguards for those arrested. The right to legal advice and the right to have a person informed of your arrest are clearly very significant. Similarly, it is very important that all searches&#151;intimate or otherwise&#151;are conducted in accordance with approved procedures, and that a proper record is kept of them.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para5"></a>It would be a pity if these provisions could not apply in extradition cases. That would be the position unless we could make the necessary modifications. I hope the Committee will therefore see why the amendment is not attractive. Nevertheless, it has given me the opportunity to clarify the position, I hope to the satisfaction of the Committee.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-38_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that this will be seen as an utterly procedural amendment by the Government. Its purpose is to provide that the consultation exercise on the code of practice on police powers in extradition cases will be valid even though it will have taken place before Royal Assent. When the Bill was debated in another place, the Official Opposition spokesman asked that publication of the code of practice be as early as possible, and we were certainly pleased to make it so. The code was published on 9th June and has been distributed widely for comment to every police force, the Court Service, the Bar Council, the Magistrates' Association and others. The consultation closed two days ago on 8th September, although as discussed we have 12 weeks for people to comment.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para12"></a>The thrust of the purpose of the amendment is to put beyond doubt that the consultation and the draft code of practice are still valid, even though they took place before Royal Assent. The amendment is no more and no less than that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I certainly welcome the amendment and, of course, the publication of the draft codes that took place this summer. As the Minister stated in his letter of 4th June, that meets the requests made by my honourable friend Nick Hawkins. It is right that the codes should be ultimately subject to affirmative procedure when they come before this House. I am glad that the Government have made that clear.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para13"></a>The Minister mentioned that the consultation finished on 8th September, two days ago. I understand from the Government's press releases and the draft code of practice itself that the Government's response is expected to be published in October. Is that still the Government's intention? Obviously, it would be very helpful to the Committee to know that the Government will give a response before the Bill leaves this House, because we will be able to take that into constructive consideration before it passes to another place.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para14"></a>In the meantime, might the Minister be able to answer one or two administrative questions on the code of practice that occurred to me as I read through it this summer in our so-called holiday, before we came back to the joy of this Bill? When will the responses of the consultees be made available on the Internet? I confess that I have not looked today, so they may <P>


<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>already be there and I shall be given good news. I notice that, as always in these cases, the Government made it clear that if any consultees did not wish their responses to be made public they should so signify. Are the Government able to tell us whether any consultees have given that indication, or whether we are likely to see all the responses?
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para15"></a>I was intrigued by some of the questions in the code of practice, particularly that on clarity on page 8. The Government said that they would welcome comments on whether the distinction between,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"investigation of the extradition offence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-38_para16"></a>
and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"obtaining evidence for the prosecution of the extradition offence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-38_para17"></a>
in Chapter 2, paragraph 1.4, needs further explanation. That is in respect of search-and-seizure warrants and production orders. Paragraph 1.4 states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Searches under warrant should only be conducted for the purposes of obtaining evidence for the prosecution of the extradition offence and officers may not conduct searches which in any way constitute investigation of that offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-38_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30910-38_para19"></a>The Minister will be well aware that I raise the matter because of the strong discussions that we had on the point earlier in the Bill, when Members of the Committee expressed concerns about it. The way in which Clause 2 is drafted makes it possible for proceedings to be launched when the overseas authority seeks extradition for a process that in this country would not readily be recognised as one where the accused faces charges. To us it always appears as though there is an ongoing investigation. That lack of certainty of prosecution has been translated into the consultation document, we think, in Chapter 1, paragraph 2.1.ii, which states that an officer may make an arrest under Section 4 where the warrant contains information that the person has been accused or convicted of an offence in the category 1 country.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para20"></a>The whole point at issue, both in another place and here, has been that more than accusation must be required. That is a detailed query on the code of practice. I raise it now because we are in Grand Committee, where we can probe. I do not expect the Minister to give me a full answer today. I do it because we have a two-week break in which I hope that his Bill team can consider the matter. I am certainly not doing it simply to prove that I have read the document during the lovely summer holiday, but it is something that we will need to consider very carefully when we come back to such matters on Report.
<P>

<a name="30910-38_para21"></a>I wonder whether the Minister will be able to indicate&#151;it is unlikely today, but at a later stage and before October&#151;what the response has been to the issue in chapter 2, paragraph 1.4, regarding the clarity of the difference between obtaining evidence of prosecution as opposed to investigation, and whether responses have acknowledged the different systems of judicial procedure overseas in that respect. That is <P>


<a name="column_GC9"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>something that we will need to home in on when we come to Report. However, I repeat the welcome that I gave to the amendment.

<A NAME="30910-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   We are still receiving some responses but they have slow delivery dates. As is usually the way, one is not officious about those things. They will therefore be available on the Home Office website by the end of September.

<a name="30910-39_para1"></a>With regard to the noble Baroness's last point&#151;I have sufficient recollection of the issues which arose before the summer holidays&#151;it was rightly an important one in Committee. We are concerned that officers do not conduct fishing trips or investigations, as we have signalled. We recognise that this requires further clarification. Almost all respondees have requested this. We will certainly give the matter consideration. I am therefore pleased to accept the thrust of the noble Baroness's questioning, to take it away and to come back when we produce the draft. We should be able to show our likely responses before the Bill leaves the Lords, which I hope will be helpful.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 172, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-39_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "CODE OF PRACTICE IN SCOTLAND
<br>
(1) The Scottish Ministers must issue codes of practice in connection with&#151;
<br>
(a) the exercise of the powers conferred by this Part;
<br>
(b) the retention, use and return of anything seized or produced under this Part;
<br>
(c) access to and the taking of photographs and copies of anything so seized or produced.
<br>
(2) If the Scottish Ministers propose to issue a code of practice under this section, they must&#151;
<br>
(a) publish a draft of the code;
<br>
(b) consider any representations made to them about the draft;
<br>
(c) if they think it appropriate, modify the draft in light of any such representations.
<br>
(3) The Scottish Ministers must lay the code before the Scottish Parliament.
<br>
(4) When they have done so they may bring the code into operation by order.
<br>
(5) The Scottish Ministers may revise the whole or any part of a code issued under this section and issue the code as revised; and subsections (2) and (4) apply to such a revised code as they apply to the original code.
<br>
(6) A code issued under this section is admissible in evidence in proceedings under this Act and must be taken into account by a judge or court in determining any question to which it appears to the judge or the court to be relevant.
<br>
(7) The power conferred by subsection (4) on the Scottish Ministers to make orders shall be exercisable by statutory instrument.

(8) A statutory instrument containing an order under subsection (4) shall not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, the Scottish Parliament."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-39_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have been discussing Clause 172, which requires the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to this part of the Bill. But elsewhere, the Bill states that Clause 172 does not apply to Scotland. I can find no explanation of that either in the Government's Explanatory Notes on the Bill as a whole or in the Home Office notes on Scotland which the Minister kindly supplied for us.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para6"></a>The Law Society of Scotland feels that there should be a code in Scotland in much the same way as for the rest of the United Kingdom. I expect that the Minister may refer to the reply he gave at the end of business on the eighth day at col. GC164. He explained in another context that in all cases other than under Clause 5, police officers will be required to act directly under the instructions of the Crown Office and the procurator fiscal and that that will include questions of search.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para7"></a>If that explanation were part of the Minister's reply today, I feel that the Law Society of Scotland must be aware of it. I had not spotted his answer until recently because I had gone home and my noble friend Lady Anelay moved the amendment. However, the Law Society may feel, as do I, that it might be helpful for the police in Scotland to have a code of practice in their hand when dealing with this part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para8"></a>There is no reason why a code of practice should not exist. Obviously, it would not be that which appears in the amendment, because that assumes that the supervision is not carried out by the procurator fiscal. Is it impossible to require a code of practice under the circumstances prescribed in the Bill for Scotland? In such a tricky operation, the police will need something to refer to. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-39_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   In the context of devolution, it is becoming increasingly important to make certain that everyone knows exactly what is to happen. It is not directly relevant to extradition, but I cite the false crisis that has blown up over the use of Dungavel House, part of the Home Office's immigration system and a former semi-open prison now used as&#151;I think this is the terminology&#151;a removal centre. In the past fortnight or so, many Scottish parliamentarians have clearly got themselves into a considerable tangle about that.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para9"></a>Hoping that we will not get ourselves into a tangle over the Bill in future, I think that it would be very useful if a code of practice had to, first, be constructed for Scottish use and, secondly, go through the Scottish Parliament. That would mean that there was less chance of muddle, misunderstanding and false crises in future.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para10"></a>[The sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 4.12 to 4.22 p.m.]

<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   In practice, this is a matter for the Scots. Under the devolution settlement, it is for them to decide how they want to undertake these issues.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para11"></a>The fuller answer is that Clause 172 extends only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland for that reason. In Scotland, the power in Part 4 of the Bill will be exercised under the power of the Crown Office and the procurator fiscal service. Section 17(3) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 makes it clear that police officers must comply with the lawful instructions of the procurator fiscal in the investigation of crime. The procurator fiscal must apply to the sheriff for a warrant to search under Clause 155 and is responsible for the decision to deliver up any evidence seized to the requesting state. By virtue of Section 17 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, the chief constable of any area, in directing the constables of the police force in relation to the investigation of offences, must comply with the lawful instructions of the procurator fiscal.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para12"></a>Secondly, Section 48(5) of the Scotland Act provides that any decision of the Lord Advocate, in his capacity as head of the system of criminal prosecution is to be taken by him independently of any other person. Therefore, there might be an area of debate about whether a code of practice issued by Scottish Ministers to the police might be seen as an interference in the role of Lord Advocate.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para13"></a>At the practical level, I should signal that there are relatively few extradition requests to Scotland. For that reason, the tendency has been that the Lothian and Borders Police Force carries out the work for all of Scotland. One can see the sense in that: one force develops out of a limited case the experience and expertise in the matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para14"></a>In short, the issue is one for the Scots to decide whether a code of practice is necessary. We have received no indication that they think that, but no doubt this debate will alert them to consider the matter. I would doubt that that were the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-39_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I thank the Minister for that answer. This is an interesting issue. As my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie said, devolution is gradually being worked through and that involves tight, complicated arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para15"></a>I am a little surprised to learn that the Lothian police will search a house in North Uist. I am not sure whether that is the case, but perhaps it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am so advised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-39_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   That is interesting. I had not caught on to that point. It is understandable because in law the arrangements of the police in these and most circumstances are made by the Crown Office through the procurator fiscal. That clears up the matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para16"></a>I would like to go back to the Law Society of Scotland to see why it put forward the amendment. It may believe that the police, whoever they are, may need a code of practice. However, it sounds as though it should not be prescribed in the Bill. I shall return to <P>

 "EXTRADITION FROM BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-39_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving government Amendment No. 248A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 248B and explain why we seek to remove Clauses 176 to 180 from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para21"></a>These are drafting amendments. At present, Clauses 176 to 180 provide for extradition arrangements between British Overseas Territories and the rest of the world. The effect of these amendments is to replace five clauses with two. I can assure the Committee that in seeking to make these changes we are not in any way changing the policy or effect of the legislation as it would apply to the overseas territories.
<P>

<a name="30910-39_para22"></a>For the record, I should explain the policy. Gibraltar, as a party to the European arrest warrant, will apply Part 1 procedures. All our other overseas territories will apply Part 2 in all their extradition arrangements, including those with the UK. We simply concluded that, in the name of clear and concise drafting&#151;which I am sure the Committee will appreciate&#151;what was already in the Bill could be improved upon. This is the result of our improvement. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-40_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30910-40_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: It will not take long to explain the thinking behind Amendment No. 249, which is tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns. It has been grouped with the debate on Clause 181 stand part in the interests of not rehearsing the arguments twice over.

<P>

<a name="30910-40_para11"></a>Clause 181&#151;"Competing claims to extradition"&#151;deals, as one would expect, with the occasions when conflicting claims for extradition occur between category 1 and category 2 territories. Amendment No. 249 may at first sight seem somewhat pedantic but it is intended to draw the Government's attention to the different drafting adopted in the two paragraphs of subsection (1).
<P>


<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para12"></a>We believe that the words in subsection (1)(a),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is a Part 1 warrant in respect of a person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-40_para13"></a>
are superfluous. The situation which is being addressed is where a certificate under Clause 2 and a certificate under Clause 69&#151;that is, from a category 1 and category 2 territory respectively&#151;come into conflict in relation to the extradition of the same person. As a certificate under Clause 2 cannot be issued unless there is a Part 1 warrant in existence&#151;that is, a European arrest warrant&#151;which has been presented to the relevant authority in this country from a category 1 territory, the existing phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is a Part 1 warrant in respect of a person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-40_para14"></a>
is unnecessary; the fact is implicit in the provisions of the Bill. In the interests of tidier drafting and to make paragraph (a) correspond more closely to paragraph (b) in its wording, we believe that Amendment No. 249 should be adopted.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para15"></a>Let me now address our concerns about Clause 181 as a whole. We understand the necessity for including a clause in the Bill which addresses the problem of conflicting simultaneous requests from a category 1 and a category 2 territory. We have tabled the debate on clause stand part in order to probe the Minister and to give him a chance to explain the workability of the clause.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para16"></a>Subsection (2) gives a number of options to the Secretary of State in terms of how he should proceed when faced with two warrants. He may order proceedings on one of them, the warrant or the request&#151;be it a Part 1 or a Part 2&#151;to be deferred; he may order an extradition in respect of a warrant to be deferred until the request has been disposed of; and he may order an extradition in pursuance of a request to be deferred until the warrant has been disposed of. In other words, all options are open. This offers no advice or help to the Secretary of State; it merely states that all options are open to him.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para17"></a>However, subsection (3) sets out what the Secretary of State must take into account, and his decision must be based on the criteria set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of that subsection. These include the relative seriousness of the offences; the place where each offence was committed; the date when the warrant was issued and the date when the request was received; and whether, in the case of each offence, the person is accused of its commission or is alleged to be unlawfully at large after conviction.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para18"></a>I understand the reasons for those paragraphs, but does the Minister consider that the list of criteria is exhaustive? Surely other factors should be taken into account. Is there any reason why there should not, or could not, be a new paragraph which might include "any other factor which is deemed relevant"?
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para19"></a>The European arrest warrant seems to support such a non-exhaustive approach in terms of the criteria on which the Secretary of State should make his decision. Article 16 of the framework decision&#151;entitled "Decision in the event of multiple requests"&#151;states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If two or more Member States have issued European arrest warrants for the same person, the decision on which the European arrest warrants shall be executed shall be taken by the executing <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC15</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>judicial authority with due consideration of all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of the offences, the respective dates of the European arrest warrants and whether the warrant has been issued for the purposes of prosecution or for execution of a custodial sentence or detention order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-40_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30910-40_para21"></a>I note here that it refers to a consideration of "all the circumstances". This might include, for instance, considering the date of the alleged offence, which is not currently mentioned in the Bill. This perhaps should also be considered when deciding between two requests.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para22"></a>The clause relies on the discretion of the Secretary of State to come to the decision he thinks best in relation to two conflicting extradition requests. We want to ensure that the clause is workable in order that the Secretary of State may reach his decision with the best possible ease.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has on frequent occasions &#151;during the Second Reading debate and thereafter&#151;referred to the delays in the current procedure caused by potential judicial reviews of the Secretary of State's discretion. I should be grateful for the Minister's reassurance that he feels this clause has been sufficiently well drafted in the light of the difficulties experienced by the Home Secretary under the present regime when faced with conflicting simultaneous requests. It would be helpful to the Committee if he could explain how often such requests occur and how, if at all, the clause has been redrafted from the corresponding provisions in the existing Acts. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   As the Committee knows, Clause 181 is concerned with the important area of competing claims to extradition. We discussed this matter in some detail earlier when we considered an amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para24"></a>The Bill deals with competing requests in three separate places. Where there are two Part 1 requests in respect of the same person, it falls to the district judge to decide which one should be given priority. That is set out in Clause 43. Where there are two Part 2 requests in respect of the same person, it falls to the Secretary of State to decide which one should be given priority. That is set out in Clause 124. Clause 181, which we are currently considering, is concerned with the third possible combination&#151;that is, where we receive a Part 1 and a Part 2 request in respect of the same person. In that case, it is the Secretary of State who decides which one should be given priority.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para25"></a>The noble Lord is right that in each of the three situations that I have described the factors which must be decided between the two requests are the same: the relative seriousness of the offences; the place where the offence occurred or was alleged to have occurred; the dates when the request was made; and whether the person is accused of the offences or is alleged to be unlawfully at large after conviction of them. For completeness, in Scottish cases, Scottish Ministers perform the function of the Secretary of State.

<P>

<a name="30910-40_para26"></a>At first, we believed that the amendment was seeking to remove the reference to a Part 1 warrant in subsection (1)(a) of Clause 181. We tended to jump to the slightly paranoid assumption that that was part of the effort to remove Part 1 from the Bill. But we understand the Opposition's position on that and no doubt we shall return to the matter at another time and place.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para27"></a>I turn to the first point in relation to the drafting. I believe I would be wise not to seek to engage in debate on this issue now but, instead, to say that, in essence, we believe that subsection (1)(a) corresponds to the wording in subsection (1)(b) in respect of a request for a certificate for a person not yet extradited. But we are happy to consider whether the drafting can be improved and we shall take it away with an open mind to see whether that would be helpful.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para28"></a>I turn to the point concerning criteria and whether there is a need to add to them. The criteria in Clause 181(3) are not exhaustive and the Secretary of State can consider any matter. The clause simply requires that he must consider the matters listed in paragraphs (a) to (d). It does not prohibit him from considering other matters.
<P>

<a name="30910-40_para29"></a>To the question of how often competing requests occur, the answer is: very rarely. We should be happy to go back and carry out research if further details would be helpful. In fact, there is nothing in current legislation under the Extradition Act 1989. Therefore, these are new provisions, which seek to lay down some clearer and tighter rules of process. I hope that, with the undertaking that I gave to consider the drafting, my response has been helpful.

<A NAME="30910-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister and am very happy with his reassurance that he will reconsider the wording of Clause 181(1)(a). I am also grateful for his assurance that the list is not exhaustive. I believe that failure to include the date when the offence is committed is a strange omission. The date when the warrant is issued is one thing, but it seems to me that the date of the offence is probably more important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   This may be an issue to which we shall return later. There can be confusion, argument or doubt as to when an offence is committed. There can be circumstances when it is not clear when an offence was committed. We shall return to that matter later. Therefore, the order&#151;that is, when a warrant is made&#151;is a certainty, whereas, in some circumstances, there can be considerable confusion about exactly when an offence occurred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that further comment. I take comfort from the fact that, in any case, the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30910-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   moved Amendment No. 249ZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 184, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-41_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "LEGAL ADVICE, ASSISTANCE AND REPRESENTATION: ENGLAND AND WALES
<br>
In section 12(2) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 (c. 22) (meaning of "criminal proceedings") for paragraph (c) substitute&#151;
<br>
"(c) proceedings for dealing with an individual under the Extradition Act 2003,"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-41_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 249ZA on behalf of my noble friend, I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group&#151;albeit very briefly.
<P>

<a name="30910-41_para5"></a>As the Committee will be aware, the Bill was amended at Report stage in another place to provide that our existing legislation&#151;the Extradition Act 1989 and the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965&#151;will be repealed in their entirety. That has avoided any suggestion of a Henry VIII power, and I am sure that that is welcome to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="30910-41_para6"></a>However, the consequence is that we now need to pick up, and repeal, references to those Acts in other legislation, and that is the purpose of this group of amendments. As I said, I do not want to go into detail but I should probably explain why I shall shortly invite Members of the Committee to remove Clause 190 from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30910-41_para7"></a>Clause 205 repeals the 1965 and 1989 Acts outright. That was not the case when Clause 190 was originally included in the Bill. As consequential amendments to existing legislation are required as a result of Clause 205, the amendments to the International Criminal Court Act 2001 are best addressed, with the other amendments, in the schedule. Paragraph 13 of the new schedule replaces the existing Clause 190 in the Bill, amending Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act. With that explanation, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   These are fairly technical amendments and we should like the chance to read what the Minister said rather than react too extempore. With regard to the question of bringing the definition of "criminal proceedings" within the Access to Justice Act, throughout the Bill we have had a great deal of discussion about access to legal advice and assistance. I believe the overwhelming view on all sides of the Committee has been that we should ensure that the defendant has access to independent legal advice at all stages of the extradition process. It seems to me that, if that is what will now happen, that is a welcome development and obviously it is in line with the ECHR. Therefore, we would support the amendment if that is what it achieved, but perhaps we may have the opportunity to look through what the Minister said.
<P>

<a name="30910-41_para8"></a>Perhaps I may ask the Minister one question in relation to Amendment No. 267B on page 18 of the Marshalled List. This point may be too detailed and the Minister may like to return to it later. In the wording of the amendment which relates to Section 5 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, there is a <P>


<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>substitution under the heading, "Power to apply section 4 to non-convention countries". What caught my eye was Section 5(1), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order direct that section 4 above shall apply in relation to a country".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-41_para9"></a>
Where we have orders on important matters such as this, I should like to know what the implications are. Perhaps the Minister can either provide an explanation&#151;if his officials can give him a briefing now&#151;or write to us. In addition, can he tell us whether the order is to be made under the positive or the negative procedure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My expertise was exhausted after the first sentence of the noble Lord's contribution. I am unhappy to say that I am not sure whether my officials can respond quite that quickly to a very technical point. The noble Lord will recognise that in moving the amendment I sought to assert clearly that this is merely a drafting position. However, I recognise the noble Lord's anxieties and we shall of course write to him so that he is fully reassured on that point.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-42_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is very similar in purpose and drafting to our existing legislation and, in particular, Section 15 of the Extradition Act. What that section does, and what this new clause will do, is to enable the UK to respond to ad hoc extradition requests from countries with which we do not have general extradition arrangements. Such ad hoc requests are very rare indeed, and successful ones even more so. Indeed, to be blunt, we can find no record of a successful ad hoc request.
<P>

<a name="30910-42_para10"></a>The reason for this is that we have extradition agreements with more than 100 countries but the ones with which we do not have them&#151;often for good reasons&#151;are the kinds of country which we believe are unlikely to meet our standards and tests in regard to human rights. Nevertheless, we believe that it is important to preserve the ability to deal with ad hoc requests because they may arrive from countries with which we feel it is possible to agree extradition.
<P>

<a name="30910-42_para11"></a>We also believe that it is useful to have such a provision in our legislation because it may help us in a reciprocal situation where we make a request to another country. There have been occasions when ad hoc requests from us to other countries with which we do not have extradition agreements have been acceded to. Therefore this provision may slightly bear on and assist such a situation. It is for those reasons that we feel it wise to include this provision in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and for the comments that he has made by letter. He commented that he originally thought he would deal with this issue by order, but we entirely support the view that it is better to make explicit provision for it on the face of the Bill. We also support the provision that any ad hoc requests must be accompanied by prima facie evidence.
<P>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-42_para12"></a>As the Minister said both in his letter and this afternoon, such requests are very rare. It would be helpful to know whether the similar provisions in Section 15 of the Extradition Act 1989, to which he referred in his letter, have ever been used. We would be reluctant to support the inclusion of these provisions in the Bill if there is no evidence that they have ever been used. Why accept something merely because it has precedent in legislation?
<P>

<a name="30910-42_para13"></a>The colleagues of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, recently managed to remove three clauses from the Bill by replacing five clauses with two. During the Second Reading debate and in Committee, many noble Lords have spoken graphically about the fact that this legislation is far longer than the legislation it seeks to replace. There is a view that we need to be diligent in cleaning off the barnacles of outdated, unused and irrelevant clauses.

<a name="30910-42_para14"></a>No doubt officials have said to the Minister, "Come on, Minister, put it in. Belt and braces. It is a jolly good idea to have it there. We may need it. You never know", but that is not good enough. We should like to be convinced that the new clause is necessary. For us, good evidence of that would be the fact that the provision has been used to good effect in the past under the existing Section 15 of the Extradition Act.

<A NAME="30910-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Simply on a drafting point, why is a reference to the belief of the Secretary of State in subsection (1) of the proposed new clause? Surely whether arrangements have or have not been made is a question of clearly ascertainable fact. Why do we not simply leave out the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the Secretary of State believes that"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="30910-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I was asked whether the powers under Section 15 of the 1989 Act have ever been used. The answer is yes. An outgoing request to Morocco was successful under this provision in a large fraud case in 1999. Even if that had not been the case I would nevertheless&#151;despite advice from officials&#151;have felt that it was prudent to keep the power given a joint wish for adequate powers to combat international crime.
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para0"></a>As to the word "belief", I suspect the issue turns on its defendability, but I am racking my brains and hoping that an idea comes to me. I am advised that the Secretary of State certifies the arrangements. We shall have to give the matter more thought and more time. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will bear with us. I apologise for not being sufficiently inspired at this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spmin2"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  If I may say so, the noble Lord had an opportunity to do that, and that is why I raised each one separately.

"( ) In the application of the Extradition Act 2003 to Scotland, references to granting bail shall be read as references to admitting to bail."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-43_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment is not a difficult one and does not distort the Bill in any sense at all. I suggest that the context for this amendment is the long-standing habit of United Kingdom Bills riding roughshod over Scottish legal terminology. This is not a devolution issue, but a pre-Union issue that has been running for a while and I believe that we should draw it to a close.
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para9"></a>This is a United Kingdom Bill that focuses on all three legal jurisdictions. There is no reason why we should not get right the terminology for all three, particularly as Clause 194 deals only with bail in Scotland. The amendment clarifies that where the Bill refers to "granting bail", which I believe is the correct expression in England and Wales&#151;it may be in Northern Ireland but I am not qualified to say so&#151;the expression in Scotland is "submitting to bail". The amendment ensures that that expression is recognised by the Bill so that this part of the Bill will read more easily in Scotland. It merely concerns getting right the terminology. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I understand that this point was raised at the very useful meeting held on 21st May <P>


<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the noble Earl, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Anelay and Lady Carnegy. At the end of that meeting my noble friend asked the Scottish Executive officials who were present to consider whether an amendment was necessary to meet the point. Since then we have considered the issue carefully indeed. I am mindful of the modest way in which the noble Earl presents the charge that the legislation often rides roughshod over Scottish sensitivities. I certainly do not want to be a party to that. The amendment is a minor one, but it concerns the correct legal terminology in Scots law for the liberation of a person on bail. The amendment would have the effect that where references are made in the Bill to "granting bail", such reference will be construed in Scotland as references to "admitting a person to bail".
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para10"></a>We do not believe that the amendment is necessary. As we understand it, the Scottish courts would have absolutely no difficulty at all in understanding the term "granting bail". I am advised that the expressions "granting bail" and "admitting a person to bail" are both used in the legislation setting out the law in relation to bail in Scotland. Neither expression is definitive; they are interchangeable. There is certainly no great point of principle here and we do not believe that both references need to be put in the Bill. I hear with the greatest respect the point made by the noble Earl, but in this area I feel that we are discussing a matter that is very acceptable in Scottish courts, so I hope he will not press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   On this occasion, I think that the Government have done extremely well in setting the Bill into Scots law. We had a meeting, which is unprecedented, at which they explained everything and they then wrote to us. I see no offending phrase referring to bail in the wrong way; the noble Earl may have spotted one, but I cannot see it.
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para11"></a>We must give credit where credit is due on the matter. It is not easy to legislate for England and Wales and for Scotland at the same time when so many devolved matters are included. Personally, I very much appreciate what has been done in that respect. I realise that the noble Earl is using the amendment to make an important point which I am sure will come into play in future, but on this occasion, we really cannot pick holes in the way in which the matter has been dealt with. I have been rather disappointed not to have been able to score a single direct hit during the Committee, because I rather enjoy doing that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   And you usually do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I certainly acknowledge the use of the meeting which we had beforehand and hope that that may become part of the more normal format for legislation. The Minister's answer only heightens for me the corrupting effect that UK legislation has had on Scottish legislation. I agree that as in both Scotland and England we all attempt to speak English, we can of course understand the difference between granting bail and admitting to bail.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para12"></a>I am unhappy with the Minister's answer. I draw his attention to the corrupting effect in Scotland which has led to our appearing to have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proven. The origins of that in Scotland are that, historically, cases were either proven or not proven. But juries then started coming in with the English words "not guilty", which was not the correct terminology. So we have ended up with an unsatisfactory situation. Based on the corrupting effect of that, I should have liked the correct terminology to be used. However, we are in Grand Committee, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-43_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 251:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 110, line 2, leave out "with specified modifications"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-43_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30910-43_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: I tabled this probing amendment and asked for a stand part debate on Clause 197 at the same time in order to elicit a little more detail from the Ministers on the provisions and effect of the clause. Clause 197, entitled:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Extradition for more than one offence",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-43_para19"></a>
is remarkably brief. I am concerned&#151;I think I have cause to be&#151;that in only four lines, the Secretary of State is given power by order subject to the negative procedure to modify the provisions of the Bill in relation to a extradition requests for more than one offence. The Explanatory Notes are hardly more helpful or explanatory, because they consist of only three lines. They give no comprehensible explanation of what is intended.
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para20"></a>At first glance, it seemed to me that there was a dangerously fine line between providing for modifications for multiple offences and overriding the speciality rule, which we have discussed at great length during various debates in Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, mentioned the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. I was heartened by its comments when it stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This clause allows the Secretary of State to modify the provisions of the Bill in cases where there is more than one offence for which extradition is requested. The extradition procedure will be the same as it is set out in the Bill. There will be a procedure for accommodating multiple requests which will be laid out in the order. It is possible for an extradition request to be submitted for multiple offences and provision should be made for that. An order made under this power will be subject to the negative resolution procedure by virtue of Clause 209(5). This is felt to be the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny given the technical nature of this provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-43_para21"></a><P>

<a name="30910-43_para22"></a>I take it, then, that the purpose of the clause is to allow for one extradition request to be made for someone accused of multiple offences committed at the same time. It would clearly be nonsense for five individual requests to be made for a number of offences committed simultaneously on one occasion. It would be helpful for the Committee if the Minister would clarify what form those "specified modifications" might take. That is why I tabled <P>


<a name="column_GC27"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendment No. 251 on a probing basis. The clause would benefit from some proper explanation. The Minister may be able to give us some examples in which the clause would be necessary.
<P>

<a name="30910-43_para23"></a>Finally, as far as I can see, the European arrest warrant makes no provision for such circumstances. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister knows of any other countries that have adopted or proposed similar provisions in their domestic legislation. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for tabling this probing amendment; I understand the need for it and its purpose. I also thank all Members on the Opposition Front Bench for their co-operation on groupings today, which has allowed us to hold this debate together with that on clause stand part.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para0"></a>It is not uncommon for extradition requests to cover more than one offence. A person who has robbed one bank may well have robbed two. Although those are separate charges, the requesting state will want to put the person on trial for all of them at once. So the extradition request we receive may well cover more than one offence.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para1"></a>In the vast majority of cases, all the offences in the request will succeed or fail together. For example, if we judge that a person is unlikely to get a fair trial, that is likely to cover offences A, B and C, rather than just one of them. If we think that a person's state of health is a bar on his extradition, that will apply to all the offences rather than only to one.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para2"></a>However, it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which one offence on a request is extraditable and another is not. For example, one offence could be covered by the double jeopardy bar even if the other was not. It is precisely to cover this situation&#151;rare though it may be&#151;that we need Clause 197 and the ability to apply the provisions of the Bill with "specified modifications" to make it workable.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para3"></a>Indeed, the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform was concerned about the use of the phrase "specified modifications" in Clause 210 and suggested that the Government should provide a fuller justification, which I am happy to do today. However, the Committee made no comment or criticism about Clause 197&#151;that applies to both its wording and the order-making power it contains.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para4"></a>Perhaps I should set out in broad terms how we envisage the system working in cases where a request covers more than one offence. In cases where all the offences either succeed or fail, the Bill can apply without any modification, except possibly very minor linguistic ones.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para5"></a>We are concerned with where one or more offences are thrown out at some point in the process while others survive. A number of principles then apply. The first is that the person should not be extradited until all the legal proceedings in respect of all the offences have been completed. What is the effect of that? Imagine a person's extradition has been sought in respect of two offences. The judge orders extradition in respect of <P>


<a name="column_GC28"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>offence A and the person decides not to appeal. However, the judge decides that extradition is barred in respect of offence B and the requesting state decides that it wants to appeal. In such circumstances the person should not be extradited for offence A&#151;although there is strictly speaking no legal impediment to doing so&#151;until a final decision has been reached in respect of offence B.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para6"></a>There are two reasons for that. First, we think it important that at the time when a person is actually handed over, it is clear to all concerned the totality of the offences for which the extradition is taking place. That of course is made particularly important because of the existence of the rule of speciality. As the Committee knows by now, that rule is a long-standing feature of extradition and provides that a person cannot be tried for an offence other than the one for which he was extradited. That being so, we need something in the Bill that enables us to deal with an incoming extradition request which is concerned with more than one offence. That is the purpose of the clause.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para7"></a>The second reason for not extraditing the person, even though it was cleared to do so on the first offence, is that it is desirable for the person to be present at the hearing in respect of offence B. So the second principle is to preserve the notion, which the Bill enshrines, that there should be a single appeal hearing rather than the many that we have under the present system.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para8"></a>Again, let me set out what that means in practice. Imagine that a request covers four offences, just to make life really complicated. The judge may decide that extradition is barred for offence A because of double jeopardy; he may decide that extradition is barred for offence B because of the passage of time since the offence occurred; however, he may order extradition in respect of offences C and D.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para9"></a>In that situation, the requesting state may want to appeal against the judge's decision in respect of offences A and B while the fugitive may want to appeal against the decision to order extradition in respect of offences C and D. We therefore envisage a single appeal hearing before the High Court where each side can argue about the particular decisions that went against it.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para10"></a>In Part 2 cases where the matter has had to be considered by the Secretary of State, this single appeal will be held after the Secretary of State's consideration so that the decisions that he has taken can also, if necessary, be subject to appeal.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para11"></a>That is broadly how we envisage the system operating. As I hope is appreciated, so far as is possible we have sought to preserve the essential features of the extradition system as provided for in the Bill. Equally, however, we need some modifications to cover the situation where a request contains offences which meet a different fate. Although that explanation has been extremely long, I hope that is has been helpful.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para12"></a>The modifications also allow one offence to be withdrawn or discharged without affecting other offences contained in the same Part 1 warrant or Part 2 request. The amendments are therefore technical. <P>


<a name="column_GC29"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Some EU states will issue Part 1 warrants for more than one offence; others will not. All states will therefore need to be able to accommodate a request for more than one offence and each state will do so in its own way. I do not yet know how they have sought to do that in practice.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para13"></a>I apologise for speaking at length. I hope that my explanation has been helpful.

<a name="30910-44_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30910-44_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: On the next amendment, we shall have to engage in an important debate about the scope of Clause 198. I shall not seek to pre-empt that discussion. Let me say that we all recognise that there needs to be protection when issues of national security are at stake whatever view we may take about how much wider we should go, if at all. We need to be able to protect those who are employed by the security and intelligence agencies as they undertake their work to protect national security.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para19"></a>However, we also need to recognise that, on occasion, the people involved will not be direct employees of the agency but people working on its behalf. Such people also need to be protected when carrying out lawful acts operating on behalf of the security services. That is the purpose and effect of the amendment. I therefore hope that the Committee will agree to it. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-44_para21"></a><P>

<a name="30910-44_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: As the Minister said, Amendments Nos. 252, 253 and 254, which are grouped, relate to the use of the term "national security" in Clause 198. That was extensively debated in Committee in another place. We should like to raise it again this afternoon but in a slightly different form <P>


<a name="column_GC30"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from that in which it was debated at the other end of the building. The wording used in our amendments comes directly from two statutory sources that already use the concept of national security. The wording in Amendment No. 252 comes from the Security Service Act 1989 and that in Amendments Nos. 253 and 254 from the Intelligence Services Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para23"></a>Amendment No. 252 seeks to insert after the words "national security" almost exactly the same words that appear in Section 1(2) of the Security Service Act 1989 after the words "including, in particular". We seek clarification from the Government of what they understand by the term "national security". I anticipate that the Minister will respond to that question by saying that "national security" means "national security", but as the 1989 Act includes similar words to amplify the meaning of the words "national security", I should be grateful for reassurance from the Government that they believe that all the issues raised by the wording of Amendment No. 252 are already covered by the broad term, "national security", namely:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the protection of the United Kingdom . . .  from espionage, terrorism and sabotage, from the activities of agents of foreign powers and from actions intended to . . .  undermine parliamentary democracy . . .  and the safeguarding of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-44_para24"></a><P>

<a name="30910-44_para25"></a>Amendments Nos. 253 and 254 seek to insert two criteria additional to national security to trigger the operation of Clause 198: namely, the economic well-being of the United Kingdom and the prevention and detection of serious crime. These amendments replicate Section 1(2)(b) and (c) of the Intelligence Services Act 1994, which set out the grounds on which the intelligence services may operate. We have tabled them simply because in that Act the intelligence services are given three alternative grounds on which they may operate: namely, national security in Section 1(2)(a) and the grounds in Amendments Nos. 253 and 254.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para26"></a>The question for the Government is, therefore, if the term "national security" is the sole ground for the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers under Clause 198, are the other two criteria excluded? As I said, they are given as alternatives in the 1994 Act. I therefore take it that they fall outside the term "national security", at least as far as that Act is concerned, or they would not need to be separately specified. If I am right in that assertion and the position is as I have described, have the Government intentionally excluded them from Clause 198 even though they are closely related to the concept of national security, given the wording of the Intelligence Services Act 1994?
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para27"></a>I should especially welcome the Minister's comments on why the Government have not chosen to include the words specified in Amendment No. 254: namely, "the prevention or detection of serious crime". The Minister has reminded us about that several times. Indeed, during an earlier debate this afternoon, a 1999 fraud case involving Morocco was mentioned.
<P>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para28"></a>In relation to the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, will the Government make clear whether they think that that is already covered by the term "national security"? I note that the wording of Section 1(2) of the 1989 Act that I cited appears to imply that national security includes economic well-being, whereas the 1994 Act gives economic well-being as an alternative to the concept of national security. Plainly the two are closely related, but the Committee would welcome clarification of the Government's position.
<P>

<a name="30910-44_para29"></a>I have no doubt that the Government have already considered those points and that the Minister will have the answers to hand and be able to reassure the Committee about these important issues. I look forward to hearing his response. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30910-45_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for the clarity with which he spoke to his probing amendment and hope that I can be equally clear in my response. Although I may occasionally be slightly more reticent, given the nature of some of the national security issues on which we are touching, I hope that I shall not be unduly so. Let me first address Amendment No. 252 and then the wider questions raised by Amendments Nos. 253 and 254.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para0"></a>Clause 198 essentially allows the Secretary of State to intervene in any extradition case in Parts 1 or 2 to prevent extradition taking place. He can do so only if a person was acting pursuant to a statutory function or acting following an authorisation from the Secretary of State. We are here discussing where the conduct that forms the extradition request was being carried out in pursuance of one of the statutory functions conferred on the security and intelligence agencies themselves. Additionally, if the Secretary of State wants to intervene to halt the extradition process, he must decide that extradition would be contrary to the interests of national security. So in a sense there are two tests.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para1"></a>Amendment No. 252 would amplify what is included in the term "national security" and make an addition about economic well-being. As the noble Lord said, the definition comes from an amalgamation of subsections 1(2) and (3) of the Security Service Act 1989. The question is whether it is necessary and appropriate to include that clarification. My first point is that the 1989 Act was breaking new ground, so no doubt the Government of the day thought it useful to illustrate what the term "national security" included, but in no way was that illustration exhaustive nor, importantly, was there any intention to define or limit the term "national security". The description was illustrative, not definitive. Subsequent legislation that employs the term "national security", notably the Intelligence Services Act 1994, has not included that amplification.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para2"></a>More broadly, as I think the noble Lord suggested, we have always felt that national security is something that one recognises when one sees it&#151;which leads us into a tautological situation. Under the Bill, it is the Secretary of State who determines whether national security issues are raised by an extradition request. I <P>


<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggest that the Secretary of State is well-placed to perform that task without the need for further clarification or embellishment. The present formulation gives the Secretary of State the broadest possible discretion, a margin of discretion recognised by both domestic and European courts. There are good reasons for that, and we should be unwise to disturb it. I think that answers the specific question: are we fettering ourselves in any way by not including more specific detail? The answer is no.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I think I had spoken to Amendment No. 252 and was just about to start on Amendments Nos. 253 and 254.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para4"></a>The Security Service Act 1989, as amended by the Security Service Act 1996, and the Intelligence Services Act 1994 gives the intelligence agencies three statutory functions, broadly summarised as protecting national security, safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom and supporting the prevention and detection of serious crime.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para5"></a>These amendments seek to extend Clause 198 to cover cases in which an extradition would be contrary to the interests of the United Kingdom's economic well-being or the fight against serious crime. We contend that since Section 7 of the 1994 Act, which is concerned with the agencies' operations abroad, covers all three of the statutory functions, the amendments do not appear to be necessary. The reason for this is that the methodology, operating techniques, personnel and resources employed by the agencies are common to each of their statutory functions.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para6"></a>Revelations about their economic well-being or serious crime work would, therefore, inevitably damage the work which they do to protect national security and therefore could endanger national security itself. So it would be perfectly possible for the Secretary of State to take the view that it would be contrary to the interests of national security to prevent anyone connected with the work of the agencies being questioned in a foreign jurisdiction. This would therefore allow him to intervene in any case where we receive an extradition request which relates to any of the activities of the agencies, even if the activity was in connection with the economic well-being or serious crime function. I think that goes to the heart of the purpose of the probing amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para7"></a>This would be the case under the Bill as it is currently drafted, which is why, as I have said, we believe the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para8"></a>I can assure the Committee that the Government are very conscious of the need to safeguard the work of the security and intelligence agencies and, in particular, to ensure that those acting on behalf of the agencies do not inadvertently find themselves subject to extradition processes.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para9"></a>Clause 198 has been very carefully drafted to ensure that it offers protection to the agencies and those working on their behalf. We are satisfied that it offers <P>


<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the requisite degree of protection for all the activities which the agencies are permitted to engage in. No doubt your Lordships will infer from that that it will be after the fullest internal consultations.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para10"></a>I hope, therefore, on the basis of what I have said, that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, will feel reassured that the important issues he raised in his probing amendments are adequately covered by existing legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-45_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said because we are all pulling on the rope in the same direction. He talks about the danger of exposure, the inadvertent risks&#151;exactly the matters that we are trying to get at. That having been said, I am not sure whether what was in the response quite answered the points we made.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para11"></a>The Minister said that it would be a mistake to accept Amendment No. 252 because as the existing provisions were not exhaustive and there was no fettering in the existing provisions, Amendment No. 252 therefore represented a restriction rather than a freedom. But our amendment contains the words "including, in particular". It is not meant to be exhaustive, but focused. I am not sure that the Minister's response went to the heart of that matter.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para12"></a>The Bill will give additional clarity about economic well-being and prevention of financial crime. However, I am not clear why mentioning those matters in the Bill, as suggested in Amendments Nos. 253 and 254, would lead to the dangers of exposure or inadvertent risk. They would make it clear beyond peradventure that the Secretary of State has powers to act in the full definition of existing legislation, the 1994 Act.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para13"></a>I accept that the Minister gave a long and helpful reply; I accept that what he was aiming at was what we were aiming at. I would like to read through what he said and consider it further. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "ARTICLE 95 ALERTS: TRANSITIONAL PROVISION
<br>
(1) This section applies in a case where an article 95 alert is issued before 1 January 2004 by an authority of a category 1 territory.
<br>
(2) In such a case, this Act applies as if&#151;

<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(3) As applied by subsection (2), this Act has effect with these modifications&#151;
<br>
(a) in sections 2(7) and (8), 28(1), 30(1) and (4)(d), 32(2)(b), 33(6)(b), 35(4)(b), 36(3)(b), 46(3)(b) and 48(3)(b), for "authority which issued the Part 1 warrant" substitute "authority at the request of which the alert was issued";
<br>
(b) omit section 5;
<br>
(c) in sections 33(4)(b), 41(2)(a), 42(2)(a) and (4) and 60(1)(d) and (e), for "authority which issued the warrant" substitute "authority at the request of which the alert was issued";
<br>
(d) in section 65(2), for the words from "believes" to the end substitute "believes is the authority at the request of which the alert was issued".
<br>
(4) An article 95 alert is an alert issued pursuant to article 95 of the Convention implementing the Schengen agreement of 14th June 1985."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-45_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment gives effect to a commitment we made previously in the Bill. At our third meeting on the 18th June, the Committee agreed to remove Clause 211 from the Bill, and we were grateful for that co-operation. The reason we asked the Committee to do so was because Clause 211 was a transitional provision, relating to pre-existing alerts on the Schengen information system, or SIS. We took the view that, on reflection, it would be better to have a free-standing provision for that purpose. That is why we have tabled this amendment to replace that clause.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para20"></a>The reason we think we need a special provision is that while requests on the SIS require there to be a previous judicially issued domestic warrant, they may, on rare occasions, be placed on the SIS at the instigation of police officers. We therefore wanted to forestall arguments as to whether such warrants had come from a judicial source. Our view is that they do, but your Lordships can imagine all the legal fun and games that could be had on this point.
<P>

<a name="30910-45_para21"></a>The new clause is very limited in its scope. It applies only to alerts issued under Article 95 of the Schengen Convention and only to those issued before 1st January 2004. The Committee will recognise that this is purely a short-term measure, since the problem will not arise once the EAW is in operation. On that basis I hope that, as before, the Committee will support the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30910-46_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for this explanation. We appreciate the problems that may occur during the transitional period in relation to pre-existing alerts on the SIS system. We also appreciate that, as with any new system, it is important to have special arrangements during the transitional period until all outstanding requests from the old system have been dealt with.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para0"></a>I hope, however, that the Minister does not think that we have actually dealt with commencement in this amendment. There are more issues to be dealt with, and we will come to those in Amendment No. 257, which will be spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. With that proviso, we are happy that this is a short-term measure to provide some meshing between the old and the new system, and we are content.

<P>
<A NAME="30910-46_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 255:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 200, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-46_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPATIBILITY WITH CRIME (INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION) ACT 2003
<br>
 The Secretary of State shall certify that the provisions of this Act are compatible with the provisions of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-46_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 255 inserts a new clause concerning compatibility with the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003. It is designed to ensure that there is compatibility between the provisions of that legislation, which is being debated in another place, and the Extradition Bill, which we are debating here today.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para4"></a>My noble friend Lady Anelay already raised the issue when debating the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill in your Lordships' House earlier this year. There was an extensive debate on the 3rd February in col. 41 of Hansard. At that time, my noble friend tried to delay the commencement of the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill until the Extradition Bill had come into effect. In answer, the Minister suggested that delaying commencement was not the right way to go about things since the two Bills dealt with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"entirely different circumstances and powers"".&#151;[Official Report, 3/2/03; col. GC41.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-46_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30910-46_para6"></a>The same point was raised on the 21st January in another place during a Committee debate on an amendment to the Extradition Bill. We have used the same wording of that amendment in our Amendment No. 255. The wording meets the Government's point about not imposing linked commencement dates for either Act but requires the Secretary of State to certify that the two are compatible.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para7"></a>I share the unease of my noble friend Lady Anelay at the response of the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, that the powers in the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill and the Extradition Bill are unconnected. We are agreed, I think, that only British law enforcement personnel can make an arrest following a European arrest warrant. The Minister has been adamant on this point on several occasions during our debate, although we have at times been less convinced that the actual drafting of the Bill reflected this intention. However, that is an issue we have been over before and to which we will no doubt return.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para8"></a>As I understand it, the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill is concerned only with surveillance by foreign police for up to five hours when following a suspect across a border in hot pursuit. It is this that gives rise to concerns about the compatibility of these two pieces of legislation. The two sets of provisions are slightly at cross purposes in their interaction. For example, presumably French police can pursue a suspect for surveillance purposes for up to five hours, but if at that point they feel they have sufficient grounds for an arrest for the purposes of prosecuting the suspect, they presumably have to withdraw, and the process for issuing a European arrest warrant to the UK must then be started. That might take some time and then must presumably be handed over <P>


<a name="column_GC36"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>entirely to British police to enforce. Perhaps the Minister could explain to the Committee if this is how he sees the two pieces of legislation meshing together and operating.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para9"></a>In answer to the amendment put forward in another place, the Minister, Mr. Ainsworth, said that both Bills were in Parliament at the same time. He said that the Government had obligations that they had entered into that they must try to enact in a reasonable period of time. However, they wanted to ensure that both Bills went into Parliament at the same time so that nothing would be hidden.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para10"></a>Of course I accept that this was the Minister's intention, but it is probably confusing rather than enlightening for both Bills to be debated before two Houses of Parliament at the same time because both parts of the machinery are moving around and being changed. In the interests of clarity, it would have been helpful to have included a positive obligation on the Secretary of State to ensure compatibility.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para11"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will, in his courteous way, dismiss the amendment, as was done in another place, and give us an assurance on the record as to the compatibility, which he will deem to be a sufficient guarantee. Both Bills are about foreign jurisdictions pursuing suspects who have fled to our country. One is about surveillance by foreign officers for a limited period; the other about the arrest of suspects by our officers. I believe it is important to have this debate at this stage of the Bill; we would all benefit from a more detailed clarification about the interaction of the two Bills. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30910-46_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful for the way in which the noble Lord presented the case before the adjournment, and I hope that I can give him some reassurance about the matter. He referred to the debate in another place, where the focus was on an anxiety about foreign police officers coming to this country to make arrests using European arrest warrants. I am glad to say that a government amendment on Report assuaged those anxieties.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para13"></a>It remains the case that we have never intended to extend any coercive powers such as the power of arrest to anyone other than those who already enforce the law in this country. I am pleased to say that this aspect of the matter ought therefore not to trouble the Committee today. I would like to add my gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her acknowledgement of that, putting the question beyond any doubt. I am glad that we have been able to make progress in Committee on that understanding.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para14"></a>Given that it is understood in Committee that the two Bills, when read in tandem, do not and cannot represent that thin end of the wedge that would see foreign police officers arresting people on these shores, I am a little puzzled as to why the amendment has been moved. After all, Acts of Parliament are necessarily compatible with each other. Any later legislation would amend that which preceded it, were there to be any incompatibility.
<P>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para15"></a>Of course, as the noble Lord indicated, I cannot say at this stage which Bill will receive Royal Assent first. Those questions are matters for the business managers as the two Bills proceed through both Houses of Parliament. I can say that, whatever way round it is, the two Acts will indeed be compatible. Such are the burdens on parliamentary time that we all have to deal with various pieces of legislation that are being processed through these buildings at one and the same time. Nevertheless, the Government are mindful of that and the need to ensure that no Bill contradicts or counteracts another. That does not mean that every Bill in any way connected to another debated during the same Session contains a clause such as that sought in the amendment. That clearly would be excessive. We believe that it is superfluous in the Bill. If it were necessary here, we would have to put it into a number of Acts where consideration was carrying on in parallel in any parliamentary Session.
<P>

<a name="30910-46_para16"></a>I assure the Committee that provisions of the two Bills will be compatible, as will all other Bills that have been passed or are passing through Parliament this Session. We do not believe that there is any need to set a precedent here by asserting that fact in the Bill. I recognise the anxieties. However, the Committee has made progress on the recognition of the broad intent of the Government behind the measures and the fact that we are not seeking to extend coercive powers. I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that it would not be appropriate for us to make the amendment to the Bill. With those assurances, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-46_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Of course Bills have to be compatible, and my noble friend was merely trying to make sure that that was the case. However, can the Government assure us that there is no circumstance in which a person could use the powers in one Bill for the purposes of the other? That seems the question that really has to be asked. Having taken part in debates on both Bills, one realises that they are in a sense about the same subject. I cannot give an example, but that is my anxiety, because we are dealing with concepts unfamiliar to us and taking into account the various international arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-46_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I would not have made my earlier remarks if they did not give the obvious intent that that assurance should be able to be given. The noble Baroness has asked quite specifically for it, but I am not really in the right position. We will reflect on that representation and look very carefully at the matter. We have time, with regard to the Bill, and will be able to respond. She will recognise that my request that the amendment be withdrawn is against the background that such an assurance could be given.

<A NAME="30910-47_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </B>   moved Amendment No. 256:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 200, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-47_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ANNUAL REPORT
<br>
 The Secretary of State shall publish, and lay before both Houses of Parliament, an annual report on the operation of this legislation."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-47_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment takes us back over further familiar ground, which is the provision of an annual report on the operation of the legislation. The purpose of the amendment is perfectly straightforward. The Bill is a new and supposedly streamlined piece of legislation that, in effect, is a root-and-branch overhaul of our existing extradition system. We have, for the first time, a situation where our extradition partners are divided into two categories, with very different procedures for each. Moreover, in the case of category 1 territories, we have an added complication in that Part 1 implements the framework agreement on the European arrest warrant and brings it into our domestic legislation.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para4"></a>It is fair to say, however, that during the Committee it has become clear that our category 1 partners may choose to implement the same framework agreement in their own domestic legislation slightly differently. We may find ourselves in the situation where we agree to the framework decision but discover that our standards&#151;for example, in terms of the one-year/three-year argument for dual criminality&#151;are different. That is both confusing and problematic.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para5"></a>Alternatively, I have to accept that we may find, contrary to the concerns of those of us on these Benches, that the new extradition arrangements are efficient and highly satisfactory and do not give rise to public controversy. Whatever way the cookie crumbles, we are embarking on a new policy on the sort of co-operation on&#151;one might say the beginnings of an attempted harmonisation of&#151;judicial decisions within Europe of which we have not seen the like before. In addition, as we have mentioned and will mention again in a moment, there are important issues about transitional arrangements and the integration of the old and new systems of extradition.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para6"></a>In the light of those important considerations, I do not think it too much to ask the Secretary of State that an annual report be prepared on the operation of this legislation and laid before Parliament. However, I am not so naive as to fail to anticipate what the Minister's reply will be&#151;that the Secretary of State is always accountable before Parliament for any legislation <P>


<a name="column_GC39"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stemming from his department, and that at any time he can be called to account by parliamentary Question or other means to comment on the operation of this extradition legislation or indeed any other legislation. We all know that that is true in theory and indeed practice, but if there is no positive obligation, defects in the operation of the Bill may slip through the net.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para7"></a>I understand why the Government may have some hostility to the amendment. We were talking about compatibility a minute ago and it could be argued that, if we included an annual report for the Bill, on every other piece of legislation in future there would be calls for an annual report using the Extradition Act 2003, assuming it becomes that, as a precedent. There are Members on our Benches who believe that the Sexual Offences Bill and what is now the Licensing Act deserved an annual report for similar reasons.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para8"></a>It could be argued, however&#151;and I do argue&#151;that in the special circumstances of this Bill, incorporating this particular piece of European legislation into our domestic law for the first time, an annual report would be one way in which the Government could make some positive move to alleviate the very real fears and concerns that abound, particularly in respect of the operations of Part 1 and how the proposed legislation would work in practice. It would be helpful. It might even be possible to do it for a few years, perhaps four or five, while the legislation was settling down.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para9"></a>Given the importance and the groundbreaking nature of the European arrest warrant, there is enough here for us to have some special report on the operation of the Bill, at least for the first few years. I beg to move.

It would be a matter of great interest to see whether the simplified Part 1 procedure led to a substantial increase in the number of extraditions and, if so, to which countries. It would also be very interesting to see whether the average time for extradition proceedings was reduced, as is the intention of the Bill. There are other matters that would also be of interest.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para10"></a>Having said that, speaking for myself and I hope for those on our Benches, we would be content with an undertaking to put that information into the annual report of the Home Office, or possibly into the judicial statistics. I would be satisfied with an undertaking that the material information on the progress of the then Act would be published, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for a period of years&#151;at least until it has bedded down. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-47_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I feel again that it is a shame that my noble friend Lord Bassam is not with us today but is downstairs, because this is his territory. In a sense, to <P>


<a name="column_GC40"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>show the danger of his not being present to deal with questions on annual reports, I shall say something slightly different from what he normally says.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para11"></a>The Committee would expect me to say, as signalled by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that we are resistant to a formal annual report. It has not been the tradition that even major and contentious legislation has had annual reports. An annual report could not cover some of the issues that might be of interest as to whether cases could have been resolved differently under the old system, as that could be only speculation, and it could not indicate what effect the absence of the Secretary of State's role had in Part 1, as that again would be pure conjecture.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para12"></a>The argument given in the past against annual reports is that for ever and a day one sets up a bureaucratic commitment and costs that lead to more paper being produced and consumed, and that is why the Liberal Democrats have often supported us on the matter. We also say on such occasions that, clearly, there is a retinue of mechanisms&#151;Starred Questions, Unstarred Questions, PQs and debates&#151;that allows proper scrutiny of the Government on such issues.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para13"></a>Having said all that, I think it would not be unhelpful if, after a period that allows enough cases through the system to make some analysis and reflection possible, one put into the public domain some of the monitoring information that we will undertake. I do not know quite what the period would be; there must be time to allow enough through the system, so I do not want to give a commitment by saying, "After one year", or, "After 18 months". That might be foolish. Am I going to be told to resign? No.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para14"></a>The information that I mean is on the operation of the legislation, particularly in relation to the number of requests received, the operation of time limits in the Bill, especially in Part 1, and the numbers extradited and discharged. There could be an analysis in some form of the time taken from request to fulfilment for both incoming and outgoing requests for Part 1 and Part 2 cases, because that goes to the heart of some of the issues about which we have talked. Officials are considering what additional categories of information they will gather, and how that can best be achieved.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para15"></a>I am happy to give a commitment that we will cover that information&#151;we may go a little further if it seems sensible&#151;on the operation of the Act after a period with the intention of putting it before Parliament if it so wishes to use it. I do not want to commit to doing that every three years, because that takes us back to the same trap from which we are trying to escape, but it would not hurt for us to find a mechanism for putting the information into the public domain. How to do that&#151;whether through a PQ or the annual report&#151;is a second-order issue on which we can reflect.
<P>

<a name="30910-47_para16"></a>I do not wish that to be seen as precedental. I recognise the strength of feeling on the issue. Because of that concern, I am happy to say that in this circumstance we will be pleased to put into the domain, in a suitable form and after a suitable period, the sort of information about which I have talked. <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30910-48_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for his practical contribution in support of what we are trying to achieve. The Government set some very ambitious objectives for the Bill, on Second Reading here and in the other place, as to how we would radically transform the extradition procedure and the reasons for doing so. It is not unreasonable for us to see to what extent we have achieved those objectives. The noble Lord's points about simplicity, time and so on are issues well worth pursuing.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para0"></a>My second point is that the Minister has said several times during our debates that there is a balance between what we get and what we give up. We want to be able to check that the balance is maintained. Of course there are worthwhile objectives in the legislation that we should pursue, but we are giving some things up as a result&#151;that is in the order of things&#151;and we want to make sure that the balance works properly.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para1"></a>Thirdly, the Minister talked about cost implications and said that something should not go on for ever and a day. I said at the end of my remarks that the report was not meant to be for ever and a day. I can see how the provisions would bed down and the report would then drop away once we had some confidence in how the system was operating. That said, he was kind enough to offer half a loaf&#151;perhaps a quarter of a loaf, or a slice or two&#151;and on that basis, and promising that I will not quote his words to him, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30910-48_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) This Act shall only apply to requests relating to acts committed after 7th August 2002."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30910-48_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: For the first and only time today, I have moved an amendment. I am afraid that I have to start with an apology. It is entirely my fault that the drafting of the amendment is defective. It was intended to read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"( ) Sections 63(2) and 64(2) of this Act shall only apply to requests relating to acts committed after 7th August 2002".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-48_para10"></a>
Sections 63(2) and 64(2) are, of course, the subsections that apply the abolition of the dual criminality rule for the 32 listed offences. I have notified the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, of the intended <P>


<a name="column_GC42"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wording, and I hope that I will be excused. I have discussed it with the Bill Office, which says that given that this is a Grand Committee it is not necessary to table a manuscript amendment.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para11"></a>We believe that it is wrong in principle to allow extradition for an offence that was not extraditable when it was committed because of the absence of dual criminality, which was a requirement at that time but had subsequently ceased to be a requirement. Under Article 32 of the framework decision, the European arrest warrant is required to come into force on 1st January 2004. However, Article 32 provided that, at the time of the adoption of the framework decision by the Council in June 2002, any member state might make a statement indicating that it would continue to deal with requests relating to acts committed before a specified date in accordance with the extradition systems applicable before 1st January 2004. The specified date had to be not later than 7th August 2002.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para12"></a>Had the United Kingdom made a statement in June 2002 to that effect, therefore, the result would have been that the dual criminality rule would have continued to apply to offences on the list if committed before 7th August 2002. So far as I am aware, the United Kingdom did not make such a statement and it is now too late to make it. I strongly believe that the Government should have made such a statement. I would have had no objection to backdating the restriction to the 7th August 2002, which is the latest date up to which such a restriction could have been applied. By that date the framework decision had already been adopted, so any offenders, if they chose to take legal advice on this, could have been on notice of a prospective change in the law. Of course, that principle does not apply to offences committed before the date of the adoption in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para13"></a>Given the failure to make the statement, I recognise that the amendment is now inconsistent with the framework decision and I realise that the Government will not be willing to accept it. Nevertheless I move the amendment as I believe that this is an issue on which the Government should have taken action. Retrospective legislation creating a new criminal offence, of course, is forbidden by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The retrospective extension of the power to extradite is not itself a breach of Article 7, but in my view it comes pretty close to it. For that reason I regret that the Government have not taken the option offered to them by Article 32 of the framework decision. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-48_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   In this group we have Amendments Nos. 259 and 260. We have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Having just been told <P>


<a name="column_GC43"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about the change when I arrived this afternoon, I am not sure that I have understood the full import of it all, but as he explained it, it seemed to have a good deal to commend it.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 259 and 260 would require that any commencement order made by the Secretary of State that applied the provisions of the Bill to extradition proceedings which had already been commenced under the Extradition Act 1989 should be approved under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para16"></a>In essence, the amendments seek clarification from the Government on the way in which they propose to manage the transition from the procedures set out by Parliament in the Extradition Act 1989 to those that are in the Bill. Will extradition proceedings that have already started when the Act comes into force continue under the provisions of the 1989 Act, or will the provisions of this Bill be applied to such proceedings in any way, with or without modifications? Do the Government propose any kind of specified cut-off date, as envisaged in Amendment No. 257, and will that be in relation to the date on which extradition proceedings commenced or to the date on which the extradition offence was alleged to have been committed?
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para17"></a>We do not seem to be able to find any provisions in the Bill setting out the arrangements that will govern this transitional period other than the traditional Henry VIII provision that orders made by the Secretary of State, including commencement orders, may,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"include supplementary, incidental, saving or transitional provisions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-48_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30910-48_para19"></a>The Minister will be aware that this is not always the case, and that the Government often set out on the face of Bills, in some detail, the way in which they intend transitional arrangements to operate. For example, Schedule 18 of the Criminal Justice Bill, which we are currently discussing, sets out the transitional arrangements that will apply when the new sentencing regime for murder is introduced. Given that extradition law and procedures can be quite complex, even the streamlined procedures introduced by the Bill&#151;the operation of the European arrest warrant is potentially controversial, particularly until the procedure has bedded down&#151;can the Minister explain to the Committee why the Government do not appear to have placed any such clear transitional provisions on the face of the Bill? I hope that the Minister will be able to provide clarification on those points as well as dealing with the important point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-48_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall do my best, but I do not believe that it will necessarily be easy, given the complexity of some of these issues. If I do not fully satisfy both Opposition Front Benches, my noble friend Lady Scotland will have an opportunity at a later stage in the passage of the Bill when I am no longer here.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para20"></a>The amendments are concerned with the important question of to which particular cases the new arrangements, for which the Bill provides, should <P>


<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>apply. Clearly, the new legislation should apply to all requests received after the point when the new Act is brought into force. There is a slight gloss on that to which I shall return shortly.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para21"></a>So if the new Act comes into force on 1st January 2004, for example, a request received on 31st December 2003 will be handled under the 1989 Act procedures while a request received on 2nd January 2004 will be handled under the new procedures. We think it is much better, and less confusing, that the procedures to be used should be determined by when the request was made rather than by reference to when the alleged offence took place, as I trailed earlier in our discussions.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para22"></a>The reason for that is that it is not always apparent at precisely what point an offence was committed. Earlier I referred to a new Act coming into force on 1st January. Imagine that a person has gone away for a few days over New Year and comes back to find that his house has been burgled. In those circumstances it might not be clear whether the crime had taken place on or before 31st December or after 1st January, in which case the new procedures would apply. Similarly, a complicated fraud case might straddle the cut off date. The other difficulty with determining what procedures should be used by virtue of the date of the offence is that we may get requests many years after the event.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para23"></a>The amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, provides that Sections 63(2) and 64(2) of the new Act's procedures will apply only to acts committed after 7th August 2002, although we had not spotted the significance of that date about which he enlightened us. We understand that the effect of this amendment would be that someone wanted for a "list" offence in another EU country could not be extradited where the conduct occurred prior to 7th August 2002 and where the dual criminality test is not met.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para24"></a>I appreciate the position from which the noble Lord proposes this amendment and his concern for the rights of those who are the subjects of extradition requests. However, the fundamental principle remains that, regardless of when the conduct occurred, it is incumbent upon the individual to act within the laws of the country where he is present. As we have previously explained from these Benches, the Government do not believe that a person should be able to escape prosecution simply by crossing a border within the EU, whether the conduct occurred before or after 7th August 2002. I hope that the Committee will see why this is not desirable and instead agree that the date of the request is what should determine which procedures are used.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para25"></a>I now turn to the two amendments standing in the name of the Official Opposition. Those seek to provide that any order that has the effect of transferring existing cases already in the system to the new arrangements should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Perhaps I can set out the Government's position on the whole issue of transferring existing cases to the new arrangements. I <P>


<a name="column_GC45"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not believe that I can do any better than to quote from the Government's response to questions that were posed by the Home Affairs Committee in another place in its first report of 2002&#150;03. The response is appended to the committee's report on the Bill. The Government's response stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In principle the new arrangements will apply to all European arrest warrants received after the new Act has been brought into force even if the conduct to which the warrant relates occurred before that date. However, the Bill also contains a power to transfer existing cases to the new arrangements. It is the Government's intention that this power should only be used very sparingly and only if it is justified and there would be clear benefits in doing so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-48_para26"></a><P>

<a name="30910-48_para27"></a>For the avoidance of doubt I should make it clear that the passage I have quoted referred to the EAW simply because the question to which it was a response did so. Exactly the same principle applies to Part 2 of the Bill. So the position is, I hope, clear. The power to transfer cases, if it is used at all, will be used only sparingly and if it is in the interests of justice.
<P>

<a name="30910-48_para28"></a>Fugitives whose cases are transferred will no doubt seek to challenge the transfer through judicial review and I am sure that the courts would be very alive to any abuse of process arguments. If they felt that the fugitive was being seriously disadvantaged they would no doubt uphold his challenge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-49_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   Perhaps the Minister could answer one question. Do his officials have information on what is now the longest outstanding extradition case? How long might we have a transitional period? If a case has been outstanding for four or five years, as I believe could occur, then if something is received on 31st December 2003&#151;that is, the day before the coming into force of the Act in his example&#151;we could be talking about 2008, 2009 or 2010 before the old procedure dropped away. Is that what the Government envisage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-49_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I pause while cogitation is taking place on that&#151;cogitation has been very fast. The longest outstanding case is approximately seven years.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para0"></a>Turning to the specifics of the amendments, I am sure that Members of the Committee are aware that it is virtually unprecedented for commencement orders to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. There is good reason for that. Parliament has expressed its wishes by enacting the legislation, and it should then be brought into force as soon as practicable without the need for further parliamentary debate. Therefore, we see no need to depart from established practice in this respect, and that is why we cannot support the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para1"></a>However, I repeat that we do not expect many, if any, cases already in the system to be transferred to the new arrangements. That will happen only if it is clearly in the interests of justice.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para2"></a>I have done my best to explain why we believe that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would be impractical. Similarly, I have sought to explain why I do not believe that we should take the unprecedented step of making commencement orders subject to the affirmative <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30910-49_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I obviously feel unhappy with the fact that the Government are unable to shift their position on Amendment No. 257. Of course, I recognise that they have now put themselves in a position where they cannot do so without breaching the international obligations entered into by not making a declaration at the time when they agreed to the terms of the framework decision. Having said that, I shall of course beg leave to withdraw the amendment today. I shall consider how far, and whether or not, it would be desirable to bring back this matter on Report for further discussion. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 115, line 26, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30910-49_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30910-49_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe that this is the last amendment at the end of nine hard days. It takes us back to one of the early days in Committee and the vexed issue of Orders in Council. It seems to be a long time since we discussed this matter on our first day in Grand Committee. I want to repeat our thanks, which we gave then, to the Minister for his commitment to making Orders in Council under Sections 1 and 68, designating category 1 and category 2 territories, subject to the affirmative rather than the negative procedure. We were very grateful to him for that.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para13"></a>My purpose in moving Amendment No. 267 is simple. It is to query the power in Clause 210(4), which allows orders for such designations to have specified modifications in relation to specific territories. That seems to be a wide-ranging and potentially dangerous power to propose. I am not clear, and should welcome an explanation, as to what the purpose of such a clause is and what "specified modifications" might be.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para14"></a>I appreciate that we are nearing the end of our lengthy discussions on the Bill but I should like some clarification from the Minister as to why we should not strike out Clause 210(4). I beg to move.

<P>


<a name="column_GC47"></a>

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para15"></a>The Ministers responding have generally pointed out that the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform queried only the use of the term in one place and that we would provide the explanation when we got to that point, and we are now here.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para16"></a>The first point that I should put on the record is that the Delegated Powers Committee did not consider that Clause 210(4) was inappropriate. All that the committee suggested was that the Government should provide an explanation as to why it was necessary, which I shall endeavour to do. We expect to designate all of our existing extradition partners as either Part 1 or Part 2 countries under the new legislation, as one would expect. There is no obvious reason why, broadly, the new Act cannot apply to all of them in the form that Parliament has enacted it.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para17"></a>The only likely problem is that, as we have already discussed at some length, we may need to vary the period in which papers have to be supplied following provisional arrest to take account of the terms of our various bilateral extradition treaties. However, we have specially catered for that by means of Clause 73(10). So, to put it simply, I do not believe that we will need to make any great use of the "specified modifications" provision when it comes to designating our current extradition partners under the new legislation. However, that provision is necessary to enable us to cope with the future.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para18"></a>The Committee may recall that at the seventh sitting of the Committee, my noble friend Lady Scotland read onto the record the list of the UK's extradition partners. It is a pretty comprehensive list so, currently, there are no plans to extend it or to negotiate any new bilateral treaties. Nevertheless, there are gaps. To cite one interesting omission, we do not have extradition relations with Japan. That has not given rise to any problems but were it to do so in future and the Japanese to approach us about the possibility of a treaty, it would obviously be sensible to proceed. I am sure that Members of the Committee could not be opposed to that in principle.

<a name="30910-49_para19"></a>As part of that treaty, we may want to insist on a two-year threshold when negotiating a treaty with a new country, because the sentence thresholds in that country were much lower than elsewhere, so that a two-year sentence there was equivalent to 12 months in the rest of the world, to give an instance. Again we would want to use Clause 210(4) to ensure that the operation of the Act reflected the terms of a treaty. That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of Clause 210(4)&#151;to allow us to ensure that the peculiarities of any future treaties can be accommodated.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para20"></a>I remind your Lordships that as a result of an earlier concession, all orders designating countries, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, indicated, as extradition partners will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure so Parliament will know fully what is happening and have the fullest opportunity to consider whether any such modifications are appropriate.

<a name="30910-49_para21"></a>I repeat that we would not expect to use this facility very often, but equally I do not think that we should put ourselves in the position where our future room for manoeuvre is unnecessarily limited. I hope that this explanation answers the concerns that lay behind the probing amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, spoke.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-49_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that fairly full reply. As I expected, he said, "It's in there but we don't expect to make any great use of it". That always begs the question why it is needed. I accept that he then went on to raise issues concerning the peculiarities of the extradition system, and I consider that the example of Japan was a very good one.
<P>

<a name="30910-49_para22"></a>I believe I am happy with what he said but, without going over other ground that we have discussed this afternoon, this type of matter could be dealt with usefully in an annual report. One talks about some of the places where specified modifications have had to be made because at issue is the liberty of a subject and the subject being moved to countries around the world. The kind of issues mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and which I raised, come up again when one looks at Clause 210(4). We shall return to that matter but, in the meantime, I am happy to accept the Minister's explanation and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column GC49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arises from the amendment in another place to insert Clause 194 modifying existing Scots law on bail in relation to extradition proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30910-50_para3"></a>The effect of Clause 194 is that Scots law on bail applies to persons facing extradition in so far as this is consistent with the Bill. Obviously as Clause 194 applies only to Scotland, it is necessary for it to be added to the Scotland-only provisions listed in the extent provisions in Clause 212. The intention of the amendment is to do so. I hope that your Lordships will understand and welcome the amendment and I now invite the Committee to agree to it.
<P>

<a name="30910-50_para4"></a>As this may be the last occasion on which I shall speak on this Bill&#151;I sincerely hope that it is&#151;I should like, although it is improper, to thank all Members who have taken part in the nine days of proceedings. It has been a good process and, as the temperature has reduced, the quality of exploration has improved and increased. Perhaps I should not have said the latter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910-50_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Clearly this is simply a draft amendment. However, I want to suggest that it is not absolutely correct. It should read,

The 12 intermediary funding bodies (IFBs) were selected by an open competitive tendering process. Local strategy partnerships are situated in each of the 26 district council areas and each partnership was subject to local agreement between the four social partners, local government and the main statutory agencies operating at the local level.

<A NAME="30910w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   On the basis of monitoring information gathered by a number of government departments since the 1960s, I am satisfied that water quality in Lough Neagh is being maintained at a sufficiently high quality for use as a potable water supply, to sustain a commercial fish population, and to support a range of recreational activities. However, specific water quality problems, mainly related to enrichment by plant nutrients from agricultural and urban sources within the catchment area of the lough, have been identified. These probems have led to a number of cross-departmental actions aimed at preventing further deterioration and achieving improvements in water quality, where possible. A nutrient control strategy, designed to co-ordinate activities in this area, will be issued by the Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service by the end of this year.

<B>10 Sept 2003 : Column WA125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30910w02_para0"></a>An essential part of our effort to maintain effective immigration control is to prevent passengers entering or remaining in the United Kingdom using forged documents. We have therefore been working with our EU colleagues on a new secure vignette to be used when people are granted permission to remain in this country. The new vignette, which will be placed in the holder's passport, follows a common EU-wide format allowing easy identification across the whole EU. This does not alter the conditions on which a person may enter the UK, or allow those people granted permission to remain in other EU countries to come to the UK. The vignette is solely a uniform and secure way of granting people permission to remain within each member state of the EU.
<P>

<a name="30910w02_para1"></a>The new common format permit will be introduced in the UK from mid-September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30910w02_para2"></a>In parallel with this initiative we are introducing changes to the Immigration Rules which will require non-EEA nationals who wish to come to the UK for more than six months to obtain an entry clearance before travelling here. The entry clearance will be obtained from a British diplomatic mission overseas. This change reflects the need to manage the flow of passengers through UK ports effectively and at the same time to provide a first class service to travellers. By introducing this change we intend to streamline the service provided to people who are coming to the UK. For people who are coming to this country for more than six months we do not believe that applying for entry clearance in advance of travel will prove an unreasonable burden. This approach will provide the best service to passengers and allows for the most efficient use of our resources.
<P>

<a name="30910w02_para3"></a>It is our intention that the new entry clearance arrangements will be introduced in stages over a two-year period. The first stage will involve introducing this requirement for nationals of 10 countries and will come into force from 13 November 2003. We will be publicising this change in advance but recognise that there may be some passengers who are not aware of this change. There will therefore be transition arrangements to ensure that genuine passengers are not unduly inconvenienced. A "grace period" will operate until 23.59 p.m. on 13 January 2004, during which any passenger who arrives at a UK port, and would qualify for entry except for the absence of the necessary entry clearance, will be admitted.

In April this year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to all affected diplomatic missions and international organisations giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding fines or appeal against them if they considered that the fines had been issued incorrectly.

<P>
<UL>Whether they will make representations to the Indian Government to take action to enforce the laws against both the dowry system and sex-determination tests, and to launch a public education campaign to raise the status of women.[HL4237]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:  </B>  The practices of making dowry payments and of sex-determination testing are both outlawed under Indian law. But dowry payments continue to be a widespread problem across India, particularly in rural areas, and sex-determination tests continue to be misused, resulting in the termination of a disproportionate number of pregnancies of female foetuses.
<P>

<a name="30910w03_para0"></a>Both the Department for International Development and the British Council are involved in project work in India, some of it funded by the FCO's Human Rights Project Fund, targeted at promoting the empowerment and welfare of Indian women at most risk. Through this work we hope to raise awareness of the issues around women's rights&#151;including dowry payments and female foeticide. Our High Commission in New Delhi also regularly raise human rights issues with the Government of India.

<P>
<UL>Whether they consider that the victims of age discrimination in the fields of education, housing, the provision of goods, facilities and services to the public, and public sector provision, should be given equal legal protection to that enjoyed by the victims of sex and race discrimination; and, if not, why not.[HL3820]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30910w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  Unfair age discrimination is intolerable wherever it occurs. The Government's priority is to introduce effective and workable legislation outlawing age discrimination in employment and vocational training. That in itself requires the resolution of a number of complex and sensitive issues, which are discussed in our consultation&#151;Equality and Diversity: Age Matters&#151;launched on 2 July. We shall be following it up with a further consultation in 2004 on the draft legislation itself.
<P>

<a name="30910w03_para1"></a>In responding to our previous consultation&#151;Towards Equality and Diversity&#151;Age Concern England, the Third Age Employment Network, and the Association of Retired Persons Over 50 felt that legislation should be extended to goods and services.
<P>

<a name="30910w03_para2"></a>The Government believe that legislating against age discrimination at work will help to form less ageist attitudes generally. Demographic and economic factors will also provide powerful incentives for providers of goods and services to change discriminatory attitudes and eliminate discriminatory practices.

<P>

<a name="30910w03_para3"></a>As announced in November 2002, we intend to introduce legislation to establish the agency as a non-departmental public body as soon as parliamentary time allows. We intend that the non-departmental public body will take responsibility for the National Health Service Act functions currently discharged by the special health authority (which will be wound up) and for the other functions identified in the consultation paper Health Protection: A consultation document on creating a health protection agency (June 2002).

<P>
<A NAME="30910w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Warner:  </B>  The Government continue to argue for maximum permitted limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements to be set on the basis of thorough risk assessments and will continue to press this view strongly at every opportunity.

<a name="30910w03_para5"></a>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has succeeded in getting the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to hold a meeting between representatives of the United Kingdom food supplements industry, the relevant Scientific Panel in the EFSA and the European Commission to discuss dossier requirements. The meeting will take place on 14 October. Furthermore, officials at the FSA have already had discussions with industry representatives to aid interpretation of dossier requirements and have offered to comment on proposed dossiers before these are submitted to the EFSA.

<A NAME="30910w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  There are no plans to review the provision for fieldwork within science GCSE or A-level. The existing science national curriculum at key stages 1 to 4, together with current GCSE and A-level syllabuses, encourages fieldwork. There is also a pilot at A-level which places particular emphasis on it. Additionally, all primary and secondary schools are required to make provision for fieldwork for all pupils as part of the geography curriculum.

<P>
<A NAME="30910w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  We have no evidence to suggest that road safety would be improved if drivers were required to filter in turn rather than give way to traffic from the right at mini roundabouts. However, we have commissioned research to produce guidance aimed at ensuring that mini roundabouts are designed so that they will be used appropriately and safely.

<A NAME="30910w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  All of the runway options consulted on, including a possible third runway at Heathrow, have been assessed across a wide range of impacts, including in particular noise and local air quality, in accordance with the appraisal framework previously agreed and published. The details were set out in the consultation documents and supporting papers. Wider health implications of airport development are also being taken into account, consistent with Department of Health guidelines for health impact assessment.

<P>
<A NAME="30910w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  The EU limit values for nitrogen dioxide are not source specific: aviation is one of several sources that has to be considered for compliance purposes. The Government have undertaken an assessment of air quality impacts associated with Heathrow options in the consultation document The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East. That document states "Another runway at Heathrow could not be considered unless the Government could be confident that levels of all relevant pollutants could be consistently contained within EU limits". Subsequent consideration of options and consultation response evidence for Heathrow and other airports is being undertaken in full knowledge of the UK environmental commitments.
