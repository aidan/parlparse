Our ambassador in Rangoon has repeatedly made it clear that Burma&#146;s many problems will be solved only through dialogue between the Government, opposition and ethnic groups. DfID is providing &#163;600,000 of emergency assistance in response to food shortages in Chin State. This year, DfID is also providing &#163;1.8 million to assist Burmese refugees in Thailand and internally displaced people in Burma.</p>

Is he aware that on a recent visit to the peoples of the Chin Hill tribes in Burma, we found evidence of a serious famine which had already killed hundreds of people? Many hundreds more were ill and dying. Since we left, in just one week in one village whose people we met, seven people died&#151;six of them children. Will DfID&#146;s welcome commitment to provide relief ensure that food reaches those most affected, particularly in view of extremely disturbing news received this morning that the SPDC authorities are not going to allow the World Food Programme or the NGOs access to those in need? The situation is desperate and I hope that the Minister can give some specific reassurance.</p>

Can he further confirm that that infestation was clearly predictable, because it was associated with the blooming of the bamboo, and that the Indian Government intervened quite successfully in Mizoram to prevent a similar tragedy? Are the Burmese Government prepared to discuss famine relief with aid organisations outside, or does my noble friend share the widespread belief that the failure to act was deliberate?</p>

However, that is more symptomatic of the Burmese Government&#146;s failure to commit adequate resources to the needs of their people than poor organisation. We believe that United Nations organisations on the ground are best placed to raise these issues with the Burmese authorities. They did so in developing the aid package that DfID recently agreed to finance. We believe that a bilateral approach from the United Kingdom to the authorities on the situation in Chin State would not be effective.</p>

However, will the noble Lord address in particular the position of the federally administered tribal areas? Although it is traditionally a lawless region, has not the situation now got to the point where firm action is really necessary? Can he say whether the new civil Government of Pakistan and the army of Pakistan are working more closely together? Is not the time now right for a united effort to be made by the United States of America, ISAF and Pakistan to eliminate the many bases, terrorist camps and other establishments that are aiding and abetting militias based in the FATA region?</p>

The new president, President Zardari, has made welcome comments about the need to crack down on this with both a reinforced military and political approach. He has also met with the President of Afghanistan, and they have promised mutual co-operation. The United States and the United Kingdom certainly have a role in supporting these efforts.</p>

Is he also aware that the new head of Inter-Services Intelligence&#151;ISI&#151;has told parliamentarians in his briefing that the military concedes that the peace talks with the Taliban along the border have not succeeded&#151;that that strategy has failed&#151;hence the resort to military operations again? Yet at the same time our ambassador in Afghanistan is supposedly brokering peace talks for the Taliban to return to government in Afghanistan. Which strategy do we really believe in&#151;supporting the pro-democracy groups, or rolling out the red carpet for the Taliban? Or do we want to please both parties at the same time?</p>

I am not privy to the current discussions in the Pakistan Parliament but I think that it is true to say that both the Government of Pakistan and Pakistan&#146;s military leadership believe that there must be a push on both fronts. There must be effective military action against lawless elements, including Taliban and al-Qaeda elements, but there must also be a political effort to win back the support of civilians in the tribal areas. These two goals are not contradictory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0810135000033"></a>For the record, our ambassador in Afghanistan is absolutely not engaged in a process of rolling out red carpets for the Taliban or arranging for their return to government; he is pursing British interests there, which are to encourage President Karzai to have an effective military strategy against insurgents in the eastern and southern parts of Afghanistan and, similarly, to pursue reconciliation with the Pashtun tribes in that area.</p>

Given that it is widely supposed that al-Qaeda has its headquarters in this inaccessible region, that Osama bin Laden is there if he is still alive, and that the main purpose of putting our troops into Afghanistan in the first place was to corner him and his immediate aides, is there the necessary co-operation between the ANA, the US forces and the Pakistan intelligence and army, and are we in the UK&#151;since our interests are directly affected&#151;also making a contribution, possibly with the new troops that we are sending in that direction?</p>

We have to understand that the border dividing the two areas is a recently modern invention and we must therefore treat it as a single area populated by people who are linked by tribal and ethnic associations. Every day, thousands of people cross the border. Any solution to this area must therefore take a comprehensive view, and that requires common co-ordinated action by both Governments supported by the likes of the United States and ourselves. We are moving forward very strongly on that. However, the troops that we are sending are at this stage for the purpose of reinforcing our operations in Helmand on the Afghan side of the border.</p>

When you look at these things in discounted cash flow, you can always prove that there is not a business case, but we have had two fires, and it is urgently necessary that the ordinary fire suppression devices that are fixed to so many buildings are fixed to the carriages that pass through the Channel Tunnel.</p>

The first recommendation of the ombudsman was for a public apology from those public bodies, including the Treasury, which had let Equitable members down. The second recommendation was for a government-funded compensation scheme. To date, we have had only prevarication from the Government. Even if the Minister cannot give a detailed response today, will he say that the Government accept the principle of paying compensation? Also, can he give any good reason for the deafening silence that we have in place of an apology?</p>

The noble Baroness will also recognise that Ministers have been rather busy on significant matters in recent weeks.

At the very least, do the Government accept the recommendations of the ombudsman&#146;s report in terms of timing&#151;namely, that any scheme approved by Parliament should be established within six months of that decision being taken and that the scheme should complete its work within two years thereafter?

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0810135000084"></a>Importantly, we are all agreed on one thing: the current threat to western democracies from extremist groups and terrorists is higher now than it has ever been. The suicide bomber has changed the security landscape. The police often have to intervene much earlier in the process than they once would have done, and by doing that they are trying to protect the public from undue risk. At the same time, the evidence available to them is much less than would have been the case elsewhere. It is often incomplete. The investigations are often much more complex. Terrorist groups are often highly sophisticated. They are certainly surveillance conscious and can see all their communications networks with very great skill and at very great depth. All that leads to difficult and protracted investigative processes. I need hardly say that investigators often work under great pressures of time. So, we can all agree to this point.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0810135000085"></a>The Government now suggest that the present limit of 28 days&#146; detention for those arrested for terrorist offences may be too restrictive. They say that sooner or later more time will be needed to complete a proper investigation. They say that the law needs amendment to give the prosecution in some circumstances up to 42 days in which to complete the investigation&#151;a process that was described in a newspaper by one commentator back in the summer as having something in the &#147;legal back pocket&#148;, just in case. That is a clumsy phrase but perhaps it encapsulates the essence of the argument being advanced.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0810135000086"></a>I shall outline briefly six solid reasons why I take issue with this and why I have tabled the amendment. First, there is no evidence to date that we have ever come close to running out of time within the present 28-day limit. The DPP is very clear on this point. Hitting the 28-day buffers is not seen by him or his staff as likely in the foreseeable future. To date, most charges have been brought at or before 14 days. In those cases where charges were preferred closer to 28 days, we are told that evidence was often already available to prefer the charges earlier, but the authorities delayed just in case further, more serious evidence was forthcoming.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0810135000087"></a>Secondly, no other country in the western world that has a common law system like ours&#151;an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system&#151;has extended detention without charge to 42 days. In fact, no country has gone as far as 28 days. The nearest comparison is Australia with 12 days, and all the rest of the comparable countries operate with single figures. I need hardly remind your Lordships that in America it is two days and in Canada it is one day. So why the marked disparity? Those countries often face a threat similar to our own. How is it that they manage and we apparently cannot?</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0810135000090"></a>Thirdly, there is almost universal opposition to what the Government propose. It almost beggars belief that any Administration could embark on such a course. Just look at the list of those who oppose the Government: the Law Society; Amnesty; Liberty; Justice; the previous Attorney-General; the previous Solicitor-General and Lord Chancellor; and successive Directors of Public Prosecutions. There are many others, but perhaps the most important person to note in that list is the Director of Public Prosecutions. DPPs are uniquely required to evaluate evidence as it comes in during the course of the investigation, make a professional judgment on the adequacy of the material and watch the time on the judicial clock. The police and the security services have conducted some outstanding operations in recent years, but the DPP alone is the best judge, arguably the only judge, of the evidential state of play. The police have a view, of course, but the DPP is the one who we should listen to on this point, and successive directors have opposed the proposed changes.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0810135000091"></a>The official position of the police via the ACPO is now merely that the extension to 42 days would be advantageous, and it would be from the standpoint of purely investigative procedures alone. However, I have to tell this House that numerous chief constables have told me privately that they see no reason for the extension and that they do not support it. As an aside, I can only say would that some public servants were less afraid of speaking out openly.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0810135000092"></a>Fourthly, as for the suggested mechanism by which the Government would seek to extend from 28 to 42 days&#151;it is set out in Clause 23 and thereafter&#151;frankly, I have nothing but scorn for it. It is a Byzantine procedure that seeks to give Parliament a quasi-judicial role and runs grave risks of breaching sub judice arrangements. It has been roundly condemned, in particular by Mr Andy Hayman, who until recently was the assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police charged with co-ordinating all national counterterrorism operations. In a long article in the <I>Times</I> on 6 October, he wrote a number of things in virtually rubbishing this Bill. He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0810135000244"></a>&#147;The Bill is about politics and it won't work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81013-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0810135000093"></a>He also wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000250"></a>&#147;the Government's current proposals are not fit for purpose: they are bureaucratic, convoluted and unworkable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000228"></a>I invite noble Lords to agree with me that he should know what he is talking about.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="0810135000094"></a><a name="81013-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><b><a name="81013-0002.htm_spnew51"></a><a name="0810135000345"></a>Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale:</b> Does the noble Lord not agree that Andy Hayman also made it very clear that he still believes that more than 28 days is necessary? Andy Hayman is concerned about the administration and the points that have been put into the Bill, but he still believes, as he believed when he argued for 90 days, that we need more than 28 days.</p>

I knew it, and I was going to comment on it later. Andy Hayman said that the mechanism to try to move the timescale from 28 days to 42 was, I repeat,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000251"></a>&#147;not fit for purpose ... bureaucratic, convoluted and unworkable&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0810135000229"></a>He went on to say of the proposals that,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000252"></a>&#147;just trying to understand them gives me a headache&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000230"></a>The full text is in the <I>Times</I> of 6 October, and I refer the noble Baroness to it.</p>

<a name="81013-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0810135000096"></a>Andy Hayman was making the same point as ACPO, which said that it would like some sort of mechanism that took us into an area of certainty if we were running up against the 28 days. That was my next point: to ask your Lordships why we should embark on such a course, if we were ever to face running out of time at 28 days, when the existing law can come to our aid. One can use existing law. As it is almost inconceivable that we would hold anyone in custody at the 27-day&#151;not the 28-day&#151;point without there being some evidence against them, one should simply charge them with the lesser offence under terrorism legislation. There  are many possibilities&#151;membership of a proscribed organisation, possession of material, preparatory acts and so on&#151;that one might call the second division of terrorist offences, falling short of the gravest of those offences.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81013-0003.htm"/>


<a name="81013-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0810135000097"></a>One therefore charges the lesser offence and continues the investigation, and if evidence of a more serious offence comes to light, one charges that later. The point is that at the time of the first charge, the 28-day clock stops running. In fact, all clocks in that judicial sense stop running. The defendant now has access to legal representation and appears before a court. In short, he is in the normal judicial process. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, will shortly propose an amendment that will allow post-charge questioning in circumstances with a judicial overview, and I shall support him. Again, the existing law, with only a very slight amendment, can quite adequately give us the flexibility that we need without adding the inflammatory words &#147;42 days&#148;.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0810135000098"></a>That is my fifth point; those words would most certainly be inflammatory, and would almost certainly give ammunition to those who seek to justify acts of terrorism against us&#151;those who, in other words, seek to recruit others to oppose what they contend is our repressive regime&#151;and it would be an act of sheer folly to provide them with such a gift.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0810135000099"></a>I have made five points so far: we have never come close to running out of time, and if we did we could use the existing law; no other common-law country has more than a 12-day limit; there is massive opposition to this suggestion from some of the most influential and respected quarters; the suggested mechanisms, or procedures, are unworkable; and there is a risk of a fundamental backlash. This legislation is fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0810135000100"></a>I said that I had six points. My sixth point is that, perhaps worst of all, the legislation seeks further to erode fundamental, legal and civil rights that have been the pride of this country for centuries. Simple mathematics will tell us that 793 years ago Magna Carta declared in one line:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0810135000245"></a>&#147;'To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000231"></a>We have recommended that principle to the rest of the world and have in part fought wars to preserve it. It set our legal system apart from the world for many years and it was held up as an exemplar. We have gone far  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_495"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enough. There is no proven case for change. This attempt to appear tough on terrorism is a shabby charade that is unworthy of a democratic process, and we should reject it. I beg to move.</p>

Many Members of the Committee will have seen the report in the <I>Times</I> on 6 October, which said that the Government have effectively dropped the proposals to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days and that they would,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000253"></a>&#147;effectively confine the controversial proposal ... to the legislative dustbin&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000232"></a>So why are we debating this again? It is a criminal offence to waste police time and I wonder whether that offence also extends to wasting the time of the Committee.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0810135000103"></a>This debate is an unhelpful distraction. It distracts us at a time when we should be concentrating our energies on more pressing issues: that is, the economy; other sensitive parts of this Bill, such as inquiries and inquests; post-charge questioning, which we on these Benches would like to see play a useful role in terrorist investigations, but with suitable safeguards; or things that will really aid us in the prosecution of terrorism, such as the use of intercept evidence, a measure that should be in the Bill, but is not.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0810135000104"></a>The proposal to extend pre-charge detention fails on three significant grounds; namely, necessity, desirability and practicability. Let me be clear: the proposal is unnecessary, undesirable and unworkable. I shall address each of those points briefly. When the Government first put forward the proposal to extend pre-charge detention from the current 28-day limit, we made it clear that there needs to be evidence to support that; that we would need to see this evidence; that the Government need to make the case; and that we would consider it seriously. On these Benches, we take the terrorist threat to this country every bit as seriously as do the Government. As I said at Second Reading, there is no difference between us on that. Wherever possible, we strive for agreement on security matters.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0810135000105"></a>But the Government have signally failed to demonstrate need. What they have relied on is a hypothetical scenario&#151;what they call &#147;pragmatic inference&#148;&#151;to make the case. Sir Ian Blair has said explicitly,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0810135000246"></a>&#147;We have never put forward a case that there is evidence of a need for an extension&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000233"></a>The Government have relied primarily on the complexity of modern plots and, therefore, the difficulty of investigation. If that constituted overwhelming justification, one would expect that those who had to mount the prosecution would indicate their support for the measure.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0810135000106"></a>But just the opposite is the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has made clear that he does not think that it is necessary. The prosecutors do not perceive any need for the period of 28 days to be increased. He collapsed the Government&#146;s case for a hypothetical situation. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0810135000247"></a>&#147;It is possible to set up all sorts of hypotheses. Anything is possible. The question is whether it is remotely likely&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_496"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0810135000234"></a>Many other experienced figures have similarly said that it is unnecessary, including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, a former Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, a former Attorney-General, the Lord Advocate and many former Lord Advocates, some of whom are here today. In its report dated 8 October, the Joint Committee on Human Rights commented that it is hard,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000254"></a>&#147;to see how the Government can plausibly claim that there is a pressing necessity to extend further the maximum period ... when the existing power to detain for more than 14 days ... has only ever been used in a small number of cases and has not been used at all for well over a year&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000235"></a>So the Government&#146;s case is not good enough as grounds for taking power to keep people in detention for periods much longer than any other comparable democracy thinks necessary to confront the terrorist threat, a point just made by the noble Lord, Lord Dear. Moreover, Parliament must balance the evidence for this measure, such as it is, against its desirability&#151;my second point&#151;and against its wider effects. In his very powerful intervention, the noble Lord, Lord Dear, repeated a remark he made some time ago to the effect that the previously described proposal to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days was a propaganda coup and a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda. The Home Office&#146;s own risk assessment for the proposal stated,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0810135000248"></a>&#147;It puts at risk the flow of community intelligence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000236"></a>That is the Government&#146;s own department. Community intelligence is a priority area for counterterrorism work. We have not got it quite right yet, but these proposals will hinder us unnecessarily in trying to get it right, and I personally attach a great deal of importance to the development of community intelligence. Let me be clear: these are security warnings. The proposal to extend pre-charge detention has real potential security drawbacks.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0810135000107"></a>Let us assume for a moment that if this proposal was desirable and necessary, which it is not, would we consider it workable? The answer is no. The former Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, made clear his view that the procedures to be established are so cumbersome that the police and the prosecuting authorities will be most unlikely to seek their extension. And as the noble Lord, Lord Dear, mentioned, Mr Andy Hayman, the former assistant commissioner for special operations, wrote recently that the process the police and the prosecution would have to go through just will not work. We have to take the comments of the police in this respect seriously since they will be involved in trying to make these procedures work. Indeed, Mr Hayman went further and wrote that at the height of a terrorist investigation it would distract efforts to solve or prevent the crime by forcing the police to prepare a &#147;politically acceptable&#148; case for an extension. The last thing we need in such circumstances is the taint of spinning.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0810135000108"></a>That leads me to the final objection to this proposal. The apparent safeguards the Government have put in place not only make the proposal unworkable, they also make it constitutionally worrying. The Constitution Committee said that they run the risk of conflating the roles of Parliament and the judiciary. They will place on Parliament demands to act in a quasi-judicial manner. The safeguards are also inadequate to attain  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_497"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their ostensible objective&#151;the prevention of the abuse of power. The excessively broad drafting of these provisions could actually lead to such abuses. Were Parliament able to conduct the sort of scrutiny of an order for the reserved power that it should if it were to provide a real safeguard against the abuse of executive power, it would be in great danger of prejudicing any subsequent trial, with all the adverse consequences for justice that could entail.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0810135000109"></a>On the other hand, if it were to avoid that danger, Parliament would be prohibited from conducting real scrutiny. The Secretary of State has herself said that much the greater part of the material aspects could not be debated by Parliament, so it would not provide any real safeguard. Indeed, it would put itself in danger of conniving with acts over which it had no real control. That would not be worthy of either House, nor of our democracy, and the Government should not put forward proposals which risk the reputation of Parliament in this way. As the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, said in her maiden speech, we are all trying to facilitate the work of the police, intelligence and security services to detect and counter terrorism, and we are all agreed on that. But to fulfil our constitutional role, we must ensure that our laws in this sensitive area of national life are relevant and proportionate. The proposal to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days fails on both grounds, and that is why we oppose it.</p>

After 12 days, on 21 August, 11 were charged with conspiracy to blow up aeroplanes in flight by mixing liquids together, carried, it is said, in Lucozade bottles, into an explosive concoction. An application to extend time beyond 14 days was granted in respect of another nine. Of these, six were subsequently charged&#151;two on 15 August, some 16 days after arrest; three on 30 August, after 21 days; and three were released after being held for, respectively, 24 days, 27 days and 27-and-a-half days. Of the 21 who were charged, only eight eventually faced trial some 18 months later. On 8 September, only four weeks ago, two years after the original arrests, the jury, after more than  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_498"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>50 hours of deliberations, was unable to agree any verdict against seven of the defendants relating to the plot to blow up aircraft. Three were, however, found guilty of other conspiracy to murder charges; one was acquitted entirely. So the total bag out of the 24 who were originally arrested was three convictions unrelated to the airline plot. I say no more about it for the reason the intervention was made just now. I am told that there may be retrials and that the Government are facing expensive civil litigation from airlines who lost millions from the restrictions imposed upon them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0810135000114"></a>But would the outcome of these trials have been any different if those people had been kept without charge for 42 days? The period for detention in Spain is 14 days. Twenty-nine suspects were arrested for the Madrid bombings and there were 21 convictions. I made the point at Second Reading that the charging of a suspect does not for a moment inhibit the continuing investigation of an alleged offence. So there is no case whatever for suggesting that 42 days will bring about a conviction when 28 days will not. The Home Office agrees because, in its consultation paper, <I>Options for Pre-Charge Detention in Terrorism Cases</I>, published in July 2007, it acknowledged that there has been no case in which a suspect was released but a higher limit than 28 days would definitely have led to a charge.</p>

<ul><a name="0810135000255"></a>&#147;in an intelligent argument on this issue a number of days is entirely arbitrary, so that you cannot say with logical empirical analysis that 14 or 28 or 30 or 56 or 90 days&#151;or any particular number of days&#151;is actually the perfect cut-off &#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000237"></a>although he recognised that Parliament would impose a cut-off. His sayings and writings have been pored over on the Government Benches with a zeal matched only by Scotland&#146;s famous son, Alexander Cruden, when he created his 1737 concordance of the Bible. But they seem to have missed this one. I sincerely hope that my noble friend Lord Carlile will develop the argument he advanced last October for a proper and fully human rights-compliance system of judicial control of detention before charge. He does not need any help from me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0810135000116"></a>A fundamental concern arises from the proposition that a young Muslim&#151;and they all have been young Muslims&#151;should be arrested on nothing more than the words of an officer, &#147;I believe you to be a terrorist&#148;. According to the highly experienced defence barrister, Ali Naseem Bajwa, who gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, detainees are taken to the police station and told nothing for many days of the basis upon which they are there. In Operation Overt, it emerged that disclosure was virtually non-existent for the first week of custody. Disclosure is, of course, where the police tell the defence solicitor, if there is one, of the nature of the matters about which they intend to question the suspect. Over the first four days of their detention, there were only three hours, on average, of total questioning of each detainee&#151;three hours over four days each. Rather than being about any offence they may have committed, the questioning was mostly about their personal circumstances and  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_499"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>background. Those who were charged after 15 days&#151;the first group&#151;were interviewed in total for 13 to 14 hours each. That is rather less than one hour a day. Those who lingered on to the end of the 28-day period before being released spent only the same amount of time overall&#151;13 to 14 hours&#151;in interview. Many days of their last 15 passed without any interview at all; the average was for 10 minutes a day. So extending time limits for questioning suspects seems to encourage a very leisurely approach.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0810135000117"></a>The essential thing to remember is that if a detainee is held without charging, it means that the police have no reasonable suspicion that he has committed any terrorist offence at all, even the mildest form of terrorist offence&#151;that of preparation for committing a terrorist offence. If they do have such evidence, they are under a legal duty to charge him.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0810135000118"></a>In September 2005, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, issued to prosecutors an explanatory guide on the application of the threshold test, which allows the prosecutor to charge where there is no more than a reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed. In terrorist cases, that reasonable suspicion may arise on evidence which would be inadmissible in court&#151;for example, intelligence or intercept evidence. That guide was, however, not made public. Indeed, it does not seem to have reached its intended target for some time: Deputy Assistant Commissioner Clarke, head of the Met terrorist branch, told the Home Affairs Committee in February 2006 that he did not think the threshold test was at all applicable to these cases. However, Sir Ken Macdonald, the retiring DPP, told the Home Affairs Committee last December that,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000256"></a>&#147;given the nature of the threshold test, the evidence is only required to demonstrate a reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the offence. I can only say to you that our experience so far has been that we have managed and managed reasonably comfortably&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000119"></a>In my Second Reading speech, I outlined the practical reasons why detention without charge will lead to a drying up of intelligence to the security services, upon which all investigation depends, and how that will inevitably increase terrorism and diminish the security of the people of this country. Today I focus upon the weaknesses and the so-called extension hearings, where the DPP or a Crown prosecutor acting with his consent, can apply to a senior judge for extensions of time. Those extensions will continue to be governed by Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act, which the Bill seeks to amend.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0810135000120"></a>Those weaknesses are these: the applications to extend time beyond the original 14 days may be made ex parte. In other words, the hearing, or part of a hearing, may be held between the prosecution and the judge in private and in the absence of the accused, or of anybody representing him. Secondly, information may be withheld from the detainee or his lawyers so that he is not told the state of play in the investigation against him. Mr Bajwa described how in one case he was given three applications, identically worded, to support three applications for more time in respect of the same detainee&#151;the same wording for seven to  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_500"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>14 days as from 14 days to 21 and 21 to 28. In other words, nothing further was disclosed as to the state of the investigation.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0810135000121"></a>Thirdly, the detainee has no entitlement to be brought in person before the judge. He may be dealt with by videolink from the hallway of Paddington Green police station. The judge, who is supposed to be monitoring his welfare, has the opportunity to see the detainee only on television. It is a brave person who complains about the circumstances of his detention when surrounded by his jailers.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0810135000122"></a>Fourthly, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, cross-examination of the senior investigating officer to test the strength of the application is not a legal entitlement. The senior officer who is making the application is not required to answer questions by the detainee or his lawyer on the reasonableness of the application that he is making.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0810135000123"></a>It is therefore no surprise that no application for extension has ever been refused and there has been only one occasion on which the number of days has been reduced. You can see why. The police tell the judge that they have plenty of irons in the fire. They say, &#147;The investigation&#146;s going well. You must trust us. If anything should turn up in our investigations, we want the detainee there so that we can question him about it&#148;.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0810135000124"></a>These are not proper, full, adversarial hearings. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights put it in its ninth report, issued on 7 February, the Bill contains,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000257"></a>&#147;no additional judicial safeguards ... and the existing ... safeguards do not provide a proper opportunity, at a truly judicial hearing at which the parties are on equal terms, to challenge the reasonableness of the suspicion on the basis of which they are detained&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000238"></a>In other words, the Government are using the judiciary as a convenient cover to give an aura of respectability to what is essentially executive detention.</p>

<a name="81013-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0810135000125"></a>I will not weary the Committee with pointing out the innumerable breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights; the injustice and the lack of fairness are obvious. Nor do I propose to dwell on the farce of asking Members of Parliament to vote on whether an individual should be held in custody on the basis of a redacted statement provided by the Home Secretary to the obvious prejudice of any future trial, which is not just unconstitutional but contemptible. I join all noble Lords who care for fairness and justice in calling for these proposals to be thrown out and for our real security to be maintained by sticking to the values on which the civilisation of this country depends.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Dear, reminded us, our constitutional safeguards, which took centuries of struggle to achieve, are fragile. I am afraid that an important element of them could be destroyed in the eight minutes that it takes to vote in this House.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0810135000131"></a>It is surely an essential ingredient of living in what we still call a free country that we are free from the fear of being locked up without charge. On occasions&#151;I think that this is the point of the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes&#151;we accept that it is necessary in the interests of public safety to restrict that principle. When it is, it is surely once again the mark of a free country that we do so for the minimum time possible. We should not throw away any of our liberties as we are asked to do by the Bill just in case it may become necessary in future or for no compelling reason or as a result of speculation, because, once we go down that path and unless someone says &#147;Stop&#148;, that road leads on to indefinite detention, which others to their shame have followed.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0810135000132"></a>Another important principle of living in a free society is surely that the law should not only apply but also be seen to apply equally to everyone. As the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford said at Second Reading, these provisions are viewed by many in the Muslim communities, which do not support terrorism, as a confirmation that those in power make special rules for them and regard their freedoms more lightly than those of ordinary criminals, for whom the limit of detention without charge is lower. In the war against terrorism, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, has indicated, these provisions are an own goal.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0810135000133"></a>Attempts have been made to persuade both Houses that this legislation contains meaningful safeguards, but, as others&#151;notably, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas&#151;have pointed out, it does nothing of the sort. There cannot be effective judicial oversight before a person is charged because there is no sufficient evidence for a court to test. If there were, the detainee would have had to have been charged. Nor can there be effective parliamentary oversight, because, as others have already said, Parliament cannot examine individual cases pre-trial because the result would be prejudice, which would prevent the trial ultimately taking place. The so-called safeguards therefore have as much substance as the back of the envelope on which they appear to have been drafted in order to push these measures past a vote in another place.</p>

I take that to be a major distinction and at the core of what we are talking about here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0810135000136"></a>Just before I rose to speak, I noticed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, straining like a greyhound in the slips, and I am sure that he will speak shortly on this matter because he has done so most eloquently both in this Chamber and in the media.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0810135000137"></a>These proposals are wholly unnecessary because the CPS has changed the basis on which most terrorist suspects are charged. We have already had some indication of it from others, but perhaps I may spell it out: most criminal charges are brought only if the prosecuting authority considers that, on the evidence currently available to it, there is a greater than 50 per cent chance of a successful prosecution. That decision must be made within 14 days of detention, except in terrorist cases, where, as a result of the earlier legislation which this Chamber passed with the assistance of the noble Lord, the authorities have 28 days to make the decision. However, the Crown Prosecution Service has adopted a different basis of charge in the majority of terrorist cases and now uses what it calls the threshold test, which permits a detainee to be charged where the evidence to show a greater than 50 per cent prospect of conviction is not yet available but the authorities on reasonable grounds believe that it will be available before trial, and where they believe that the suspect, if released, would be a danger to the public. In practice, therefore, the time available to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service is not 14, 28 or 90 days&#151;it is the whole of the period up to trial, which is commonly a year to 18 months. During that time, investigations can and do continue and evidence can be served on the defence right up to the end of the presentation of the prosecution case in court. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said at Second Reading,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000258"></a>&#147;there is no need for an artificial deadline&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/7/08; col. 645.]</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0810135000152"></a>The next argument that I disqualify&#151;and there is a shameful advertisement by Liberty in today's <I>Guardian</I>&#151;is that we propose a situation far worse than that in the United States, France and other comparable countries. Does anyone in this House really believe that charging someone with association de malfaiteurs is an adequate basis for keeping people in custody for a year and longer? I do not. Does anyone in this House believe that the French system of arresting people, not informing their lawyers and interviewing them without a tape recording is a proper basis for interrogation? A leading French juge d&#146;instruction smiled when he described it to me as&#151;I will not attempt to imitate his accent&#151;&#147;a very productive period of interrogation, monsieur&#148;.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0810135000153"></a>As for the United States of America, the noble Lord, Lord Dear&#151;I say this to him with great respect&#151;misrepresented the position in a country in which at least one citizen has been deprived of his citizenship rights and has been kept in custody for years, and where executive witness detention&#151;not executive defendant detention&#151;can keep people in custody for up to a year at a time. Let us make fair comparisons. I am always willing to meet fair comparisons, but not the traducing comparisons that we sometimes see.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0810135000154"></a>I have also heard it said that those of us who broadly support this proposal are proposing internment. I wrote a report on the definition of terrorism and studied every terrorism law in the known world. I have looked at the history of internment over the past 70 years. Perhaps I can simply dispose of that argument by saying that I hope that everyone in this House, including those who have looked at the most recent  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_505"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>record of internment in this country, shares Churchill's description of internment as,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000259"></a>&#147;in the highest degree odious&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81013-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0810135000155"></a>I shall now explain why, with one significant misgiving, I support the proposal that we are debating. I have five main reasons. The first is the range and complexity of the risk that we face, which is changing all the time. The risks of violent jihadist terrorism that we face now come from many places and countries. Some are domestic and home grown. Terrorism of that kind threatens places of mass public aggregation in this country&#151;for example, the safety of our children as they get on the bus to go to school in central London, or young people around the country who gather in, if your Lordships will forgive the old-fashioned expression, a dance hall to enjoy themselves.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0810135000156"></a>However, the risk of terrorism is now potentially far more pervasive. Terrorism potentially involving al-Qaeda supporters now spreads anywhere in the world. It includes, for example, a significant threat&#151;noble Lords should listen carefully to this because it is true&#151;to humanitarian efforts in what is sometimes called the &#147;deep field&#148;. Aid and development are seen as support for apostate regimes, hence the attack of 11 December 2007 on the United Nations headquarters in Algiers. All this is planned in an extremely complex international network, part of which is likely to be in this country and will be very difficult to unravel.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0810135000157"></a>The manifestations of terrorism around the world now include piracy in the Horn of Africa&#151;on which the French Government have been rather firmer than the United Kingdom Government&#151;and franchised al-Qaeda activities, as they are sometimes called, in north Africa, with global planning connections. It is now clear that most al-Qaeda networks have some element of contact between them. The word &#147;unravelling&#148; is entirely apposite to the kind of evidence that the authorities may have to deal with after arrest. In addition it has to be said, recognising what is happening in Pakistan, that the less than stable new Government of Pakistan are thought by many experts to represent an increased and significant security threat not just in Pakistan but to Europe and to its citizens in their own countries.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0810135000158"></a>The final point about risk is serious; it is about regeneration. There is evidence, which I think that those who are expert in the field and fully up to date will recognise, that some networks have regenerated themselves repeatedly after disruption. It is important to be able to penetrate the evidence about such networks in order to prevent regeneration.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0810135000159"></a>I turn next to evidential challenge. We have already heard something in this debate about computers, and a noble Lord opposite helpfully intervened to point out how complex these cases can be. As has already been said, the risks of which I have spoken are posed by determined and often clever people. Al-Qaeda will be listening to every word of this debate to see how much quarter is given by this Parliament. It is sometimes thought that its ideas cross the world at high speed, and they do. But the problem is that its ideas cross the world not only at very high speed but at very slow speed, too&#151;on foot, on ships, on planes. It is difficult for the authorities to bring together those strands of

It is, as has been said, highly trained in counter-intelligence, and it is learning all the time. It would be unwise in a debate such as this one to describe what it knows or to speculate what it does not know, but it does not require much imagination. One problem with an evidential challenge is that its desire to succeed is driven by a religious imperative, albeit a heretical one, in which reason can disappear into the long grass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0810135000160"></a>As has been said, making the linkages of evidence can be painstaking. We need to have appropriate and fair means to avoid releasing prematurely those who are determined to regenerate their activity and who will set out to achieve their ends come what may. Without going into detail, there really is evidence of that.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0810135000161"></a>The potential for damage can be stated in a few words: deaths between the tens and the thousands, with the numbers likely to be increased by suicide bombing. The authorities in this country have been fantastically successful in disrupting this activity. Putting it at its lowest, many hundreds of lives have been saved by them through such disruptions. The maximum of an extra 12 days, controlled as it would be, could in my view assist those disruptions.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0810135000162"></a>The enduring integrity of the law is very important to me. The one thing I dread is a horrendous event in which an airplane or a huge bomb is driven into a crowd of thousands, resulting in a huge number of deaths. We can imagine the headlines the following day. We can imagine the understandable reaction in the elected House. There would also be a very strong reaction in this House, although it would undoubtedly be more measured. I want to see an end to the constant introduction of new counterterrorism law. I want us to have a counterterrorism law that we can consolidate, and I mean consolidate formally if at all possible&#151;a codified, robust counterterrorism law which is good enough to endure, and which would endure a massive atrocity. If, heaven help us, such an atrocity takes place, I want to be able to stand up as independent reviewer and say to the Minister, as he faces pressure from his own Back-Benches in both Houses, &#147;We need no more because we&#146;ve done the job already&#148;.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0810135000163"></a>We have heard it said that we are talking about the thin end of the wedge, but I see no such argument here. I see finality in the law of detention with appropriate protection from the judges. I say to my noble friend Lord Lester that one needs only to look at what the judges have done in relation to counterterrorism law to see the level of protection that they give. I spend a lot of time talking to officials in the Home Office and a few judicial names trip off their tongues on a daily basis, knowing that they face being tested on that daily basis by those judges. I cite as an example a case at first instance, not an appellate case, R (I) v City of Westminster Magistrates&#146; Court and the Chief Constable of Manchester Police, decided on 28 August this year by Mr Justice Collins, as one of many examples of the courts being robust in testing the law, but saying that it complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. I believe there is no real evidence that it does not comply with the European Convention.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0810135000164"></a>We should also bear in mind that we have been here before. The noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, chaired a committee of Privy Counsellors some years ago. I apologise for taking so much of the Committee&#146;s time, but I feel that I should speak once. The Newton committee spoke of giving the judges more inquisitorial power. That is exactly what we have done.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0810135000165"></a>As regards proportionality, how many people are these new proposals likely to affect adversely? Let us assume that the overall effect is adverse in terms of keeping people in custody. I believe that these laws might affect a maximum of five or six people in the next four or five years. This is not the end of civil liberties as we know them. They could save many lives at home and abroad, including those of people in the humanitarian camps which the United Nations and other bodies maintain abroad. I believe, in fact, that these laws could have the effect of reducing the detention periods of some people. It is undoubtedly the case that judicial rigour would be strengthened as a result of these enactments, and I would expect the judges, in an increasingly inquisitorial role, to keep detention to a minimum.</p>

<a name="81013-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0810135000166"></a>I turn finally to my misgivings. I have real misgivings about the parliamentary role as set out in the Bill. I do not believe that the parliamentary part of this adds anything useful whatever to the provisions. It does not make them better; it does not make them worse; it does not make them safer and it does not make them less safe. They are a fig leaf. In my view, nothing would be lost if it simply disappeared from the Bill.</p>

I am concerned about the inquest proposals as they stand and I am sympathetic to the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, in relation to post-charge questioning, which is no quick fix and is actually quite a tricky proposal that may need further detailed consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0810135000172"></a>On this proposal, the chorus of disapproval is misdirected. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, that, if necessary, I am prepared to stand with her on the barricades. We could be the last man and woman standing to preserve civil liberties in this country, even if we have a slightly different view of the balance. The way in which she presented the threat, as she would have it, to the balance, is misdirected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0810135000173"></a>Before I sit down, I shall refer briefly to the threshold test, the effect of which is to charge people on a lower standard and keep them in custody for months, if not years.

My point is that if you charge people by a lower standard than is normal, the threshold test, you can keep them in custody for as long as you like. Of course they can make a bail application, but even the noble Baroness, with her persuasive skills, would have trouble persuading a judge at the Old Bailey that someone charged under the threshold test with a serious terrorism offence should have bail. The chances are that they would remain in custody for a multiplier of the extra 14 days maximum allowed by the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0810135000191"></a>I come to the matter of parliamentary scrutiny. It is worth reading out what tests have to be applied. They are,</p>
<ul><a name="0810135000260"></a>&#147;to obtain relevant evidence, whether by questioning him or otherwise ... to preserve relevant evidence, or ... pending the result of an examination or analysis of any such evidence or of anything the examination or analysis of which is to be or is being carried out with a view to obtaining such evidence ... to obtain, whether by questioning or otherwise, evidence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0810135000239"></a>Those are all questions that have to be asked by a court and by judges. They cannot be debated in Parliament because the moment they are, there will be interference in the due process of law when the chap comes up for trial. The result will be not a conviction but the release of someone because of interference by Parliament. Is that what the noble Lord wants? It is not what I want. I want the person who is guilty of an offence to be charged, locked up and sent away for a long time. That is right and proper, and it is the way that I hope we do things in this country.</p>

I agree completely with what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, said about the level and nature of the threat. The speech of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, although delivered in good part, did not have the ring of authority that the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, had. We should not treat the situation as being one in which you have to prove the level of the threat.</p>

<a name="81013-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0810135000200"></a>I approach the debate on the following basis: there is a very substantial threat that is a danger to the whole community and, if extending the number of days would assist in bringing terrorists to justice, we should do it. Unfortunately I do not accept that proposition. I accept what has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, both of whose speeches were excellent&#151;although I disagree with the final conclusion of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile&#151;about a huge amount of work having to be done involving the computers, the foreign element, and making intelligence into evidence that can be produced in court. Anyone who has been involved in these cases, such as the noble Baronesses, Lady Kennedy and Lady Mallalieu, and the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, has seen the piles of paper reflecting the huge amount of work. The critical point was made by my noble  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_512"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend Lady Mallalieu&#151;that we have recognised that you cannot possibly get that material together in 14, 28 or even 90 days. I supported both privately and publicly the increase to 90 days because I believed that the computer problems, the international problems and the fact that you had to arrest early for fear that people might be killed if you did not do so justified the extension to give the intelligence services, the police and prosecutors as much time as possible in which to construct a case.</p>

<a name="81013-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0810135000201"></a>That proposition was rejected. What happened subsequently? A pre-existing provision in the prosecutor&#146;s code&#151;the threshold test, which my noble friend Lady Mallalieu described&#151;allows you to bring charges when you have a reasonable suspicion and a likelihood that you will get the evidence within a reasonable time. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, the basis on which it operates has changed in practice. That has worked. I listened incredibly carefully to what he said, because I hold him in the greatest respect, and he also has the knowledge, having been the independent reviewer. If he had said, &#147;Well, I don&#146;t think it would work&#148;, I would have been influenced by that. Instead, he railed against the threshold test. He said that it is a bad thing. It may be a bad or a good thing, but it is there. It is the law that prosecutors currently operate. The idea that extending it from 28 days to 42 days is going to make a difference is utterly fanciful.</p>

<a name="81013-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0810135000202"></a>I have read the Home Office&#146;s documents very carefully to seek to justify the extension from 28 to 42 days. The Home Office accepts that the threshold test is now used extensively in terrorist cases and that where there is a reasonable suspicion and a likelihood of getting the evidence it is not necessary to have a 51 per cent chance. However, it says that there is a gap when it might not be possible to get the evidence &#147;within a reasonable time&#148;. I have thought very carefully about what that could mean. Are there judges in this country who, when they are told that the evidence could be obtained over the next six months, will be influenced by the fact, and say that if you had had 14 days more they might allow the prosecution to continue? It is utter nonsense.</p>

<a name="81013-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0810135000203"></a>I have experience of working with the Home Office, and I have the greatest possible admiration for Home Office officials. They write with great clarity, and if that is the best they can do to defend 42 days, it is clear&#151;just as it was clear from the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, when, instead of saying that the threshold test does not work, he railed against it&#151;that we do not need this extension from 28 to 42 days. Therefore, with a heavy heart, because I am utterly sympathetic to the Government's fight against terrorism and I completely agree with the analysis made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, of how big the threat is, I say that there is no benefit in this. It does not help at all. With a heavy heart, I am going to vote against the Government.</p>

I would remind your Lordships that in all other cases, however complex, the maximum is four days&#151;not seven days, not 14 days, not 28 days and not 42 days. Terrorist cases are not the only cases in which the police have to analyse computer records.

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0810135000212"></a>I wish to make only two points today. The first relates to the basis of the Government&#146;s argument for  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>extending the period of detention beyond 28 days, which is that 42 days might not be enough in exceptional circumstances. The trouble with that way of putting the argument is that it has probably given the impression that, in all ordinary circumstances, 28 days is acceptable. I merely remind the noble Lord, Lord West, of assurances that have been given by all his predecessors, including the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, who was in her place earlier, that the norm remains 14 days, not 28 days. I very much hope that the noble Lord, when he comes to reply, will repeat loud and clear that that is the position. It is important because judges, believe it or not, pay attention to what Parliament says. They even pay attention to what Ministers say. It is important that judges, who have the task of deciding whether to extend the time beyond 14 days, should realise that the view of this House is that 14 days, not 28 days, is the norm. I look forward to a further assurance on that point.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0810135000213"></a>My second point is that Ministers often use the increased threat as a justification for extending pre-charge detention. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, has already made that point. However, I see no connection between an increased threat and the length of time a suspect is kept and questioned in police custody. An increased threat, assuming it to be so, is surely justification for increased vigilance on the part of the Security Service, the police and all the others. It might even be justification for increased sentences as a deterrent, but surely an increased threat, assuming that it exists, does not touch on the question that we are discussing: whether the length of pre-charge detention should be extended. Surely it cannot be the government case that extending the length of pre-charge detention will act as a deterrent. Indeed, exactly the opposite must surely be the case; so far from being a deterrent, it is a step that is positively inflammatory&#151;the word used by my noble friend Lord Dear.</p>

First, most of my friends supported indefinite detention without trial in Northern Ireland. Clearly, a matter of 42 days is not an absolute matter of conscience for  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them. Nor can I understand how conscience or judgment, despite the quite remarkable speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, would allow a man to support a 90-day limit while in office, but not a 42-day limit when out of office.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0810135000219"></a>There are three substantial, practical objections to what the Government propose: first, the proposal is now so hedged about with conditions that it could verge towards being unworkable, which is a serious consideration for the Government to take in mind; secondly, it is likely to be abused by the Government and would worsen relations with minority communities from which terrorists might come; and, thirdly, it is simply not needed or wanted. As I have said, there is some force to the first objection, but if that is so, the Government can come back in a year&#146;s time to improve those procedures. On the second point, the Government have, certainly at times, tended to misuse anti-terrorism laws for other purposes, but I do not see even this Government sweeping up and detaining people with no cause whatever&#151;other, perhaps, than that they might be Muslims or something of that kind&#151;and holding them for 42 days without good cause before releasing them just for the fun of it. I simply do not believe that that is likely to happen. Nor do I believe that moderate Muslim opinion in this country would be inflamed by the fact that we have taken these measures against terrorism&#151;not against Islam, but against terrorism. That is the most important point we have to get across. Because this legislation is subject to review, it is possible for us to strike it down in the future.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0810135000220"></a>What is the positive case for the Government&#146;s proposals? There is no doubt that tracking down the evidence against a suspect from computer discs and hard drives&#151;possibly using encryption and foreign languages&#151;across continents and requiring the co-operation of foreign intelligence agencies can take time. It has been suggested that those things can take time against other criminal acts. Of course they can, but there are moments when the police are in a position where they have to decide whether to make an arrest to prevent the commission of a crime before they have begun to amass the kind of evidence that could be put to court in a prosecution. If that crime is a bank robbery&#151;ça va. A bank robbery is a very bad thing, but a terrorist crime, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, pointed out, could be a much more terrible thing.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0810135000221"></a>We have to agree that it is undesirable that even a single individual should be unjustly treated or detained, which might happen under any circumstances, whether the time period is 7, 14, 28 or 42 days. But we have to consider what is in the other balance of the scale; that is, what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, called proportionality. If the lack of this provision causes the police to fail to prevent a major terrorist outrage, what then? It might mean multiple fatalities, a strike against economically important infrastructure with great consequences, or it might mean that we fail to prevent an outrage as great as the detonation of a dirty nuclear device in a city centre, leaving it uninhabitable for years. We have to take into account that things are changing, that what was unforeseeable a while ago has become terribly foreseeable in terms of the world  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economy. What was also unforeseeable a while ago is that there is a very weak and potentially bankrupt Government in Pakistan, a country which is a nuclear power with all the dangers that that may bring to us. The weights in the scales are simply disproportionate.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0810135000222"></a>It is very difficult indeed to rectify the injustice which has been done to a dead terrorist victim. Victims have human rights just as much as suspects. Finally, I should say to my noble friends on the Front Bench&#151;to whom it will come as no surprise that I am going to support the Government today&#151;that I do so for one other reason. Let us think about the dilemma if the Government are denied these powers tonight, but at some time in the future a Conservative Administration conclude that they need them. How would that Administration go about coming back to Parliament and asking it to grant those powers? My party might come to rue the day if it wins this vote. So although I find myself in strange company&#151;not least in the company of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, with whom, as he well knows, I do not always agree, and with many Peers on the opposite side of the Chamber with whom I do not often agree&#151;when I vote with the Government tonight it is partly with the thought of protecting my friends in my party from the position in which they may find themselves if they are in government in the reasonably near future.</p>

We all appreciate the very serious threat of terrorism. If we thought that an extension of the power to detain without trial from 14 to 28 days, and then from 28 to 42&#151;or from 42 to 90, or from 90 to, as far as I can understand those on the other side, an indefinite period&#151;would actually cope with the problem, then we might need to reconsider it.

The noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, was a member of the parliamentary assembly that discussed this issue and passed a resolution which is summarised, as the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, said, in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report. For those who want to read the summary of resolution 1634, it is on page 9 of the report. It sets out the substantial objections to what the Government are now proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08101312000005"></a>The situation is well summarised in the series of reports by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which explains why we unanimously, from all parties and beyond, consider the proposed extension to be wrong in principle and unjustified in practice; why it lacks a sense of proportion; and why there are alternative adequate means of tackling the problem. It is unnecessary to bore the Committee with the detail; it is all in our reports. The proposal stains the good reputation of the Government and the UK in the wider world in upholding the rule of law and ensuring respect for human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08101312000020"></a>There is a significant difference between post-charge and pre-charge detention, and that is the difference with which we are concerned. It is not an academic difference; once one has been charged and is being detained, as is the case on the Continent as well as  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>here, a different set of safeguards arises. The noble Lord is perfectly right that in some of the continental systems, people are detained for very long periods after they have been charged. The same, of course, is true here. The question is whether pre-charge detention periods should be extended.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08101312000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, referred, quite correctly, to internment in Northern Ireland. That was a classic example of detention indefinitely without charge. To those noble Lords who say that the threat of terrorism is so appalling that we must do anything to counter it, logically their position is&#151;or should be&#151;in favour of internment, without any time limits, until the evidence has been forthcoming. That is what, at the height  of the Second World War, Winston Churchill  described as,</p>
<ul><a name="08101312000081"></a>&#147;in the highest degree odious&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08101312000075"></a>and I think he was right. We are now facing a serious threat, but no greater than when we were fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. That is why this Committee has a peculiar responsibility today to strike a fair balance, as has been said, between the need to protect the lives of our people against a serious threat of terrorism and the need to uphold our tradition as a country which respects the rule of law.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08101312000022"></a>I have come to the conclusion, even after listening with an open mind to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, that that Government have made a classic mistake. The Minister is a distinguished Navy man; perhaps he will forgive me for making a comment as an Army man. I was taught in the Army that it is a classic mistake to dig a trench, to be flushed out of it, to dig another trench, be flushed out of that, and then to be on the run. I believe that that is exactly the Government&#146;s position: they dug a trench which was indefensible; they were flushed out of it on the question of 90 days; and now they are trying to defend 42 days without, I believe, any objective justification for doing so. I very much hope that this evening&#146;s debate will be the second mutiny at Spithead, but that this one will have a better and quicker resolution.</p>

One of these officers has forwarded to me 17 foolscap sheets giving particulars of those who have no human rights at all, as they are all dead. He sent more pages giving details of the dreadful injuries to others, one of whom is a young woman who, some might argue, theoretically retains her human rights. The pity is, however, that she has no legs and, as for others who lost eyes, limbs and internal organs, that is how she will spend the rest of her life. Nothing

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08101312000025"></a>I do not accept the argument that I have heard noble Lords making that asking for an extension of maybe just hours beyond the present 28-day limit of detention would be a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda. The recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda was the invasion of an Islamic country by the USA and Britain and the fact that our troops are still in occupation. However, I concede that, if we continue to talk about 42 days&#146; detention before charge as though it were the norm and not an exception, that will both confuse and help to radicalise some impressionable young Muslims.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08101312000026"></a>It is a pity in many ways that this is a government Bill, as that certainly seems to have united the opposition to it. It is also unhelpful that the &#147;42 days&#148; epithet has, I believe, confused many people. Even some police officers who have not studied the Bill have been persuaded that, if a person suspected of a terrorist offence were arrested, that person could be detained for up to 42 days. That, of course, is totally incorrect.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08101312000027"></a>The police did not ask for any magic figure of 42 days to be included in the Bill. The extension in the most exceptional of circumstances could be for just 24 hours or perhaps for two days. However, it seems that in an effort to make any extension more acceptable the Government chose to limit that to an absolute maximum of 42 days. Therein came the opportunity to confuse; it has been a classic &#147;shooting oneself in the foot&#148; job.</p>

<a name="81013-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08101312000028"></a>The senior police officers to whom I have spoken have assured me that the proposal for 42 days was not made at their request. They are as aware of the civil rights of suspects as they are of those of past and possibly future victims and they will work to the best of their abilities within whatever parameters Parliament sets. None the less, Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick, the senior officer responsible for the counterterrorism command at New Scotland Yard, his predecessor, Assistant Commissioner Hayman, and the latter&#146;s operational deputy assistant commissioner, Peter Clarke, are firmly of the view that the time is coming when, because of the most horrific possibilities of a terrorist attack aimed at achieving maximum deaths and casualties, an extension to the present 28-day limit of detention before charge is most likely to be necessary. However, I concede that Andy Hayman was concerned, as my noble friend Lord Dear said, about the bureaucratic system that would have to be employed before such an extension were allowed.</p>

They operate with technical virtuosity across the globe, using sophisticated telecommunications and computing, with layers of encryption and in obscure languages. They operate powerful propaganda systems through the internet. They are not susceptible to reason, argument or negotiation. They are patient. They are implacable.

It is mere prudence to create a reserve power to extend pre-charge detention for a reasonable additional period. It is better also to legislate for such a contingency in advance, calmly and carefully, than to try to alter the balance between security and liberty following a terrorist outrage in the midst of a crisis. That is what the Government, rightly, seek to do.</p>

Of course, we should not surrender more than the minimum necessary of liberty and we should at all times be vigilant on behalf of our liberty, but the balance between liberty and security has always been recalibrated in time of conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08101312000037"></a>I respect the professional experience and judgment of noble Lords who have been very senior police officers, headed the Security Service, chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee or served in government as Attorney-General or Lord Chancellor. However, I am puzzled as to how they can be confident that, as technology and other complexities develop and we find ourselves in uncharted circumstances, it will never be necessary, in the interest of the safety of the public, to hold anyone in pre-charge detention for more than 28 days. What if, as my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey asked at Second Reading, the police cannot start to question a seriously injured suicide bomber for some time, or it takes some time to make safe for investigators premises where biological or radioactive materials have been kept? When an early arrest is needed in the interest of public protection or when there is more than one plot requiring simultaneous investigation, it may be necessary to hold suspects for longer before charging.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08101312000038"></a>The call by the Opposition Front Bench and the Joint Committee on Human Rights for evidence of the need to extend pre-charge detention seems unreasonable. You cannot have evidence about what has not yet happened. There can be pointers,  however; if we extrapolate past trends, we are assuredly led to conclude that longer periods of investigation before charges are preferred in terrorist cases may be needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08101312000039"></a>We were asked by some noble Lords at Second Reading, and by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer again today, to accept that the threshold test

I am not a lawyer and I may misunderstand them, but I find both those arguments less than satisfactory. I am encouraged to raise these questions by the important speech of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08101312000040"></a>If investigators do not yet have the admissible evidence to prefer a charge convincingly, how content should we be that a charge is none the less slapped on the suspect to legitimise continuing detention during the search for more evidence? The noble Lord, Lord Dear, suggested that it would be satisfactory to use what he termed &#147;second division&#148; or holding charges. As my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer reminded us, the threshold test requires that there be no more than reasonable suspicion. It may be there and may already be provided for, but that does not make it a good thing. The suspect, after being charged on the basis of a threshold test, can then be detained for months longer&#151;far beyond 42 days. Why is that preferable to the continuation of pre-charge detention up to a maximum of 42 days, authorised by a senior judge who is persuaded that there is sufficient prospect of the fuller evidence needed for a charge being found?</p>

The moment that you are charged in those circumstances, you have access to a lawyer, you know what the charge is, you are put before a court and you are in the normal judicial process. Will the noble Lord comment on that?</p>

It is rather like the French system, which the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, described to us. It makes me decidedly uncomfortable.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08101312000043"></a>If the Government insist that an adverse inference may be drawn from a suspect&#146;s exercising the right to silence under post-charge questioning, how confident can we be that the interests of justice are being served? If that insistence is not maintained, there remains the problem that continued questioning of the suspect in detention fails to secure the balance between defence and prosecution that procedures in a trial are designed to safeguard. Threshold charging and post-charge questioning will no doubt make the need to extend pre-charge detention beyond 28 days rarer, but they are not flawless means to justice. We are in the disagreeable situation in which the means to secure liberty and justice and the means to secure safety are inescapably in tension.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08101312000044"></a>Like all noble Lords, I do not want Parliament to grant excessive powers to government or their agencies to curtail civil liberties. Our enemies indeed seek to destroy the freedoms that we cherish and that we are proud to claim distinguish our political culture. To overreact to terrorist threats would indeed be to allow our enemies a victory. I agree with that argument. But I do not think that the Government are overreacting in the provision for 42 days.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08101312000045"></a>The Government have sought strenuously to ensure that civil liberties are protected in this Bill. Contrary  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_524"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, I believe that the safeguards are substantial. The Bill is in no sense a charter for arbitrary government. The Bill would make contingency provision only for the extension of pre-charge detention, which would be exceptional and never routine. The Bill does not allow the Home Secretary to invoke the power other than in circumstances of a &#147;grave exceptional terrorist threat&#148;. It does not even allow the Home Secretary to take the initiative to activate the power. The reserve power to extend pre-charge detention beyond 28 days could be activated by the Home Secretary only after she had received a joint report from the DPP and a chief constable setting out reasonable grounds for it in the existing situation. The Home Secretary must then take legal advice to ensure that all the legally prescribed conditions for activating the power have been met. Parliament would have to approve the activation of the power within&#151;now&#151;seven days. The Home Secretary's decision to activate the power would still be subject to judicial review. The Independent Reviewer of Terrorist Legislation, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, would subsequently report to Parliament within six months on the propriety of the Home Secretary's activation and use of the power and Parliament would debate his report. If the reviewer and Parliament found fault with the Home Secretary, the Home Secretary could not survive politically. That is certainly not the &#147;subjective, unfettered discretion&#148; for the Home Secretary that the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, claimed it to be in her speech at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08101312000046"></a>The Bill also contains powerful safeguards once the power is activated. It would not be for the Home Secretary to commit individuals to detention, but for a judge following application by the DPP to do so. It is not the case, as some seem to suppose, that the Government are demanding that Parliament give the Home Secretary the power to bang up anyone as a suspected terrorist at the suggestion of the spooks and the cops. Just as under existing legislation no individual can be detained beyond 48 hours without the approval of a district judge, and beyond 14 days without the approval of a senior judge, so under this Bill no one could be detained beyond 28 days without the DPP having approved the application being made and a senior judge having authorised the extension of detention. Detention could only be extended at any point after the first 48 hours for up to seven days, and after 14 days, a senior judge would have to approve each period of extension for up to a further seven days. The whole power to extend pre-charge detention beyond 28 days up to 42 days would lapse after a maximum of 60 days from inception.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08101312000047"></a>Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who anticipated that the judges would be manipulated by the Executive, I am confident that the judges would not give their approval if they were not truly convinced that an extension of detention was genuinely necessary in the interests of securing evidence to bring an appropriate charge. We can expect the judges to be sceptical and rigorous. They have a fine record of defending civil liberties against the wrongful use of power by successive Home Secretaries. In the field of terrorism, we have seen the judicial challenge to control orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08101312000048"></a>I have rehearsed these points, which must be well known to your Lordships, because I do not think that they have been given sufficient weight in the estimation of some noble Lords who are critical of the Government and because I am not always sure that the Government&#146;s critics outside Parliament are fully aware of them. Forty-two literary celebrities have taken the Liberty whip. Can such a quantity of intellectuals&#151;and quantity is presumably as important as quality here&#151;be wrong? It is not inconceivable. After all, 364 economists who write to the <I>Times</I> were wrong about the 1981 Budget. Have all the celebrity writers, as good citizens of the democracy they wish to defend, studied the detailed provisions of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08101312000049"></a>There may be flaws in some aspects of the Bill&#151;we shall need to examine the provisions for parliamentary oversight&#151;but those issues are for other debates. The issue now is simply whether there should be a power of any kind to extend pre-charge detention beyond 28 days. I believe that, with suitable safeguards, there should, and that the amendment is misconceived.</p>

<a name="08101312000050"></a><a name="81013-0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81013-0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08101312000106"></a>Lord Goodlad:</b> Briefly, I bring to the attention of the Committee the role of Parliament envisaged in Clause 28, and point out that it cannot work well and should therefore be revisited. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution, in its report of 5 August, said that, in seeking ways in which Parliament may be involved in decision-taking about police detention of terrorist suspects, the Bill risks conflating the roles of Parliament and the judiciary&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Thomas and Lord Carlile, alluded to this&#151;inviting Parliament and the judiciary to ask and answer similar questions; placing on Parliament tasks it cannot effectively fulfil; and risking undermining the right to a fair trial of the individuals concerned.</p>

<a name="81013-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08101312000051"></a>Under the Bill, an order declaring the reserve power exercisable will, like normal legislation, be expressed in general terms and will, on the face of it, merely permit the DPP to seek warrants for further detention from a court. However, the reality would be that the order would be made in relation to investigations into particular individuals. As the Home Secretary has acknowledged, the debate on an order is likely to include the &#147;outline of the plot&#148; and,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08101312000052"></a>Your Lordships&#146; committee found principled and practical difficulties with this arrangement. Members and Select Committees of both Houses would have to tread a tightrope between exercising parliamentary privilege and duty of free speech to ensure proper scrutiny while, on the other hand, avoiding remarks, individual or collective, that might serve to prejudice fair trails and threaten the independence of the judiciary. Effective debates in Parliament would need not only to avoid touching on potentially prejudicial matters but also to ensure scrutiny commensurate with the fact that individual liberty would be at stake. Parliament would operate without knowing the full factual background. The Home Secretary&#146;s legal advice would be redacted to remove material the disclosure of which might damage the public interest or prejudice a prosecution.</p>

No such further details have been provided. Your Lordships&#146; committee is unconvinced that the Government have properly thought through the proposed scheme. It expressed concern that, under the Bill, Parliament would be asked to make decisions that, in the circumstances, it is institutionally ill-equipped to determine. Far from being a system of checks and balances, the proposals before us are, in the view of your Lordships&#146; committee, a recipe for confusion that places on Parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and which could undermine the right of fair trial for any individuals concerned.

At Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, reminded us that he was wrestling with the concept of four to eight hours when he was Lord Advocate. When I was Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, I got by with seven days. I was persuaded by Mr Andy Hayman of the complexity of modern terrorist cases, and that they posed new challenges. I regret that further and more detailed investigation later proved to me that there are other means of achieving probably the same results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08101312000060"></a>It is clear that the present 28 days have proved adequate to date.

If they ever have to be met&#151;I hope that that will not happen&#151;the Bill is not the means of doing so; rather, there should be a wholly judicially supervised solution. The very safeguards that the Government have sought to insert wholly undermine its workability. Confusing parliamentary and judicial functions is a recipe for disaster. The more detailed the material provided, the more prejudicial it will be. The Home Secretary suggested topics for debate, but I fear that they lack intellectual rigour: the outline of the plot, the number of suspects

Instead of charging on a realistic prospect of conviction, it is sufficient to have a reasonable suspicion that a suspect has committed an offence. That is the lower standard. We should spell out what happens very carefully. If the second lower standard has been adopted, the crucial stage then is the bail application or an application to dismiss before a judge. By this time, at least an outline of the case will have been served on the defence. The strength of the evidence will be rigorously considered by the court and, after determination of this application, the case will have to pass the full code test within a reasonable time. There is no target of 28 days and I am confident that, as regards the reasonable time issue, the judiciary will act correctly and interpret that provision properly. The case will be reviewed by prosecutors at regular intervals and in the mean time the investigation can continue and, when available, notices of evidence supplementing and overtaking the outline will be served.</p>

He has done the Committee a great service. I, too, support the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dear.

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08101312000068"></a>The key reason for rejecting the 42-day extension on which I wish to concentrate is simply that it is not necessary. Sir Ken Macdonald, the outgoing Director of Public Prosecutions, has made this clear from the outset. I wrote to him personally on 20 May this year, asking for further information about the threshold test. I wrote because I had precisely the anxieties which motivated&#151;although I disagree with the result&#151;the rather passionate words of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew. I wanted to find out whether the threshold test was sensible and worked properly, and exactly how it operates. On 4 June I received an extremely helpful five-page reply, which can be found at appendix 3 on page 28 of the report of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution. It well repays reading because it probably answers most of the questions that have arisen. It shows that we have a satisfactory system in which all relevant cases have been charged well within 28 days. Only eight cases have gone beyond 14 days, and of those only four have had to use the threshold test for charging. This is the test of reasonable suspicion that a terrorist offence has been committed with a prospect of further evidence within a reasonable time as opposed to the full test of the code for Crown prosecutors, which is that there is already sufficient evidence to give a realistic prospect of conviction. The DPP&#146;s letter is absolutely clear that no case will go on to trial unless the prosecutor&#151;very experienced prosecutors are assigned to these cases&#151;is satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of conviction.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08101312000069"></a>The point is that in all terrorist cases, as soon as the suspect is charged he is brought immediately before the court in accordance with Article 5 of the European convention, and questions of possible bail and timetables for delivery of evidence by the prosecution, justification for any delay being sought as a result of the need for further inquiries or examination of laboratory results and a detailed timetable and summary are all presented to the court by an experienced Crown prosecutor and closely monitored and decided by a High Court judge

Thus, all the safeguards, some of which have been bolted on to the proposed 42-day procedure, already exist and are in place, decided upon not by Parliament or the Executive but by the independent judiciary, properly informed by the independent Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08101312000070"></a>I therefore believe that the whole House can be satisfied that all the proper procedures are already in place. The extension to 42 days is not merely unnecessary but is disproportionate, as I think is widely agreed in this House. It is likely to cause at least some members of the Muslim community to feel victimised. The so-called safeguards are contrary to principle, almost certainly unworkable and risk damaging the prospects of a fair trial. These are powerful objections and I very much hope that this unwise proposal will be rejected.</p>

When you have a threshold test to charge, it is certainly a relevant point, but the Director of Public Prosecutions explains in his letter that only eight cases have had to go beyond the 14 days and only four of them have had to use the threshold test.

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08101328000003"></a>I have lost count of the times that I have spoken in this House for an increase in pre-charge detention, and the arguments have not changed. They have not changed because the reasons for the need for them have not changed. I am as convinced now as I have ever been that having a maximum of 28 days in our legal system is inadequate for the terrorist challenge that we face. The senior police officers who are&#151;listen carefully to the adverbs that I use&#151; currently, directly and operationally involved in counterterrorism all say that they believe that we need more than 28 days and that they need more than 28 days. What has changed under the Bill is the way in which the Government propose to meet the requirements. This is a reserve power, to extend the pre-charge detention limit up to 42 days. The need for this falls broadly under two headings. I shall be brief, because most of the arguments are well known.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para5"></a>

Early intervention in terrorist cases is necessary because of the self-evident risk in allowing a case to run to obtain evidence. Police intervention is forced to be much earlier than in other criminal cases. As for the growing scale and complexity of cases, there is no doubt that, pace the noble Earl, Lord Onslow&#151;you only need to look at the recent cases to see this without having to be told&#151;there has been a great increase.</p>

The fact that the director-general of MI5 has said that in public, and the fact that he does not produce chapter and verse of the proof for the committee that the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, sits on, is not very surprising. The former director-general&#151;who is in her place&#151;enumerated that there was an increasing risk in her time, and the current director-general has also cogently explained that there is an increasing risk. The Home Secretary has also said so. Given those sources, there is no doubt about that. People can see it for themselves in the number of cases that are coming into the courts.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08101328000007"></a>There are at least 2,000 terrorist suspects, with 200 networks or cells and 30 active plots. Is that not evidence, when someone who knows what they are talking about says that? The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, says that he is convinced of an increasing threat. The evidence is overwhelming. I will not enumerate the staggering statistics about computers and disks that have to be dealt with now after any arrest. The sophisticated complexity of the material; the enormous increase in computer product, which is often encrypted; the multiple identities of suspects, whereby it can take considerable time to establish who an arrested person actually is; the global reach of the contacts involved, which often means reliance on foreign security and intelligence services for information and for operational assistance, are all factors.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08101328000008"></a>As I have said in this House before, we are very lucky to have security and intelligence services with a long history of close and successful relations with foreign services, which have often been built up slowly and painstakingly over the years. It is a mistake to think that this is easy or automatic, or that such liaisons can ever be taken for granted. Liaison services have vastly different levels of competence, resources and speed of working. In addition, they will pass on only what does not conflict with their own national interest. All that can mean time-consuming waits for information that our services need to proceed with a case.</p>

I said on Second Reading and I now repeat that I have never before known a Home Secretary to consult so widely on a Bill. No one pretends that these attempts to satisfy concerns about civil rights and parliamentary control will be easy to implement; in fact it would be much easier to do without them. I understand the reservations of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, about parliamentary involvement in this process. In what I consider to be an authoritative and impressive intervention, he made a very powerful case. He gave his reasons, given his absolutely unparalleled experience of being the independent reviewer in the field of terrorism and terrorist cases, and he made the case for why he believes that we need to go to 42 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08101328000010"></a>It has already been said that it is ironic that criticism of those very provisions&#151;parliamentary involvement and the safeguards&#151;is coming from those who are most concerned about civil rights. Those provisions were brought in to try to meet the requirements of safeguarding civil rights. This is an honest and brave attempt to balance the operational security requirements of the law enforcement agencies to defend the public with the requirements of civil rights. As such, it deserves our support.</p>

I have listened carefully to the debate this afternoon. Underpinning the disagreement on the amendment is where the balance needs to be struck between an emphasis on national security and upholding civil liberties. It is understandable that any Government would wish to put great weight on the need for national security, for protecting their citizens is the basic duty of any Government. Those of us not in government can reflect further on the balance that must be struck, particularly if, were we to get it wrong, our national security would be weakened and not strengthened through groups in society feeling that they were being targeted and treated unfairly.</p>

I spend a lot of my time looking at the degree to which the police services, and, I am sure, the intelligence services, are stretched to full capacity in investigations that are graded as high priority. We cannot view that with complacency.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08101328000017"></a>We have also discussed risk, which, in terms of terrorism, has been transformed in the past 10 to 15 years. The objective of the terrorists is not to make a specific point but to inflict mass casualties. There is a desire to do &#147;better&#148; than has been done before. There is also the recognition that the individuals concerned will die in the course of taking that action. That means that the decision on when to intervene in any prospective plot is that much more difficult. You have to intervene earlier to avoid running the risk of possibly horrible and appalling loss of life. That is the dilemma that is faced, and it is why it is necessary for the Committee to debate these provisions.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08101328000018"></a>Much has been made of the complexity of the cases. A recent example involved the seizure of some 200 or 300 computers. A modern computer contains a terabyte of memory, which is the equivalent of 50,000 trees, cut down, converted to paper and printed on both sides. If that material is encrypted or is written entirely in Arabic or, perhaps more significantly, if it contains significant material hidden in files which have been given such innocuous labels as &#147;holiday photographs&#148;, it is an enormous task to sift through it. That is why time is needed, because of the relationships that have to be pursued, as my noble friend Lady Ramsay said, in international jurisdictions.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08101328000019"></a>In our discussions, we have heard much about the threshold test. I had a brief exchange with my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton on this point. As I understand it&#151;although I may be corrected by the massed ranks of noble and learned colleagues in this Committee&#151;the decision on making a prosecution, whether or not with a reduced threshold, has to be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service. Before this provision can be implemented, the director of that service has to certify that a prosecution is necessary. This new power is a reserve power which can be used only in the event that things cannot otherwise be dealt with. Because it is a reserve power and because it requires the consent, approval and recommendation of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it can be invoked only in circumstances in which the lower threshold test has not proved satisfactory, or when the other matters that noble Lords have raised mean that the legislation is needed. Those are the only circumstances in which this failsafe will come into force.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08101328000020"></a>The reality is that this proposal is designed to protect in the event of other things failing. It can be implemented only after what has been described as a tortuous and difficult process. It should be a tortuous and difficult process. However, the provision is there for a reason. It is there because, although there may be a threat to civil liberties in any instance where someone is detained for longer than 28 days&#151;and probably for longer than 14 days, and probably longer than seven

As a relative newcomer to this place, I can only say that it shows itself at its best when issues such as this are debated. Notwithstanding sniping from some quarters, the nation is fortunate that such a Chamber still exists to air, in a rather less party political and partisan context, matters of crucial national importance. I hope that such debates here allow consideration of the argument rather than the expression of preconceived political ideas.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08101328000026"></a>No one likes holding people in custody without charge. I can assure noble Lords that the police investigate all cases as quickly as possible and that they would not detain anyone for longer than is absolutely necessary. It is disappointing that some Members of the Committee seem to think less of the police than that. Indeed, when applying to the court for an extension of detention, the police have to present strong evidence for further detention. Judges&#151;and I have considerable faith in judges, particularly since the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, told me they pay attention to Ministers&#151;would not grant extensions of detention where they did not believe that the investigation was being pursued diligently and expeditiously. Judges can, as they have in the past, grant less than the full seven-day extension requested, or no extension at all if they feel that further detention is not justified. All of us would prefer to be in a position where a charge could be brought within 48 hours. But we are in a different world today, as a number of noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08101328000027"></a>When it comes to terrorism, particularly modern-day terrorism, we cannot always expect to uncover the crucial evidence that can found a charge immediately on arrest. If the police wait until after a crime is committed to make an arrest, we may have scores, hundreds or even thousands of casualties. In securing a successful prosecution, it would often be advantageous to wait and gather further evidence, because conspiracy to commit an act is notoriously difficult to prove. But the risks of waiting too long and allowing another 7/7 or 9/11 are far too great. I would always prefer the police and agencies&#151;and I make this point to them&#151;to err on the side of the safety of our people and not to delay acting because they may be aware of a time constraint when framing a charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08101328000028"></a>We as a Government often face the issue that we are wrestling with today in this Committee: balancing the safety of the majority of our population against the freedom of the individual. I am certain where our duty

Those who are not in power, and particularly those who are never likely to be in power, have the privilege of arguing in the abstract. They are not faced with the harsh realities of being accountable to the nation for their decisions. However, this Committee has already understood the force of the argument and the necessity to change the legislation, and that it would be inconceivable in the present circumstances to return to 48 hours. Parliament has already accepted the need for 14 days&#146; detention as the norm and, exceptionally, 28 days&#146; pre-charge detention in terrorist cases. So today&#146;s debate is not on a matter of principle, on an extension beyond a matter of hours or on Magna Carta; it is more on a prosaic judgment as to whether 28 days is enough to ensure our safety or whether we need slightly more. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, we may need 12 days or so extra. It does not have to be 12 days; it could be a matter of a day or hours.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08101328000029"></a>Why do experts believe that there may be an occasion when more than 28 days will be required? I have already touched on the need to act quickly. I make no apologies, because it is important, for referring again to what former deputy assistant commissioner Peter Clarke said of the Dhiren Barot case. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101328000138"></a>&#147;there was not one shred of admissible evidence&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08101328000130"></a>at the point of arrest. Barot was subsequently sentenced to 40 years&#146; imprisonment. After moving quickly, the evidence has to be sought and compiled. The difficulties of doing so are growing exponentially, as a number of noble Lords have understood and spoken about. Again, I make no apologies for reiterating some figures. In 2001, when police investigated the last major IRA case, they had to analyse the contents of one computer and a handful of floppy disks. Three years later in 2004, in the Dhiren Barot case, 270 computers and 2,000 computer disks had to be analysed. In addition, the inquiries extended across eight other countries and jurisdictions. In a recent ongoing case, 30 addresses were searched within two hours and 400 computers, plus 8,000 disks, were seized for analysis.</p>

<a name="81013-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08101328000030"></a>The terrorists learn quickly from their mistakes and our successes. They make much more use of encryption and different communication devices, and they move across borders using numerous names and numerous countries to store, access and hide material. They have steadily become more aware of all our capabilities, particularly those relating to intercept. The consequence of all this&#151;and I have not even added the extra delays that would be caused by contamination of evidence if the plot involved CBRN, to which a couple of noble Lords referred&#151;is that more and more time is required to gather the evidence and to charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08101328000031"></a>We have not required more than 28 days up to now, so what is the reason for the change? That is the question that a number of people asked, including the noble Lord, Lord Dear. The situation was exactly the same when we extended the period from seven to 14 days and from 14 to 28 days. On neither of those occasions had there been a case that required more than the existing time limit, but all the trends showed us that it would happen because of the complexity to

Such an extension was required and then used.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08101328000032"></a>In every arm of government and in the commercial world one has to make serious decisions based on predictions and trends. That cannot be avoided. The analysis now leads inevitably to the conclusion that more than 28 days will, before long, be required. But would such powers be used indiscriminately by our police? A number of noble Lords referred to that. I have rather more faith in our police than some people and organisations seem to exhibit, and in this context it is well worth noting that the police have not needed or used more than 14 days in the past 14 months because there has been no requirement to do so. There have been no plots of the complexity that requires that length of investigation. I have to say&#151;this is not giving anything away&#151;that at present all our intelligence indicates that that might not remain the case for long. I digress here and mention the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who said that the threat has not increased. I am afraid that the threat has increased dramatically, and that has been stated very clearly. We are monitoring 2,000 people, and the things that regularly cross my desk are daunting. There is a greatly increased threat, which we have to manage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08101328000033"></a>However, I understand the concerns of those who say, &#147;Hang on a minute. If we go down this route we could end up with 300 days, 500 days or whatever&#148;, Indeed, it was concern about how far we should go that led me to express doubts about the 56 days that was talked about last year.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08101328000034"></a>I have no easy answer to this. Rather, it has to be a question of judgment using pragmatism, common sense and knowledge of all the issues. I believe&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, touched on this as well&#151;that 42 days is about right, bearing in mind that we are looking at going beyond 28 days, and at the moment, using my professional judgment, pragmatism and common sense, I do not envisage additional complexities that would require more than that. I cannot say that that is any more than a judgment&#151;I do not know the exact answer&#151;but it will be only the most exceptional, complex and serious cases that require more than 28 days.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08101328000035"></a>What of those who have been saying that more than 28 days is not required? Most of them of course are interested laypersons and not experts. Many call in aid senior police officers, serving and retired. I can say only that ACPO, the chief constables of all the forces where the bulk of terrorists have been apprehended&#151;not those from some of the shires&#151;and, more recently, retired senior police officers who spent time in post handling these complex operations, rather than those who have been retired longer, all believe that more than 28 days will be required at some stage in the future. Indeed, this morning I had a phone call from Chief Constable Ken Jones. He phoned me to say, &#147;Best of luck. Charge of the Light Brigade&#148;, or something like that, but then he said, &#147;I do hope you manage to get it through because there will be a case where we need more than 28 days&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08101328000036"></a>Noble Lords have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of terrorism, who, more than any other non-operational person, has access to information on terrorist investigations. He is convinced that at some stage more than 28 days will be required.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08101328000037"></a>Andy Hayman, former assistant commissioner for special operations at Scotland Yard, has been quoted at length. I shall set out exactly what he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08101328000136"></a>&#147;As someone who has been deeply involved in every major counter-terrorism investigation since 2005, I am convinced that we will soon need the power to hold suspects for more than the current limit of 28 days&#151;and that we need to legislate for that power now rather than in the middle of an emergency&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101328000131"></a>I have to say that I am sure that there will be a need to go beyond 28 days.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08101328000038"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon asked whom we have consulted. I could go into detail on this but over four months we consulted more than 100 organisations, the judiciary, legal organisations, police forces, the CPS and the DPP, and the DPP was consulted before the Bill was introduced.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08101328000039"></a>I asked myself whether there was any way of avoiding extensions by using technology or perhaps using other legislation. These were the very issues that I wanted to investigate last year when I was falsely accused of a U-turn. I was glad to hear the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, accuse me of that again. It was an interesting interlude in my life but at least it brought the new phrase, &#147;Doing an Admiral West&#148;, into the drivers&#146; lexicon, so it was not all bad.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08101328000040"></a>The short answer to whether technology or other legislation will remove the need to extend is no, and certainly using intercept as evidence or post-charge questioning are not silver bullets to achieve this end. I do not intend to go into detail on using intercept as evidence but we are pursuing the recommendations of the Chilcot review at full speed on a cross-party basis.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08101328000041"></a>I looked at the question of technology but it cannot resolve the time aspects of analysing ever growing amounts of computer data, not least because there are choke points where only a limited number of assets can be brought to bear and the need to go through other jurisdictions and languages is incredibly time-consuming. Some of them do not want to help us; it takes a long time.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08101328000042"></a>So what of using other legislation or other charges? Let us take the threshold test, for example. I think that I have three pages on that. I could go through them or I could say that I am afraid that it does not meet all our requirements. It has been debated at length and I shall spare the Committee those three pages. The threshold test does not achieve what we want.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08101328000043"></a>We have of course looked at whether the Civil Contingencies Act could provide a workable model, but we, the Home Affairs Select Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, and the police have all concluded that it is not the answer. This is primarily because the Act was not designed to provide for extensions of detention in terrorist-related cases and it would give rise to considerable legal and other difficulties if we tried to use it in that way.</p>

There would have to be a challenge through the courts to show that but I do not believe that it does; I think that we have all the right safeguards in place.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08101328000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Imbert, made very clear during Second Reading that using spurious minor charges and then post-charge questioning was not the correct way to do business in this country, and I agree entirely with that. The DPP is totally against holding charges of the type that the noble Lord, Lord Dear, talked about. They are contrary to our legal system. As a throwaway comment, I have to add that it is ridiculous to say that you are entitled to legal representation post-charge but to suggest that there is no legal representation or access to a lawyer pre-charge. There is.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08101328000047"></a>I am convinced that there will be a complex case in the future where the police will need more than 28 days to bring the appropriate charges, and there is no way of avoiding that stark fact. That is why we are proposing contingency, or what I sometimes call&#151;perhaps somewhat inelegantly&#151;back-pocket legislation, to enable the 28-day limit to be increased in exceptional circumstances, and then only for a very limited period. What is the balance of risk? As a Minister, I have to ask that. If I am wrong&#151;and my goodness, I hope that I am&#151;there will be no such complex plot and the limit will never be extended above 28 days under the powers in this Bill. But if the proposed legislation is rejected and the Government and the experts are right about needing more than 28 days, it could mean that dangerous terrorists are released to commit atrocities or destroy other potential prosecutions. They will not be brought to justice for the terrorist crimes that they have committed.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08101328000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred to the Overt trial. I have to be careful.

I throw that to the Floor.</p>

Complete checks need to be made all the time as such people will be able to use their phones and perhaps unravel cases that may be going on against someone else. They will not be found guilty of something they intended to do, which is possibly to kill thousands of our people. That cannot be right and we must try to avoid that from happening.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08101328000055"></a>As a Government, we feel that the imbalance in that risk is simply too great and not legislating is a risk we should not take with the lives of our population. Having made that decision, how can we safeguard the rights of individuals caught up in this process? There has been detailed consultation across the board on this issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, pointed out that she has never known so much consultation by a Home Secretary. The other place demanded a number of extra safeguards, including stronger parliamentary involvement. A number of people from all parties decided that.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08101328000056"></a>I have to be careful what I say, but to my mind the judicial safeguards that already exist are without a doubt the most important to secure an individual&#146;s rights. It is important to remember that a judge may grant extensions for only a few more hours&#151;or maybe a day&#151;over the 28-day limit, but in highly pressured situations where the CPS and police are trying to secure sufficient evidence to charge, those additional few hours may make all the difference. Additionally, the fact that the DPP has to submit a bid in conjunction with a senior police officer to the Home Secretary before the Home Secretary may increase the detention limit adds further to that protection. As we know, the current DPP would look at that in great detail if he were about to do it. The fact that the Home Secretary has to go before the House, as has been pointed out by noble Lords, will focus that Home Secretary&#146;s mind. I do not believe that it will be done lightly.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08101328000057"></a>I was concerned, as are a number of others in the Committee, that the safeguards had become rather cumbersome. Indeed, I was very concerned, so specifically asked ACPO if they were workable. It said, &#147;Yes. The  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_539"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposal is a bit clumsy but it is workable&#148;. That is good enough for me. As the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said, we can readdress it in the future anyway. Some have suggested that there may be confusion between the role of Parliament and the judiciary. I can understand that, but it represents a misreading of the provisions. The role of Parliament is to discuss and, if so minded, approve the order-making power to apply for and grant up to 42 days&#146; detention. The courts, in contrast, assess on a case-by-case basis whether the police and CPS need more time to collect and examine evidence in order that a charge may be brought. I believe that it is the judiciary that safeguards the rights of the individual.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08101328000058"></a>Concern has been expressed about parliamentary debate being limited. I could go into the things that could be debated, but there is no point, as I identified the key balance between the two. As I have already said, ACPO considers this to be workable, and although it is rather inelegant, it possibly gives more protections for those caught up in the process. Clearly Members from all parties in the other place felt they wanted those, so they got them.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08101328000059"></a>A great deal of nonsense has been talked about global comparisons. First, I should say that as long as our legal system is compatible with our human rights obligations&#151;I am entirely satisfied that the Bill&#146;s proposals are compatible&#151;I do not really care what other countries do. My prime concern is the safety of our citizens and visitors to this country. I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and others, delude themselves if they think that people in these other countries are held for these short times. I am constantly talking to my opposite number. I will not go into detail&#151;I get into enough trouble as it is&#151;but I assure you that you are bloody lucky to live in this country. That is all I would say. I do not intend to go into the detail here, but I might do so on a private one-on-one basis. I also never cease to be amazed how people who despise and hate our country and who are here illegally fight tooth and nail to avoid being sent to any other jurisdiction. I try to send them to all sorts of others, but they do not want to go to any of them.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08101328000060"></a>Finally, and importantly, there is understandable concern that this proposed back-pocket measure will alienate communities. That is an important point. I am particularly proud of the advances we have made in the past 15 months with the &#147;prevent&#148; strand of our counterterrorist strategy. We have done a great deal in that area. In the case of this Bill we have undertaken extensive consultation, including with representatives from Muslim communities and other faith and community groups. It was quite clear that pre-charge detention was in no way near the top of their concerns and we have seen no evidence to suggest that the 28-day limit has undermined their support in dealing with terrorism. However, as we have made clear, we will undertake a review of the impact of counterterrorism legislation on the Muslim community.</p>

I said that we saw no evidence to suggest that this undermined their support. My noble friend talks of patronising. I fear that sometimes people are rather patronising on this subject. Muslim communities are no different from any others in that they want criminals caught and prosecuted and want the police to have the powers to do that. Some people patronise them. The Bill contains measures to enhance and protect national security and it is for the greater good of all communities, including Muslims, who are an integral part of our society. I think that they see that as well.</p>

<a name="81013-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08101328000063"></a>I have spoken at length but make no apology as this is an important matter which, if we get wrong, we could all live to regret. When the need for more than 28 days arrives&#151;and it certainly will&#151;we can either have a well considered and debated back-pocket measure in place ready to make available to prosecutors or we will be forced to release terrorists on to our streets, unless some hurried legislation is passed and we all know that hurried legislation in a period of emergency is bad legislation. I assure the Committee that whoever is in power will find it a very uncomfortable moment.</p>

That is probably given on both sides. I have listened very closely to what successive DPPs said. They do not need it now; neither do they see a need in the future. Please note that they are the people who make the decision on the ground while the clock is running. I have heard no challenge to the suggestion&#151;more than a suggestion&#151;that I and many others have put forward that it is possible to use existing law when running through the 28-day process to charge what, with the greatest respect to him, the Minister called holding charges. They are not holding charges. No one can say that charges of possession of explosive materials or preparatory acts of terrorism are holding charges. They are serious in their own right. If the investigation is continued beyond that point, and the prime offence is charged later, then so be it.

It is for the courts to decide whether the prosecution is delaying. The courts have many resources for forcing the prosecution to bring the case as speedily as possible&#151;it is no good the noble Lord raising his eyebrows because that is a fact. That is a perfectly justifiable way of going forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08101328000073"></a>I was disappointed that the Minister should almost in one line, and getting a laugh in the process, overlook the fact that common-law countries do not even approach 28 days. The nearest is 12 days. The argument follows immediately: if they can make do with 12 days or single figures, why are we looking, in any circumstances, to go to 42 days?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08101328000074"></a>Lastly, ACPO is divided. It agrees with that. Andy Hayman, who is recently out of office as an assistant commissioner, said that the proposals are bureaucratic, convoluted and unworkable. He was supported by a range of law officers in your Lordships' House: the noble and learned Lords, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, Lord Lyell of Markyate, Lord Morris of Aberavon and Lord Falconer of Thoroton, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. One could go on. If they do not know rather more than ACPO, then I am not sure what we should be debating today.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, with your permission, I would like to make a Statement on this morning&#146;s announcement on the implementation of the proposals I announced last week. Again, I hope the House will understand that it was necessary for me to issue a market notice this morning, ahead of the markets opening.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In my Statement to the House last Wednesday, I outlined the principles of the Government&#146;s proposals to restore confidence in the banking system and put banks on a stronger footing&#151;essential steps in helping the people and businesses of this country&#151;and support the economy as a whole. Since then, there have been intensive discussions with UK banks and institutions. I can today set out to the House how the principles set out last Wednesday are being applied.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Let me first remind the House of the three key elements of the measures I outlined last week: first, to inject sufficient liquidity into the financial system now; secondly, to make available at least &#163;50 billion of capital, should it be required, to recapitalise the UK banking system; and, thirdly, to provide a guarantee on eligible new debt to support medium-term lending between banks. These measures aim to unblock the inter-bank lending system and strengthen UK institutions, so that banks can start lending to people again. This is necessary, both to stabilise the banking system and to support the wider economy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;No country alone can solve the global problem. At the weekend, at both the G7 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting and at the IMF, it was clear that the three elements of last week&#146;s proposals will be essential parts of any global recovery plan. Yesterday, the Prime Minister had discussions with European Union leaders and they too agreed that this was the right way to stabilise and rebuild the banking system.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Today, many European Union Governments have announced how they plan to support their financial systems. So it is increasingly clear that the measures I am announcing today form the basis of an international consensus on the right response to these events.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_546"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 546</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Let me set out to the House the detail of today&#146;s announcement, which covers both liquidity and capital. Turning first to the funding of the banking system&#151;or liquidity&#151;the Bank of England will continue supplying sufficient short-term funds. This will include, from today, an unlimited amount of dollar funds available to banks to be swapped for sterling funds and continued loan operations through the special liquidity scheme.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Additionally, today I have announced details of the Government guarantee scheme for new lending between banks&#151;an essential part of banks resuming lending to people and businesses. The guarantee under the scheme will be provided by Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury directly. It will be temporary, covering new lending issued during a six-month period, but this period is renewable. It will be priced on commercial terms, which can be varied at the Treasury&#146;s discretion, but initially set at a premium of 50 basis points above the recent average cost of default insurance for each of the participating banks. It is risk-based. The guarantee scheme will be available only to those banks and institutions which participate in the Government&#146;s recapitalisation scheme, as I made clear last week.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The banks taking part in this scheme are given the option of raising capital in the open market in the usual way or through the Government&#146;s bank reconstruction fund. When raising capital through the reconstruction fund, the participating banks receive an investment from the Government in return for shares.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Let me outline, in turn, the position of each of the eight major UK banks and building societies which agreed to the recapitalisation proposals last week. Santander has agreed to transfer &#163;1 billion of capital into its UK operations. Barclays will raise more than &#163;10 billion by next spring, through a combination of preference and ordinary shares, raised from private sources and other measures.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;HSBC announced last Friday that it will raise &#163;750 million of new capital for its UK operation in the open market. Standard Chartered has announced that it has already met its agreed capital requirements. Nationwide Building Society has announced that it will increase its capital base by &#163;500 million.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Let me now outline how HBOS, Lloyds TSB and RBS will be recapitalised through the bank reconstruction fund. Subject to take-up by existing shareholders, the Government will take significant shareholdings in these banks, in one case a majority stake. In line with normal commercial practices, the Government on behalf of taxpayers will have appropriate representation on their boards. These shareholdings will be managed on a fully commercial basis by an arm&#146;s-length body with a precisely defined remit to act in the interests of taxpayers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Government support in respect of these three banks is tied to conditions covering executive pay and dividend policies. Conditions have also been agreed with them on the level of lending to small businesses and homebuyers. We are making it clear that there will need to be a strong focus at these recapitalised banks on making available lending for  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_547"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 547</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>small business and homebuyers. These conditions are set out in the individual agreements with the banks, copies of which will be placed in the Library.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the case of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the Government will purchase both ordinary and preference shares once the merger is complete. HBOS will receive up to an &#163;8.5 billion investment into newly issued ordinary shares on completion of the merger. The Government will also invest up to &#163;4.5 billion into newly issued ordinary shares of Lloyds TSB at completion. At the same time, we will invest up to an additional &#163;4 billion in preference shares in the merged institution, with &#163;3 billion of which being invested in HBOS and &#163;1 billion in Lloyds TSB.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In return for this investment, which potentially represents around 44 per cent of the proposed merged bank, the Government will appoint two independent board members. No cash bonuses will be paid to any board member this year. Directors in HBOS will be asked to relinquish their rights to bonuses and directors in Lloyds TSB will receive restricted stock instead of cash for any 2008 bonus entitlements. The availability of lending to homeowners and small businesses will be maintained to at least 2007 levels, and greater support will be given to people experiencing difficulties with mortgage payments to help them stay in their homes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;For RBS, the Government will take up to &#163;15 billion of ordinary shares and &#163;5 billion of preference shares. This potentially represents a 63 per cent interest in the bank, in return for which the Government will appoint three independent board members. Again, no bonus will be awarded to any board member this year, and any bonus paid next year will be in stock and linked to long-term growth in the bank. Mortgage and SME business lending availability will be maintained at 2007 levels, to the benefit of people up and down the country. These steps will help put RBS on a stronger footing and allow it to build on its core retail banking operation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;These announcements represent a total recapitalisation of just under &#163;50 billion for the eight major banks, in line with my announcement on Wednesday. And as I said then, more capital is available to smaller institutions, should they need it. The Government do not want to run Britain&#146;s banks; they want to rebuild them. The long-term future of UK banks lies in the private sector. We will aim to sell the public share in the participating banks as soon as feasibly possible. Our objective today is to stabilise and rebuild, and we will maintain our stake for as long as it takes to do that.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I want to say a few words about the Icelandic banks. I met the Icelandic Finance Minister in Washington at the weekend, and I made it very clear that it is imperative that we work together to resolve the position of creditors in this country. Our authorities have set up an arrangement, agreed in principle, for an accelerated payout to depositors. We are also working with the Icelandic authorities to facilitate claims by UK charities and local authorities on their deposits held at these Icelandic banks. In

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;All the operations of the Bank Reconstruction Fund will give the Government a capital stake&#151;an investment&#151;so the money we borrow is exchanged for valuable assets, and because some of these shares are purchased on preferential terms, the Government are better protected and get a better return. The Government guarantee to support new lending between banks will be charged on full commercial terms, ensuring that the taxpayer is appropriately rewarded. The injections of liquidity, through the SLS and other operations, simply allow banks to swap securities with the Bank of England, so the risk remains with the banks, not the taxpayer. In other words, we get the money back. So any additional borrowing and debt incurred by the Government as a result of these proposals is either in return for assets charged at commercial rates, or in the form of a temporary loan to the banks. So, as was the case with the temporary nationalisation of Northern Rock, the most appropriate measures of government borrowing and debt to judge the position of the public finances will be ones that exclude the Government&#146;s stake in the banking sector.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The principles which I announced last week are now being adopted across the major world economies. It is essential that Governments work together, decisively and quickly, not only to stabilise the system today but also take action to prevent these problems happening again in the future. That is why we have to work together to improve international supervision. Tomorrow, this House will see the Second Reading of the Banking Bill, a further step towards making our system more robust.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Today&#146;s announcement is a necessary and significant step to restoring confidence in the banking system and making it resilient in the future. These proposals fully respect the rights of existing shareholders, and despite current market conditions, the UK banking sector can have confidence about its future. These are very turbulent times in financial markets, but I believe these measures are essential to stabilise the financial system and help the UK economy. We are committed to do whatever it takes to stabilise the banking system, protect savers and taxpayers, and support the wider economy&#148;.</p>

The Minister will not expect these Benches to rejoice in the fulfilment of the Labour Party&#146;s 1983 manifesto threat to take one or more banks into national ownership in order to control their lending and other policies. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that these are extreme times and that extreme actions are necessary, and we will continue to work constructively with the Government, including on the Banking Bill which will reach us soon. Last week, I wished the package that was announced

Clearly it did not, which is why we have ended up with the part nationalisation measures today. For the sake of our economy, I also wish today&#146;s measures well, and I hope that they will succeed.</p>

<a name="81013-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08101328000093"></a>Will the Minister say how the Government measure success? We believe that success cannot be scored unless the real economy is protected from recession, or at least from a prolonged one. However, the Government have continually refused to update their official growth statistics, and the lack of a growth forecast is a real problem, and this is despite the fact that all the emerging statistics and the professional consensus are in comprehensive disagreement with the Government. Will the Government now come clean on the economic prospects for the country, because we believe that Parliament and the country as a whole should be informed of the forecast and what difference this package of measures will make?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08101328000094"></a>Last Wednesday, the Government announced that they would invest up to &#163;50 billion in preference shares in UK banks. There was no hint of taking equity stakes of such dimensions that the end result would be outright control of one major UK bank and a de facto controlling interest in another. Were the Government not in possession of the full facts last week? Can the Minister explain the Government&#146;s change of mind?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08101328000095"></a>I hope that the Minister will also clarify the nature of the obligations that the banks which are taking the Government&#146;s equity support will make. This morning&#146;s announcement referred to,</p>

<p><a name="08101328000132"></a>This was described as &#147;madness&#148; on FT Alphaville, while the Council of Mortgage Lenders doubted whether it would be &#147;either prudent or desirable&#148;. Are the Government really saying that they want to hardwire those heady days of 2007 lending, including the house price bubble, into the system? Do the Government take a different view from most of the market; namely, that the banking system must be deleveraged? Indeed, is that not what would normally result from the significant increases in tier 1 and core capital that the banks are now embarking upon?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08101328000096"></a>Today&#146;s announcements deal with the capitalisation of the largest banks, and this will cost taxpayers &#163;37 billion. The others will take self-help measures, doubtless to avoid the interference that the Government&#146;s shareholdings would involve. This morning&#146;s announcement stated that the Government would stand ready to provide similar support to all eligible institutions. Can the Minister say how much taxpayers&#146; money the Government expect to spend on other banks? Has the FSA concluded its discussions on capital requirements with all other eligible institutions? There are obvious dangers, if only to the confidence within the banking system, if there are still unresolved issues. Can the Minister say whether the FSA is now content with the capitalisation plans of all eligible institutions and, if not, when we may expect that process to be concluded?</p>

What can the Minister say about protecting taxpayers&#146; interests?

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08101328000098"></a>The Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, at lunchtime today on the radio said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08101328000137"></a>&#147;Many lessons have been learned over what has gone on in the last 10 years ... we probably allowed a boom to go on for too long&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101328000133"></a>We agree with that and we know who was in charge for the past 10 years. The Government are all too ready to blame the US or global conditions for our current problems, but the fact is that our economy was ill equipped to cope with the bust that inevitably followed the boom.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08101328000099"></a>The &#163;300 billion package that the Government are committing to the equity plus guarantee package is roughly 19 per cent of our GDP. This is a higher percentage than any of the packages announced by any of the other countries in the EU and is nearly four times the 5 per cent that the US is committing. Can the Minister explain how it is that the crisis was nothing to do with us but is costing us the most?</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08101328000100"></a>The Chancellor said in his Statement that we should not count the extra borrowing to fund this package as government borrowing. Does not the Minister agree that it is clear that the ONS will do just that? The Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates that adding in all the extra borrowing since the Chancellor&#146;s last Budget, including these latest measures, will push borrowing above 50 per cent of GDP. Does the Minister recall the last time that this happened? It was in 1976, when the Labour Government went cap in hand to the IMF. Do the Government have any idea when they expect to return debt to more manageable levels?</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08101328000101"></a>I appreciate the Minister&#146;s difficulties&#151;he is not a full-time Treasury Minister&#151;in responding to detailed questions, but I am not alone in having been disappointed last week with the Minister&#146;s rate of non-response to the questions that were put to him. I hope that today he will give a more comprehensive set of answers but, if he is unable to do so, will he commit to replying in writing to the questions that <I>Hansard</I> will show that I and others have put to him?</p>

We are pleased to see that the Government are acting on bonuses at the banks they are directly recapitalising. The noble Baroness talks about anger at the Government&#146;s funding of the banks, but there is real anger at the fact that bankers have been taking huge bonuses while driving their banks into the ground. I am sure that the country will expect the Government to be very hard on that. Will the Minister say whether this bearing down on bonuses

They are set to benefit hugely from guarantees and one would hope that the Government impose at least some of the same conditions on them as on the banks they are directly recapitalising.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08101328000104"></a>I have one concern about the language in the Statement concerning the banks having agreed to maintain lending at 2007 levels. This is obviously welcome for small businesses but, given that 2007 levels of lending on mortgages were fuelling an unsustainable boom in house prices, is that really what the Government mean? I suspect it is not but it would be useful if the Minister could clarify that today.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08101328000105"></a>Have the Government sought any assurances from the banks about the terms on which it is lending to small businesses? The problem is not simply that the lending has dried up but that the banks have been imposing arbitrarily significantly higher interest rates and charges to small business borrowers which, in some cases, have been almost as damaging as if the facilities had been withdrawn.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08101328000106"></a>The Government are taking powers to appoint non-executive directors to the banks which they are directly recapitalising, and that is surely right. Although we on these Benches have no great faith in the Government being a banker, we have not huge faith in bankers to be bankers either. Therefore we are relieved that the Government are putting some of their own people in place.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08101328000107"></a>My colleague in another place, Vince Cable, has suggested that now the Prime Minister has got back his Stalinist approach to life in dealing with the banks, he needs a Beria to organise a purge of failed bankers. We are pleased to see that a number of bankers seem to have taken the revolver out of the drawer, but we hope there may be further progress on this front before too long. Let me make one suggestion about who might replace them. There are a number of highly respected executives from the mutually owned building society sector who have not been seduced by the exotic and risky products which have brought the high street banks low; perhaps they might get a call over the coming days. The Statement says that the shareholdings will be managed on a commercial basis by an arm&#146;s-length body. Can the Minister say what kind of body and who its members are likely to be?</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08101328000108"></a>When we discussed the first of the Minister&#146;s three Statements last week, I spent a little time speaking about the need to put a great deal of emphasis on co-operation at European and international level. We are very pleased that that has happened. This weekend, the Prime Minister was able to have a major influence on EU members by talking to the euro-zone Finance Ministers. This was a unique event. The Chancellor was not at that meeting and will not be at future meetings of the euro-zone Finance Ministers. It is absolutely clear that that is the body that takes a decision and then goes to the rest of the EU and, in effect, says, &#147;Chaps, this is what we are doing&#148;. The UK Government have no place on the body and, while I do not want to excite Members on the Conservative Benches by mentioning the word &#147;euro&#148; at this time of  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_552"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>night, do the Government believe there is any scope for a permanent involvement of the UK Government in the euro-zone group of Finance Ministers given that they, at long last, seem to be getting their act together in the co-ordination of European financial policy?</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08101328000109"></a>My final question on the international front is that, given its financial strength, China will be in a strong position as a result of events of recent weeks, but it is not clear why the Chinese Government do not appear to have been at the heart of the discussions which have so far taken place. Is this because they were not asked, or is this because they were asked and decided to leave it to capitalists to sort out the mess first before they come in and pick up the pieces?</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08101328000110"></a>The response of the markets today suggests that the worst of the banking crisis may be over, but the crisis of the real economy is just beginning. Having shown that it can help the banks in their hour of need, the challenge now facing the Government is to help those who are facing the loss of their jobs and their homes. This will now increasingly be the focus of our debates over the months to come.</p>

I hope that the noble Baroness will recognise that the Government are approaching this issue not, as she suggested, on the basis of positions adopted more than a quarter of a century ago but on the basis of the real need of the British economy, particularly the finance sector at the present time. Regarding the international dimension to the proposals to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred, there is a great deal of support for the approach that the Government are taking and a degree of emulation.</p>

I hope that he will give credit for the fact that European Finance Ministers have been very concerned to discuss the British proposals and, in key respects, have taken steps to follow the basis of those proposals in some of the developments for their own banking structure. I reassure the noble Lord that co-operation at that level, which has been a feature of this past week, is bound to continue. In the same way, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have been active in the G7 and have been very concerned that the Americans fully understand the nature of the British response to the banking crisis and the importance of the Americans following a strategy. Contrary to what the noble Baroness indicated, the Americans were first to propose the figures involved, not through any doctrinaire position or because of any ideological stance, unless she is suggesting that we have been successful in persuading President Bush of the merits of certain stances of effective government intervention. No. The Americans have been concerned with how they bring the necessary government resources to support a system which was on the brink of collapse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08101328000113"></a>The noble Baroness suggested that I could not go into detail when discussing certain areas last week, and of course I could not. It has taken a week of negotiation with the banks. If she thinks that we were supposed to promise significant sums of money without having any basis for negotiation with the banks and getting understandings of what the terms should be, she is being rather more naive than does her credit. It was necessary for the Government to carry out these negotiations.</p>

<a name="81013-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08101328000114"></a>In giving support for the recapitalisation of the major banks which are involved in the exercise as well as the potential for other banks and financial institutions which may need help, of course we are concerned that they know the terms on which this is to be effected. I reassure the noble Baroness that the Financial Services Authority has today published a document that indicates the nature of the strategies which the institutions will need to follow in order to qualify for government support. They include support for the real economy. What does she think the promise of support for small and medium-sized enterprises is? What does she think that seeking to avoid the repossession of our fellow citizens&#146; homes and keeping that to an absolute minimum is about if not the relationship between the financial institutions and the real economy? If she thinks it is crying in the wilderness to say that anything can be done in this period of crisis to help mortgage holders, I can only say that there are rather more constructive optimists on this side of the House and, equally importantly, among the institutions which lend as well. That is why we are able to indicate that the terms on which we are reaching the agreement with the banks is a strategy for lending to SMEs and advancing mortgages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08101328000115"></a>On preference shares, we have been very concerned to emphasise that the very significant sums involved in the recapitalisation of certain banks come with clear terms of government interest in their strategy. It is all right for the noble Baroness to say that people are upset about bonuses to those who have got us into this mess. Let her rest assured that the Government intend that bonuses will be paid not on the basis of the past but on the future position in share options. In that way, there will be rewards for bankers who are successful; such success will be measured in terms of the effectiveness of the bank strategy over a period of time and not these excessively short-term measures which helped to reduce us to the calamitous state that we all face.</p>

I am not surprised that she prefaced it by a repudiation of some of the comments which have been made across the Dispatch Box from the Opposition. As she rightly says, two crucial dimensions of this support for and development of the financial institutions are the credit guarantee scheme and the special liquidity scheme. That is clearly crucial to the oiling of the wheels which guarantee inter-bank lending which, only a week ago, was at a catastrophic, stationary level.</p>

I am sure that when the Prime Minister tapped Lloyds TSB on the shoulder and said that it would be rather helpful if it could merge with Halifax Bank of Scotland, he did not appreciate that only a few weeks later, a much bigger lifeboat would be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08101328000123"></a>I am somewhat mystified. My question relates to paragraphs 35 to 38 in the copy of the Statement. In the case of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the Statement says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101328000140"></a>&#147;the Government will purchase both ordinary and preference shares once the merger is complete&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101328000134"></a>It goes on to say that HBOS will get so much and Lloyds will get so much. However, if the purchase of shares is to take place when the merger is complete, you will not end up with shares in HBOS and shares in Lloyds TSB; you will possibly end up with shares in Lloyds TSB HBOS plc. What are the Government saying, or are they keeping their options open? The statement a few weeks ago about the merger was one thing, but the Government are now having to come with this great new lifeboat for the organisation that was going to help HBOS. Are we absolutely certain that, in the reality of what the Government are now proposing with this bigger lifeboat, the merger is necessary? Paragraph 48 of the Statement says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101328000141"></a>&#147;more capital is available to small institutions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08101328000135"></a>but earlier in the Statement there is talk about the Nationwide Building Society increasing its capital base. No doubt one of the reasons why Nationwide wants its capital base to be extended is that it wants to take

That is its judgment; it is nothing to do with the Government, because Nationwide is not proposing to avail itself of government funds. On the merger, the noble Lord is right to point to the difficulties, which are apparent to the whole House. The Government want the merger to take place because it would strengthen the institutions concerned. However, the noble Lord cannot expect us to underwrite the situation if the merger does not take place. We are spelling out the exact terms between the two institutions. The availability of the money depends on the merger.</p>

What is the Government&#146;s estimate of the total cost of the operation so far and how is it to be paid for? The next question is more difficult. However much taxation is increased or public expenditure is cut, there is likely to be a substantial increase in government borrowing. What is the Government&#146;s policy on funding that deficit from the public? To the extent that they fail to do so, there is likely to be a massive increase in that old-fashioned concept of the money supply and a large increase in inflation after a time lag.</p>

Can the Government fully cost this position at present? Of course they cannot. We are making provision of the resources but we do not know the level of take-up. We are committed to producing a Pre-Budget Report in the near future, which will require us to address ourselves to the issues that the noble Lord has identified. He asked me similar questions last week, when I was obliged to be somewhat vague in my response. He will have to forgive me for that. In changing circumstances, when we are involved with proposals rather than categorical allocation of government resources, there are bound to be some aspects that are uncertain. However, we will meet his requirements when we produce the Pre-Budget Report, which will also help to identify the extent of government liability. The judgment on the categorisation of government debt is a matter for the Office for National Statistics, but it will be some time before it reaches its conclusions on that.</p>

I emphasise the fact that the Government are making this money available on proper terms and conditions on a commercial basis, so there will be a return to the taxpayer from the realisation of assets or the charging of commercial rates. Those returns will not be immediate in some cases, but the Government are concerned to ensure that the taxpayer&#146;s interests are safeguarded. The other side of the noble Lord&#146;s question&#151;the concept of trickle-down&#151;relates to whether the ordinary citizen will benefit directly from these arrangements. If nothing had been done and the financial system had gone into catastrophic collapse, that would have been felt in every home and business in the country. We are providing a structure that gives confidence back to the financial system and a basis on which banks can give loans to small businesses, which have a regular need for such loans, and on which mortgages are safeguarded for house owners. Those are the trickle-down effects, which we should all welcome.</p>

At least we have been quick and to the point. My question is about the public debt. Is it not important that we protect the real economy as much as we can and treat increases in public debt as temporary and necessary, rather than making a totem of and trying to protect the money supply? That is exactly what drove the US economy in the great depression in the 1930s, as shown by the great monetarist, Milton Friedman. Let us not go down the path of making those mistakes and let us protect the real economy.</p>

Now that we know that some council officers who should have been more prudent were placing deposits with Icelandic banks right up to the end of September&#151;these people are highly paid professionals and not amateurs running some charity&#151;does the Treasury still stand by the view that no reckless deposit-placing took place?</p>

May we have some guidance on the role of two advisory firms, Sector Treasury Services and Butlers, which appear to have given councils advice and an A-rating for Landsbanki and Heritable virtually up to the moment that that firm bit the dust?

What does keeping the availability of mortgage-lending at 2007 levels mean? That was a completely wild, once-in-a-lifetime year. It would be completely inappropriate for the amount of mortgage lending by the banks to continue at that level.

I therefore welcome the opportunity afforded by this brief debate to bring it back on the radar as one of the most important remaining subjects for geopolitical resolution not only in the Middle East but the entire world. It has bedevilled many Governments and Ministers. The noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, with his authority as a former UN official of great distinction and skill, knows a lot about this subject. He, like others, must anticipate that, somehow and somewhere, we will be able to make progress from now on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08101337000020"></a>I make a few brief points tonight, in my Question for a short debate, in the hope that the Minister will give some answers. It has been a long time; when we had our first exchanges at the beginning of January, I well remember the Minister&#146;s very forthright answer, when he said that of course a completely genuine, wholehearted sovereign Palestinian state must be created out of these negotiations&#151;nothing less will do. Then we had the terrible tragedies of violence in March, with more than 100 civilians in Palestine killed from Israeli Government incursions. Those mercifully and happily dropped off after that, because even the most hard-line Israeli Minister realised that it was a real dead end to pursue that kind of policy. Ever since then there has been quiet and silence, with hardly any references to the subject, although there has been plenty of speculative material in the Israeli press. There has been very little in the United States press or the election campaign about the subject and there has been very little in this country at all.</p>

<a name="81013-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08101337000021"></a>There was an <I>Independent</I> editorial in March, which, sadly with justification, said towards the end:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08101337000213"></a>&#147;Far from helping to bring about the end of the Middle East&#146;s most intractable dispute, Mr Bush deserves to go down in history as a US president who has worsened it immeasurably by wholly abandoning even the pretence that the US should act as an impartial referee in the Arab-Israeli dispute&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000199"></a>Without wishing to criticise Barack Obama at all, it was characteristic of a leading American politician and a candidate for the American elections that he went to Israel for 24 hours on a visit&#151;rightly, and I was delighted to see that&#151;but spent only one hour visiting Palestine, which is supposed to be a side-by-side sovereign state in literally a few weeks.</p>

<a name="81013-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08101337000022"></a>That slippage is causing great concern among many people, as I am sure the Minister will concede. This House and Parliament need answers from the Government about what is happening. I have rightly criticised President Bush; many people are disappointed with how he has reacted in sending Condoleezza Rice on endless missions, which seem to have no concrete result or progress. I admit that there will be many behind-the-scenes negotiations and talks and, therefore, a lot that cannot necessarily be revealed; that would be encouraging if the Minister could at least allude to some of the progress being made. But I have my doubts about that. I speak as a friend of Israel of many years standing, and a more candid friend now because I think that Israel faces the need for greater urgency to ensure that these negotiations are at long last fruitful.</p>

Despite his very optimistic noises in June and July when they thought they were getting close to achieving a deal, ever since then there has been a deafening silence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08101337000024"></a>I quote, too, from a <I>Financial Times</I> leading article from the end of March. It has always been a normative, standard friend of Israel, as we all are. We were all delighted&#151;or I was personally&#151;with the 60th anniversary this year of the celebration of the Israeli state. The <I>FT</I> is a moderate newspaper by any standards, but it said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000233"></a>&#147;next week, the Arab League will re-present its spurned 2002 peace offer: Israel returns all occupied Arab land, including ... east Jerusalem ... in return for full peace ... Israel and its friends should know that only war will come from continuing to spurn peace&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000200"></a>Given the new, possible provisional Administration that may arise from the coalition-building that is going on in Israel, that may appear unfair, but that is what a lot of people pessimistically now feel about the situation.</p>

<a name="81013-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08101337000025"></a>I have a quote from Prime Minister Olmert from the end of September&#151;this is a very striking statement, because very little had been said over that period, although we assume that there is a continuing format of more or less fortnightly negotiations going on, with senior figures in the outgoing Administration. There is a rather shaky tableau at the moment, and perhaps the Minister could give us more of a reply about the ongoing framework of these talks. Tzipi Livni herself referred to her regular meetings with the equivalent of the Palestinian Foreign Minister. We need to know more about that. At any right, on 30 September, Prime Minister Olmert said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08101337000214"></a>&#147;I am saying what no previous Israeli leader has ever said. We should withdraw from almost all of the territories&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000201"></a>Presumably he would have to say &#147;almost&#148; for Israeli public opinion.</p>

<a name="81013-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08101337000026"></a>In those exchanges earlier in the year, I asked the Minister whether he agreed&#151;apparently he did&#151;that more than 65 per cent of the Israeli public said that there must be talks, even with Hamas. We know that there has been the Hamas Hudna truce period suggestion, which was proposed for two years and which is still in place. The Israelis sought to ignore it originally but seem perhaps to have changed their minds about it. Coming up to date, last week the Israeli military commander of the occupied West Bank complained bitterly about the violence inflicted by extremist Israeli settlers on unarmed Palestinian residents, saying that it was getting worse and worse. There are other signs, too, of a very worrying situation, with the settlements apparently continuing to grow on the basis of a spurious formula by the Israeli authorities that there can be expansion of existing territorial footprint areas and not necessarily a brand new area. We all know how those things can be circumvented and manipulated to avoid the UN sanctions that might come if they do not respond to what the UN and the whole world community wants.</p>

The situation in Gaza is really desperate; it is estimated officially that well over 50 per cent of the population will be suffering directly from incipient and long-lasting

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08101337000028"></a>It is surely now time for Israel to show generosity, as it has so much and the Palestinians have so little. Mahmoud Abbas has shown great patience in prolonging these negotiations, without any help or encouragement from the Americans. Surely those who are true friends of Israel see where the dead end is developing for that country, although it so brilliantly celebrated 60 years of existence in the summer. What if the Palestinians said that they would give up their struggle for a separate Palestinian state? President Bush originally promised it at the end of 2005 and it is already three years later. People are saying that maybe it will go into 2009 now, as the talks are difficult, and so on. But this cannot go on. The British Government should not condone or be a party to that going on, unnecessarily and unfairly. If the Palestinians renounced their objective of a separate sovereign Palestinian state with all that entailed and said that there should be one territory, whatever the structure might be&#151;one state&#151;the Israelis would have lost their own separate Zionist state. How blind and narrow-minded is that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08101337000029"></a>I end by quoting from another person, whose words were reported on 28 September in a Sunday newspaper in Paris. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08101337000215"></a>&#147;This is not really a classic political conflict between two countries or peoples. The causes are above all human. For this is the story of two peoples equally and profoundly convinced&#151;in a different historical perspective&#151;of their right to live on the same tiny piece of middle eastern land ... It is thus necessary for both peoples to agree that both have this right. Then you follow up with all the practical points, the first one being should this be two states with two peoples or one combined state with two people ... But the solution cannot just be done by the politicians. The whole of civil society must be involved. Why should this not include musicians?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000202"></a>I quote Daniel Barenboim, of course. If this is not done, the Palestinians cannot be left in limbo without a state of their own. The UN would have to respond and persuade the Americans to avoid yet another of the 32 vetoes that they have made so far since 1968 to stop this process going ahead.</p>

<a name="81013-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08101337000030"></a>I ask the Minister in all sincerity to give us a positive, tangible and realistic answer today about what is really happening with these negotiations and give us hope for a conclusion of this business, even if it is not at the end of the year then pretty close to it, once the American elections have been returned.</p>

There are now 630 movement restrictions in place as against 561 in November 2007. Indeed, Peace Now, the Israeli NGO, reports that tenders for 1,761 settlement buildings have been issued since Annapolis; a 38-fold increase on the previous year. It is all in danger of becoming a tragic charade, which has urgently to stop if peace is to be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08101337000033"></a>Despite the very welcome reduction in violence by the Israeli Government and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza following the June truce, the lives of Gazans have hardly improved. Yes, increasing supplies of goods have been allowed into Gaza and Israel has allowed in more fuel, but draconian restrictions continue to remain in place for the movement of people and goods. No exports are leaving Gaza. According to the World Bank, that means that 98 per cent of all industrial operations remain closed. Some 80 per cent of the population are still dependent on aid to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08101337000034"></a>Diplomats from many Governments tell aid agencies and others that Gaza will not be open until Gilad Shalit is released. They explain that the politics are too difficult because of a growing split between Hamas and Fatah and they ask what Israel will do in any case if reconciliation is achieved. Frankly, that is not good enough; it amounts to condoning or de facto legitimising collective punishment. Urgent steps must be taken to open the Kami crossing, especially for exports, and stalled UN humanitarian programmes must be allowed to resume. Most of all, the international community must actively support Palestinian reconciliation and publicly support a national unity government if it is announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08101337000035"></a>Of course I recognise that the UK has been very active, particularly around the quartet meeting last May, endeavouring to bring an end to the blockade of Gaza. But the Prime Minister did not mention Gaza in his speech to the Knesset during the summer; nor, on the same day that the quartet met on 26 September, did the Foreign Secretary in his speech to the Security Council. It would be helpful if my noble friend, whom I greatly respect, could tell the House what specific and effective steps the UK is demonstrably taking together with our European international partners to bring an end to the blockade.</p>

I must confess that I began to worry when I saw in the Motion put down by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, reference to &#147;new initiatives&#148;. One thing that we do not need is a new initiative. We want the existing initiatives to make progress. That is what we should focus on. We should also remember that difficult though it is to achieve, it is clear what the objective ought to be two viable states&#151;a Jewish state and an Arab state&#151;living side-by-side in peace.

Any attempt to encourage that would be wrong. If we are going to get a two-state solution, we need to have two viable parties negotiating&#151;one on behalf of Israel and one on behalf of Palestine. At the end of the day, it will have to be done by them. Obviously, help and encouragement will be provided by the European Union and the United States and they are clearly doing that already, but there is no substitute for those two parties engaging. As I see it, the problem is the division that exists within the Palestinians between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08101337000038"></a>I welcome the fact that a truce was brokered by the Egyptians and that has led to a reduction in violence in and around Gaza, but some worrying signs are there. Reference was made to humanitarian assistance and the potential for humanitarian problems in Gaza, but I noticed that, recently, Israelis checking a truck carrying humanitarian aid about to go through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza found two tonnes of dual-purpose fertiliser, probably intended for the creation of explosives and explosive devices for the rockets that have come from that area in the past and to some extent continue to come from that there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08101337000039"></a>I am also concerned about reports that we heard on our own media this morning. A report on the &#147;Today&#148; programme said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08101337000216"></a>&#147;Militant groups in Gaza are re-arming, training and preparing for a possible renewal of violence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000203"></a>If it turns out that the Hamas truce is tactical, that would be the greatest disservice that could be rendered to the people of Palestine. Although I appreciate the concern of the two noble Lords who have already spoken, I think that they are looking in the wrong direction to some extent. What we need is persuasion on Hamas to change and to facilitate genuine negotiations. The practical issues that have been mentioned so far are all capable of resolution. What we do not have are people who are committed to getting an agreement and speaking for the Palestinians. The potential exists for a solution. A solution along the lines that this House would welcome is one that the majority of Israelis now want&#151;although not all. The majority of Israelis now want an arrangement that this House can be content with, but what we do not have is a viable party on the other side.</p>

What action are we taking to freeze settlement expansion, which Israel has promised? Why has the European Union extended the EU-Israel agreement when Israel has not fulfilled the legal obligations originally imposed?

I therefore address my remarks simply to the issue of Israeli settlement policy in Arab-occupied territory post-1967. This is steadily undermining any prospect for longer-term peace. We all know that the Balfour declaration led to the creation of a Jewish homeland, but we also know that the declaration said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000234"></a>&#147;nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine&#148;.</ul>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said, 40 per cent of the West Bank is now made inaccessible and unusable for residential, agricultural, commercial and municipal development. The settlements began in this area in the 1970s, and have grown relentlessly ever since. We have a kind of fragmented Palestine&#151;a kind of Middle Eastern Bantustan&#151;which, ominously, was welcomed, according to a report in the <I>Financial Times</I> last week, by the leader of the Likud party, Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08101337000046"></a>Being deprived of land and homeland breeds despair and, in turn, violence, making the long-term peace settlement even more difficult to achieve. We all know that this policy contravenes international law. Article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention prohibits an occupying power from transferring,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000235"></a>&#147;parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000205"></a>It contravenes numerous Security Council resolutions and endless appeals from the European Union and the international community; indeed, the road-map process in 2003 demanded a cessation of settlements. Above all, the Americans give something like $3 billion a year, yet fail to stop this settlement policy. James Baker, the Secretary of State in the early 1990s, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08101337000217"></a>&#147;I don&#146;t think that there is any bigger obstacle to peace than the settlement activity that continues not only unabated but at an enhanced pace&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08101337000047"></a>I am a great believer in the wonderful aspects of the Jewish faith that its people offer to the world. I greatly admire the inspiring leadership of the Chief Rabbi, Sir Jonathan Sacks. In a lecture last week, he pointed out that Jews believe that what we possess, we hold in trust for future generations. The people of Israel must ask themselves how that admirable belief can be reconciled with taking other people&#146;s land.</p>

Racism is despicable, but Israelis must be careful not to give an excuse to racists to foment anti-Semitism by their land settlement policy in Arab-occupied territory. I hope that the Minister will say what the Government and the European Union are doing about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08101337000050"></a>I remind your Lordships that European Sub-Committee C produced a report in July 2007 on the European Union&#146;s role in the Middle East peace process, and concluded that the EU must now play,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000236"></a>&#147;a more active and imaginative role in the search for peace in the Middle East&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08101337000051"></a>So what role can be commended to the Minister? First, that the EU is by far the largest provider of aid to the Palestinians must surely give leverage. We should therefore continue and enhance our humanitarian aid. We should encourage President Abbas to work closely with Arab colleagues. Indeed, one of the positive features of the past few years, from 2002, has been greater engagement of Arab countries in the region, encouraging them to promote an internal reconciliation process that would allow the creation of a technocratic Government, probably under Salam Fayyad, in the Palestinian territories and an agreed date for elections for the Palestinian presidency and the PLC.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08101337000052"></a>There should be an attempt to give a widening mandate to President Abbas to negotiate with Israel on the basis of the quartet resolution. There should be preparation for the opening of border crossings between

Of course, the European Union is already very involved, but this should allow controlled movement of goods and people, and the co-ordination of the three main parties on anti-terrorism and anti-arms smuggling activity. We should build on progress in expanding the PA&#146;s security capacities. I note that former Prime Minister Blair was in Jenin. Jenin is a model of that activity, which also occurs in Nablus and the Hebron area.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08101337000053"></a>Finally, the EU should support an economic package, including economically driven security arrangements, financial support, economic infrastructure and private business support, all in preparation for the conference to be hosted in London in December of this year. Time permits only those headings, but that is quite a massive agenda in itself. The stakes are high. I am convinced that the EU can play a most positive role, and hope that some of these suggestions can be furthered by my noble friend.</p>

First, it must surely be a high priority for the European Union to ensure that the incoming US Administration really throw their weight behind the negotiation of a comprehensive package to bring a durable peace to Israel and its Arab neighbours. Too often in the past, new US Presidents have simply put the Middle East peace process into the &#147;too difficult&#148; tray, or have sent their Secretary of State off on a half-hearted quest for peace, only to withdraw their support at the first whiff of opposition in Congress.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08101337000055"></a>This time, the negative implications of continuing tension and conflict over Palestine for all the other US foreign policy objectives in the Middle East region&#151;for the stability of Iraq and the Lebanon, for the handling of Iran and the fight against terrorism&#151;must be even clearer than they have been for the past several years. So the European Union could be pushing against a less firmly closed door than in the past, but push it surely must, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that it will.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08101337000056"></a>Secondly, I urge that the European Union pursues a genuinely inclusive approach to the negotiating process, not allowing itself yet again to be held captive to a set of rigid preconditions for involvement on the Arab side, as has been the case in recent years. Of course, it is right to insist that acts of violence against Israel by Hamas must cease, but there is now a de facto ceasefire in Gaza. Of course, actual negotiations must be contained within the framework of the Arab peace plan and not simply go back to square one. Of course, Hamas must in the end be prepared to sit at the negotiating table with Israel and to respect its right to security, but these requirements should no longer be a barrier even to talking to Hamas and seeking to draw it into a serious negotiating process.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08101337000057"></a>Thirdly, the EU could play a much more prominent and proactive role in any eventual settlement arrangements that are agreed. After all, no third party stands to gain  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_567"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 567</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more from a Middle East peace settlement than the European Union, and none stands to lose more from the continuation of the present stasis. Hitherto, the European Union has been a generous donor to the Palestinians and has backed a number of imaginative, if somewhat marginal, schemes to underpin the peace process, but has left all the running on the main issues to be made by the US. Is it not time for the European Union to indicate the role it could play in any post-settlement security arrangements for the region? Is it not also time for the EU to sketch out the sort of deeper and wider relationship it would wish to develop with Israel in such circumstances? Is it not essential that the EU pulls together all the disparate elements of its policies towards the Middle East peace process, and those of its member states, into a concerted and coherent effort, and not just sit around waiting for the Lisbon treaty to come into force?</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08101337000058"></a>I know that the points I have raised are not easy or simple ones to handle, but the present opportunity for the European Union to turn over a new leaf in its involvement in the peace process will not last for long.

So far this year 436 Palestinians have been killed directly in the conflict, mostly by the Israeli Defense Forces, but some by settlers. This compares with 29 Israelis killed in the same period. The stark difference between these two figures shows clearly the balance of force used, even if the figures are looking a little better at present.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08101337000060"></a>This year so far the number of checkpoints and closures has increased by 12 per cent. We heard other figures earlier. Many Palestinian homes have been destroyed while more Israeli settlements have been built in the Occupied Territories&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Luce, gave us figures in that regard&#151;contrary to international agreements and international law, deliberately making the peace process more difficult, as he eloquently said. It is no wonder that Palestinians lose faith in the ability of their leaders to deliver a peaceful life.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08101337000061"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, I read Mr Olmert&#146;s remarks given in an interview with the Israeli newspaper <I>Yedioth Ahronoth</I> a week or so ago, in which he said clearly that Israel should agree to return most of the occupied territory, including East Jerusalem. As others have said, it is a pity that he did not say that before he resigned, but at least it shows realism about what is necessary for peace. We all know the outlines of a peace agreement with two viable states, but what is happening to the peace process? That is what we are asking the Minister to bring us up to date on. What has Tony Blair been able to achieve in his very difficult mission in Palestine? We await to hear that with interest.</p>

Nablus was, and I believe still is, almost sealed off by Israeli forces, with access on foot through a humiliating checkpoint. Gaza remains an open-air prison, with restricted access from the north and almost no movement to or from Egypt through the Rafah crossing. Gaza still has no air or sea port. The successful ceasefire has allowed a small increase in supplies by land of fuel and other essentials. No exports are moving out of Gaza, hence the massive unemployment, dependence on food aid and almost certain malnourishment among children. Because the local water supplies are polluted by salt, kidney diseases are common. In spite of all those problems, some normal life continues; we visited a joyful graduation ceremony at the university.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08101337000064"></a>Since last summer, it has been obvious that the Gaza ceasefire should be extended to the whole of the West Bank. Alas, that has barely been discussed. Will the Government devote some effort and energy to that matter? Will they try harder to secure the release from detention in Israel of some 40 Palestinian parliamentarians and others who are still held without charge?</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08101337000065"></a>Our Government and the quartet&#146;s special representative have set out to improve the economic situation of Palestinians. That has proved an impossible task while Gaza remains blockaded and the West Bank is divided by Israeli checkpoints, which have increased in number since the Annapolis conference.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08101337000066"></a>When will the Government give a full account of their policy towards Israel and Palestine? They cannot claim that it has been in any way successful. Fifteen years of negotiations by the PLO and then the PA have not ended a military occupation that has lasted for 41 years. Increasing colonisation of the West Bank has inevitably led to despair and violence, as Prime Minister Olmert recently recognised. How much has this country spent since the Oslo agreements to shore up a disastrous status quo? The total world amount of aid and relief to Palestinians has been put at $9 billion.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08101337000067"></a>Why has Hamas been demonised, when it contains some of the most well educated, honest and consistent politicians in the Arab world? Why were we so cool about the Arab League initiative? Why did we not welcome the Palestinian Government of national unity? Why are we still relying on the largely unreformed Fatah party, which is now internally split? Her Majesty&#146;s Government have a great deal to explain.</p>

I have always believed that the big mistake that Israel made historically was when, having won the major wars in the past, it was not more magnanimous in giving away territory, taking the long view and seeking a settlement. We are all paying the price today, including Israel. That failure has led to increasing bitterness over the years, the increasing militancy of settlers and the increasing militancy of Hamas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08101337000069"></a>In the very frank interview that has been referred to by my noble friend Lord Dykes and the noble Lord, Lord Cope, Ehud Olmert, the recently retired Israeli Prime Minister, not only said that they should give away more territory; he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08101337000218"></a>&#147;I read the words spoken by our retired generals, and I say, how is it possible that they have not learned anything and have not forgotten anything ... With them, it is all about tanks and land and controlling territories and controlled territories and this hilltop and that hilltop. All these things are worthless&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000207"></a>One only wishes, as has been said, that he had said those things when he was Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08101337000070"></a>Yesterday I talked to my cousin in Israel, who emigrated 25 years ago. He is a headmaster in a boarding school of 250 pupils. He is very aware but is not politically active. He sees Hamas as a very cynical enemy. The feeling in Israel is that Israel completely pulled out from Gaza but that was answered only by rockets. The public in Israel are dismayed by corrupt politicians, and there is a mood of pessimism. They believe that they have no one to negotiate with, the PLO being a spent force. My cousin accepts that, ultimately, Israel will have to make major territorial concessions, and he is also particularly worried about the increasing right-wing trend among youth.</p>

<a name="81013-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08101337000071"></a>Today we have bitterness and mistrust, not only between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank, not only, sadly, between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel, but between the PLO and Hamas; that is a nightmare situation for anyone attempting to negotiate a lasting settlement, whether from Europe or elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08101337000072"></a>In a few months there will be new Administrations in America and in Israel. Thankfully, Tzipi Livni is seen as an honest politician, but she will have an extremely difficult task in putting a coalition together and then trying to negotiate a lasting settlement. We can only pray that she and the Palestinian leaders reach an accommodation. It cannot come a moment too soon for many Israelis, who live in fear, and most Palestinians, who live in misery.</p>

As a major donor to the Palestinian territories, the EU should be at the forefront of efforts to alleviate the desperate situation in which many Palestinians find

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08101337000077"></a>We hope to hear that the Government and the EU, of which France holds the presidency, are actively involve in diplomacy with other states which have an interest or an influence in the region. Now that the Palestinian leadership is split and weakened, it is important that others can be prevailed upon to contribute in a positive manner and not to exacerbate the splits. The Arab world should be encouraged to act in the best interests of the Palestinians, not in a way that plays to the gallery at home. We watch with interest the reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah.</p>

The fragile peace process is very precious. I hope that the Government are doing everything possible to nurture it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08101337000079"></a>This debate has highlighted faults on both sides of this difficult ongoing problem. We heard of a fresh horror on the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning, which was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Trimble. It contained the most chilling interview with an 18 year-old girl&#151;a proud potential suicide bomber who was willing to kill innocent women and children.

I reassure him and other noble Lords that the Middle East peace process continues to be a high priority for the Government. I know that it is a topic of great interest to this House. The UK remains committed to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East and is working closely with its EU partners to offer all possible support to the Annapolis process. The EU has a critical role to play in this. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said that the Government had a lot to answer for. I am not sure that I accept that, but I certainly accept that we have been asked a lot of questions tonight, and I will do my best to answer as many of them as I can.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08101337000081"></a>The situation for the Palestinians and the ongoing peace negotiations continue to pose tremendous difficulties. It remains as important as ever that we progress on both if we are to build a better future for Palestinians inside a viable Palestinian state. The UK and the EU will, therefore, continue to play a leading role in the international community in supporting the peace process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08101337000082"></a>Although I accept the impatience of many noble Lords who have spoken about the fact that Annapolis is almost a year old, it is worth reminding ourselves that a year ago, before Annapolis, there were no negotiations. Seven years had been lost without real talks. The conference changed that. Talks began and both sides restated their commitment to their road map obligations. The conference was also a signal of renewed international commitment to the peace process. It was encouraging for a particularly strong Arab

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08101337000083"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that the EU political association agreement is intended as a technical agreement; it is not meant to carry a political message. Indeed, in announcing it, the importance of the political situation as regards Palestinians was specifically marked out and the agreement was in no way intended to prejudice progress on that.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08101337000084"></a>The EU remains committed to ensuring that there is progress in the negotiations. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have visited the region and they speak often with the key players. Similarly at the EU level, the Middle East peace process is frequently discussed at Foreign Ministers&#146; meetings, most recently at the September informal meeting. The EU special representative, Marc Otte, spends a great deal of time in the region, and Javier Solana for the Council and Benita Ferrero-Waldner for the Commission are also deeply engaged.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08101337000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, asked about the progress of discussions between the parties, referring to the fact that there was an original commitment for fortnightly meetings. I think it is correct to say that the last meeting between Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas occurred in the middle of September. Since then, Mrs Livni has met the chief Palestinian negotiators. While the change of government in Israel has inevitably slowed down the momentum of meetings, it is very clear that both sides are making every effort to keep the momentum of these talks moving.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08101337000086"></a>Throughout, we on the outside have been consistent in our message: we support the Annapolis process and, as part of this, expect all parties to fulfil their road map obligations. Of course, the talks have moved more slowly than the optimists hoped, but they have not collapsed as the pessimists predicted, so we will continue to build on the progress made.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08101337000087"></a>Part of supporting the talks is tackling actions which undermine confidence. The most striking example of that is Israeli settlement construction&#151;a policy which serves to break down trust and make a final deal even harder. Settlement building, whether in east Jerusalem or the West Bank, is illegal and contrary to Israeli commitments, and we have made it clear that it must stop. Even since Annapolis, according to Peace Now, the number of tenders for construction in the settlements has increased by more than 500 per cent. In public and private, we, as the UK and the EU, have made clear our opposition to this.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08101337000088"></a>Another key plank of our support for the peace process is building Palestinian institutions that can govern effectively. In December last year, the international community pledged an extraordinary $7.7 billion at the Paris donor conference in support of the Palestinians based on the Palestinian Authority&#146;s Reform and Development Plan. This plan, designed by Prime Minister Fayyad, offers a route to substantial reform of Palestinian institutions so that the Palestinian Authority can deliver essential services to Palestinians more effectively. The UK committed &#163;243 million in support over three years, linked to political progress, which amounted to a substantial increase in the Government&#146;s assistance.

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08101337000089"></a>We all know that the security sector is particularly important. Israel has legitimate security concerns but it is better for all if these can be met by Palestinians policing Palestinians. Our European partners have been very involved in this. On 24 June, Germany hosted a conference in Berlin to galvanise international support in this area. We announced that we would support it and have set money aside for security sector reform, including improving civil justice and public prosecution.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08101337000090"></a>The EU has a leading role in training the Palestinian civil police and the UK has been a long-standing contributor to that civil police training mission. We currently provide three police officers to the mission and have allocated &#163;1.2 million of our funding to support Palestinian policing needs this year.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08101337000091"></a>We also support the US effort to reform the Palestinian national security forces, led by its security co-ordinator, General Dayton. There is obviously a long way to go, but as we are seeing in Jenin particularly, which has been the focus of our efforts, we are trying to bring together security and economic development, including co-operation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. We think that it is showing some positive results, which we hope may prove a broader model for co-operation between both Israeli and Palestinian security forces, and that this more integrated approach will deal with economic development as well as security issues.</p>

His last visit was just a week ago, on 7 October. He continues to push forward with his confidence-building measures. The noble Lord is correct to express frustration that it is more of the same, if you like, but in a situation where there is no broad breakthrough on a peace agreement, perhaps incremental progress is the best we can hope for. Since January&#151;I take the noble Lord&#146;s point&#151;the UK has been a key partner in the Palestine investment conference, an initiative supported strongly by Mr Blair which was held in Bethlehem in May. We have worked since then with the World Bank to try to get access to investment for Palestinian companies. In the light of that, and looking forward, on 15 December we will be holding an investment conference here in London to encourage investment and build UK-Palestinian business relations.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08101337000096"></a>Of course it needs to be about more than just humanitarian supplies. A hand-to-mouth existence will not lift Gazans out of poverty. Without crossings open for people and commercial goods, Gaza cannot lift itself out of economic decline. Israel must allow more in and more out, and we and our EU colleagues will continue to press Israel to do so.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08101337000097"></a>The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas&#151;another new development in recent months&#151;is welcome. We commend Egypt for its work on the ceasefire. It is good news that it has held so far. But this cessation of violence is only one step. In that regard, the retention of Gilad Shalit in captivity does not allow that to be built on, but neither does the retention of Palestinian parliamentarians in jail without trial.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08101337000098"></a>This has been a year of incremental progress; I plead guilty to the charge of the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, on that score. There is certainly no reason for great optimism at this stage. However, we remain absolutely committed to this peace process, which remains a core objective of Britain&#146;s foreign policy. We view ourselves and the EU as having particular responsibilities in the coming months as the United States goes through a change of Administration, with the inevitable loss of attention and focus that that can often mean on foreign policy issues. We will try to make sure that the momentum of peace-making continues through the arrival of a new Government in Israel and that all sides are left in no doubt that only a just peace can end the terrible tragedy of the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08101337000118"></a>Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 reflect concerns that the committee have felt for some considerable time about the safeguards that are in place when pre-charge detention of between 14 and 28 days is being authorised. The Minister will no doubt be grateful to know that these are probing amendments through which we seek his views on what the committee sees as the need for more adequate safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08101337000119"></a>The committee has done some detailed work on the arrangements surrounding pre-charge detention. The Minister is no doubt aware of this work and has read it with great interest. I shall say a little more about the detail. Between 14 and 28 days, if detention is to be  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_575"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column 575</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continued, there has to be a hearing before a judge,and it is the nature of these hearings that has caused the committee concern. In its 25th report of the Session&#151;its 12th report on counterterrorism&#151;it says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08101337000231"></a>&#147;We do not accept that the current arrangements for judicial authorisation of extended pre-charge detention satisfy the stringent requirements either of habeas corpus or Article 5 ECHR&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81013-0014.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08101337000120"></a>The committee has identified three basic problems. First, the suspect and his or her lawyer can be excluded from the hearing, so parts of the hearing can be closed to them. Secondly, information can be put before the judge that neither the suspect nor his or her lawyer can see. Thirdly, the committee was concerned about the narrowness of the questions that the court is required to answer when it decides whether or not to authorise further detention.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08101337000121"></a>The committee&#146;s second report of this Session therefore recommended a statutory regime to govern the hearings that give warrants for further detention. We suggested that there should be more stringent requirements about the information that must be contained in the statutory notice given to a suspect before such a hearing; that there should be measures to define more closely the power to withhold information from the suspect and his or her lawyer; that there should be provisions for special advocates to represent the interests of the suspect at any closed part of the hearing; that there should be express provision for the right of the suspect to cross-examine the investigation officer; and that any restrictions on disclosure or participation are subject to the overriding requirement that the hearing of the application be fair. We have attempted to put those requirements into our amendment. I hope very much that the Minister will feel able to enter this discussion with us about how far the safeguards for extending detention from 14 to 28 days are satisfactory and in accordance with our human rights requirements. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has said everything that needs to be said. I should like to add one or two points. Although this issue may now seem academic in one sense, it is not at all academic because the Home Secretary&#146;s Statement in the other place has indicated that a Bill is in the offing, if and when it is needed, which would extend the period of detention without trial beyond 42 days.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08101337000123"></a>I deeply regret the part of the Home Secretary&#146;s Statement, which says that she deeply regrets,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000239"></a>&#147;that some have been prepared to ignore the terrorist threat, for fear of taking a tough but necessary decision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000208"></a>That is a most impertinent thing for her to have said if it refers to those of us in the opposition parties and on the Cross Benches in this House, and those on the Back Benches from the Labour Party who have disagreed with the Government&#146;s judgment.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08101337000124"></a>I, working with Roy Jenkins in 1974, was involved in fashioning the first prevention against terrorism Bill. I was much involved also with advising him, as he recalls in his memoirs, on effective steps to counter terrorism. The notion that those who disagree with the Home Secretary&#146;s judgment are prepared to ignore the terrorist threat is preposterous. I am very sorry that

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08101337000125"></a>This amendment seeks to introduce a limited but further form of natural justice into the procedure. I shall not make a long speech, but, as everyone knows, it is a cardinal principle of our system of justice that you are entitled to know the case against you, to have a fair opportunity to rebut it, to have proper access to legal advice and to be sure that there are reasonable grounds for the conduct of which you are suspected to have been guilty.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08101337000126"></a>My only direct experience of these procedures was on the related issue of the proscribed organisations procedure where I once represented a body which was trying to avoid proscription. As its advocate, I am bound to say that a very nasty taste was left in my mouth when it said, &#147;We are going to withdraw from the proceedings because we do not believe any longer in British justice&#148;&#151;and it did. Having talked to some of the special advocates, I know that there is considerable concern among many of them about the present procedure.</p>

<a name="81013-0014.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08101337000127"></a>What this seeks to do is obvious to anyone reading Amendment No. 34, in particular, and I shall not add to it. We would be very interested to know the current view of the Home Office. Although we will not divide the Committee today, this probing amendment is important for the future.</p>

I think I am right in saying that he spoke of extensions for four different people, all submitted with exactly the same wording basically along the lines of, &#147;We think he&#146;s done something naughty and we need to go on&#148;. Those were not the exact words, but the implication of what he said. We really must get out of the habit of not telling people what the charge against them is. It is an ancient liberty which should be protected, and I hope that when the noble Lord comes to reply, he can give us some satisfaction on this point. If not, we will have to go back to the barricades on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08101337000129"></a>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 are in this group. Amendment No. 36 provides for the:</p>

<p><a name="08101337000209"></a>I am not a lawyer, although I see quite a few legal eagles around the place who will either put me right or shut me up, but it seems that this would make the threshold charge clear to anyone who reads it. To me this clause is a pretty clear statement of what one wants the threshold charge to be. Obviously as I put my name to this amendment, I support it and wish to draw the attention of noble Lords to it.</p>

My solution to this quite important problem would be to create a new appointment of an independent commissioner who would be entitled to attend interviews at Paddington Green in all terrorist cases. His function would be similar to that which was once fulfilled by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper at the holding centres in Northern Ireland, and proved extremely effective. This new commissioner&#151;I do not know what he should be called&#151;should be entitled, whenever he wants, to attend interviews at Paddington Green to see how well the police are getting on the with the job with which they are charged. However, the important point is that he should also be entitled to attend the hearing before the judge at which the prosecution makes an application for an extension of time. From his independent position, he would then be able to put the judge in a position to say how well in his view the police were getting on with the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08101337000131"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord West, will remember, I suggested this idea many moons ago. At first it received what I would almost say was a good deal of support from the government Benches, but when I pressed it, it somehow did not get any further. But in the light of my noble friend&#146;s amendment, I have thought seriously that I might bring this back at a later stage because it would be a simpler and probably cheaper way of achieving the objectives that she has in mind.</p>

We welcome the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, into our midst today, but it appears that he has brought with him some of the spin that we so deplored in the Administration of the previous Prime Minister. When the Home Secretary says, &#147;I deeply regret that some have been prepared to ignore the terrorist threat for fear of taking a tough but necessary decision in relation to our deliberations today&#148;, it is clear that spin has come back into the Government&#146;s armoury. I deeply resent the suggestion that we have ignored the terrorist threat by our decision. I have made the point over and over again that we oppose the proposals put forward by the Government because we believe that they would increase the terrorist threat by alienating a significant part of the community of this country. We feared that what they were doing was more likely to increase terrorism than otherwise. We on these Benches have no fear of taking tough and necessary decisions and I suggest we have an election so that we can be over there to take those decisions.</p>

My noble friend referred to Amendment No. 36. Subsections (3) and (4) of the proposed new clause seems to put this issue in lay-man terms. As my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew knows, I am a mere chartered accountant so I have no major or professional interest in this part of the Bill. However, I was interested to see that proposed new subsection (4) encapsulates much of what we were discussing and voting on earlier. It is particularly important and I am sure the Minister will be able to give major consolation to both my noble friend and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd.</p>

The point of the amendment is to probe what the Government have to say in response to a suggestion that in certain and, I am sure, limited circumstances it might be appropriate for the court to order pre-charge bail. It may not happen very often and would have to be handled sensitively&#151;clearly, for the most serious offences it would not be appropriate&#151;but there might be a situation when it would be sensible.

Something I have come across throughout my career is that people who have responsibility for something often have a slightly different view of it. That was all I meant.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08101337000144"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said that the amendments were exploratory, and I shall take them all together. On Amendment No. 34, we believe that extension hearings are already fully adversarial and that most of the proposals put forward in the amendments are already covered in existing provisions on the extension of detention in Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08101337000145"></a>It is already a requirement that public authorities act in accordance with the ECHR under the Human Rights Act 1998. Nothing in Schedule 8 might require a judicial authority to act in any way other than compatibly with Article 5.4 or any other convention right, so the proposed new paragraph 29(7) is completely unnecessary. The extension hearings are a mechanism by which we give effect to Article 5.4. They provide a judicial hearing under which the lawfulness of the suspect&#146;s detention is reviewed.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08101337000146"></a>Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 already provides for the detained person to make written or oral representations and be legally represented. Extension hearings apply only to people held on suspicion of terrorist offences or involvement in terrorist activity in any event. The prosecution must demonstrate to the judge that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention is necessary, that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously and why more time is needed to obtain, preserve, examine or analyse relevant evidence.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08101337000147"></a>Sometimes an ex parte hearing&#151;closed part&#151;is required during the application process to authorise the withholding of information from the detainee. These are not routine and can be ordered only on limited and proportionate grounds. They are only a part of the process and are closed for a reason: for example, to prevent evidence being destroyed or that others might be alerted to the detail of the investigations. The judge may also exclude the detainee from part of the application hearing itself under paragraph 33. The grounds on which this exclusion may be made are left to the discretion of the judge. This process has been endorsed by the House of Lords in the case of Ward v<I></I>Police Service of Northern Ireland. The detainee may need to be excluded where, for example, the judge

The police are entitled to withhold this information from the suspect until the interview itself; therefore, only by excluding the suspect could the judge examine the legitimacy of this reason for why further detention is necessary.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08101337000148"></a>Conducting this examination is in the detainee&#146;s best interests; it ensures that there really are proper lines of inquiry left to conduct. However, it is important to note that closed hearings get rarer as time goes on. In fact, in extension applications for 17 individuals after the 14-day point, only one ex parte hearing has been conducted by the prosecution. </p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08101337000149"></a>We continue to believe that extension proceedings are currently fully adversarial. The one that I saw at Paddington Green was amazingly thorough. It gave the man the opportunity to know what was going on and gave the judge the opportunity to really see what the police were doing; indeed, the judge gave the police a hard time and granted them only a small extension. The suspect is entitled to legal representation and to be present at the open part of the hearing.</p>

The judge whom I accompanied at Paddington Green was extremely thorough. He went into considerable detail to make sure that it was appropriate for the man concerned to be held while further investigations were going on. He gave them only a very short time.

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08101337000165"></a>Video links are often used for the suspect&#146;s appearance as both the security risks and resource implications justify such an approach; in any event, video link is routinely used in other judicial hearings. The judge may order the suspect to be present in person if there is reason. He or she does not always do that: it is often to do with security or movement of people. Such hearings without special advocates comply with human rights, but should in a particular case the judge consider that fairness requires a special advocate to be appointed, he or she could do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08101337000166"></a>In relation to the point that the existing grounds for issuing a warrant for the further detention of a suspect beyond 14 days should be amended to include a requirement that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has been involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of a terrorist offence, it is implicit in any successful application for a warrant that the initial arrest was lawful and that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the person has committed a terrorist offence.</p>

<a name="81013-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08101337000167"></a>The test for a lawful arrest under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is that the constable reasonably suspects that the individual is a terrorist as defined in Section 40 of that Act. This reasonable suspicion is an implicit prerequisite for the test which is currently required to extend pre-charge detention. If a court is to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that further detention is necessary for the purposes of obtaining relevant evidence, there must inevitably be a reasonable suspicion that the person committed the offence. The minimum standard that the prosecution or police must demonstrate is that there are reasonable grounds on which to suspect that person. Conversely, without reasonable grounds to suspect that person, the prosecution or police could not even commence an application for further detention on grounds of securing relevant evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08101337000170"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 35 is threefold: to replace the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation with a panel of reviewers; to provide that the Motion approving the order for annual renewal of the 28-day limit cannot be made until a minimum of one month after the annual report on the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000, and Part 1 of the Terrorism Act 2006, has been published; and to provide that the Secretary of State cannot appoint the independent reviewer unless he or she lays a report on the appointment process before Parliament and it is agreed by affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="81013-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08101337000171"></a>In our response to the JCHR on 6 June, we made it clear that we do not consider it necessary to replace the independent reviewer with a panel of reviewers and that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, has done, and continues to do, an excellent job. We do not accept that his post is too heavily loaded for one person. The appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was renewed for a further three years in October 2007. We do not believe that it is necessary for Parliament to agree a report on the appointment process, as this is unnecessarily bureaucratic. Having a statutory requirement to publish the annual reports a month in advance of the renewal debates would be difficult. Where possible, we ensure that the report made by the independent reviewer is available in advance of the annual renewal debates, but this cannot be guaranteed. I therefore resist this amendment</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08101337000172"></a>I am unable to accept Amendment No. 36. It seeks to put the threshold test used by the Crown Prosecution Service on a statutory footing, but only for cases with a terrorist connection. It would also require that defendants be informed which test had been used; the courts to set timetables regarding evidence; and annual reports by Her Majesty&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate on the operation of the threshold test for cases with a terrorist connection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08101337000173"></a>In rejecting this amendment, I have taken into account the fact that there is already a statutory requirement for the Director of Public Prosecutions to issue formal published guidance on charging under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This statutory framework emphasises the independence of the Crown Prosecution Service and recognises the need for regular revision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to take into account changes to the law or circumstances. Both those factors make the charging test unsuitable for primary legislation. It would be particularly inappropriate to enshrine only one of the charging standards in statute and only

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08101337000174"></a>The current version of the code for Crown prosecutors was issued in 2004 and is the fifth edition. The code is laid before Parliament whenever it is revised, but the contents of the code are not statutory, although it is binding on prosecutors. The code was the subject of public consultation when it was last revised in 2004 and sets out two tests&#151;the full code test and the threshold test. Both these tests have two stages&#151;the evidential stage and the public interest stage. Interestingly, the amendments laid here do not mention the public interest test. Only if the evidential stage is met does the prosecutor go on to consider whether it is in the public interest to prosecute the case.</p>

<a name="81013-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08101337000175"></a>Under the full code test, a suspect can be charged where there is a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to charge that suspect. By contrast, the threshold test requires Crown prosecutors to decide whether there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed an offence and, if there is, whether it is in the public interest to charge. In deciding whether there is a reasonable suspicion, prosecutors must also make a clear evidential decision. They are directed under the code to consider the evidence already available and the reasonableness for believing that further relevant evidence will become available within a reasonable period sufficient to meet the full code test.</p>

<a name="81013-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08101337000176"></a>Under the code, the threshold test is applied only to those cases in which it is not appropriate to release a suspect on bail after charge but the evidence to apply the full code test is not yet available. Obviously such circumstances may apply not just in terrorism cases but in other serious criminal cases as well.</p>

<a name="81013-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08101337000177"></a>The threshold test is applied only for a limited period. The charging decision is kept under review by the prosecutor and the full code test must be met as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, I should point out that Her Majesty&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate already carries out thematic inspections of charging across criminal case work, and that includes the threshold test. A statutory requirement to inform the defendant which evidential test has been applied would not add value or safeguard the rights of the defendant.</p>

In most cases, the first hearing will take place within 24 hours of the charging decision. At that stage, there will be clear consideration of the evidence in relation to the bail application. The Bail Act 1976 specifically requires the strength of evidence justifying retention in custody to be considered. The legal process already allows the court to set time limits for the service of further material. It also permits applications to the court to be made for the case to be dismissed due to lack of evidence at an early stage in proceedings.</p>

Advising the defence at the point of charge what test they have been charged under would not assist the defence or add any extra safeguards to the extensive ones that already exist.

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08101337000180"></a>On Amendment No. 71, we have considered the option of allowing terrorist suspects to be released on bail and have consulted the police. They did not recommend making police bail available for terrorist suspects because of the risks to public safety that might be involved. There is also a risk, which we are unwilling to take&#151;</p>

However, some terrorist charges are quite minor, and when we visited the police, they seemed to have no objection in relation to those. Surely there would be an objection to bail if there was any suspicion of danger to the public, and it would be completely reasonable for bail to be refused. But if there is no suspicion of danger to the public&#151;the person may have turned Queen's evidence or been co-operating considerably with the police&#151;I would have thought that bail would be perfectly reasonable.</p>

I enthusiastically agree with all of that. However, given that that is the Government's position, I do not understand why one should not at least empower the judiciary in exceptional cases to be able to grant bail. The Joint Committee recommended a provision,</p>
<ul><a name="08101337000244"></a>&#147;to make court-ordered pre-charge bail with conditions available in relation to terrorism offences ... the availability of bail with conditions would enable the police to continue their investigation of those suspected of terrorism offences who do not pose a risk to public safety or a flight risk, while at the same time maintaining some control over them through bail conditions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08101337000212"></a>Why can we not trust the judiciary with such a power to be able to protect the rights of liberty in those rare and exceptional cases referred to by the Joint Committee?</p>

The necessary requirement test in paragraph 32 of Schedule 8 ensures that each case is assessed on its merits. If the test is not met, the court has the power to release the suspect rather than grant continued detention. I shall take this away and look at it, because there might be some room for flexibility. I would rather do that because, as I say, I respect the sense of our judiciary in some of these cases. However, in most terrorist cases, I would be very concerned about suspects being released on bail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08101337000187"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, mentioned the independent commissioner, and he is absolutely right. I thought that that seemed like a very good idea indeed, though I admit that I have not had the full answer from all of my officials on it yet. I know that they have said that they do not think that it is necessary; that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, reviews it; and that independent visitors can visit&#151;all of which are good points. However, I would like to pursue this a little further as well. There may be administrative or other reasons why it is impossible, but I would like to be certain that that is the case. I hope that I have answered the other questions. If so, I would be grateful if the amendment were withdrawn.</p>

I make it clear that, as my noble friend Lord Carlile mentioned in the earlier debate, he and I have been close friends and colleagues for 37 years. I do not for a moment doubt his integrity or&#151;although I may disagree with him&#151;the reasons why he puts forward the views that he has expressed today. However, I wonder whether it is appropriate that the independent reviewer should have an office within the Home Office itself and be serviced by Home Office officials, which is the current position. This does not just apply to my noble friend Lord Carlile but to anybody who may hold that office in the future. If we are to have an independent reviewer, he should be seen to be independent, have his own office and staff, and, when he comes to give his view to both your Lordships and to Parliament as a whole, we should know that it comes from somebody who is in no way influenced by the views circulating in the Home Office at any particular moment. It may not be my noble friend, but his successor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08101337000189"></a>On Amendment No. 36, there is a great deal of sense in having a statutory basis for the threshold charging. As I pointed out in my speech earlier today, the guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions to his prosecutors was not published and did not come to light until February of this year. For a period of two to three years, the public were unaware of the nature of the threshold charging going on in terrorism cases. That involved not only a reasonable suspicion that a person had committed a terrorist offence but that there was a likelihood that more evidence would come to light. Further, that decision could be based on inadmissible evidence&#151;intelligence or intercept evidence. It seems to me that we ought not to encourage the Director of Public Prosecutions to give guidance to public prosecutors that is not absolutely transparent

First, I pay tribute to the appointment of the new Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, who is one of the most outstanding human rights lawyers at the English Bar. The fact that he succeeds Ken Macdonald, a most impressive holder of that office, is a most important safeguard. I always believe that people are more important than rules or legal structures and the fact that Keir Starmer QC will hold that office constitutes a confidence-building measure.</p>

<a name="81013-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08101337000191"></a>Secondly, I thank the Minister for his very full reply. I am sure that the Joint Committee on Human Rights will need to look with great care at everything that he has said this evening when deciding what response is called for. Thirdly, I personally am sympathetic to the use of the special advocate procedure, and indeed I have said so consistently. People forget that it originated in a case in Strasbourg and was a Canadian procedure recommended by Amnesty International which came to be used in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. I well understand why that is a desirable compromise between full adversarial justice and inquisitorial justice. However, it is vital to think very carefully about any further safeguards against abuse that one can build into the system, always accepting that nothing should be done to enable a suspected terrorist to gain access to information which might then be leaked or used by terrorist organisations. Speaking for myself, I very much welcome the spirit in

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0810133000010"></a>On 8 October 2008 I announced that, by order (the Transfer of Rights and Liabilities to ING Order 2008, No. 2666) under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, the retail deposit business of two Icelandic banks, Kaupthing and Landsbanki, with UK subsidiaries, respectively, Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander (KSF) and Heritable, have been transferred to ING Direct.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0810133000011"></a>Acting on the advice of the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority (FSA), and in order to ensure the stability of the UK financial system, the Treasury took action to protect the retail depositors in KSF, a UK-based banking subsidiary of Kaupthing, and in Heritable, a UK-incorporated banking subsidiary of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki. Landsbanki has entered an insolvency process in Iceland.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0810133000012"></a>Heritable and KSF are regulated by the FSA. The FSA concluded on 7 October 2008 that Heritable no longer met its threshold conditions, and was likely to be unable to continue to meet its obligations to depositors. The FSA concluded on 8 October 2008 that KSF no longer met its threshold conditions, and was likely to be unable to continue to meet its obligations to depositors.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0810133000013"></a>The FSA determined that for each bank there had been an event of default under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). It was then urgently necessary for the Treasury to intervene in the public interest. The Treasury has used the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 to ensure a resolution that fully protects UK retail depositors and preserves financial stability. Savers' money is safe and secure, and customers will be able to access their accounts as usual.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0810133000014"></a>This action by the tripartite authorities protects savers' money and provides continuity of business for retail depositors by transferring their deposits to ING Direct. The rest of the business has been put into administration. In time the Treasury will be able to make a claim in the administration of Heritable and KSF as the businesses are wound up and their assets are sold.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0810133000015"></a>Under the transfer order, the FSCS has paid out approximately &#163;3 billion to enable retail deposits held in Heritable and KSF and covered by the FSCS to be transferred to ING Direct. The FSCS has financed its payout through a short-term loan from the Bank of England, which will be replaced with a loan from the Government after a short period of time.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0810133000016"></a>HM Treasury made a payment to ING Direct for retail deposit amounts not covered by the FSCS, amounting to approximately &#163;600 million. In return, the FSCS and HM Treasury have acquired rights in respects of the proceeds of the wind-down and realisation of the assets of the remaining business of Heritable and KSF in public ownership.</p>

Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;600 million was met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0810133000018"></a>On 29 September 2008 the Government announced that by order (the Bradford and Bingley plc Transfer of Securities and Property etc. Order 2008, No. 254) under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, Bradford and Bingley's UK and Isle of Man retail deposit business along with its branch network has been transferred to Abbey National plc. This transfer follows a competitive sale process for this part of the business. The remainder of Bradford and Bingley's business has been taken into public ownership. This action by the tripartite authorities protects savers' money by transferring their deposits to Abbey.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0810133000019"></a>Following the turbulence in global financial markets, Bradford and Bingley found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution. The FSA determined in the morning of Saturday 27 September that the firm no longer met its threshold conditions for operating as a deposit taker under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and FSA rules.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0810133000020"></a>The Government, on the advice of the FSA and the Bank of England, acted immediately to maintain financial stability and protect depositors, while minimising the exposure to taxpayers. It worked over the weekend to bring about the part-public, part-private solution which best meets those objectives.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0810133000021"></a>The transfer of the retail deposit book has been backed by cash from HM Treasury and the FSCS. The FSCS was triggered following the determination by the FSA that Bradford and Bingley was unable or likely to be unable to satisfy claims against it, prior to the making of the transfer order.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0810133000022"></a>Under the transfer order, the FSCS has paid out approximately &#163;14 billion to enable retail deposits held in Bradford and Bingley and covered by the FSCS to be transferred to Abbey. The FSCS has financed its payout through a short-term loan from the Bank of England, which will be replaced with a loan from the Government after a short period of time.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0810133000023"></a>HM Treasury made a payment to Abbey for retail deposit amounts not covered by the FSCS, amounting to approximately &#163;4 billion, this sum being net of &#163;612 million receipt from Abbey. In return, the FSCS and HM Treasury have acquired rights in respects of the proceeds of the wind-down and realisation of the assets of the remaining business of Bradford and Bingley in public ownership.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0810133000024"></a>Parliamentary approval for additional provision of &#163;4.6 billion for this new expenditure will be sought in a supplementary estimate for HM Treasury.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0810133000025"></a>An out-of-turn supplementary estimate will restore the Contingencies Fund to normal levels, as well as providing for the funding of the recapitalisation scheme

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="0810133000026"></a><a name="81013-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81013-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0810133000063"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0810133000027"></a>Today I would like to update the House on progress with our 14-to-19 education reforms, and the next steps in realising our ambition that all young people should participate and achieve in learning until at least their 18th birthday.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0810133000028"></a>Last month saw first teaching of the new diploma qualification. My department has received much positive feedback from young people taking the new diploma qualification, describing how exciting and enjoyable they have found their studies, and from teachers who have been impressed by how successfully the distinctive new curriculum, combining theoretical studies with practical work-based experiences, has engaged their students.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0810133000029"></a>Our reform programme has also received positive and constructive external scrutiny. In September, Ofsted published a progress report on the implementation of 14-to-19 reforms so far. The report confirmed the positive impact that local 14-to-19 strategies were already having in raising achievement, increasing participation and retaining learners in education and training, and setting out the areas where further work was needed in order to ensure the reforms secured the best possible outcomes for our young people.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0810133000030"></a>Earlier this month the Public Accounts Committee produced a report commending the diploma for the opportunity it provided young people to study for qualifications integrating academic and vocational learning, but also rightly pointing out the importance of ensuring that all schools, colleges and work-based learning providers are supported to teach diplomas, not just those teaching from this September. We now have support programmes in place for those teaching diplomas in 2009 and 2010, as well as those who have not yet applied successfully to deliver the diploma.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0810133000031"></a>The latest information we have from local consortia indicates that around 12,000young people are currently working towards a diploma qualification. Our focus continues to be on the standard of teaching of the diploma, and on supporting the system to build the capacity to deliver these reforms to the quality our young people deserve and at all times putting quality before quantity as we take forward the diploma programme.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0810133000032"></a>Legislation currently before the House would have the effect of raising the age to which young people must participate in learning from 16 to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. If this legislation is passed, then the   


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS26"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column WS26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around 600,000 young people starting secondary school last month will be the first young people who will have to stay on in learning beyond 16. That is why I am today publishing <I>Delivering 14-19 R</I><I>eform: Next Steps, </I>an implementation plan setting out in detail the journey we and our partners will take between now and 2015 to ensure every young person in the country is able to reach their full potential, enjoying first-rate educational provision which both stretches and engages them, and prepares them to progress on to higher education or skilled employment. It also sets out the support which will be made available to ensure that young people continue to be able to access this provision, whatever financial or challenging personal circumstances they might face.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0810133000033"></a>In addition, it confirms our commitment to ensuring that the ideas and energy of the young people themselves should directly impact upon the planning and delivery of reforms at a local level. We will establish a pilot scheme involving some of those areas delivering from September 2010 to see how the student voice can be taken into account most effectively, which will inform a firmer requirement on consortia to demonstrate how they take the views of young people into account in the fourth diploma gateway. We will also establish a national 14-to-19 learner panel by spring 2009.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0810133000034"></a>Higher education and business support for the diploma has also continued to grow. Wellington College has confirmed its intention to offer the diploma in engineering as early as September 2009. All the Russell and 1994 group universities have publicly stated that they will consider applications from diploma students. Our network of diploma employer champions has now expanded to over 80, including such household names as Land Rover, Vodafone and Toshiba.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0810133000035"></a>I am also announcing today the criteria against which bids for the &#163;55 million-worth of funding available for the development of exemplary diploma facilities, announced in July, will be assessed. This will allow work to begin on the development of a series of projects that will create world-class diploma facilities to benefit learners and act as showpieces to inspire the whole sector.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0810133000036"></a>Just one example of the exciting new projects already under way are the plans for a new academy, sponsored by JCB, that would be at the forefront of diploma delivery at levels 1, 2 and 3 in engineering and manufacturing and product design. The academy would be located next to JCB's world headquarters in east Staffordshire and would admit pupils from across Staffordshire, Stoke, Derby city and Derbyshire.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0810133000037"></a>There is much more work to be done to guarantee the successful implementation of our reforms, but I am highly encouraged by our progress to date.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0810133000039"></a>Further to the announcement that my predecessor made on 22 May 2008, I am pleased to be able to provide further details of the Ministry of Defence&#146;s plans to mark this year&#146;s 90th anniversary of the Great War armistice on Tuesday 11 November.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0810133000040"></a>We very much hope that the principal participants on 11 November will be remaining veterans of World War 1, who will lay wreaths as they remember fallen comrades of the Great War.  A short service will be led by the bishop of the Armed Forces, the right reverend David Conner, and military musicians and a choir will provide music.  The service will start at 10.45 am and will last for around 25 minutes.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0810133000041"></a>This unique service will take place two days after our annual national act of remembrance for the fallen of the two world wars and conflicts since on Remembrance Sunday, when Her Majesty the Queen, other members of the Royal Family, senior politicians, military chiefs and heads of missions in London will lay wreaths and pay their respects.  No additional wreaths will therefore be laid by dignitaries on 11 November, but many will be in attendance to watch this historic event.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0810133000042"></a>The MoD is currently in discussions about broadcasting the event live so it can be seen by a wider audience.  While members of the public will be welcome to watch, this will not be a ticketed event.  The Royal British Legion is organising &#147;Silence in the Square&#148; in Trafalgar Square. This event is aimed at promoting public participation in a collective act of commemoration at 11 am.  It is hoped that a large screen on Trafalgar Square will show the events taking place at the Cenotaph to ensure that those there can share in the commemoration and any members of the public who cannot be accommodated in Whitehall will be directed there.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="0810133000043"></a><a name="81013-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81013-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="0810133000065"></a>The Minister for State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0810133000044"></a>The House will be aware that the Ministry of Defence is investigating the disappearance of a computer hard drive from the premises of a contractor, EDS, at Hook.  This incident has happened in part as a result of the work that the MoD has been doing in partnership with EDS to implement the requirements of the Cabinet Office&#146;s data handling review (DHR) and our own action plan following Sir Edmund Burton&#146;s review into data handling in the MoD.  This process of departmental improvement will continue to root out and expose areas where shortcomings need to be tackled.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0810133000045"></a>In this most recent case, while conducting an audit of storage media, EDS found that it could not find a removable hard disk drive.  Under the terms of its contract EDS is required to protect all personal information in its care.  The hard drive had been used with the TAFMIS recruitment system and may, in the worst case, contain details relating to 1.7 million individuals who have inquired about joining the Armed Forces.  For casual inquiries this will include no more than a name and contact details.  But for those who applied to join the forces more extensive personal data  


<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS28"></a><b>13 Oct 2008 : Column WS28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be held.  In some cases this will include personal information such as next of kin details, passport and national insurance numbers, drivers&#146; licence and bank details and National Health Service numbers.  EDS assesses that it is unlikely that the device was encrypted because it was stored within a secure site that exceeded the standards necessary for restricted information.  An investigation is being conducted by the MoD Police.  The MoD has set up a helpline for those who may be affected by this incident, and for those individuals whose financial details may be involved, action has been taken through APACS (the Association for Payment Clearing Services) to inform banks so that the relevant accounts can be flagged for scrutiny against unauthorised access.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0810133000046"></a>As a result of the review conducted earlier this year by Sir Edmund Burton, the MoD is clear about the crucial need to implement wholesale improvements in how we store, protect and manage the use of personal data.  We are also clear that we need to effect a significant behavioural change among our people at all levels.  We are currently engaged in a comprehensive programme to do all of this.  The MoD is a large department operating many complex data systems worldwide, often at very short notice and under extreme conditions.  This presents additional challenges and risks in the implementation of rapid change&#151;however, we are determined to ensure that we effect that change.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0810133000047"></a>We have pursued the task with urgency and commitment and in the process we have identified further opportunities for improvement.  The progress that the department has made to date is consistent with that required by the DHR timetable and the commitments we have made to the Information Commissioner.  Some of the greatest challenges that we have had to overcome relate to incorporating stricter data handling standards into existing contracts and their related systems retrospectively.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0810133000048"></a>We have undertaken a series of comprehensive reviews into our personal data holdings, looking wider than our personnel systems, and assess that we hold in excess of 200 million records.  By the end of October, as agreed, all personal data held by the MoD will be under the new governance regime required by DHR.  This work relies heavily on reciprocal commitment from our key suppliers.  Central to it is our continuing detailed census of storage as part of our commitment to good data management.  In line with this, it is intended to reveal whether any storage devices cannot be accounted for.  Such cases are treated very seriously with immediate action to investigate the loss, engage individuals who might be at risk of compromise and alert the Information Commissioner.  This process led to the discovery of the missing hard drive at the EDS site in Hook.</p>

<a name="81013-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0810133000049"></a>The fact that this event, and another involving a suspected theft at Innsworth, has occurred on a high-security site manned by cleared personnel illustrates the need continually to review and enhance our arrangements for personal data.  This work relies heavily on reciprocal commitment from our partners. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0810133000050"></a>The Information Commissioner&#146;s Office recognises that we may uncover further issues as we implement our assurance regime.  This is a direct result of emplacing

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0810133000052"></a>I am very pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence has awarded a contract to the Inteq Consortium for the redevelopment of, and provision of services to, the Basil Hill site in Corsham, Wiltshire.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0810133000053"></a>The purpose of this private finance initiative,  part of the Corsham09 Programme, is to maximise defence operational effectiveness and business by providing a coherent information infrastructure and assuring the delivery of integrated information solutions throughout the MoD and to our Armed Forces, both at home and abroad. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0810133000054"></a>The modernisation and redevelopment of the Basil Hill site will enable defence equipment and support military and civilian personnel and other MoD staff, who are currently located on various sites in the Corsham area, to be brought together on the one site.  This will provide a greater unity of purpose against the developing backdrop of high-tempo global operations and coalition partnering, and will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation, thus enabling us to continue to provide world-class communications systems and services to our Armed Forces.  </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0810133000055"></a>The Corsham09 PFI contract, worth some &#163;690 million over the next 25 years, will deliver modern living and working accommodation for up to 2,200 personnel, including the provision of some 180 en-suite bed spaces for service men and women.  The contract also includes provision for the delivery of a wide range of services,

Some 80 MoD civilian posts will transfer to the new service provider, Inteq.  No redundancies are anticipated as a result of the transfer, which will be handled in accordance with existing legislation and the Ministry of Defence&#146;s Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations(TUPE) code of practice.  The trade unions have been involved throughout the process, and a formal consultation period is currently under way. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="0810133000056"></a>Some of the services that, in future, will be delivered by Inteq are already provided under contract to the MoD.  As a result, approximately 100 people currently employed by contractors will also transfer, in accordance with TUPE legislation, to the Inteq Consortium.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0810133000057"></a>The agreement we have reached with Inteq will benefit not only our Armed Forces, but also the local community and economy, as well as the wider UK economy. The PFI contract will help to secure existing jobs in the local area with the potential for new jobs to be created.

This work stemmed from earlier analysis and feasibility studies carried out on four candidate naval gun systems:</p>
USA&#151;BAE Land and Armament Systems (formerly United Defense) Mk 45 Mod 4 127mm (5 inch) gun;UK&#151;BAE systems (RO Defence) 155mm (6.1 inch) third Generation Maritime Fire Support Proposal;Italy&#151;OTO Melara 127mm (5 inch) lightweight gun; andGermany&#151;MONARC 155mm (6.1 inch) naval gun.

In 1999, RAF aircraft were among the first in the world certified to fly on up to 56 per cent non-crude oil derived synthetic fuel. Since April 2008, RAF aircraft have been certified to use 100 per cent synthetic fuel. Work continues to achieve the wider use of synthetic fuels for ships and land vehicles.</p>

<ul><a name="08101317000209"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_8"></a>What independent information they are seeking, and with what funding, on the current needs of disabled people for income support, especially those too young, too elderly or too severely disabled to have any prospect of finding employment. [HL5326]</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_56"></a><a name="08101317000103"></a>Employment and support allowance is a radical move away from the existing system of support. Our underlying principle is to help a person back into work where that is possible. We have made very clear that we will not write anyone off.</p>

<a name="81013w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_57"></a><a name="08101317000104"></a>We recognise, however, that for the most severely disabled people, finding employment may not be an option. We will be targeting additional help and support on the most vulnerable through the support group and guaranteeing an income for those in the greatest financial need of &#163;102.10 per week. For some people that is almost &#163;16 a week more than the current income support rate.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_58"></a><a name="08101317000105"></a>In addition, severely disabled people with care or mobility needs may be eligible for disability living allowance which makes a valuable contribution towards the extra costs of disability and can be paid regardless of whether someone is in or out of work, or also receiving employment and support allowance. Similarly, attendance allowance contributes to the extra costs of disability for people who become disabled after the age of 65.</p>

<a name="81013w0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_59"></a><a name="08101317000106"></a>We will be evaluating the new benefit, including the commissioning of independent reports, to ensure it meets our aims and objectives and the needs of disabled people.</p>

In 2007, this applied to 611 out of a total of 35,946 cycles. These figures do not enable the HFEA to track the total number of patients who are at risk of or suffer from OHSS.</p>

However, we did ensure where relevant that all respondents were responsible for the provision of live music at that venue. This means they would have had knowledge of any changes to their licence in relation to live music. The survey did not ask about the length of time the interviewee had been working at the venue but did ask a related question about the length of time they had been responsible for live music at the venue. The contractors reported that 60 per cent of respondents had held this responsibility for more than two years. This may be an underestimate as some of the 40 per cent who did not hold the responsibility may have worked there for longer than two years in some other capacity.</p>

We are looking at how we can simplify aspects of the application processes to relieve some of the burden and have also agreed to look at the feasibility of alternative licensing arrangements which better reflect the nature of travelling entertainment performed at multiple sites.</p>

The DCMS has been developing options for consultation to exempt low impact (de minimis) licensing activities from the scope of the 2003 Act. The Government do not undertake amendments to primary legislation lightly, particularly in the case of legislation which was only brought fully into force within the past three years. As part of that work, we are considering exemptions for small and incidental live music events, taking into account the recommendations made by the Live Music Forum. Officials have had discussions with stakeholders, including the Musicians' Union, which aim to develop exemptions that can benefit live music without jeopardising the licensing objectives. We hope to publish a consultation document in the autumn, and subject to the outcome, to have the exemptions in place by spring 2009.</p>

It is for the parties to agree how and when these powers will devolve. There are also important issues relating to areas already devolved which the Executive need to resolve. The Government regret that the Executive have not met since June. The Government urge the parties to agree a way forward which enables the Executive to resume regular meetings and enables devolution to be completed as soon as possible. The Government believe that there is no single issue that the parties cannot resolve through constructive dialogue, if they are willing to do so, and welcome recent statements by the First and Deputy First Ministers committing them to such dialogue. The Secretary of State assesses progress through his contacts and meetings with the party leaders and with the First and Deputy First Ministers. The Government remain committed to working with the parties to ensure the successful implementation of the St Andrews agreement.</p>
