As I have already said to the House, Defra will shortly re-send that guidance by way of a reminder. It is more important for government departments to have regard to the status of national parks than a specific responsibility to advance their causes.</p>

<a name="08061266000030"></a><a name="80612-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80612-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061266000612"></a>Lord Judd:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I declare an interest as the vice-president of the Council for National Parks and president of the Friends of the Lake District. Does my noble friend agree that the vision and commitment of those who fought for the parks is more relevant than ever in our pressurised and stressed society? Does he further agree that they are literally the lungs and places for the physical and mental regeneration of the population? Is there not a danger that, because of other priorities, there could be a process of erosion and suburbanisation of the parks? Is it not essential that all government departments with any involvement in the parks have at the top of their priorities the preservation of this very special asset?</p>

The national parks are there as lungs for the nation and are vastly used by millions of city dwellers. That does not mean to say that development will not take place in the national parks. That will have to be sustainable and take account of the economic and social circumstances of people living in the parks. But the national parks are not under threat from either the Planning Bill, which the House will receive in due course, or from their use by the Ministry of Defence. Indeed, in some parts of the national parks the land has probably been better looked after from a biodiversity point of view by the MoD than it would have been if it were otherwise.</p>

As the Government are issuing new guidance, as the Minister mentioned, will they consider establishing different criteria for different parks that take into account traditional activities as well as natural criteria?</p>

I promised to do that in a recent debate on areas of outstanding natural beauty and it is important that that is done. National parks each have their own authority and their own planning rules. As I have said, developments are taking place that need to be sustainable and take account of the circumstances, both social and economic, of the individual parks. I agree with the noble Duke that it is not a one-size-fits-all situation but there are no plans for the issue of new rules specific to each national park.</p>

I know the Minister comes down to the West Country every now and again, and I am sure he is aware that the Dartmoor National Park Authority and the Ministry of Defence work well together. Does he agree that it is imperative that our troops have a training area conveniently situated, like Dartmoor, so that they can have rigorous and realistic training?</p>

He is right. Areas of isolation away from the main population are, almost by definition, in the national parks, particularly areas of Dartmoor. That applies also to the Lake District when it comes to low flying practice. I know people have been irritated by it in the past, but all that irritation stopped during the first Gulf War when they saw how vital it was. There is a disturbance factor but, as I have said, those areas are vital for the training of our troops before they are sent abroad. We have a small island and a large population, so it is right that we use those areas that are isolated. As I have said, the land and the biodiversity are probably better looked after, in some respects, than if the MoD was not using that land. That applies particularly to the Dartmoor area.</p>

However, the PMOI remains on the list of EU-proscribed organisations. Is it not there because the British Government wanted it to be there, and is not the legal basis for it being proscribed by the EU the listing by Britain?

The EU listings are based on a national-competent-authority decision; namely, that a domestic proscription or asset-freeze should be in place.

<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>How many prisoner escort drivers are also employed as court orderlies.</p>

The contracts permit contractors to use escort staff for custodial duties. This enables them to make the best use of their staff and to service the variable workload of the courts. Contractors report that they regularly use escort staff for custodial duties, but they do not keep records of the number of occasions on which escort drivers undertake those duties.</p>

My concern is that all too often one hears that drivers do not leave courts until after the courts have closed, as drivers acting as court orderlies are unable to start the journey until then. Recently, for instance, a boy was taken from a court on the south coast. He had nearly reached Feltham when the van was turned round and had to go back to court to collect a suicidal woman, who was taken to Holloway. The van finally arrived at Feltham after midnight. The point is that, if vans leave too late, they arrive at prisons late and there is not proper time to assess prisoners, particularly the vulnerable, the suicidal, women and children. I hope that the Minister will make certain that no escort driver should also act as a court orderly. Will that be put in contracts in future?</p>

The specific instance that he raises has, of course, been investigated. My honourable friend Maria Eagle has written to appropriate Members on that issue. In general, the contractors are dealing with considerable challenges at the moment because of prison population pressures. However, I am satisfied that we have the appropriate monitoring in place and that they are doing everything that they can to make sure that incidents such as the one that the noble Lord mentioned are as rare as possible.</p>

Would it not have been possible on that occasion for the court officials to have walked that prisoner from one court to the other?</p>

Let me make it clear that the vehicle did not make a special journey to Northampton solely to move one prisoner from the Crown Court to the magistrates&#146; court. The vehicle left the contractor&#146;s base in Leicester to collect prisoners from Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Bedford and to deliver them to Cambridge magistrates&#146; court. The vehicle was then routed to Northampton to transfer the prisoner from the Crown Court to the magistrates&#146; court and to collect prisoners from the magistrates&#146; court and escort them to Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Glen Parva in Leicestershire before returning to the Leicester base. That seems to be a perfectly appropriate thing to have done.</p>

I accept everything that the noble Baroness says. However, despite the current pressures in the system, the figures for 2007-08 show that 97 per cent of prisoners were delivered to the prison before reception closure.

That is why we have set a challenging target that 100 per cent of prisoners should be delivered before reception closes. When that is not possible, great care is taken to liaise with the appropriate establishment to ensure that an appropriate assessment takes place, but I accept that this is a considerable challenge.</p>

LOCOG&#146;s aim is to protect the ecology and historic nature of Greenwich Park, including the buildings and archaeology that form the backdrop to the venue, and to avoid any sensitive areas. The site will be fully restored after the event.</p>

However, I find it a stretch of the imagination to understand how it can be restored when presumably a large number of trees will have to be demolished in order to make way for the 170-acre utilisation of the park for the creation of a three-day-event venue. That will be significantly less than the 1,800 acres used in the other principal establishments in this country for the same sport. Given that we have some medal aspirations for this sport, is it not unreasonable to restrict the crowd to about 25,000 compared with the 200,000 or so who can be accommodated elsewhere? How would the Olympic budget cope with the loss of revenue represented by such a restriction on the crowd?</p>

There will be more spectators around the course. It is a restricted site in comparison with others, but it has the supreme advantage of being very close to the main Olympic facilities. This is London&#146;s bid and it is only appropriate that these important events should be located within the capital if possible. The bid met with the full approval of the vetting authorities in those terms. However, a great deal of work needs to be done.</p>

I do not have a direct answer for the noble Baroness, but she and the House should accept that LOCOG is well aware of the significant historical nature of this site. It is of great value to all people in the United Kingdom. Nothing will be done to damage the site.</p>

For example, the football pitches at Hackney Marsh were supposed to disappear, but they are not going to; they will come back in better condition. Will LOCOG ensure that anything that is disrupted is improved, and that, if we lose the odd tree, we plant two instead?</p>

That is why I am confident in answering the noble Baroness&#146;s question about whether facilities will be lost. If it proved absolutely necessary to take some away permanently, there would be an obligation to replace them elsewhere.

We all appreciate that Greenwich, by comparison, has greater difficulty with regard to public transport. Nevertheless, my noble friend is right. As far as possible, these will be the green Games. In order to be the green Games, public transport must play a significant part.</p>

The Greenwich site will be used only for the equestrian events and the running and riding parts of the pentathlon. Its use will be much more limited. A crucial part of London&#146;s bid is that the vast majority of events should take place within London. Greenwich has always figured as the site for these events.

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08061266000102"></a>It all started back in 1992. Your Lordships will remember the pledge of the shadow Home Secretary at the time, Mr Tony Blair, to the Labour Party conference when he said that the Labour Party would be,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000547"></a>&#147;tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80612-0002.htm_para7"></a>

<p><a name="08061266000500"></a>Jack Straw pledged curfews for 10 year-olds. It was Labour&#146;s response to the disaster of the 1992 election&#151;a repositioning that would put them well to the right of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, who in his period as Home Secretary had argued that the British prison system did not work effectively and called for more rehabilitation of offenders and alternative sentencing. Mr Michael Howard, however, appointed as Home Secretary in 1993, coined the phrase &#147;prison works&#148; and ratcheted up the rhetoric in a competition for &#147;toughness&#148;, which has led us to the position where

<a name="80612-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08061266000104"></a>In the 1997 election, one of Mr Prescott&#146;s five pledges on his little pledge card was to halve the time it took from arrest to sentence for young offenders. The manifesto said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000549"></a>&#147;youth crime and disorder have risen sharply, but very few offenders end up in court, and when they do half are let off with another warning&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000501"></a>So it was that in government new Labour sought to tackle youth offending through the criminal justice route. The deep-rooted social problems which various studies had identified were to be solved not through investment in mainstream local authority children&#146;s and young people&#146;s provision and more effective children's services, but through punishment. The White Paper <I>No More Excuses</I><I>,</I> published in 1998, stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000550"></a>&#147;punishment is important to signal society&#146;s disapproval of criminal acts and to deter offending. It is the appropriate response to children and young people who wilfully break the law&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80612-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08061266000105"></a>Any plans to tackle the complex economic and social factors that cause youth offending were put on the back burner. The flagship Bill in 1998, which your Lordships will recall was the Crime and Disorder Bill, abolished the principle of doli incapax&#151;one of the principles of this country that nobody under the age of 13 could be assumed to be guilty. It also established the Youth Justice Board, created locally accountable youth offending teams, replaced cautions with a new reprimand and final warning scheme and restructured non-custodial penalties. It also introduced the ASBO, the rationale for which was described by Hazel Blears MP in these terms:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08061266000527"></a>&#147;Disorder causes police the most problems. If police are to deal with serious crime, they cannot constantly be on the streets trying to control behaviour in the community. Orders dealing with anti-social behaviour will be most useful in dealing with that type of situation. They will apply to anti-social families, who often roam the streets of my city with impunity, causing misery and mayhem to the decent people who are trying to uphold standards&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, 8/4/98; col. 414.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000502"></a>She praised ASBOs for introducing the civil burden of proof, making it easier for orders to be obtained and welcomed the punitive sentence of five years&#146; imprisonment, which could be imposed for their breach. There was a relish for the punishment of young people in Labour ranks for conduct that was not criminal at all. Those feelings were extended and deepened by successive Home Secretaries from David Blunkett to John Reid, whose frustration at the courts&#146; insistence on the legal traditions of fairness and justice was self-evident.</p>

<a name="80612-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08061266000106"></a>Between 1998 and 2001, four separate Acts of Parliament dealt with aspects of youth crime and in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act recently passed, it has all been overhauled again. The report, which is the subject of the debate, <I>Ten </I><I>Y</I><I>ears of Labour</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s </I><I>Y</I><I>outh </I><I>J</I><I>ustice </I><I>R</I><I>eforms</I>, is an independent audit by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King&#146;s College London, and its two authors, Enver Solomon and Richard Garside are the deputy director and director respectively. They focused not on the philosophy or principles behind the Labour Government&#146;s initiatives,  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_679"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 679</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but on the implementation, examining whether the Government and the YJBs hit the targets that they set themselves, as set out in business plans, public service agreements with the Treasury and Labour manifestos. They say that assessment has been difficult. They have been struck by the lack of consistent and robust data on which any measurement of progress can be made. Employment levels, relative levels of income inequality, demographic breakdown, cultural practices and technological progress will all have an impact. Indeed, that echoes the report of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit that 80 per cent of the reduction in the official crime rate since 1997 was due to economic and not criminal justice factors. On page 13, the report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08061266000528"></a>&#147;More fundamentally, it is far from clear what impact the youth justice system, however reformed, will have on levels of youth crime and levels of safety and victimisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80612-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08061266000107"></a>Therefore, it does not seek to quantify the distinctive and particular contribution made by the various youth agencies to levels of youth crime. It does not have the material on which to make that assessment. The report&#146;s most significant finding is the move away from a welfare approach to dealing with children and young people, to one which relies far more on punishment. &#147;New Labour, new punitiveness&#148; is a phrase that has been coined to describe it.</p>

<a name="80612-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08061266000108"></a>Secondly, the report concludes that the Government sought to introduce a more managerialist approach to tackling youth crime, focusing on &#147;processing&#148; young offenders from arrest to sentence. The only target it set that has been hit has been from Mr Prescott's little five pledges card getting children quicker through the courts and into custody.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08061266000109"></a>Thirdly, the report finds the focus on early and rapid intervention by the criminal justice system has led to an expansion of that system into areas outside its remit&#151;parenting programmes and youth inclusion and support programmes to identify children at risk of offending. I have commented before to your Lordships on this Government's perversion of the criminal justice system, which developed over the centuries to deal with crime and punishment, to a new function: social engineering, a tool for risk management. Go into your local magistrates&#146; and risk managers&#146; court; turn left for the beaks and right for the risk managers. This has been commented upon on a number of recent occasions.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08061266000110"></a>On the topic of finance, total Youth Justice Board spending on youth justice has increased since the year 2000, when the youth offending teams first became operational, by &#163;267 million to &#163;650 million, a real-terms increase of 45 per cent, so additional money in real terms has been made available. A significant proportion of that money, 31 per cent, has been drawn from the budgets of social agencies: health, education, local authorities, and above all social services. They have been raided. Has the money gone to positive programmes? No, the bulk of that &#163;650 million, 64 per cent, has gone into purchasing secure accommodation, some provided by the private sector in secure training centres, and some by local authorities in secure children's homes. Sixty-four per cent goes on locking children up. Five per cent is spent on prevention programmes, two per cent on community education, and 16.5 per cent on youth offending team funding, including money for substance abuse programmes and other interventions,  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_680"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as anger management courses, education training and employment projects. Ten times more is spent on custody than on preventing crime by young children. The Youth Justice Board recognises that. In a presentation to a seminar on 5 April this year, the YJB representative said of its prevention strategy:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08061266000529"></a>&#147;Until 2005, our resources were limited, and the only significant medium term funding was for the Youth Inclusion Programme&#151;around &#163;7 million per year between 1999 and 2005&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000503"></a>The report concludes that substantial sums have been transferred from policy areas that are critical to tackling the causes of youth offending, with a corresponding reduction in investment in social responses to youth crime and disorder. Punishment comes first&#151;that is where the money goes.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08061266000111"></a>Was it money well spent? The Government may point to the report&#146;s conclusion that targets for the reduction of vehicle crime, burglary and robbery were on course to be met, but there have been no figures on performance against those targets since the publication in 2004 of the <I>Youth Justice Annual Statistics 2002</I><I>-</I><I>03</I>. Those are the last statistics that are available. The targets on self-reporting offending have not been met, nor is it possible to measure current youth crime levels satisfactorily by any other means. The report concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08061266000530"></a>&#147;At best, all that can be said is that the wide-ranging reforms have contributed to a continuing stabilisation of self-reported youth offending at the level the government inherited when it came to power in 1997&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000504"></a>Therefore, youth offending has not been reduced by all the additional resources that have been put into it. The report&#146;s verdict is that the target for reducing youth offending is modest&#151;to maintain stability, rather than reduce it. However, even that target has not been met, despite the significant investment, focus and political energy expended. The report says that youth justice agencies can do little more than regulate youth crime and that they have an extremely limited impact, if any, on reducing it.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08061266000112"></a>When it comes to the use of custody, targets have been set, revised, reduced and altered over the years. The fact is that no targets for reducing the number of children in custody have ever been met. More children are now imprisoned and for longer. The number of custodial sentences imposed in 2004 was 60 per cent higher than in the early 1990s, and the average custodial sentence for burglary increased from four months to 9.5 months in the 10-year period to 2004. Many more young people have been criminalised and dragged into an environment which destroys them and ruins their life chances.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08061266000113"></a>One young man whom I have tried to assist was sent to custody at the age of 14 for three and a half years and, after his release, was charged with murder. He told me, &#147;It took me a week to become the king of the remand centre that I was sent to because of my previous experience&#148;. We are sending young persons to be influenced by people such as that. In my view, it is a particularly cruel system that drives children into custody, where they will be under the influence of people such as that, through the imposition of ASBOs for conduct which, in itself, may never have been criminal. In its report of February last, <I>Make </I><I>M</I><I>e a Criminal</I><I>: </I><I>Preventing Youth Crime</I>, the Institute for Public Policy Research highlighted the failure of the policy.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80612-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08061266000114"></a>The cost in human lives has been terrible: 30 children have died in custody, mostly through suicide. But does incarceration work? The report indicates that, despite claims by the YJB, which again have had to be revised and reduced, the rate of reoffending has not significantly improved. Therefore, we are looking at a distressing policy failure. The Government&#146;s youth justice policy has failed in all aspects. It is wrong in principle to use the courts of justice for social engineering, and it has proved useless in practice. The so-called reforms of 1998 are not value for money and they have diverted funds from fundamental social issues which are the causes of crime.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08061266000115"></a>Mr Rod Morgan, the former head of the YJB who resigned last year, said on 21 May, when the report was published:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08061266000531"></a>&#147;I agree wholeheartedly with the King's College report that the centre of gravity of spending is distorted. It is precisely some of the trends they are talking about&#151;the increased use of criminalisation, the number of youths we have in custody&#151;that led me to resign. If we are serious about preventing youth crime, it has something to do with the youth justice system, but it has much more to do with broader social policies relating to the family, relating to education and housing etc&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000505"></a>He called, as I do, for a shift from the excessive use of custody and criminalisation to work with parents and work in the community to engage with young people who are falling out of mainstream services. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08061266000117"></a>At the outset, I declare my considerable personal involvement in those changes. I confess to having written the pre-1997 policy paper on youth justice reform, building on&#151;the noble Lord did not mention this&#151;the scathing 1996 Audit Commission report, <I>Misspent Youth</I>, on the failures of the then youth justice system. I confess to having invented the basic architecture of the current scheme, the local multi-agency youth offending teams, or YOTs, and a national Youth Justice Board, the YJB, at arm&#146;s length from a government department. I make no apologies for that. I chaired both the steering committee that brought the new system into being in 1998 and the YJB itself for four and a half years before becoming a Health Minister. If any noble Lords want to take a pop at this basic architecture, they should probably direct that at me rather than at my noble friend the Minister.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08061266000118"></a>Your Lordships will be astonished to know that my take on the history of the last 10 years is considerably different from that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. He was somewhat selective in the quotes that he gave us. I shall give a rather different perspective. We redesigned the youth justice system because before 1997, as the Audit Commission report clearly showed, little effective action was being taken with young people who offended. If you do not know how many  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_682"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 682</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are offending and you do not have any programmes for tackling that offending, of course you will not have criminalised anybody&#151;you did not know about them. That is a good take on a lot of what was happening pre-1997. The public were up in arms about the lack of action by public agencies in respect of young offenders, especially in some of the poorest areas in the country. The dilatory way in which the criminal justice system dealt with persistent young offenders was a scandal, which is why the Government pledged to speed up the system. They delivered on that pledge.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08061266000119"></a>The problem with the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies report is that it gives no context or explanation of why the new system was established. There was no pre-new Labour golden age of youth justice and crime prevention from which resources were redirected, as the centre&#146;s study seems to suggest. Instead, there were few effective programmes for preventing offending or reoffending, whether in the community or in custody. The system provided little effective public protection from serious and persistent young offenders and those who were caught took for ever to be processed by the criminal justice system, often committing more crimes while they were bailed and awaiting trial.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08061266000120"></a>I acknowledge that the centre&#146;s study is strong on the needs of young offenders; I totally agree with that aspect. Yet it totally fails to acknowledge the needs of public protection that the Government&#146;s reforms tried to address. There is a balance to be struck between the needs of young offenders and the protection of the public. Our new system for the first time brought a wider range of agencies, including health and education, to bear on youth offending at the local level in a more co-ordinated way. It is pure fantasy to suggest that these changes diverted huge sums of money from other worthwhile programmes. Money may have been diverted from those budgets, but it was certainly not all being spent on worthwhile programmes dealing with young offenders. For the first time these reforms gave the system a clear statutory aim to prevent offending by children and young people. That was enshrined in the 1998 Act.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08061266000121"></a>To maintain that focus, a national body, the Youth Justice Board, was set up. I pay tribute to the people who served on that board then and those who have succeeded them. They have put in a lot of effort and time and have achieved a great deal of progress, along with all the staff. Let me give some examples. National standards and good practice guidance have been put in place where none existed before. Parents were engaged for the first time in parenting programmes to try to help the parents of young offenders and young people at risk of offending. The Youth Justice Board pioneered restorative justice, which introduced reparation and making amends to victims and communities. Research programmes and better data collection were introduced. I have to say that the centre would have struggled to write its report without some of that better information, data and research that the Youth Justice Board provided and commissioned.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08061266000122"></a>I acknowledge that the Youth Justice Board has set itself stretching targets. We set stretching targets and we knew at the time that we were probably not going to achieve them all, but we thought that it was worth  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_683"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 683</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having a go. The fact that we have not met them all does not mean that the services and programmes provided have not been hugely beneficial compared with what I may describe as the shambles that preceded the reforms. In any case, my understanding is that the Youth Justice Board intends to meet its target to reduce first-time entrants into the system, but perhaps my noble friend will be able to confirm or throw more light on that when he replies. For the first time&#151;this is the most significant issue&#151;there was real engagement of the youth justice system with the sentencers. It is not politicians but sentencers who send children into custody. The Youth Justice Board made the first real effort to engage with sentencers and to publish information court by court on the use of custody relative to community penalties.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08061266000123"></a>The report makes it absolutely clear that it does not like preventive programmes being provided through the youth justice system. However, it is worth reflecting on the reason for using the Youth Justice Board and YOTs to distribute money for summer programmes and the youth inclusion and support programmes. Great consideration was given to that by departments across Whitehall. The reason why we used the YJB and the YOTs was that that was the most effective way of directing money to reach the young people most in need and most at risk.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08061266000124"></a>Universal prevention programmes, to which I suspect the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is very attached, have consistently failed to reach those young people most at risk of offending. That is a brute fact of experience in this area. I know that this is controversial territory because I know many of the practitioners in social services, health and education who do not like targeting in these programmes, but I ask your Lordships to reflect that, if we are to have effective earlier intervention to prevent offending, we have to target the young people most at risk and we have to have the multi-agency data systems that support that. One should always remember before the cry of &#147;Stigma!&#148; goes up&#151;and I have heard that cry in this area many times, believe you me&#151;that those young people are already stigmatised. One of the most revealing factors in why young people end up in the criminal justice system is that they come from criminal families. If we do not target the people at risk, we are not likely to succeed in this area.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08061266000125"></a>I accept that there may be better ways of bringing programmes to bear than were available in 1997 and 1998. I am sure that the new joint unit for youth justice between DCSF and the Ministry of Justice will help, as well as the YJB&#146;s new scaled approach for targeting effort and resources. We still need to do more in substance abuse programmes, employment and training, and we need to improve our accommodation and resettlement services for young offenders, as the centre&#146;s report rightly indicates, but we should not overlook the huge improvements that have been made in these areas by the Government&#146;s investment policies. That is where a lot of the extra money has been spent, particularly in custody.</p>

The report says that the use of custody has been relatively stable. It has certainly been stable in contrast with what has happened in the adult prison population. In large part, that improvement has been achieved by the development and use of more robust community penalties, especially the intensive surveillance and support programme, which was devised by the Youth Justice Board. Although that has not reduced the use of custody as we would all have liked, it has reduced reoffending. It has certainly reduced the frequency and seriousness of the reoffending that has taken place. We must not lose our nerve in our approach to more robust community penalties. We need to progress those even further. Much of the extra money that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said was spent by the Youth Justice Board on custody was spent to improve the programmes that these young people experienced when they were in custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08061266000127"></a>Lastly, I will say one or two words about panicky responses to surges in crime by young people. We got it wrong in the David Blunkett era over mobile phones. There was an excessive response, which led to more young people going into custody than was perhaps necessary. We run the same risk in relation to knife crime. I hope that we will have a balanced response, rather than being too moved by screaming newspaper headlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08061266000129"></a>The Government are going through some difficult times. Look at some of the unpalatable news this week: the four commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have reported to the United Nations that children in Britain are criminalised, subjected to violence and discriminated against. The low age of criminal responsibility, ASBOs, public discrimination and marketing pressures are blamed for creating bleak childhoods. While crime dropped between 2002 and 2006, the number of children prosecuted rose by 26 per cent. Too many children are being criminalised and brought into the youth justice system at an increasingly young age.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08061266000130"></a>On Monday, the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, in an answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharples, said that 12,000 ASBOs were issued up to December 2006, half of which&#151;50 per cent&#151;were breached. About 63 per cent of those who break an ASBO will end up in a custodial sentence. On Tuesday, in an Answer to a Question from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, said that 55 per cent of people come into prison with a serious drug problem.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08061266000131"></a>The Government must accept that, despite the plethora of criminal justice legislation, the situation remains that we have the worst prison record in Europe and that those working in this field are demoralised. So what needs to be done? The report from the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies has performed a valuable service in drawing attention to the deficiencies of the Government's youth justice strategy and the need for a change of direction, if the youth justice system is to have a real chance of tackling the causes of youth  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_685"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 685</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crime. I accept some of the good practices identified by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, but although the Government have introduced some welcome and sensible reforms of the way we deal with young offenders, our youth justice system overall is unfit for purpose.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08061266000132"></a>Before setting out the ways in which the youth justice system needs radical reform, it is right to give the Government credit for a number of important changes for the better. First, we have seen the introduction of some valuable new preventive programmes, particularly youth inclusion programmes which work intensively with the 50 juveniles in their area who are judged to be most at risk of offending. An independent evaluation of youth inclusion programmes carried out for the Youth Justice Board has found that they reduce offending or maintain non-offending for around two thirds of the young people involved in them. Some of the youth inclusion programmes run by Nacro&#151;and I declare an interest as President of this organisation&#151;have even more striking success rates of more than 80 per cent. Despite these encouraging developments, 10 times more of the youth justice budget is spent on custody than on preventive programmes.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08061266000133"></a>Secondly, where young offenders are diverted from court and given reprimands or final warnings, a much higher proportion are now involved in diversion programmes designed to engage their energies in a more positive direction than was the case under the previous system of cautioning, and this is something we all welcome.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08061266000134"></a>Thirdly, the Government have introduced the referral order which is now applied to the majority of young people who appear in court for the first time. These orders place a strong emphasis on reparation and restoration and the research shows that they work well. The rate of re-offending for young people given referral orders is lower than the rate which would have been expected if they had been given other forms of sentence.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08061266000135"></a>Fourthly, although there is still a great deal wrong with the custodial regimes for young people, the additional resources which the Youth Justice Board has put into custodial establishments have undoubtedly improved these regimes compared with the position a decade ago.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08061266000136"></a>Fifthly, inter-agency work with young offenders is now stronger than when the Government came into power, and I pay due credit to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for his time as chairman of the Youth Justice Board. This is particularly obvious in the work of youth offending teams in which staff seconded from police, education, health and social services backgrounds work together with young offenders and young people at risk of offending. The Government have ensured that every youth offending team has an accommodation officer, and this has increased the proportion of young people in stable accommodation from 83 per cent in 2002 to 93 per cent currently.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08061266000137"></a>Despite these genuine improvements, the youth justice system remains seriously unfit for purpose. No youth justice system can significantly reduce youth crime unless it gives a high priority to meeting the welfare needs of young offenders. Half the prisoners in young

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08061266000138"></a>In a study called <I>Wasted Lives</I> in which Nacro researchers interviewed a sample of juveniles in young offender institutions, the authors drew up a list of 11 risk factors often associated with offending by young people. These included physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental neglect, unstable living conditions, misuse of alcohol or drugs, school exclusion and family conflict. The study found that, on average, the children in the sample had six of the 11 risk factors. Any system dealing with children who offend must have at its centre effective approaches for meeting the welfare needs which are almost always at the root of serious and persistent child offending. Far from having such a system, we still process young people through a watered-down version of the adult criminal justice system. This is wrong and the sooner there is a radical appraisal, the better.</p>

<a name="80612-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08061266000139"></a>As the Children's Commissioners have pointed out this week, we use the criminal justice process too much. Our age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10, which is astonishingly low by European standards. In France, the age is 13; in Germany, Austria and Italy it is 14; in the Scandinavian countries it is 15; in Spain and Portugal it is 16; in Belgium it is 18; and in eastern Europe it ranges between 14 and 16. If we are to replace our system with one geared to the needs of vulnerable children, the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to at least 14. Below that age, child offenders should be dealt with as children in need of measures of care, and where a court needs to be involved, it should be a family court, not a criminal court.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80612-0004.htm"/>


<a name="80612-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08061266000140"></a>We also use prosecution too much. In 1996 the Audit Commission produced a report called <I>Misspent Youth</I> which proposed that 20 per cent of juveniles who were then prosecuted should instead be dealt with by diversion programmes outside the court system. Yet since then the Government have introduced tighter restrictions on the number of times children can be dealt with by diversionary measures before being brought before a court. This has produced a striking increase in the number of children prosecuted for minor offences which would previously have been dealt with by informal warnings. In 2006, 61 per cent of young offenders were diverted from court compared with 73 per cent in the early 1990s. Research consistently shows that unnecessarily prosecuting young people can increase rather than reduce their chances of reoffending by officially labelling them as offenders, a label which all too often they then seek to live up to in order to create a hard image and status in front of their friends.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08061266000141"></a>Above all, we use custody too much for young offenders. Around 3,000 young people under 18 are currently in all forms of custody, and more than 2,500  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_687"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of these are in Prison Service custody. Many of the young people we currently detain would be better dealt with by programmes of supervision in the community that work to tackle the problems which are at the root of their offending. Since 1997, the Government have changed the law to make it easier for the courts to detain children both before and after sentence at increasingly younger ages and for less serious offences. They have done this despite the evidence showing that around 80 per cent of these young people are reconvicted within two years of leaving custody. This country&#146;s high use of custody means that most of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s resources, around 64 per cent, are absorbed by the cost of custody alone. These are resources which would be far more effective in reducing youth crime if they were spent on strengthening and expanding community supervision and prevention programmes.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08061266000142"></a>I welcome the fact that the Government have set targets to reduce the number of first-time entrants to the youth justice system and to reduce the number in custody, but they have set targets to reduce the use of custody before and failed to achieve them. If we genuinely want to reduce youth crime, we need a radically reformed, less punitive youth justice system that better meets the welfare needs of children who offend. A reformed system should include a higher age of criminal responsibility, a much stronger emphasis on dealing with minor offenders outside the court system and tighter restrictions on the use of custody for young people. Such an approach would not just be better for young offenders, it would also better protect society from future offending by difficult, disturbed and vulnerable children.</p>

It is always a privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, with his long experience and great wisdom on these matters. I was also interested to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and to be reminded of those days in 1997 when, among others, I was very excited at the thought of what might follow what I thought was going to be the focus on tackling crime and the causes of crime. At the time, as the Chief Inspector of Prisons and working on a report on young prisoners, I was very pleased to find the noble Lord, Lord Warner, working on the setting up of the Youth Justice Board and youth offending teams, both of which I have strongly supported ever since. We were able to work together and share some of our practical experiences on the ground in order to set up a procedure by which the Youth Justice Board and the prisons inspectorate would work closely together on the inspection of young people ever since.</p>

First, it came out about three days before the publication of the reconviction figures for the years up to 2005; that was the only time that they could be measured because they are measured two years after release. The figures for 2005 show that there had been a reduction of some 16.4 per cent in the reconviction rate among

That did not appear in the report, which is slightly unfortunate, because, armed with those figures, there might have been a different representation.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08061266000145"></a>Secondly, it is slightly unfortunate that we have not had all the details of what the Government are going to put in their youth crime action plan, which is to be published next month. I look forward to it with considerable interest. Having had a discussion with the new chairman of the Youth Justice Board and found the sort of things that she is looking for, I suspect that this plan is perhaps going to answer some of the problems, at least in intention. For example, the plan is said to include: early identification of future prolific offenders; giving chaotic families the support and challenge they need; ensuring that courts have the range of disposals and alternatives to custody; early targeted intervention from other agencies; the need to make the most of short periods in custody; and improving resettlement and continuity of care for young offenders.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08061266000146"></a>All I can say is, &#147;Hear, hear, to all that&#148;. If that really is in there and it results in improvements it is perhaps premature to dwell too much on the past until we have seen the content of that plan. Having said that, it is appropriate to consider what might come against what is there now in terms of the machinery that is there to deliver those good intentions. I was particularly interested to hear the chairman of the Youth Justice Board say that she was about to embark on discussions with the Prison Service to see whether there could not be someone appointed to be in charge of young people who are in the hands of the Prison Service; that person would be responsible and accountable for what happened to those young people while they were in custody.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08061266000147"></a>I was particularly glad to see that because that is one of the main props that I called for in my report for young prisoners. It has been a serious deficiency in the system ever since, because unless we have one person responsible and accountable for overseeing what happens, things will not happen. That is the way of the world. I refer not only to the criminal justice system but to industry and to schools, hospitals and the Armed Forces. I wish that this point had been listened to before, particularly in terms of young people. I am also concerned that in addition to the question of timing there remains a disconnect in the overall direction that the Government are taking in relation to youth justice and other parts of the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08061266000148"></a>We have had recently a classic example of this disconnect. The excellent report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, into how women should be treated in the criminal justice system&#151;that they ought to be held in small establishments around the country near their homes so that local conditions can apply in their rehabilitation&#151;was immediately followed by another report, which has been accepted by the Government, for the building of Titan prisons, which are completely the opposite of what the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, was calling for for women.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08061266000149"></a>At the same time as acknowledging that there is an enormous social content and mental health problems attached to the young people who come into the hands of the criminal justice system, we have the dismemberment

This has been split into two so that the part looking after children is now submerged under Ofsted, with its tick-in-the-box approach to education, and the adult element, which will include people over the age of 18 who, in many ways, should come under the youth justice system, being under the Healthcare and Mental Health Commissions. I suspect that will mean that social care for adults will be submerged as well.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08061266000150"></a>While the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Children, Schools and Families will be involved in drawing up the youth crime plan&#151;which is absolutely right because the Minister for Children is in the DCSF&#151;I am worried that there is no mention of the Department of Health, which is responsible for social care and mental health care, being involved. If we acknowledge that the causes of crime lie in social conditions, and that that is where prevention must start, it is an error to leave out of the discussions the people who are most responsible for that environment. They should not be left out of the drawing-up of the plan for what is called &#147;resettlement&#148;, but which, all too often, I fear, is settlement because you are dealing with people who are not settled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08061266000151"></a>I hope that everything that is said in the debate today, based on this very good report, will be taken into account. I refer particularly to the last paragraph of the conclusions, which states,</p>

<p><a name="08061266000506"></a>Not all is wrong, not all is right, but the accumulated wisdom of organisations such as the Centre of Crime and Justice Studies ought not to be disregarded and I welcome the opportunity to have its report drawn to the attention of Members of the House.</p>

We also need to keep in perspective that much of the consequences of youth crime sometimes grotesquely affect the most deprived societies in our community. Those who have more than their fair share of social disadvantage and social challenges with which to contend in their daily lives have the added acute burden, every day and every night, of misbehaviour of one kind or another in their midst.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08061266000154"></a>If we are concerned about these things, it is important that we avoid knee-jerk emotional reactions and that at all costs we avoid appeasing prejudice, particularly where it exists in the more irresponsible sections of the media. There is a counterproductivity about wanting to make ourselves feel more satisfied by showing a macho response to what is wrong, thereby exacerbating the difficulties with which we are dealing. I am one of those who holds that a hallmark of a civilised society is the ability not simply to react to what confronts it but to ask, &#147;Why does this confront us?&#148;. I can think of no area of policy where this is more important than the one we are deliberating today.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08061266000155"></a>I have shared with this House before, and I hope I will be forgiven for doing so again, two anecdotes that have profoundly affected me as an individual. One concerned the former chief constable who was involved in an imaginative programme in a young offender institution in the north. He was talking to a young man who was about to be released, and to his surprise the young man started to weep. The young man said, &#147;I am weeping because I&#146;m terrified about what I am going to encounter when I leave this place. This is the first place in my life where I have felt secure, where I have begun to discover myself as an individual and to recognise my potential, and where I have felt that there are people who are concerned about me, which has awakened a concern on my part about other people. I really am petrified of what I am going to return to in society&#148;.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08061266000156"></a>The other anecdote concerns the late Joan Lestor, who was a great personal friend of my family; in fact she was the godmother of one of my children. She was a strong advocate of children&#146;s interests. She was not given to exaggeration, though; she was a realist. I shall never forget her coming to our home just having visited one of the young people who had been involved in the dreadful murder of James Bulger, that awful event that shocked the nation. She was unspeakably distressed. Why? Because, she said, speaking of one of the youngsters who had committed the crime, &#147;That youngster has never been loved in his life&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08061266000157"></a>When we are dealing with justice and the young and delinquent behaviour by the young, we have to ask ourselves about our own values, our own society and the context within which it is all happening. If we have a society that is dominated by greed, by so-called success&#151;as if all that matters is getting to the top of the pile with not too many questions about how you get there&#151;where is our authority?

I am conscious that there are schools in this country where staff are doing some of the most imaginative, highly relevant work with young people who are excluded and who have no parental support&#151;but their only reward is to be told that their school has failed because it is not performing against the league tables and the conventional measures of success. We really have to think about these issues and what their relationship is. We have to do some integrated thinking about different aspects of our policy if we are to get it right. We also have to recognise that in deprived areas of our country there is an absence of hope and social and educational aspiration. If we are going to get this right, the regeneration of our deprived areas cannot be too high a priority.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08061266000159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with his usual wisdom, was right to emphasise the fact that we have to take the whole issue of mental health far more seriously. I speak with some sensitivity on this matter because one of my daughters leads a team of people working with women with mental health problems in deprived communities. She becomes exasperated because of the shortage of resources. Everyone makes referrals to the team, but where are the resources to do the work? We need to give higher priority to all that.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08061266000160"></a>My general message today is that what is needed is a new culture. What I shall be looking for in the youth action plan is not just a set of management proposals but a regeneration of culture and of what our society should be, a reassertion of the importance of muscular love in our social policy. That does not mean sentimentality. I get infuriated in my older age by those who go around talking about&#151;I do not use the term in its political sense&#151;&#147;bleeding-heart liberals&#148;, when those who say that sort of thing are the weak people who are betraying society while so often the wet-nosed &#147;liberals&#148; are the people who are thinking hard and sensibly about what needs to be done to get it right. We have to recognise that and become more assertive about why it matters that there is a different concept of how things should be.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08061266000161"></a>Of course we must be clear about what is right and wrong and about what is acceptable behaviour and what is not, but it will not do to go around telling the young how they should behave unless that is evidenced in our own behaviour. We have to set an example. We have to demonstrate our own social responsibility and the fact that it takes precedence over our egocentric, material preoccupations.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08061266000162"></a>We should be working for a situation in which the young are enabled to fulfil their potential. The success stories are there. When I was president of the YMCA, I saw the stories of youngsters who had been involved in some quite shocking crimes but went on to get PhDs once people really began to relate to them and see what could be done. We should be concentrating on how we enable the young to make something of their stunted and distorted lives and to recognise that, after the experiences that many of them have been through, it would be an absolute miracle if they were not caught up in criminal activity of one kind or another. We must get the social context right, and that means integrated thinking by a whole range of government departments.</p>

He is right that we need to have hard-headed thinking, and when he uses the word &#147;liberal&#148; I know that he uses it quite rightly. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford for introducing the debate today and for the opportunity to speak on a report that speaks very strongly for itself. The report, in combination with the fact that the UK Children&#146;s Commissioners are presenting to the UN this week in Geneva and with the most recent UNICEF report, draws a pretty grim picture of childhood and youth in the UK. It is not a picture we can be pleased with.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08061266000164"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, reminded us that before 1997 things were far from good. He suggested that my noble friend took a pop at the architecture. I think it was a justified pop. The noble Lord is right that things were not good before 1997, but in many ways they have got worse. I accept that some of that can be laid at the door of society in general, but some of it should be laid at the door of the Government in the way they have chosen to proceed with measures that they put in place in good faith, but which by and large have failed. It is time to take another look.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08061266000165"></a>The report highlights the failure of all but one of seven measures: the only area of improvement has been a reduction in arrest-to-sentence times. The Government have failed in six other objectives. I shall speak about one of them: to improve accommodation. I shall then speak about demonisation of young people and ASBOs.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08061266000166"></a>On improving accommodation, the Government&#146;s target was to ensure that all young people subject to community intervention or released from custody had appropriate accommodation when they left. However, that accommodation is not provided. Many young people do not know where they are going to go when they leave custody. In its survey, <I>Youth crime briefing: housing and accommodation issues for young people in the criminal justice system</I>&#151;it was conducted in December 2005, but I understand that the situation has not changed&#151;Nacro found that homelessness can significantly increase the likelihood that a young person will break the law. Moreover, homelessness can affect the way in which young people are treated in the justice system. For example, they are less likely to receive bail if they have no permanent address. In 2004, the Audit Commission showed that up to 1,000 young people are remanded to secure facilities each year because they do not have a suitable address for bail. Has that figure increased or decreased? This problem is further compounded by the fact that young people without accommodation are more likely to receive custodial sentences. When they are released, many of them will find it even harder to find somewhere to live, either because of deteriorating family commitment, which may have meant that they were in trouble in the first place, or because of the social stigma that goes with the prison sentence. Fewer than half of the young adults surveyed by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons&#151;a survey referred to in its annual report of 30 January 2007&#151;said that they knew where to get help to find accommodation, drug treatment or continuing

Those are exactly the contributory factors that make it so hard for those young people to proceed in society in any positive way.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08061266000167"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, made an outstanding contribution to a short debate on restorative justice that I introduced in your Lordships&#146; House. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08061266000532"></a>&#147;There is a myth around that RJ is in some way a soft option because it does not involve enough punishment. The research shows that offenders find it tougher to face their victims than to go to court. Another myth is that it is costly. Even the most expensive RJ conferences&#151;those for serious crimes&#151;cost only &#163;800, compared with the &#163;35,000 a year that we pay to keep someone in prison. It is time for us to stop endlessly studying and evaluating RJ and to use it much more widely in the areas where it has proven value&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/11/07; col. 1104.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000507"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord for that comment, because RJ is being rolled out not nearly fast enough and it is young people who can benefit from it the most. I have been into schools practising restorative justice. It is quite astonishing how young people who have gone through any kind of restorative process have developed a completely different view of themselves and how they relate to the world. That does not mean that they will stop being troublemakers overnight, but they are on a different track to a more positive outlook and start to relate to authority far more constructively. I hope that the Government will think about resourcing restorative justice much more positively.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08061266000168"></a>I turn to the demonisation of young people. The Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s report found that children are being demonised by a society that is locking up too many of them. The Government&#146;s measures have contributed to the demonisation of children. For example, they have largely accepted the &#147;buzz off&#148; or &#147;mosquito&#148; system, which disperses any groups of young people that may be hanging about by emitting a high-pitched noise that only they can hear. I accept that young people hanging about in a group can occasionally be threatening, but often they are not. They are disruptive to some degree and might cause one to get off the pavement; they are loud and raucous; but very often they are not threatening. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that the media have contributed to an unconstructive and dangerous view of any assembly of young people. The Government could have another look at the ethos underpinning mosquito systems, because they affect all young people and not just those who cause difficulties. If one walks past such a system with one&#146;s eight or nine year-old child, they suffer as much as the one or two young people who might be causing a difficulty outside a shop. The system is making places unpleasant to be for a whole generation of young people. It is an appalling thing to do to our young people.</p>

<a name="80612-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08061266000169"></a>I turn finally to ASBOs. The use of ASBOs risks contributing to, rather than reducing, the criminalisation of young people. They represent a crossover from civil to criminal proceedings. A young person can now be given an order, as they have been, for playing music too loudly, which is a non-criminal offence. If they breach the order, it is treated as a criminal offence and the young person can end up with a custodial sentence for actions that did not initially constitute a criminal offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08061266000170"></a>ASBOs have not been effective as far as young people are concerned. One of the more telling quotes on them comes from Neil Wain, chief superintendent of Manchester police, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08061266000533"></a>&#147;It was evident from my interviews that many of those people subject to ASBOs had underlying problems such as drug and alcohol dependency, mental health issues or dysfunctional families&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000508"></a>dysfunctional families have a critical impact on young people&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000552"></a>&#147;and most originated from socially deprived housing estates. Yet little or no support had been offered. Efforts to divert young people into positive activities were lacking&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000509"></a>When a police officer of his stature says that, we really need to take it very seriously, as the report concludes.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08061266000171"></a>Many of the Government&#146;s measures have failed. It is time to put the resources into other, supportive measures that would be effective in reducing offending and reoffending rates.</p>

I am particularly grateful to her for raising the issue of finding accommodation for young people leaving custody. I remember being involved in a report that highlighted the fact that many young people leaving custody said that they were moving back with their families. What actually happened was that they moved back for a day or two and then the arrangement collapsed and they were on the streets. These issues are complex and the issue of finding a home for young people when they leave custody is crucial.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08061266000173"></a>Whatever the faults and virtues of the system since 1997, one has to recognise the achievements of the Youth Justice Board and the various policies associated with it; and particularly of the youth offender teams that have been so important and valuable. While one may wish to integrate their work better with the mainstream, one has to recognise the achievements that have been made. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for securing the opportunity to debate this important report.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08061266000174"></a>The report concludes&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have been taking money from hard-pressed mainstream social provision to develop a specialist system for youth justice. The authors point out that this new service is at one remove and therefore less well integrated. They question the effectiveness of such an approach. I felt a shock of recognition reading this. The scenario seems familiar. One might also say that we have developed a system of public care for looked-after children that drains huge sums from mainstream preventive provision, works far too much in isolation and provides disappointing outcomes. The Minister for Children, Beverley Hughes, told a meeting some time ago that the Government had increased their spending on looked-after children in the care of the state from &#163;1.3 billion to &#163;1.9 billion in just a few years and that they needed persuading that the money was making a difference&#151;they had not yet seen the evidence. I believe that there have been improvements and I will come back to this point.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08061266000175"></a>David Kidney, MP for Stafford and chair of the All-Party Group on Looked After Children and Care Leavers, recently reminded me that, at a meeting of  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_695"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experts in criminal justice from Spain and Germany last year, the failure to intervene early to prevent problematic behaviour developing was identified as an important flaw in our approach that contributed to our exceptionally high rate of child custody. Many noble Lords have already highlighted this fact.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08061266000176"></a>The Department for Education, as it was, is to be highly commended for commissioning the Institute of Education to compare practice in foster care and residential childcare between England, Denmark, France and Germany. The striking difference is that Denmark, France and Germany intervene earlier and more effectively to prevent harm to children. Why is this and what relevance does it have to our debate? The Social Care Institute for Excellence confirmed to me this morning that the difference is partly one of workforces. It highlights the clear evidence that social workers in Belgium, Germany, France and parts of the US have a far higher status than social workers in this country and that, because of this, they are more effective in prevention.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08061266000177"></a>Academics highlight the differences between our looked-after population and those of the neighbours that I have mentioned. Denmark takes a significantly larger proportion of children into care then we do. However, the children are less traumatised, and entering care is seen as an opportunity for them to improve their life chances rather then reduce them. A child in care is expected to do better academically than his peers. This may be explained by better early intervention to prevent harm, and then prompt later intervention if the child continues to be harmed. Half of Denmark&#146;s looked-after children are in residential care, compared with 10 per cent of ours; but 90 per cent of its residential childcare staff have a degree-level qualification, compared with 20 per cent of our staff.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08061266000178"></a>Pedagogy, the discipline applying to the care of vulnerable children, is one of the most popular university courses, and vacancy rates for staff in children's homes are minimal. In this country, there is no mainstream university discipline clearly applicable to this work. Social work is the closest, but is some way from the mark. Vacancy rates for staff in our children's homes are even higher than those for field social work&#151;that is, very high indeed, among the highest in social care. Danish pedagogues have a large degree of autonomy in their work and can interact spontaneously with their children, for instance by giving them a hug when necessary. English pedagogues are controlled from the top down, keep endless records of their work and feel inhibited in their physical contact with children.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08061266000179"></a>My sense is that what is true of Danish pedagogues in comparison with our residential childcare workers is more broadly true of Danish, German and French teachers, social workers and youth workers. If confidence in such professionals had collapsed in those countries as it had in ours, and if their status had reached the nadir that ours had, then their care system might be more similar to ours. Their preventive services might also be imperfect and permit preventable harm to children. Those children might then be catered for by another tier of provision, and the intense, incendiary needs of those children might also leave that service

These countries might also be forced onto the back foot and find themselves spending vast amounts of money with limited effect.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08061266000180"></a>I ask noble Lords to consider the comparative status of our social care workforce. Until very recently, our social workers were not required to have a degree. Originally, it was assumed that those wishing to become social workers would have a degree. However, that was not the case for a long time. Teaching is only just becoming a masters degree profession. The capacity of our early years workforce is decades behind that of many of our fellow nations. My noble friend Lord Dearing recently pointed out that, even if we achieved the targets of Her Majesty's Government with regard to vocational training, we would be catching up only with where Germany now stands, rather than with where it will be in years to come. We all recognise the failure to provide&#151;and the lack of attention to&#151;good quality vocational training in our schools. This is relevant here and perhaps I will come back to it.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08061266000181"></a>It may be that the youth justice system is set up to address, to some degree, a symptom rather than an underlying cause. I agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. I pay tribute to him for his work as chief executive of the Youth Justice Board. I particularly recall what he did with parenting interventions, and how effective they were in reducing reoffending rates&#151;a cheap and effective way of reducing young offending. He referred to the advent of this service. One has to remember that there were young people&#151;and still are, to some degree&#151;who caused endless harm to their local communities. The services to prevent that harm were not there, and it must have been hell for those communities. If I understand the history correctly, there was a vacuum for the reasons that I described of the long-term demoralisation of social services and those working in them. One can see why such a development was necessary.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08061266000182"></a>I emphasise one further point from what the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said about public panic over particular problems. He mentioned the issue of mobile phones. I recall a poor young man, Joseph Scholes, who committed suicide in prison after being caught up in the hysteria over mobile phones. I hope that the Government will listen to the noble Lord&#146;s request for there to be no similar knee-jerk response to knife crime.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08061266000183"></a>Youth criminality may be due largely to a failure to provide the services that enable families to thrive and children to succeed. Our failure to invest in those working directly with these families may be heavily implicated in this predicament. I mean these comments to be constructive. If my understanding is correct, then much of Her Majesty&#146;s Government's current policy is also correct. It is right that teaching should become a masters degree profession as proposed. Her Majesty's Government&#146;s Teach First programme that incentivises high flyers to try the profession of teaching is right, and its success in persuading 50 per cent of those who are caught up in it to continue in schools is great news. It is right that Her Majesty's Government have now introduced a social work degree, and that courses are popular is great news. It is right that Her Majesty's Government are piloting newly qualified

I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, is not going, because I wish him to hear my acknowledgement of the vision that he contributed to at the beginning of the present Government&#146;s tenure of office in the building of a radically new approach, as was intended, to the juvenile justice system. It was full of good intentions. Sadly, the good intentions have not led to heaven, but neither have they led to hell. I endorse the opening paragraphs of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, in which he listed the achievements that have been made and what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has just said about the importance of YOTs and the multidisciplinary approach. However, I have to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that that approach will not be complete if the Department of Health is excluded from the infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08061266000186"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is not in his place to hear my admiration of his speech. He returned to the essential ingredient missing in our society when it approaches young people&#151;what many of us are too embarrassed to call love. Such young delinquents as I have encountered in the early stages have quite clearly been starved of it, and the application of it has had astonishing effects. It is like when they ran a copper telephone cable across a desert in South Africa and suddenly there was a little line of green under the cable because what was missing was the trace element of copper in the soil below. That is the effect that love has on children. Not only children: we live in a society where you cannot call it love when you talk about adults because you get into all sorts of arcane and embarrassing suggestions of what it means.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08061266000187"></a>The noble Lord called it tough love, but you can call it care or engagement. I remember a particular child at school who was going very fast in the wrong direction. I managed to convince him that I was personally concerned about what happened to him. I would not call that love in the context that I was expressing it, but that is what it was. He was an absolutely changed creature. From being a scruffy truant and somewhat abusive, he rapidly became well behaved and offered to help mark the register. He completed his school career without a blemish and I was able to give him a recommendation of good character. It cost me very little, but it was worth an enormous amount to him. We have to look at society as well as the actual criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08061266000188"></a>However, the criminal justice system is what the debate is about, so we need to knit the two together. The Danes have done that, I understand from the

I remind the collective memory of Her Majesty's Government of a long ago predecessor of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, at the Dispatch Box, Lord David Ennals, who in the last months of the Administration that fell in 1997 set up something called the intermediate treatment fund. It was devoted solely to two aims. The first was to go about magistrates&#146; benches, courts, police forces, probation services and so forth preaching the merits of non-custodial treatment of crimes requiring custody. I had personally seen them to be remarkably successful in reducing reoffending rates among young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08061266000189"></a>The second aim was to go around with small handfuls of money finding beaten-up estates that were about to start going over the edge into criminal cess pits and find young enthusiastic adults prepared to start youth activities of any kind that engaged their enthusiasm so much that it would engage the enthusiasm of the young people. Through a grants application scheme, the programme also gave those adults the know-how to get funding from other sources at a ratio of five to one. One of my two complaints about the latter years of the Administration of which I was a part earlier on was the great cry that prison works. The other was the decision to wind up the intermediate treatment fund so that we had to find a voluntary way of doing it, which was not so easy or successful. Thought should be given to replicating it in some way or another.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08061266000190"></a>The programmes for these agencies do exist and are successful. I refer to two that are carried out in Lambeth by what is still called Rainer. I declare an interest as having been a patron of Rainer for some time. The programme cut arrest rates among young people by an average of 65 per cent. In some areas where Rainer works, arrest rates have been cut by as much as three quarters. Unfortunately, as we see from the national figures, that is not replicated countrywide. Money of the sort that I mentioned could be profitably spent on such youth inclusion programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08061266000191"></a>The next thing relating to love is the family. We are at last politically aware of the family&#151;rather late, I fear, in the process of decay of that institution. Where there is one, it is essential to retain connections between the offender and the family, which will be essential in getting him or her back on the rails. I join the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with great enthusiasm, in saying that mathematics, geometry and geography all conspire to say that Titan prisons cannot be an element in that. I know the answer that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will give because I have heard it several times already. He will say, &#147;Oh yes they are&#148;, but I am afraid that he is wrong. I say, &#147;Oh no they aren't&#148;, although we must not turn this into a Christmas pantomime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08061266000192"></a>We must also avoid criminalising young people unnecessarily. By coincidence, I spoke in the Second Reading debate on Tuesday of the Education and Skills Bill. Noble Lords in this debate should be made aware so that they can be drawn into the debate in Committee of the proposal to criminalise truancy for children in the new compulsory education of children

It will be an offence taken to court if a child, after a series of processes, does not toe the line. I do not know how one can expect any constructive learning to be done by somebody who is in a room with an instructor only because he will be criminalised otherwise. However, if he does not go to school, the damage is even greater than if he is there, sulking and being made ever more resentful of society.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08061266000193"></a>That brings me to my final point, which I raised at the Second Reading debate. I refer to the question of literacy. We all know of the very high rate of illiteracy among the prison population. It is somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent. The most conservative estimate is that 40 per cent of those are straight dyslexic cases. Astonishing changes can be made to the careers of children. One of the most common causes of, or routes into, criminality is the total frustration in school of people who are perfectly clever but are taught in ways that they cannot cope with because they have not been diagnosed. What this country must have, for the sake of future generations, is 100 per cent screening of children in their early years so that dyslexia is detected. In the very large number of cases where it can be got around with spectacular results, children will be diverted in numbers from the criminal path. That is what love demands, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in a good speech, said.</p>

Youth crime is not a topic on which I would normally trouble your Lordships. I do not have the experience or expertise of other noble Lords who have spoken, but it is a matter that has been troubling me. As this report came highly recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I thought it would be a good read, and would perhaps satisfy some of my concerns. In the event, I found the audit exercise a bit pointless, but the authors seem to share my concerns.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08061266000195"></a>In my other life, when I ran my business, even though we had accurate measurements of income and expenditure, and careful data on the volume of goods sold and made, I was still wary of audits. When you produce audits based on budgets and targets as this paper attempts, the results are pretty meaningless. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, reminded us that the authors say that accurate statistics are difficult to come by and can, at times, be contradictory. We should be wary of the conclusions. At various points in the paper, the authors accuse the Government of overstating their record. Welcome to the world of accountancy, where overstatement and understatement are constantly debated and no two accountants agree. I am sure that the Minister&#146;s justification for his data is as robust as the authors&#146; justification for theirs. As I said, welcome to the world of accountancy. The paper could have been more critical of the use of targets. The Minister does not need me to tell him that unless targets are used sparingly, and have a clear vision, they inhibit innovation and change because all the effort goes towards reaching the target, instead of doing a more effective and better job. It is a pity that the paper did not look more at the

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08061266000196"></a>However, the authors share my concern and&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, reminded us&#151;those of the UK&#146;s four Children&#146;s Commissioners. They are concerned that there are too many children locked up, and that there is a disturbing trend towards locking up even more. I looked up the figures and the number has almost doubled in the last decade to 3,020. What troubles me, other noble Lords and the commissioners is that these are easily some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. Most show signs of personality disorder. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, gave us the details. He reminded us that many have the literacy and numeracy of the average seven year-old, or even younger. All this is at a time when, overall, crime figures are dropping. Nor does it seem to make financial sense. Custody is expensive, and there seem to be schemes that provide a cheaper alternative. I know of a scheme called the Archway Motorcycle Project. A police survey showed that this project in Thamesmead&#151;which costs &#163;200,000 to train 200 young people each year, and revealed a strong positive effect on attenders in trouble with the law&#151;costs about the same as it costs the taxpayer to keep half a dozen youngsters locked up in a secure training centre. We constantly hear complaints that these youngsters are let out too early. David Ruffley MP complained about this on television only last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08061266000197"></a>Fewer and fewer people feel that a crackdown is the answer, yet every burst of outrage in recent times seems to encourage this. Then the crackdowns tend to fulfil their own publicity through overreaction, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, told us. My noble friend Lord Warner reminded us that the public must be protected. He is right. I felt encouraged when Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister and created the new Department for Children, Schools and Families. At that time the Secretary of State, Ed Balls, indicated a change in the balance&#151;spoken about by my noble friend Lord Warner&#151;when he declared it a failure on our part every time a young person gets an ASBO. He realised that in some cases ASBOs have criminalised children, and in other cases become a mark of esteem. He also toned down the &#147;yob culture&#148; rhetoric and the respect agenda, which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, spoke about.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08061266000198"></a>My right honourable friend Ed Miliband last year spoke of the need for the Government to do more, to rehabilitate young people and to end society&#146;s perception that most teenagers are involved in crime and anti-social behaviour. This point was made not only by my noble friend Lord Judd and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but in the report of the four Children&#146;s Commissioners. I realise that the number of children behind bars continues to increase, but my inclination is to give these new and young Ministers a chance. They are being helped by the Government&#146;s attack on child poverty; by early intervention in the form of such schemes as nurseries and Sure Start; and by flexible working, after-school and breakfast clubs, and maternity and paternity leave. After all, these young Ministers have been brought up on a diet of social justice, and are committed to enabling people to make the most of

They realise that our existing system of criminal justice for children is, perhaps, part of the problem, not the solution. My request is that we give them a chance to turn things around.</p>

<a name="80612-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08061266000199"></a>When will we know that they have succeeded? In my ideal world, prison custody would be abolished for all children, except those guilty of very grave crimes and who pose a serious danger. Ideally, they would be detained in local authority secure accommodation to maintain the family connection. Young people should be diverted from court and perhaps brought before a young people&#146;s prosecutor. Interventions would be at community level and these would have to be expanded and improved, as would drug and alcohol treatment, and advice and support for parents. There should also be improvements in restorative justice and mentoring to help youngsters think through the consequences of their actions. All these services, including mental health provision could be improved, as many noble Lords have said. Perhaps equally important is the need to encourage a more vocationally orientated education system designed to bind children into society, rather than rejecting them. This is one of the points of the new Education and Skills Bill that we debated earlier this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08061266000200"></a>I do not think that my wish list is impossible to achieve. Perhaps it reflects the change in culture that my noble friend Lord Judd described. Some progress will be made if we comply with the children's rights convention. But there is a real problem of perception. There is outrage when a child suffers through the negligence and viciousness of others, but where is the outrage when last year a UNICEF study of children&#146;s well-being in rich countries put us at the bottom of the list? Now there is a worthy target if we want one&#151;to climb from the bottom to the top. A paper on how to do that would be a much better read.</p>

I agree with him that one of our major problems is that the way in which we deal with crime and the young has become the most testosterone-driven part of the political debate. Politicians tend to beat their chests and say how tough they are going to be and then have a crackdown. Once they have finished having their crackdown, they forget about it. The problem re-emerges in a slightly new way in a slightly new fashion and there is another crackdown. The press likes this, because it does not have to think very much, either. It calls for a crackdown and it gets one. It is a horrible cycle. As we have gone through this process, we have seen that it tends to swamp the good work that is done, where it exists, and tends to cover up the bad practice. We have to do more. This is one of the major problems that the Government and everyone involved will have to square up to in the next few years if we are to make any real impression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08061266000202"></a>I wish to draw attention to a large group within our offender system&#151;the dyslexic. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, who is becoming rather quicker on the draw than me in this area, has already referred to this group.  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>When I made my first speech in your Lordships&#146; House a little more than 20 years ago, I spoke about dyslexia. The change of tone about this condition has been massive. People used to say, &#147;Oh, the poor little middle-class boy genius&#148;&#151;among sufferers, there is a 4 to 1 ratio of males&#151;whereas now the problem is being appreciated and manifesting itself most strongly in our criminal justice system. The noble Lord said that the figure in that area was about 40 per cent. Most of the statistics that I have seen put the figure at about half.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08061266000203"></a>Although most people in prison or the youth justice system come from the lower socio-economic groups, we are not finding and supporting those who have dyslexia within those groups. Some 10 per cent or 12 per cent have this problem to varying degrees. Calling it one problem is probably a misnomer. Dyslexia is a spectrum that covers a large percentage of, predominantly, the male population. It would be astounding if there were not a high number of dyslexics in the prison population.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08061266000204"></a>When I worked for Apex Trust, which is not as big as it was, we dealt with getting offenders into jobs. It was the first time ever that I had sat down in a group where my literacy skills were above average. What can we do about these people who do not achieve? The noble Lord, Lord Elton, said that, if we have 100 per cent screening of children going through the education system, we could largely deal with this problem. He may be right, but even with a good screening process at the right age and for the right group, we will probably still miss a few people, whose problems will come out earlier or later. Also, even if we do that now, we are still between 10 and 12 years from dealing with the problem in the population. There is no great appetite for the huge expenditure and change to our education system that what he suggests would require, although perhaps there should be. So what do we do?</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08061266000205"></a>We have people who are, as a result of their social context, not being picked up on their way through the system. Noble Lords should not worry; I will soon get around to considering something that is the Minister&#146;s departmental responsibility. As we go through this process, we find people who offend because they are educational drop-outs, because the education system is not friendly to them and they come from a background where you do not find out why you have failed in the education system. It is just accepted that you are no good at school. I am afraid that that is another reality that we have to accept.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08061266000206"></a>What can we do when we get people into controlled environments, particularly custody, that allow us to identify the problem and then deal with it? The thrust of what I would like to concentrate on is the practicality of what one does after identifying the dyslexic&#151;and there are good diagnostic systems. In the adult prison population, many people are assessed as being dyslexic every time they go to a new prison. They are half way through an education system, but then they leave or give up.</p>

You did not like the cold and wet; let&#146;s roll you around in a muddy field and play a sport that you have absolutely no aptitude for and make it as unpleasant as it conceivably can be&#148;. We say to the dyslexic young offender, a person for whom school was a memory at 14, &#147;Let&#146;s teach you to spell properly again&#148;. To be perfectly honest, someone who does that really deserves the odd punch on the nose. We are taking a thoroughly unpleasant, hideous and degrading experience and making the person go back through it; even suggesting that they might is bad enough.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08061266000208"></a>I ask the Government what evidence there is and what good examples there are of taking that person, sitting them down and telling them, &#147;The reason why you cannot do this is because you have this condition. It comes down to this: the short-term learning capacity in your brain is different, but you have other compensating traits&#151;better lateral thought and being able to tackle subjects sideways&#148;. I feel sorry for <I>Hansard</I> when I occasionally go off and do that myself. That approach would be a valuable first step.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08061266000209"></a>It must be remembered that this is a disability in your differently constructed brain. If you are late in tackling this, you will never hit key stage whatever. That is very common. We should concentrate on making sure that these individuals are given a series of coping strategies. A basic one is explaining that you have a problem. If you are told that you have to fill in a form, you may need to say, &#147;Can I have two, because I will make mistakes on the first one?&#148;. There is something that I still do, even as a large white male with a posh voice who happens to be a Member of the House of Lords: I still have the odd run-in with authority. I do not like doing what I am told. When you consider someone for whom every form of officialdom is basically unfriendly, is it any wonder that people just give up and go away? Will we take the first step by explaining not only to society as a whole but to the person involved that they can deal with this problem? It will never be easy&#151;they will never be like everybody else&#151;but they need to take that step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08061266000210"></a>The Youth Justice Board is probably a good place to start running these models and projects. It will not be about passing a certain level of literacy, because often the moment is gone. That is not always so; sometimes it is a marginal problem that needs some support, but often it will be a social problem or it will be because learning capacity is either not there or has slowed down. Will the Government give us some answers on what they will do? Unless they explain the problems so that they can be understood by other people in such groups, education and understanding will not be there. When communication breaks down, we have to start again.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08061266000211"></a>How can someone apply for housing and benefits if he cannot handle the form? If he does not know how to ask for that help, which is now provided in legislation, how will he get it? The practical task is getting the Government to accept that they have to take a slightly different approach. They should invest in this group to explain about living in the world as it is and not how it should be according to statistics.</p>

At the same time, I say how much I admire the youth justice campaigns that he has so valiantly fought over the years. Having paid those two deserved tributes to him, I beg leave perhaps to doubt the grave indictment that he levelled at Her Majesty&#146;s Government of total and abject failure in this field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08061266000213"></a>I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for not following in the same terms the most moving appeal that he made in his address to us. I have the greatest respect and sympathy for his case and I am sure that his speech contributed substantially to the discussion in your Lordships&#146; House today. As the last of the speakers on the list not from the Front Benches, I shall touch on a document that has been referred to more than once in this debate: the report published some days ago by the children&#146;s commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am glad that Her Majesty&#146;s Government require the commissioners to report once every five or six years&#151;I am not sure which&#151;as that, as much as any exercise, focuses attention on this issue. When the previous report was submitted, in 2002, there was only one commissioner&#151;the one for Wales. Now we have commissioners for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The others have followed, if I may say so with some pride, the pioneering and progressive attitude of the Welsh Assembly in this matter.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08061266000214"></a>I shall make some general remarks, the first of which concerns the mandate of authority that the four commissioners have. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the mandate is founded on the rights of the child as declared in the convention. The situation is slightly different in England, where the mandate is based on the five aspects of well-being that are highlighted in the White Paper <I>Every Child Matters. </I>This is not logic chopping or hair splitting: there is a world of difference between rights based on basic human rights as interpreted in the international convention and what, with the best will in the world and with the most genuine intentions, is declared as an instrument of government policy.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08061266000215"></a>The remits of authority differ. The commissioners for Wales and Northern Ireland have every right to deal with individual cases, which is the most important feature of their function. That right is not enjoyed by the commissioners for England and Scotland. The English commissioner has a right of entry to premises where a child is in care or is being catered for, but that right is not enjoyed by the other three commissioners. Devolution has reached different levels in the Celtic countries, which means that certain anomalies apply. For example, in Wales immigration is a reserved, non-devolved matter, which is different from the situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland. When a child in Wales seeks asylum, the commissioner cannot intervene. Ironically, it would not make any difference to pass the

These matters deserve considerable attention.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08061266000216"></a>The House will know that under Article 4 of the convention it is incumbent on all Governments who have signed up to and ratified it to incorporate its contents in domestic law. We have not done so. The Minister may be able to tell the House whether there is a genuine intention to do so and on what timescale.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08061266000217"></a>The convention report is chequered. Much of it is encouraging and much is disquieting. Certain matters constitute a considerable blot on the conscience of our community, particularly on criminal matters. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, touched on the age of criminality. We are entirely out of line with the European Community in this case. Our age of criminality is 10; it is eight in Scotland. In nearly every other European country, it is 13 or 14. I think that France has an age of criminality of 16. The Children and Young Persons Act 1969, which as a junior Minister in the Home Office I had the pleasure of taking through the House of Commons almost 40 years ago, had a provision enabling the age of criminality to be raised from 10 by affirmative order of both Houses of Parliament. I well remember the late James Callaghan as Home Secretary saying how progressive a measure that was and how much he hoped that the initiative would soon be taken. He was a man of fairness and toughness. Unfortunately, that provision subsequently disappeared from the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08061266000218"></a>Many of your Lordships have touched on the number of children in custody. In February this year, apparently 2,837 children were held in custody. The figure given by the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, was slightly different. He adumbrated the principle that accountancy gives many facets to the ordinary, common truth. Be that as it may, the figure is disgracefully high, whether it is his or the one that I cited from the commissioners&#146; report. As I have said many times, in the United Kingdom more children are in custody than in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway put together. That is the situation that stares us in the face. Only one or two circumstances can reasonably be responsible for that. Either our children are more wicked and have a greater predilection to serious offences than children in Europe, or we have a different attitude towards sentencing. Clearly, it is the second factor that is responsible.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08061266000219"></a>I accept that there are some children of such dangerous calibre and viciousness that they have to be incarcerated. I also accept that it is a serious matter to injure a person with a knife or to carry a knife in a situation where that is kept as an option. However, I do not believe that the answer lies ultimately with punishment or prosecution. It lies more in managing to inculcate a culture in the home, school and community at large, whereby it is regarded as a disgraceful, cowardly and barbaric thing to carry a knife. That is easier said than done. Clearly, it is only in that direction that any solution lies.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08061266000220"></a>I am rapidly running out of time, but let me make a point that has been touched on by many noble Lords in this debate. There is a danger that we, as a society, have a punitive attitude towards our children and young persons. They are getting a bad press. The  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_706"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 706</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>media have a negative attitude towards them. There is a grave danger that we might be seen, as a society, to be at war with our young people. We heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about the way in which in many areas young people are dispersed by the use of what I think is called the mosquito bleeper, a high-pitched resonance that disperses children as if they were pariah dogs.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08061266000221"></a>Our children are the greatest material treasure that a community could have. Let us remember, as far as the attitude of society is concerned, that old men&#151;and old women now and again&#151;over the centuries in this land and no doubt in the civilisations of China, Sumer, Greece and Rome, have always been telling one another how decadent the young are. There may have been a morsel of truth in it, but I doubt it. I believe that it has had more do with the attitude summed up by that jealous and cynical remark made by Bernard Shaw:</p>

It is also gratifying to see that a number of notable experts in this House on this subject have taken the time to speak today and have brought their wise, personal perspectives to the subject.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08061266000223"></a>A decade is a long time, but in the life of a young person it is, critically, a period of enormous change. Unlike adults, it is a period when the foundations for their physical and mental well-being are established; when their knowledge-base and interests are cultivated; and, most importantly, when their life chances are determined. It is through this decade from age eight to 18 when the future of that person will be cast in the direction of success or failure. Fortunately, most succeed on the measures of well-being that we consider relevant in our society. We produce people who are relatively well educated; relatively healthy and make a positive contribution to society. It is those who do not contribute, those who tripped up at some point early on in their lives, who are our concern today. Moreover, those who encounter problems early on are seldom the sole protagonists of that error. As many noble Lords have illustrated, to a large extent broader circumstances contribute to offending behaviour in children.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08061266000224"></a>We know the circumstances. We have looked at them not only today, but did so recently in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill as it made its way through this House. However, the more depressing aspect of this saga is that 10 years and several billions of pounds of funding have resulted in so little being achieved. On most of the measures which could constitute success on youth crime&#151;take first entrant rates, reoffending rates, or reductions in custodial sentences&#151;there has been an expansion of the youth justice net, rather than a reduction in the crimes being committed.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08061266000225"></a>The report before us today&#151;<I>Ten years of Labour&#146;s youth justice reforms: an independent audit</I>, published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King&#146;s College&#151;shows that if one takes a broader look at the system, the picture is even bleaker as these reforms over the decade have singularly failed to address the  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_707"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 707</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs of the most vulnerable children and young people. For significant numbers of young people supervised by youth offending teams, the system has failed to meet the most basic test of a safety net; that of providing suitable accommodation&#151;the proverbial roof over the head&#151;without which stability is impossible to attain. When it comes to preparing them for later life, one-third are found not to receive full-time education, training or employment. Substance misuse or the provision of mental health interventions are ever the Cinderella of the service, whereby, according to this report, none of the targets for substance misuse, screening, assessment, intervention and mental health referral has been met.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08061266000226"></a>Many expert noble Lords spoke in this debate, but I want to respond to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Warner. I pay tribute to his ongoing and prevailing involvement in youth justice. His record is such that we in this House can be proud to have been party to it, even at a stage once removed. I will also resist the invitation of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, to take a pop at him for his involvement in the current system&#151;in a very direct fashion, that is. There is a problem with the noble Lord&#146;s refutation of this study in that he believes it is based on the fallacy that the report is comparative, looking at a previous golden age and then finding the present age to be wanting. That is not what it sets out to do. The report, which is written by independent experts, using empirical data and tried-and-tested methodology to arrive at their conclusions&#151;unwelcome as they may be to the Government&#151;is one that stands up to peer review and to other independent expert analysis.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08061266000227"></a>I touch on this because it is symptomatic of a larger problem to do with evidence-based research within the Government and their supporters. They do not like it. There was a fine illustration of this only last night with the Counter-Terrorism Bill and its odious proposal of detention for 42 days&#151;noble Lords knew I would come to this, did they not? When the head of the Metropolitan Police was asked for evidence to support his enthusiastic response to 42-day detention without charge, his response was that there was none. He just wanted to keep the power in his back pocket in case he needed it. The fundamental problem is having powers in case you need them at some point, rather than looking at the research as it exists. My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford has spoken of risk-averse management. For those who might suggest that we are just making political weather out of this, let me quote Professor Simon Hallsworth, a former adviser to the Government on gun crime. He criticises the Government for their &#147;deeply sinister&#148; abandonment of their policy to be tough on the causes of crime, only in order to replace it with a policy which is concerned with the &#147;management of risk&#148;.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08061266000228"></a>I move now to the Government&#146;s current response. Almost all the experts agree that a more robust preventive strategy employing social and welfare-based interventions is the way to tackle potential risk-prone individuals before they enter the criminal justice system. Indeed, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families almost said as much in his article in the <I>Independent on Sunday</I> on 8 June 2008, when he plugged the new youth crime action plan. He tells us that we need,</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08061266000553"></a>&#147;a &#145;triple track&#146; approach, with tough enforcement accompanied by early intervention addressing the root causes of violent or anti-social behaviour, and support to help troubled youngsters to get their lives back on track&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000510"></a>In fairness to him, he also goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08061266000535"></a>&#147;We must do a great deal more to intervene early to tackle the causes of disadvantage and vulnerability&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000511"></a>The point is that all these things are rendered mere aspirations unless they are accompanied by strategic and real-time resources. As my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford said, when 10 times more is spent on offending, versus preventive measures, it is no wonder that the outcome does not measure up.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08061266000229"></a>As the report points out, a key element of the Government&#146;s approach has been a reliance on,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000554"></a>&#147;systemic managerialism and central control&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000512"></a>This finding is supported by others. Professor Hallsworth, the director of London Metropolitan University&#146;s Centre for Social Evaluation Research, dismisses the Home Office&#146;s Tackling Violence Action Plan as anti-social criminology. He adds that it is &#147;hardly evidence-driven policy&#148;. He describes the policy as,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000555"></a>&#147;a cold, soulless, administrative, technocratic programme for mapping and managing risks wherever they appear: a post-welfare programme fit for the emergent national security state&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000513"></a>I can only refer again to last night and to the debate that will probably ensue. Moreover, Professor Rod Morgan, the former head of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, says that he was,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000556"></a>&#147;incensed ... by the incomprehension and arrogance regarding the research process which some administrators displayed&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000514"></a>when he headed the YJB.</p>

<a name="80612-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08061266000515"></a>We hope that these concerns will prove unfounded when it comes to the Government&#146;s new action plan and that the track of prevention alluded to by Mr Balls will be prioritised. More broadly, we hope that the Government will reflect on the findings of this report and reassess whether the strategic focus of government agencies to work with and support young people at risk is the more effective way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08061266000230"></a>I return to the focus of the report: young people in the context of youth justice and the reforms over the past 10 years. For young people, a decade of reform, a decade of targets and a decade of moving acronyms are meaningless. These young people have been let down by their parents and carers, they have been let down by community and society, and they have been let down by the Government. The welfare state and the party that has claimed to wear its mantle have failed to ensure the welfare of the most vulnerable group in their charge.</p>

Secondly, I take it on myself to remind the House that the noble Lord has already answered one Question and that he will be replying to another debate after this one. We have to admire his diligence and hard work in coming to the

I note that he is leaving the Maximum Number of Judges Order 2008 to one of his colleagues and I think that he is right so to do. I trust that he will then possibly take the evening off, but if he has other plans that is a matter for him.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08061266000232"></a>Secondly, along with others, I offer my thanks to the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies and my congratulations on its report. It is a very good report and the noble Lord would be well advised to study it, as I am sure would the noble Lord, Lord Warner. He asked that we should direct some of our comments at him and not just at his noble friend the Minister. I appreciate that the Minister&#146;s noble friend Lord Haskel was not that keen on the report and did not like its use of statistics. However, one has to remind him that it is the Government who are a long and doughty supporter and a great user of these statistics and that they are, as he admitted himself, obsessed by targets. He pointed out the danger of using targets and the effect that they could have on how people operate.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08061266000233"></a>Thirdly, I obviously offer my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for introducing this debate and for getting such a good list of speakers to come before us. In his opening remarks, he went back to the comments of the then shadow Home Secretary, Tony Blair, at a Labour Party conference just after the 1992 election, when he talked about being &#147;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&#148;. I do not want to go back quite so far. Tony Blair has now gone. He has been replaced as Prime Minister for more than a year by Gordon Brown&#151;a Prime Minister who in that year has not made one speech on criminal justice and such matters, and I think that is something that he might consider remedying in due course.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08061266000234"></a>I should like to go back some 10 or 11 years to the time when Jack Straw, then Home Secretary&#151;he is now Secretary of State for Justice and he has had quite a few other jobs in between&#151;launched his White Paper, <I>No More Excuses</I>, and the subsequent Crime and Disorder Act 1998. I remember that I dealt with part of that Act, when it was a Bill, in this House as a shadow home affairs spokesman. I suppose that I have moved on to various other things and, like his honourable friend the shadow Secretary of State for Justice, have come back to justice in the end. At the time, I think that it was the late Lord Williams who took that Bill through this House.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08061266000235"></a>As the noble Lord will remember, there were great expectations concerning the Crime and Disorder Act and the various other criminal justice and youth justice measures that followed over the years. As we have seen so often with this Government, following that there was a great expansion of expenditure&#151;of taxpayers&#146; money. We have seen expenditure on youth justice go up by some 45 per cent in real terms since then, which is more than on any other part of the criminal justice system. We would have welcomed that increase in expenditure if it had been effective; yet, 10 years on, as I understand it&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred to some more recent figures&#151;we still see that 70 per cent of male young offenders who receive a community sentence and 76 per cent who receive a custodial sentence reoffend, or, rather, they are reconvicted. Obviously the reoffending and reconviction rates are  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very different. One has to presume that the reoffending rate is considerably higher&#151;if one can measure such a thing&#151;than the reconviction rate. Perhaps the noble Lord will comment on that when he replies.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08061266000236"></a>We were also told that there were targets to reduce reoffending&#151;or, again, is it reconvicting?&#151;by some 5 per cent a year. I do not suppose that the noble Lord will be able to argue that those targets have been met in any way, but perhaps in due course he would comment on them and tell us what has happened to the attempt to get reoffending down by 5 per cent a year.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08061266000237"></a>In the few minutes available to me, I want to put a number of questions, as always, to the noble Lord, and I hope that in his usual diligent way he will try to respond to them in due course. First, the report from the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies says, in effect, that the Government&#146;s approach has failed. The authors have highlighted the fact that we have seen this great increase in spending without any discernable improvement in the youth justice system. They state that most of the Government&#146;s targets have been missed and they recommend that the time has come to re-evaluate the function and purpose of the youth justice system. Where have the Government succeeded in their approach to youth offending?</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08061266000238"></a>Why have they missed most of their recent targets for the number of children in custody? We have been given figures for how many there are and how that compares with other countries. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said that we have more children in custody than France, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands combined. Again, the Minister should comment on that. I understand that the Government had a target&#151;yet another&#151;that there would be a reduction of 10 per cent. Since 2005, rather than seeing a reduction of 10 per cent we have seen an increase of some 8 per cent.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08061266000239"></a>The report also states that the Government&#146;s youth offending teams,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000557"></a>&#147;do not appear to be able to successfully meet the complex needs of children and young people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000516"></a>What assessment have the Government made of the effectiveness of those youth offending teams? I refer to an article that the noble Lord will be familiar with from the <I>Observer</I> of a week or so ago. It published details of an internal memo from within the Ministry of Justice which states that 5 per cent to 6 per cent of young offenders commit between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of all juvenile crime, with an average of 30 to 40 offences per year. The worst offenders have a 96 per cent reoffending or reconviction rate, with each costing taxpayers some &#163;80,000 a year. The memo also states that reoffending rates are stubbornly high and have not significantly altered since 1997. Does the Minister agree with me that that again is an indication of complete failure on the part of the Government?</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08061266000240"></a>That internal memo also suggests that the youth justice system raises &#147;barriers to effective resettlement&#148; after young offenders have finished their sentences and that, by setting strict supervision conditions, it leads to an increasing number of children breaching their orders, which in turn triggers more custodial sentences. Why does the justice system raise those  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_711"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 711</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>barriers to resettlement? Going back to the report from the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, it states a somewhat depressing picture. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000558"></a>&#147;youth justice agencies can do little more than regulate youth crime&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000517"></a>Does the Minister accept that view? Further, does he agree with my party that if youth justice agencies were properly incentivised to reduce reoffending, with clear, aligned objectives and lines of accountability, we could get a grip on the problem?</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08061266000241"></a>That should be enough for the noble Lord to be going on with for the moment. Again, I offer him my commiserations and congratulations. We appreciate the work he does in this House, particularly on a Thursday like this. I look forward to hearing his response. No doubt others will hear a second response in the second debate later on.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, in her typically spirited speech, suggested that this Government are not interested in evidence-based research. Of course we are. My noble friend Lord Warner and I have boxed and coxed various jobs over the years. We were both responsible for a huge expansion in the NHS research and development budget, entirely focused on evidence-based research. I am responsible for research within my department now.

There is the big increase in spending, the reduction in crime, more offences brought to justice, the big increase in police numbers, many drug targets met, and targets on speeding up court processes for

Of course it raises, properly, some serious questions about the relationship between criminal justice and complex social and economic problems. That is its conclusion and I echo that.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08061266000247"></a>We have to tackle those fundamental, underlying issues we face as a society but that is what the Government have been doing and tackling in the past 10 or 11 years. What are the Sure Start programmes about or the huge expansion in education, the work of YOTs and our work with local authorities in general? The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked about YOTs. They have a critical role in the work with young offenders and the relationships they have with local authorities and other agencies. We debated in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill the inspector&#146;s report on YOTs. It clearly showed that YOTs had done enormously good work but that there are issues that still have to be tackled. The youth crime action plan is one area in which we will take that forward.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08061266000248"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the poor outcomes of children in care and why we need early intervention. On the point of my noble friend Lord Judd, yes we should avoid knee-jerk reactions. We have to get the social context right. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, was particularly powerful in the sense of this problem of young people lacking love and our having to recognise that in the ways we respond to these questions. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about restorative justice. I have noted her comment about the need for quicker rollout and will certainly ensure that that is considered.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08061266000249"></a>On the accommodation issue, which is relevant to the underlying theme of the report on the social framework in which criminal justice has to operate, my understanding is that an accommodation indicator is included in the provisional set of local government indicators. We welcome that, as does the Youth Justice Board. Obviously we hope it will drive local authorities to improve access to accommodation for young offenders in the future.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08061266000250"></a>My noble friend Lord Warner, who did such a great job at the Youth Justice Board, has explained the development of youth justice policy and the investment that has taken place. Some noble Lords have said of that investment that too much of it is spent on custody. They suggested that in a rather pejorative sense. We have to understand that much of that money has been spent on improving the educational programmes for those especially vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08061266000251"></a>On mental health, which is a critical area, as we have all acknowledged in our debates during the past year, part of the extra resource has come from the Department of Health to support considerable improvements in mental health services, provision and assessment for young offenders. We have of course emphasised the need for greater integration between youth crime prevention and wider children's services. There is no argument between the Government and noble Lords about the importance of doing so. I refer to the aiming high in the 10-year youth strategy of the commitment to pool 10 per cent of the Youth Justice Board's prevention grant with local authority funding. That will be created through a three-year pilot to look

We accept that it is critical to get that relationship right.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08061266000252"></a>I come to the whole question of targets. When the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, cited the accusation of systematic managerialism and central control by the Government, my noble friend Lord Warner said, &#147;If only, if only&#148;. The debate on targets is very important. It permeates the whole relationship between central government and the spending on public services, often by other agencies. I will defend the targets. I have no doubt that without some of the targets in the National Health Service, we would not have made the hugely impressive improvements that we have. I also accept that we need focus and that if you have too many targets, it is too confusing.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08061266000253"></a>I come to the question of the key targets that have been set in the criminal justice system. When one looks at the progress that has been made, one should not ignore the fall in crime, the reduction in reoffending and the increase in the number of offences brought to justice. Those are achievements. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked me about the 5 per cent reduction target. I suspect that he knows the answer already. The figure that we have is of a reduction from 40.2 per cent in 2000 to 38.4 per cent in 2005. Yes, we would have liked to have made further progress, but as my noble friend Lord Warner said, those targets were deliberately stretching; it is right that they should have been. It is clear that we need to work on that foundation. I was asked about the objectives of the Youth Justice Board for the 2008-11 CSR period. The aim is to achieve a continuing reduction in first-time entrants to the youth justice system, a continuing reduction in the frequency and seriousness of reoffending and to improve public confidence in the youth justice system. In that, I say that prevention and early intervention remain the cornerstone of our approach to reducing youth crime.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08061266000254"></a>We do not need to redebate the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, but I just point to the fact that that Act reinforced the emphasis on out-of-court diversions. There is a general view that the youth rehabilitation order, whatever our debate about various aspects of it, presents a helpful, constructive way forward.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08061266000255"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the issue of ASBOs and the whole question of demonisation of young people. I echo my noble friend: we must be very careful not to demonise young people; we need to recognise the contribution that so many of them make to our society and the greater pressure that I suspect that they are under than many of us were at that age. ASBOs are not about demonising young people. They must be seen in the context of the other actions that have been taken, such as Sure Start and the Every Child Matters programmes. But anti-social crime has to be tackled. What is often forgotten is that the victims of many of those crimes are young people themselves.</p>

We do not need to get into a cul-de-sac of pedantic argument about anti-social behaviour and the definition of crime. Noble Lords know quite well what I mean. I have said that this is not about demonising young people, but anti-social behaviour and crime which causes great problems to vulnerable people and to young people themselves also have to be tackled. One has to see the whole approach of ASBOs alongside out-of-court diversions and touch approaches to serious crime committed by young people. One has to see this in the round.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08061266000261"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Warner that of course one has to get the right balance on knife crime; there is no question about that. On mosquito noises, there is no government policy. That has not been endorsed, but a balance must be found between proper association and the problem of real intimidation by groups of youths, which has caused concern to many people, including young people themselves.</p>

<a name="80612-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08061266000262"></a>I turn to education and training, which is critically important for young people in custody. I pay tribute to the people who have been working in youth custody settings, who have done enormous work in the past few years to improve the general education and training programmes. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, mentioned literacy; of course it is important. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, made one of the most powerful speeches I have ever heard him make on this area. I visited Chelmsford prison last week, where staff paid great tribute to him for his work on dyslexia and young people, and people in general, in prison. Literacy is a very important part of our educational programme. I am informed that it is very much a focus of the special educational needs co-ordinators who have been introduced in our youth offending institutions, but there can be no complacency and I will ensure that the points raised by both noble Lords are fully considered by the Youth Justice Board and its educational partners. The actual number of hours for which young people are receiving education and training within custodial settings has increased impressively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08061266000263"></a>I come to the question of the number of young people in custody. I have debated this with noble Lords several times. I understand the concerns that noble Lords have about the number of young people in custody. It stands, from my figures for March 2008, at 2,942. Of course, we want to deal with the young person in the community wherever possible, rather than removing him or her from it&#151;the Government have said this. But we cannot lose sight of the fact that some young offenders&#146; behaviour is so serious that young people have to be placed in secure conditions. That is not a knee-jerk reaction or an impact of testosterone levels, as has been suggested. It is worth remembering that most under-18s in custody have almost reached adulthood. In April 2008&#151;the last month for which I have figures&#151;more than 50 per cent of the under-18 custodial population was aged over 17. By contrast, only 0.2 per cent were under 13. In the House of Commons two days ago, my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor said in Oral Questions:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08061266000536"></a>&#147;Very few young people are ever put into custody. The only reason that they are put into custody is that they have committed very serious offences. The number of children aged 12 in custody is seven. The bulk of those young people who are put into custody are aged 16 and 17&#151;they are not children; they are often large, unpleasant thugs, and they are frightening to the public. In my judgment, the courts have been quite right to ensure that they are locked up, and locked up for a long time where they have committed grievous offences&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10/6/08; col. 155.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08061266000265"></a>We have listened with interest to the comments of the UK&#146;s four Children&#146;s Commissioners. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that of course I noted the Welsh leadership in this matter, to which he was right to draw our attention. On the question of individual cases, as far as the English commissioner is concerned, this is quite consistent with some of the other decisions that we made about regulatory or inspectoral bodies in England. In general, the view has been taken that it is much better for the statutory agencies to deal with individuals&#151;that is their responsibility&#151;but with the regulator, the inspector, or in this case the Children&#146;s Commissioner then able to comment on the generality of the performance and service offered. I recognise that there are differences of view. He pointed to some anomalies. At this early stage, perhaps it would be better to learn from these different experiences. I have no doubt that, then, adjustments can be made. The subject of Article 37(c) and the reservation is under review at the moment.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08061266000266"></a>I will briefly come to the youth crime action plan, to which the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred very eloquently. This gives us great hope for the future. It is a partnership between my department, the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Home Office. I take his point about the importance of health. I assure him that the Department of Health has been closely involved, as have other government departments. He is absolutely right to remind the House of the importance of health considerations. I suspect he particularly meant mental health considerations because of the experience&#151;of which we know&#151;of many young offenders and their mental health problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08061266000267"></a>The report was, as I said, a very helpful document. It was well written and is very useful for us to consider in the context of the youth crime action plan. I do not agree with the analysis of some noble Lords as to its conclusions, but I suspect that we will take what we will from it. It highlights both achievements and the major challenges that we face. We have made considerable progress in the last 11 years. There is still much to do. We still need to ensure that we have the kind of co-ordinated programme that noble Lords have suggested. The youth crime action plan is clearly the vehicle for us to take that forward. I have no doubt that we will debate again very shortly when that plan is published in your Lordships&#146; House, with the same degree of expertise as we have heard this afternoon.</p>

I note that the report has been accepted and welcomed. Indeed, just a moment ago, the Minister paid tribute to the analysis in the report of the problem. Only the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, begged leave to differ because of the lack of proper statistics, on which I will not comment at this stage. Of course, the report does not stand on its own; it is supported by the report of the commissioners to the United Nations, to which the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and my noble friend Lady Miller referred. In particular, it is supported by a person who is very much at the centre of the Youth Justice Board, namely Mr Rod Morgan. I have already quoted to your Lordships how much he agrees with the findings of the report and says, in terms, that it was these failures of policy which lead to his resignation from the chairmanship of that board.</p>

He sought a new culture. The culture behind the present situation was contained in that White Paper, <I>No More Excuses</I>&#151;I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Warner, contributed to it&#151;which put punishment at the forefront. As I said to your Lordships, that was the purpose&#151;the criminal justice service was to be used for that purpose. But the noble Lord, Lord Judd, refers to&#151;and we accept&#151;the muscular love that liberals have always indicated. That theme was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, in a very interesting speech. Of course, various solutions for early intervention have been put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and in an excellent speech by my noble friend Lord Addington. Early intervention and treatment and dealing with young people&#146;s problems before they get clawed into the criminal justice system&#151;the youth justice system&#151;whether through ASBOs or any other way, are all being rehearsed. That points the way forward to a new culture away from punishment&#151;to the use of welfare social solutions to the problems that have affected young people in this country.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Joint Intelligence Committee&#151;the JIC&#151;is situated in the Cabinet Office and, under the chairmanship of Alex Allan, provides intelligence assistance to departments across government.</p>

While the documents do not contain the names of individual sources or specific operational details, they are sensitive high-level intelligence assessments. The individual concerned informed his superiors about the loss of the documents on Wednesday morning and they called in the Metropolitan Police, which began an urgent investigation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;On Wednesday afternoon the Cabinet Office was contacted by the BBC, which told the department that the two documents were in its possession. The nature of the documents was made clear to the BBC and it was requested that it did not broadcast the contents of the documents and that they be returned. The original documents were handed back to the Metropolitan Police on Wednesday evening. There is no evidence at this stage to suggest that our vital national security interests have been damaged or that any individuals or operations have been put at risk. However, the police investigation is continuing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This was a clear breach of well established security rules, which forbid the removal of documents of this kind outside secure government premises without clear authorisation and compliance with special security procedures. These rules are a clear part of the operating procedures for handling matters of this sensitivity. All individuals on joining the assessment staff are given a formal briefing on the rules by a specially designated security officer. This formal briefing is supplemented by clear written instructions provided to the individual and that individual has to sign a statement to indicate that they have read, understood and will comply at all times with the rules. In this case, no authorisation was sought for the removal of the documents.</p>

It is a matter of utmost concern to the Government that this breach of security happened. We will take all steps to ensure that all individuals who work within the Joint Intelligence Committee staff observe the procedures that are necessary for security.

The facts in the case are pretty straightforward. Highly classified and sensitive government documents, drawing on material derived from intelligence sources, were discovered by a member of the general public. The documents were left lying on a train seat by mistake, I assume, by the official concerned, who has now been suspended. This member of the public gave the documents not to the police, as should have been the case, but to a BBC security correspondent. As a result, we know the subject matter of the two documents. Fortunately their contents have not been published and the BBC is to be congratulated on preferring to obey the law and safeguard the security of the nation, rather than going for what could have been a big scoop.</p>

This would have put trust between the UK and Iraq in jeopardy. As for the assessment of al-Qaeda, this country&#146;s leading terrorist foe, I invite the House to consider the implications of an enemy being informed of our assessment of their strategy and capabilities. In war, what a fighting force needs above all is to know what the other side knows and thinks about it and what it does not know. Al-Qaeda has shown itself to be extraordinarily astute politically. Here it would have been handed information on a plate from which it could have devised new and more deadly ways of operating to harm us and to kill our people.</p>

<p><a name="08061266000278"></a>What is the value of what are claimed to be the right decisions if people in a central part of the government machine, the Cabinet Office, take their duties so lightly that they are capable of actions that risk directly helping the enemy to conspire successfully against us? The aim of government should be to prevent terrorism, not to help to create messes for which the police are then said to need extra powers to clear up. One wonders what our close intelligence allies think. What do the Americans, Canadians and Australians make of this story? Their security is thereby prejudiced, too. Presumably the Government will apologise to them if they have not already done so.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08061266000279"></a>It would be nice to think that yesterday&#146;s incident was an isolated case. It was certainly egregious and the House notes the action taken in respect of the individual concerned; the Government could do no less. However, this is not the end of the matter. There is a systemic and cultural problem, both at the heart of government and more widely in other Whitehall departments. I could list no fewer than seven other instances of lapses since November 2007 in the proper custody by the Government of sensitive data in their possession&#151;seven other lapses in just six months, and these are merely the ones about which we know. The House will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to give chapter and verse of these examples, but they are strikingly spread throughout Whitehall: two in HMRC, two in DWP, one in the Department for Transport, one in the National Health Service and one in the MoD. The Cabinet Office makes eight, and this is the department responsible for security throughout Whitehall.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08061266000280"></a>Lest anyone thinks that these earlier lapses were trivial, let me recall that some of them were so serious that, as today, they demanded a ministerial Statement to the House. To cite just one, the House will recall the loss in transit by HMRC of the banking details and addresses of 25 million families in receipt of child benefit, which jeopardised the personal financial security of a large proportion of this country&#146;s households. This shows contempt for the rights of the citizen to basic personal security and trustworthiness. This is the Government who imply that they are a better, more trustworthy guardian of the security of the people than those who disagree with Ministers about issues surrounding the extension of pre-charge detention. I suggest that this is not serious. Security is indivisible. The Government cannot be secure in one part and insecure in another without destroying overall credibility.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08061266000281"></a>Sir David Omand is a distinguished person of wisdom and integrity and his willingness to review procedure is to be welcomed, but I regret the fact that the Minister&#146;s Statement contains no hint of the thought that anything is required other than to reiterate existing procedure. It sounds complacent. I suggest that the House needs to know more about enforcement. Good security does not require a genius to achieve it. It is not complex and it is not difficult; it is simple. Departments have rules and those rules need to be obeyed. To ensure observance, the rules should be actively monitored. Departments check the credentials of people on entry and often take away the visitor&#146;s telephone, so why had they not been applying proper perimeter security to

The knowledge that briefcases will be really, and not just theoretically, opened on a random basis and irrespective of rank would act as a real deterrent to the flouting of regulations.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08061266000282"></a>It is time that the Government got a grip of the lax security culture that has been allowed to develop in Whitehall, which seems to be part of a broader procedural sloppiness of sofa government. This instance of the loss of the Government&#146;s own information, and the state&#146;s secrets, is the moment to do it. The Government should enforce sound procedures for handling all information. In addition, they should ensure watertight special handling of the state&#146;s secrets, the leaking of which prejudices the security of the entire nation. They should increase governance in this area by permitting on a permanent basis independent inspection by suitably cleared people of the effectiveness of the security procedures in place. Moreover, I am sure that the House would find it helpful if the Minister were to give a progress report before the Summer Recess on Sir David Omand&#146;s findings.</p>

The first shock about this disclosure is that is happened in the Cabinet Office, which has been commissioned to review data-handling procedures in government following a series of data breaches over the past year. How can we have any faith in the department that is actually responsible for clearing up the messes when it is in the middle of perpetrating another one?</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08061266000284"></a>I will not gainsay the expert analysis of the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, on the threat posed by this lapse in security, but I regret that she is not going to take part in the ensuing debate on data protection and the measures that the Government should put in place. We have a couple of hours this afternoon to explore some of the positive things that could be done about the situation, in which it is quite evident that there is a cultural failure. Nowadays we usually think of technological advances in data protection and the fact that the tools have not kept up with the technology, but this case concerns sheets of paper in an orange folder. The failure even to keep them in a locked briefcase absolutely beggars belief. There is a whole raft of other issues, such as memory sticks that can be left on mantelpieces, CDs whose material can be downloaded and the laptop that was stolen. The list is endless.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08061266000285"></a>The Cabinet Office accommodates the Intelligence and Security Committee, which provides recognised formal training and development for IT security professionals and others. Surely that security regime has to be looked at again. We must ask whether it is sufficient for the Government to appoint one person to conduct an inquiry when there is a systemic failure of this degree in the very department that is supposed to enforce these standards. The Security Commission,  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I believe also comes under the Cabinet Office, is tasked to investigate and report on possible or actual breaches of security, but I realise that generally it does not deal with them. I believe that, at the moment, the commission is chaired by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. However, in this case an internal inquiry really is not enough because clearly there has been a systemic failure. Would it not be better to have that body look at this instance, as well as at any other potential cultural failures that are running through the department, and then make suggestions?</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08061266000286"></a>I understand that the police were involved in this case at first, but the investigation now seems to have gone off on a complete tangent. Perhaps the noble Baroness could explain why the police are now conducting a forensic investigation when it is clear that the member of staff left the stuff on the seat. Why is police time now being taken up on a forensic investigation of something that is quite obvious? I hope that as many Members of the House as are able will take part in the ensuing debate because there are some serious questions to be answered at greater length.</p>

I want to make it absolutely clear that the Government take this breach of security very seriously indeed. I appreciate the points about the loss of personal data, about which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, reminded us, my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham made a full and honest Statement to the House. That loss is also something that the Government regret deeply. However, I am not convinced that it is right to suggest that there is a culture across Whitehall that joins this incident with that event. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, is well aware of the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee and, although I do not want to state the obvious, I point out that the kind of information that we are talking about is handled by the staff of the JIC, who understand very well their responsibilities as Cabinet Office staff. I would not want to detract from that at all: they are all trained and have to sign a personal agreement on appointment that they will abide by the rules. However, there has been a breach of those rules here.</p>

<a name="80612-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08061266000288"></a>In order to offer all those concerned about this issue an appropriate reassurance, we have set up an investigation under the leadership of Sir David Omand. That investigation will keep the Intelligence and Security Committee of parliamentarians informed, and my right honourable friend Ed Miliband has said that he will keep Members of another place informed. It is therefore right that noble Lords should ask to be kept informed, and that will happen. Moreover, I want to assure noble Lords that the investigation by the police was set in train immediately and is continuing, although I do not want to speculate about what the investigation might turn up. On the specific question put to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about the Security Commission, the chair has been consulted and is content with the approach that we are adopting.</p>

First, while I appreciate that it is entirely appropriate that the identity of the person who lost the documents should not be revealed at this stage, can she give some indication of the level or rank at which that person was operating? I think that that is relevant to the cultural question referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones. Without specifying the exact rank, can the noble Baroness give us some idea of how high or low in the hierarchy of the JIC the person operated at? Secondly, without in any way impugning the integrity of the BBC, may I ask whether there is any knowledge of how wide or narrow has been the circulation of information concerning the contents of these documents? Were copies taken and has an undertaking been made at the appropriate level as to non-disclosure? If not, will the Government consider taking any action in the civil courts that might be appropriate?</p>

It would be inappropriate at this stage for me to say anything that could result in the identity of the individual being made known. On his second question, about the circulation of the document, there was a gap between the documents going missing on Tuesday morning and the Cabinet Office being notified. The police investigation will of course look into the circumstances around the whole incident. However, I do not want to speculate on what may result from that.</p>

I think that subsequent to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, the Minister said that on appointment to relevant posts, including this officer&#146;s post, documents are signed giving an undertaking to abide by the rules. How frequently is an officer reminded of this matter? Will my noble friend pursue the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, on the inspection of briefcases when they are taken from the office to the outside world? Finally, why, if these documents are important and sensitive, should they be available in loose form that can be taken out of the office in a briefcase or under one&#146;s arm rather than being available only to be looked at, studied and commented on in some secure part of the office in Whitehall?</p>

I believe that my right honourable friend was trying to make it clear in his Statement that, although there was a breach of the rules, that was not because the document was taken outside the premises. It is extremely rare that such documents should ever be taken from specified secure government premises. The point is that, if such a rare occurrence were to be required, clear authorisation should be sought in advance and there should be specific compliance with security procedures around the removal of such a sensitive document. It is true

The first is about the conversations that the Cabinet Office had with the BBC on Wednesday afternoon. It appears from the Statement that the BBC was requested only not to broadcast the documents&#146; contents. Does that mean that the Cabinet Office agreed that it could make reference to the fact that it had the documents in its possession, and could those documents have been covered by a D-notice? My second question goes back to an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, on our relations with our allies. From what we have heard on the BBC, these documents were caveated for the eyes only of citizens from certain countries. That has serious implications for our relations with those countries. I would be grateful if the Minister could reply to the question put to her by the noble Baroness.</p>

They were informed on Wednesday and they have therefore had the opportunity to take whatever steps they feel are right. I am not sure whether I have made it clear so far, but those that we have informed to date include the US, Canada and Australia. The documents&#146; content was covered by a DA-notice but what the BBC said was not, so we communicated to the BBC that we would prefer that it did not broadcast. As the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, pointed out, it has complied to date with our request.</p>

It would not be appropriate for me to place a timescale on Sir David&#146;s work. I do not want to second-guess what my right honourable friend will say, but the Government would want Sir David to have the opportunity to undertake a full investigation and we should give him the opportunity to do that without creating an undue restraint.

The Minister used the word &#147;authorisation&#148; on a number of occasions. It is mind boggling that such information can so casually be taken out of more secure areas. When she talks about authorisation, is there an established procedure? Does an officer who wishes to take information home ever so rarely have to have a countersigned authorisation from a senior member of the department? Is there a set procedure and is it part of the investigation whether the set procedure was followed?</p>

The reason why we have asked Sir David to undertake an investigation is that we want to offer reassurance that we do not take this matter lightly.

There has been an unauthorised removal of papers, which shows that there is a problem with the rules themselves if the papers can be withdrawn. Does this not show that the Cabinet Office has less security than the average supermarket? If we walk out of a supermarket with something that we should not have, it can set off an alarm. It is possible to tag papers so that they set off an alarm if they are being removed from a secure area.

We and the public have just been shocked by yet another catastrophic example of data loss, where literally millions of the records that individuals have entrusted to the state have gone missing. The case in the Statement concerned state security, which is slightly different but potentially more serious. I am going to concentrate on the affect that these losses have on individuals, on their confidence in giving data to the state and on the state&#146;s responsibility for looking after that data properly.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08061266000305"></a>At the moment, the UK probably leads the developed world in data loss. The point of the debate is to ask the Government what tools are in place to prevent that loss, whether they are using them and what more tools are needed. We on these Benches believe that the culture must change dramatically before losses of this magnitude stop occurring. As the Minister will know, because he agreed to it, we succeeded in getting a change to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill that gives the Information Commissioner more powers to deal with reckless and careless losses. It is a small step which needs to be followed by many others.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08061266000306"></a>In the debate, we will call for an urgent updating of the Data Protection Act, which is 10 years old. In that time there have been phenomenal technological changes and it is not surprising that neither legislation nor thinking have kept pace. It was timely for this debate that last Tuesday an exhibition in Portcullis House showcased some of the advances in both the private and government sectors. I expect the Minister visited the exhibition. I certainly met his counterpart from the other place there and we had an interesting discussion. We are all agreed that the public have the right to expect that government agencies which demand their data, and private agencies which request personal data, should have systems to keep them safe and staff who are well aware of how best to use such safeguards. Legislation is certainly not the only answer; there must be a widespread cultural shift across public and private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08061266000307"></a>Going back into history, it was in 1965 that George Moore, a co-founder of the giant computer chip manufacturer Intel, made a prediction: he said that information technology would grow, and continue to grow, at an exponential rate and would herald a revolution in human, social, political and commercial life. He was absolutely right. The increasing ease with which data can be collected, stored and processed presents countless new and exciting opportunities. I am not suggesting that we should not welcome this but, as more and more data and information relating to us are collected and stored, protecting the security of that information becomes ever more difficult. A real tension emerges between engaging with the opportunities offered by these new technologies and ensuring that any information that is collected, stored and processed is treated with due regard to its sensitivity. That tension is most pronounced in e-government, which is convenient and efficient when it works and disastrous when it does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08061266000308"></a>The introduction of ContactPoint, otherwise known as the Children&#146;s Index, about which my noble friend Lady Walmsley will speak, provides a database of every single child in England and Wales. Spine, the NHS central medical record database, represents a dramatic widening of the circumstances under which the genetic information of individuals may be retained. And, of course, there is also the proposed national identity card scheme.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08061266000309"></a>Data are also collected as part of CCTV operations, cameras record us in our cars in the street, satellites watch over our homes, police helicopters operate face-recognition technology above crowds and technology now exists which allows tiny drones to swoop in and photograph indoors. I must ask the Minister whether recent reports are true that the Government are considering the construction of a database which will hold details of every phone call made and every e-mail sent by the public, allegedly as part of the fight against crime and terrorism, although that might be part of the wilder imaginings of the press.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08061266000310"></a>Mass data collection and retention is not the sole domain of government. The private sector has been years ahead in seeing the commercial potential in data collection. However, collection is one thing but the problems arise in its retention&#151;how is it stored, how is it accessed and by whom? Even the technology that I understand and use&#151;the memory stick, for example&#151;allows vast amounts of data to be downloaded in one place and removed to another, just as we were talking about in the Statement. More sophisticated is the collection of information by Google, for example, in developing targeted advertising. There are all kinds of technological advances which are hard to grasp.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08061266000311"></a>I was talking with the chief executive of Phorm this week who told me that once something is stored you have lost control over it. Phorm has been the subject of an interesting article in the <I>Economist</I> recently which some of your Lordships may have read. It is a company on the cutting edge of what can protect the public. A bit of controversy surrounds its work because, with its client BT, it intercepted people&#146;s online business without BT customers knowing. But Phorm is certainly correct when it says that if consumers knew what was actually stored they would decide to opt for true anonymity online. This is what Phorm is trying to develop with major telecommunications clients on a global scale.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08061266000312"></a>The focus should now be on what is stored and how because once there is a breach it is too late. A robust assessment of new databases and other initiatives could be effected through the use of privacy impact assessments, which, essentially, are privacy specific audits, which identify areas of e-government but have the potential to conflict with the provisions of data protection legislation. These are in their infancy in Europe but are commonplace in Australia and Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the US. I ask the Minister whether PIAs&#151;which have been warmly welcomed by the Government, who have acknowledged that they can be useful in maintaining the balance between the needs of today&#146;s society for more information to be shared and protecting privacy&#151;have been conducted in any aspect of e-government. As far as I can establish,  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_727"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>none has been conducted on the proposed national ID card scheme, ContactPoint&#151;nor has that been done on Spine or the forthcoming implementation of the automatic number plate recognition system. Is the Minister able to say why not?</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08061266000313"></a>I am sure the Minister is aware that some use of online data is absolutely disgraceful. The worst private sector example that I have come across recently is the utterly pernicious national staff dismissal register. I know my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno will make some remarks on this new development and so I will simply say that this new database, where tittle-tattle, rumour and potentially defamatory material concerning ex-employees can be stored for access by other prospective employers, is a dangerous development. We on these Benches take business crime seriously but there is a court system to deal with it. A website which is run for profit and which is trying to take the place of the police, prosecution, judge and jury is a serious issue. I hope the Government will do something about safeguarding the interests of workers who have little ability to pay for expensive access to the courts in order to do something about it.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08061266000314"></a>Of immediate public concern, too, is the HM Revenue and Customs debacle last year&#151;this has been referred to on numerous occasions in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;when the records of 25 million people were lost in the post. There have been further incidents of significant losses from the DVLA and the MoD. In the context of data mismanagement, the public do not have the confidence that they need to feel if the Government are going to take their next step in e-government. That next step, which was demonstrated at Portcullis House in the exhibition on Tuesday, is centralised registration online guarded by secure access, along the lines of what noble Lords may be used to using with their online bank accounts. It sounds good and looks convenient, but if something goes wrong and it proves to be insecure it will be a total disaster. The fact is that nothing can be regarded as totally secure. Does the Minister agree with that?</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08061266000315"></a>One of the things the Government have tried to do is bring in data guardians. On the advice of Kieran Poynter of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who was commissioned to conduct the review into what went wrong at HM Revenue and Customs, the Government have appointed a number of dedicated data guardians charged solely with ensuring that large quantities of data, held by whichever department, are treated in compliance with good practice set down in the Data Protection Act. That is a welcome move. How is it progressing?</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08061266000316"></a>The Government also have&#151;this was a surprise to me&#151;a dedicated Data Protection Minister, currently Mr Michael Wills MP. It was revealed, subsequent to the HMRC data loss, that the first he heard about that incident was when a Statement was made by the Chancellor in another place. Mr Wills candidly admitted that in the light of the Revenue and Customs data loss the Government are going to have to learn lessons&#151;but I am afraid it is part of his job to teach them.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08061266000317"></a>I am not excluding the private sector. There have been some shocking examples of the misuse of data by a number of banks and companies entrusted with  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sensitive data. HSBC is facing the prospect of a Financial Services Authority investigation and a hefty fine after it lost the key details of some 370,000 customers in April. Nationwide customers, not directors, are going to have to pay for security lapses with a &#163;980,000 fine.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08061266000318"></a>I must also draw the House&#146;s attention to a crossover between the private and public sectors in the comments of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which said in a recent report on data protection:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08061266000538"></a>&#147;Where there is a demonstrable need to legislate to permit data sharing between public sector bodies, or between public and private sector bodies, the Government&#146;s intentions should be set out clearly in primary legislation. This would enable Parliament to scrutinise the Government&#146;s proposals ... and, bearing in mind that secondary legislation cannot ... be amended, would increase the opportunity for Parliament to hold the executive to account&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000518"></a>I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comment on that.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08061266000319"></a>The Information Commissioner has made a good start in changing attitudes in all public bodies, but he is labouring, as I have said, under a rather outdated Data Protection Act. He is also pretty limited in his resources. Are the fees that the Information Commissioner can raise sufficient to deal with the volume of work that he now has to cope with? The regulator is charged with not only educating data controllers about their obligations but their compliance with the Act itself. I would be surprised if the resources that he was set up with were adequate for the job he now has to do. Arming the commissioner with new legal powers is essential. Although I know that by convention the Minister will not comment on what is going to be in the Queen&#146;s Speech, it would be useful to know how urgent the Government feel that updating is.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08061266000320"></a>I shall mention the situation raised in the European Parliament by my noble friend Lady Ludford, who is concerned about exchanges of passenger data and DNA from different European countries. She is concerned about the operation of the data retention directive, which is an effective and constructive dialogue that is very much needed, and the UK Government&#146;s contribution to that, particularly as our primary data protection legislation is derived directly from Europe.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08061266000321"></a>In conclusion, the pace of technological advances has been ferocious. The benefits are great in convenience, but equal dangers or, probably, greater ones are posed by data misuse, theft or improper exploitation. The tools are not yet in place to give the public confidence in even what the public and private sectors hold now, and, as PFIs and partnerships allow more and more data to move between the two, any regulatory system must apply equally to both and be constantly reviewed. In the short term, money is far better spent on that than on creating an identity card system that brings further challenges. In the longer term, the far more technologically literate younger generation are those who should decide whether or not that should proceed. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08061266000323"></a>One thing that interests me about this debate is how few people seem to be interested in it. That really worries me. This subject goes to the heart of a lot of things to do with the relationship between the citizen and the state, about which there are many highly independent Back-Benchers on both sides who get deeply upset. Because the debate has the word &#147;data&#148; in it, however, they do not see that actually this is the future&#151;it is exactly the sort of thing that could tip the balance of power in the wrong direction if we do not get it right. That is why it is critical.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08061266000324"></a>The House has just had a debate about youth justice, which unfortunately I was not able to take part in. What really worries me about that is what data are kept long-term. A year ago I became aware that both a reprimand and a caution are admissions of guilt to a criminal offence. You may say to a youth aged 14, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, it&#146;s a reprimand, it will come off your record&#148;, but in fact it does not. They have a criminal conviction that stays on their record for life for the purpose of American or Australian visas. They can never work with the law. They can never get a job as a policeman, in the Army or as a teacher. That last situation depends slightly on the offence but, since we saw the other day that they were considering firing a headmaster for fishing without a rod licence, we can gather that, with regard to the relevance of the criminal offence to what you can do in the teaching profession, common sense has been suspended&#151;as usual.</p>

<a name="80612-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08061266000325"></a>We need to worry about this. We are criminalising a generation of young people who will be completely disbarred from seriously useful professions in the future. Many of those people are the brighter ones. It is the people who are risk-takers, more outgoing and a little bit more punchy who get into trouble, and they are probably the people who you want as your leaders in the future. We need to look at how we expunge records properly, for all purposes, so that they cannot be recovered. There may be one or two offences that we consider sufficiently serious that records for them should be kept&#151;for example, sexual interference with a person&#151;but an awful lot of them should be written off properly. We used to have a statute of rehabilitation, but we seem to have forgotten that. Moments of madness now live with you for ever. We have to think about that. It is underlying aspect of my thinking on this. I shall talk about the principles that worry me.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08061266000326"></a>What do the Government want to do&#151;by this I probably mean the Executive rather than Parliament, but Parliament is to a certain extent covered as well? They say that they want proactively to protect people from harm. That sounds good&#151;it is a very laudable intention&#151;but who is going to harm them? Is it a bad guy out there, or some little inspector or regulator who is going to destroy their career through some rule in the future? Sometimes the Government can be the most dangerous person to deal with. Was it not Reagan who said that one of the most terrifying things for a small business to hear is: &#147;We&#146;re from the Government and we&#146;re here to help you&#148;?</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08061266000327"></a>I shall deal with two aspects of this question: first, with the sharing and amalgamation of data. There is a great belief that sharing and amalgamating data across large government systems will deliver useful results  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and help people. The second aspect is legitimate access to those data. I shall revisit the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act regulations because they are no longer fit for purpose. I hope that the Government may come back to us with some sensible suggestions with checks built in&#151;I shall deal with that later.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08061266000328"></a>We in Parliament should be interested in the efficient, effective enforcement of our laws, but the trouble is that we pass the laws in principle and then hand over responsibility to the Executive to produce statutory instruments and rules which dictate what happens. We all know the old saying about rules: &#147;Rules are made to be broken&#148;. We say it because it is impossible in this complex world, with its complex human relationships, to define every single thing that exists. A lot of mathematical chaos theory shows that rules cannot be used to control a complex system, yet we mistakenly think that to run a good bureaucracy and provide certainty&#151;for example, that one will get one&#146;s passport on time or that things will run smoothly&#151;one can apply them to all the interactions in human life. One cannot. This comes down to the problem of big databases and data-mining across them.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08061266000329"></a>At the end of the day, the rules will be used by inspectors. We all know what inspectors are like: they believe in level playing fields&#151;they are quite right to do so because the world should be fair. They think that you have to obey the rules absolutely so that they apply to everyone. However, we know that human life is too complicated for that. We know that the watchwords should be &#147;flexibility&#148;, &#147;understanding&#148;, &#147;interpretation&#148;, &#147;intention&#148;, &#147;impact&#148;, &#147;outcome&#148; and &#147;empathy&#148;. They will help people, Britain and all the other aspects of society move forward. Instead of that, one gets the little Hitler. When we talk about these things in Parliament, we do so as if reasonable people are the enforcers. Reasonable people are not good enforcers&#151;they break too many rules and are too understanding&#151;but the good enforcers will destroy everything that you think is good. We have to get that balance back again.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08061266000330"></a>We are talking about balance and protecting people. RIPA falls into three parts. There is the reverse-look-up bit: you want to find out who someone is; there is a telephone number; you have got to look it up; it is no big deal; it is just a reverse directory inquiry look-up. There are no great protections against that and I am not very worried about it. Self-authorisation is fine. However, the problems arise when it comes to the second aspect, traffic data. Who called whom for how long? Those data give you a feel for the significant connections. You can build up quite an accurate pattern of someone&#146;s life if you data-mine intelligently. Yet local councils can self-authorise for some of those data.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08061266000331"></a>The final aspect is surveillance, which local councils are using RIPA to carry out. At the moment, they are carrying out physical surveillance, but let us not imagine that that will not extend to electronic surveillance very soon if it has not already done so. Let us take an example from the other day, of Poole borough council and the school catchment area case. Someone filled in a form. The council felt that they had got it wrong, so it watched them for five days, at the end of which it found out that they had not been telling lies. However, the children became aware of it. One can imagine the  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_731"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 731</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bad effect of that on individuals. Perhaps one could say that it would have been better to do it electronically and monitor all the mobile telephones in the house to see where they were. However, how many noble Lords are registered for the congestion charge in London? Have they looked up the rules for how many nights they can spend in London? Do they not think that it would be fair for Capita to do some data-mining on their mobile telephone location records to find out whether they have spent the correct statutory amount of time in London or whether they are one day short over the year, at which point, they must of course, because they have been a burden on the public purse, be fined and possibly locked up?</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08061266000332"></a>The point is that we have got the proportion wrong. We are criminalising too many things. You get a criminal conviction for leaving your dustbin lid four inches open. You get a criminal record for trivial things like a playground fight. You get a criminal record for stupid things that we do not think are criminal. The law needs to align itself with what is criminal and what is not. Until we do that, we cannot unleash automatic systems that decide who they will convict. That is my first point.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08061266000333"></a>One big thing that you cannot do is to retrofit security into a complex system. If you design it from the start and work out where your boundaries, firewalls and stop lines are, what is permissible and what is not, you can do it. Under the Communications Data Bill, which will come to us soon in order to implement part of an EU directive, they will be able to keep a record of all the websites that you visit on the internet, once they have fitted the net-flow equipment. The information will go to the Home Office, along with all your telephone stuff. At the moment, they have to go to the individual telcos to find out who you rang and when; and it goes through a process where someone checks that the request is valid. If this all goes into one central Government-controlled vault&#151;it will slip through somewhere in the small print of a Bill that you are not interested in, or in a statutory instrument that you have to vote out in its entirety, and are you really going to go to the wall for that?&#151;then suddenly they will be able to data-mine it.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08061266000334"></a>There is stuff out there now that looks at business relationships and relationship trees&#151;who you know and who you might know. On this subject, I warn noble Lords that they are all two jumps away from Osama bin Laden. I thought that I was four jumps away from him, because I sat on a committee with someone whose brother-in-law was married to his first cousin. At the end of my little talk, someone came up to me and said, &#147;I&#146;m terribly sorry, Merlin, I taught him English when he was young&#148;. So I am one jump away and noble Lords are two.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08061266000335"></a>That sounds silly, but noble Lords will know how the press says, &#147;Queen&#146;s fifth cousin caught for drugs&#148;. This is the next thing that worries me: police targets. When police come under pressure, they have to produce someone, so they look for relationships that may or may not exist. This is the trouble: you get some keen investigator looking for things. You can see how he could draw inaccurate inferences that implicate an individual incorrectly. You take that through to someone  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_732"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 732</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>else and then put it to the Home Secretary, so that it comes under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act. You do not have enough evidence to go to court, but it is enough to confine them to barracks, to their home, and cut them off from human contact. That worries me.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08061266000336"></a>I like to keep stuff in silos, because you get extra firewalls and extra checks in there. We need to make sure that stuff is encrypted and that only the right people have the authorisation to get in there. With Varney rippling out and sending one&#146;s address all over government, we have to be careful. I have spoken to some people and I think that they are absolutely on the right lines in making sure that stuff is secure. However, we need to ensure that it covers not just obvious things, but also unobvious things that become significant later.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08061266000337"></a>At the moment, the Government are saying, &#147;Trust us, we will look after it, you have no problems&#148;. However, it will not take much for that trust to break down. We must keep the trust there. I talk a lot to various groups about CRM&#151;customer relationship management. It is when the people at the centre&#151;the local authority or whoever&#151;manage your query or problem in the way that they think it should be managed. People now talk about VRM, vendor relationship management, where you, the citizen, decide who you want to interact with and how much you are going to tell them. That way you are responsible for your own stuff. If you make a mess of it, so be it; at least you are in control. There are some people who cannot be, and here we come to the real world. Some people need to be looked after, but most of us do not. We have lived for a very long time in a common law system where we take responsibility for our own lives. We should go back to that and stop trying to be protective.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08061266000338"></a>The problem, when things go wrong, is the repair part; how you recall it, how you repair it, how you rescue things&#151;how you get your credit rating back, how you get your reputation back. It is very difficult. Until we solve that, we have to be very careful about how we concentrate everything in one place.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08061266000339"></a>Many things that the Government want to achieve can properly be done by anonymisation. There are technologies out there that can anonymise totally&#151;although they can be reverse engineered in certain critical situations. We could bring in RIPA Part 2 and specify that, instead of a system of self-authorisation, you have to do it properly and go out to a second party. If you are a local authority wanting to look at who someone has been talking to, you have to go to a policeman to authorise it. The police will be willing to do it. If you are the police, you go to a magistrate. This was how we always worked it. We had an outside body checking. We should go back to that. With reverse anonymity, you go to a judge and say, &#147;We have detected the probability of something very serious here and need to reverse engineer this to find out who was involved&#148;. There are lots of technical ways in which these things can be done, but we must engineer in safeguards at the start. We must not rush into this. We must not build things that we will regret in five years&#146; time. I know from history that every time you hand over too much power to the state, things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08061266000340"></a>My last point is that the people who look after us, who try to protect us&#151;such as the Information Commissioner, the Interception of Communications Commissioner and the Surveillance Commissioner&#151;should report to Parliament and to somewhere outside any other executive line of reporting. Otherwise, you do not have proper procedure. All of that is complicated. You have to remember that there is not just one bad guy or one good guy. There are bad guys inside the system and good guys outside. We need to make sure that we protect our people in future.</p>

There are so many areas of concern relating to data. Recently, 25 million records were lost, which is incredible. A laptop was stolen and more data were lost, and, only this week, we heard about the missing data on the train. We have had all those situations. Sometimes, there is deliberate lawbreaking. There are hackers who can find out a great deal about us, such as our bank details and identities, and that can lead to fraud. At other times, it is pure human error, and we are all capable of that. It is not the conspiracy but the cock-up that causes so much difficulty.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08061266000342"></a>I sometimes feel as though privacy is nearly something of the past. They tell me that if I walk around London I will be photographed by a CCTV camera about 300 times in a day. Gosh, I hope that I am behaving myself when the camera catches me. Then you see the cross-referencing of information. I did something that I should not have done this year: I renewed my car tax by telephone. I did not go to the post office. Many post offices no longer deal with car tax. That is another thing that we should continue battling for. The people that I was dealing with knew nearly everything about my car. They knew me and then they cross-referenced something else on the database and knew the make of the car and whether it was insured. They also knew whether it had an MOT. There was all that cross-referencing and you wonder sometimes how far that cross referencing goes. How secure are you? How undermined is your own privacy with all these databases that can be linked one to the other. Then there are private businesses. Somebody phones you up and they want to know where you live and all they need is your postcode and then the whole cross-referencing starts again. There is already that danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08061266000343"></a>My noble friend mentioned the national staff dismissal register, which is ominous. Action Against Business Crime was set up with Home Office backing and we know that even today the Home Office logo is still on that particular organisation&#146;s literature. The Home Office backed Action Against Business Crime. I received an Answer on 22 May that more than &#163;1 million was contributed between 2004-07 to set up and maintain that organisation. Under the auspices of that organisation, you have the national staff dismissal register. Although the Home Office&#151;which I take at its word&#151;says that it will not be involved in any way with its operation, the logo is still there. The original sponsorship is still there, which the Home Office backed.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08061266000344"></a>The register is used by employers when they are vetting applicants for jobs. They can see not only whether there is any criminal record or offence that could be punished in a criminal way, but if there is any suspicion&#151;not proof. The person might have been dismissed not because of any theft or fraud, but often because of rumours and unfounded suspicion. If we go back to human error, how often is incorrect information or unfounded rumour included in a person&#146;s data?</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08061266000345"></a>How often is there a miscarriage of justice? When that happens, you may be recorded by one company as having been suspected of something. Maybe the person was a Methodist Minister who preached non-Wesleyan theology&#151;that happens sometimes. Then you are suspected. That can be recorded against you. If you tried to get another job someone might say, &#147;He is not sound; he is suspected of something&#148;. People's lives, and more seriously in some ways, their livelihoods, can be jeopardised.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08061266000346"></a>I am not going to mention the private companies which already contribute to the national staff dismissal register, but they include some of the best-known names in the kingdom. Representing many thousands of employees, they have signed up to&#151;and use&#151;this database. It is open to abuse. I know that one of the companies, a shop mentioned on the database, does not have a great deal of good to say about the Royal Family. I do not know what would happen if they suggested that a member of the Royal Family was under suspicion. These are unfounded rumours. There is no basis for the allegations. There might be dislike of an employee, and even the possibility of blackmail. The most vulnerable people who come to these shores are those likely to be misunderstood and blacklisted in this way. People who might not understand English or know their rights could be at a tremendous disadvantage if their names were included on this register.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08061266000347"></a>What influence&#151;I would not use the word &#147;control&#148;&#151;does the Home Office have over the national staff dismissal register? What information about their rights is given to employees when they are taken on by one of the companies that are part of this network? What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that employers do not abuse the register? Will employees be able to take legal steps to have their names removed and, if falsely accused, sue for defamation? What information is given to them? What control do the Government have to ensure that nobody is ill-treated or abused under this scheme? Why is the Home Office logo still on this literature?</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08061266000348"></a>I express another cause for concern, of which I have spoken previously in this House; namely, the passport personal interviews. Sixty-eight or 69 permanent offices have been established to interview people face to face, for the first time, when they apply for a passport. About 600,000 passports are applied for each year. This is to stop terrorist activity or anything of that nature. These permanent offices have facilities to take one&#146;s photograph. As time goes on and these offices become the network for identity cards, fingerprints, and possibly iris scans, will be taken there. This is all part of the Government&#146;s proposals. How secure are these databases? How secure will the national identity card database be? We are already told that people are  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_735"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issued with the wrong passport. I read that somebody had been sent somebody else&#146;s personal details instead of a passport. There are many human errors.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08061266000349"></a>My final concern is over what happens where there are not enough applicants for a permanent passport interview office. Then there will be a remote-area interview facility, which will use a webcam. Possibly a council office will be available. The applicant will go there and be photographed, but how will their fingerprints be taken, and their iris scans obtained? I think it will be impossible to do that by webcam. We will have a database that is totally unfit for purpose and does not give those who are interviewed remotely the same record as those in permanent passport interview offices. Places where remote-area interviews will be carried out include Arran, Bute, the central Highlands, Orkney, Pembrokeshire and north Anglesey. They will have these remote facilities. Can the Minister give us assurances on these facilities, as well as on the national staff dismissal register, before giving them additional support or encouragement? The more surveillance we have, the more mistakes we can make. The more mistakes that we make, the more innocent people will suffer.</p>

It is great pity that the other parties did not believe that this matter was very important. I share the disappointment of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, on that and I thank him for his interesting contribution.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08061266000351"></a>Few subjects can be more important than the freedom and integrity of the individual, which is what we are talking about in this debate. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, spoke movingly in an interview on the 42-days issue about the importance of our fundamental freedoms, which we have enjoyed in this country for hundreds of years, and the danger of destroying them. Our identity and the integrity of our personal information fall into that category; we must protect them from an overintrusive, meddling and incompetent Administration. Sadly, the human rights group Privacy International rates Britain, along with China and Russia, as an &#147;endemic surveillance society&#148;.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08061266000352"></a>There are five main issues about which we should have concern. We have heard about them all during this debate. They are: first, the sheer magnitude of the information held about us; secondly, the fact that there are some people, such as children, whose information is held on databases with no justification at all, not even a proportionate response to need or threat; thirdly, the demonstrably poor security of the information&#151;as we have just heard in the Statement, the Government cannot even trust the competence of senior officers in the Cabinet Office to protect sensitive information; fourthly, the question of knowledge, consent and ability to opt out; and, fifthly, the lack of adequate powers and funding of the Information Commissioner to protect the individual from this intrusion by the state and commerce. I shall take those one by one.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08061266000353"></a>The first is the magnitude of the problem. A report in April this year from Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, said that the public need to be made  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more aware of the &#147;creeping encroachment&#148; on civil liberties created by e-mail monitoring, CCTV and computer tracking of our buying habits. One of the concerns in the report is the use of special listening devices that can be placed in lamp posts, street furniture and offices. More than 300 cameras with built-in microphones have been fitted in benefit offices and city centres. Westminster City Council has already started piloting the listening devices, but experts say that the use of these microphones raises questions about how surveillance can be used to intrude into the private lives of citizens. An official report by the commissioner has revealed that nearly 800 public bodies are between them making an average of nearly 1,000 requests a day for communications data, including phone taps, mobile phone records and e-mail or web-search histories, not to mention old-fashioned snail mail.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08061266000354"></a>Unlike in the vast majority of European democracies and the US, in the UK bugging and telephone wire taps can be set up without recourse to a judge The Home Secretary authorised more than 3,500 operations of this sort in 2005-06. A massive government database holding details of every phone call, e-mail and time spent on the internet by the public is being planned as part of the fight against crime and terrorism. In light of the various security breaches, of which I will say more, there will be concern about the ability of the Government to manage a system holding billions of records. About 57 billion text messages were sent in Britain last year, while an estimated 3 billion e-mails are sent every day.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08061266000355"></a>Brussels officials are considering controversial anti-terror plans that would collect up to 19 pieces of information on every air passenger entering or leaving the EU, which already supplies that information to the United States, as my noble friend Lady Miller mentioned. Britain has 4.2 million CCTV cameras&#151;one for every 14 people. As my noble friend Lord Roberts said, each person is caught on camera an average of 300 times every day. I, too, hope that he was behaving himself. The Royal Academy of Engineering has warned that, if a national standard for CCTV cameras were created, it would make it possible for all information gathered by these cameras to be shared and accessed by anyone with the means to do so.</p>

<a name="80612-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08061266000356"></a>Then there is the DNA database. Britain&#146;s is purported to be the largest in the world. Approximately 2.4 million people have their DNA permanently retained on the NDNAD, which is alleged to contain more than 100,000 DNA samples taken from children who have never been charged or convicted with any crime. Black and ethnic minority males are overrepresented on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08061266000357"></a>This brings me to my next point: people who should never be on these databases. The number of children on the DNA database has risen from 8,484 in 1995-96 to 179,441 in 2006-07&#151;a 21-times increase. About 160,000 young people aged between 10 and 17 were added to the National DNA Database last year after being arrested for the first time, of whom at least 81,000 were innocent. There are at least 105,000 innocent 10 to 17 year-olds on the database in total. All these young people will have their DNA profiles kept permanently on the computer. Many adults who have  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_737"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 737</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been arrested on suspicion of sometimes very minor offences, but never charged, are on the database, and some do not even realise it. The children&#146;s database ContactPoint is a matter of concern not because it is inappropriate for professionals to share information about children who need services but because of its size, universality and questions about the lack of security. It should never replace meaningful discussions between professionals and lead to complacency that the job has been done.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08061266000358"></a>I now turn to the lack of security and the consequent loss of privacy and cash by individuals, as well as the economic cost to the state. Let us consider the cash first. In 2005, identity fraud cost the economy &#163;1.5 billion, according to the Cabinet Office. The amount lost by individuals and companies to fraudsters reached &#163;535.2 million during 2007. Although the introduction of chip and PIN has reduced card fraud on the UK high street, the increase was driven by a 77 per cent jump in fraud carried out abroad using cloned versions of cards that belong to British shoppers. Card fraud abroad rose from &#163;90 million to &#163;207.6 million last year&#151;39 per cent of total losses. In the UK, card fraud rose 6 per cent last year, largely driven by &#147;card not present&#148; fraud. We have all been lured into buying something over the phone that we want.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08061266000359"></a>To many of us, the loss of our personal information and privacy matters much more than mere money. There have been numerous high-profile cases. In December 2007, the <I>Times</I> downloaded banking information belonging to 32 people, including a High Court deputy judge and a managing director. Private account numbers, PINs and security codes were offered as tasters by illegal hacking sites. The <I>Times</I> found more than 100 websites trafficking British bank details; a fraudster offering to sell 30,000 British credit card numbers for less than &#163;1 each; and a British &#147;e-passport&#148; for sale, although the Government insist that these are unhackable.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08061266000360"></a>The <I>News of the World</I> disclosed in December 2007 that it had been handed two disks mislaid by the Department for Work and Pensions containing the national insurance numbers of 18,000 claimants. In February 2008, Skipton Financial Services lost an unencrypted laptop containing personal information on 14,000 customers. We have heard from my noble friend of a number of other cases involving banks and building societies. Haringey Council files, many of which were marked &#147;Confidential&#148;, were found in a squat in February 2008. The documents included the names, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, pay slips and bank details of more than 20,000 people. Local government is not immune from this problem.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08061266000361"></a>The DVLA in Swansea in 2006 admitted that one-third of entries contained at least one error and that the proportion was getting worse. In December last year, the DVLA in Northern Ireland lost the personal details of 6,000 people and the details of 3 million theory test candidates. Southend-on-Sea Borough Council is reviewing its procedures after a laptop computer containing social service case notes on local children turned up on eBay in May. Marks &amp; Spencer has warned 26,000 of its staff that their personal data are at risk following the theft of a laptop computer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08061266000362"></a>It was revealed in December that sensitive details about adults and children were lost in 10 incidents at nine separate NHS trusts; this is particularly sensitive information. There was the loss of a CD with 160,000 children&#146;s names and addresses by a trust in east London. In Norfolk, medical papers on patients with lung, breast and colon cancer were dumped in a wheelie bin. Only last month, a laptop computer holding personal and financial information on 10,000 NHS staff was stolen from a hospital in Cornwall. Some of these organisations cannot protect their own staff, let alone their own patients.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08061266000363"></a>There have been lots of breaches of financial information. The Bank of Ireland lost four laptops containing unencrypted sensitive personal information about up to 10,000 customers. The Information Commissioner said that he had been told of 94 data breaches since November last year. The breaches included the loss of laptops, computer disks, memory sticks and paper records. Some were stolen, while others were lost in the post. The combination of the lost disks with 25 million people&#146;s financial details, the 5,000 illegal immigrants cleared to work in the security industry and the 500,000 false names on the DNA database has convinced people that putting all their most private information in the hands of the British state might not be the best of way of keeping it safe and secure.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08061266000364"></a>The database to beat all databases is the one behind the planned compulsory identity cards. The ID cards project is one of the biggest computer systems yet envisaged, far more complex than the NHS system. Apparently, iris scans, fingerprints and face-recognition software will all work perfectly and be amazingly cheap to implement, although, apparently, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, did not think so when she recently tested out the system in this building. I am not sure what it would make of my husband&#146;s false eye and the rather startling coloured contact lenses that some young people wear these days.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08061266000365"></a>The bigger the system, the greater the opportunity of failure. There is also the fact that databases pick up errors and then build data error upon error. Have noble Lords ever tried to get the spelling of their name corrected on a company&#146;s database when some illiterate has got it wrong the first time that it was input? I am sure that your Lordships will understand that it has often happened to me, with a name like Walmsley. It is very frustrating.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08061266000366"></a>It is not the ID card itself but the ID register that is the problem. What I am most frightened about is that each entry will eventually take on a legal status, even if it is wrong. I know somebody who flies around the world with a passport with his incorrect name on it. He has tried to get it corrected but the agency will not do it. Once it is fixed, it is fixed. Have noble Lords ever stood in front of anyone and told them their facts and had them say that the computer says something else? Why do they always believe the computer instead of a perfectly honest and trustworthy person who could have no possible reason to lie?</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08061266000367"></a>The really worrying thing is that the perpetrators of 80 per cent of all computer security lapses are not hackers but employees. This multiplies the dangers.

Then the ID card, far from eliminating problems, will be a one-stop shop for identity fraud and possible terrorist crime. Is it any wonder that we have no confidence in these databases? Even nine out of 10 doctors do not have confidence in the NHS system.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08061266000368"></a>What would we on these Benches like to see? First, we believe in the primacy of the right to privacy and informational autonomy; we see a close relationship between that right and the liberty of the individual. Therefore, we believe that, while every reasonable step must be taken to detect crime and deter terrorists, infringement of those rights must be necessary and proportionate and be done to the highest level of professionalism and security. We believe in the principle of consent, with people fully informed about the information held on them and with appropriate rights to opt out in many cases and to correct wrong information.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08061266000369"></a>Anyone who knows anything about human development knows how important the sense of self and personal autonomy is to the human race. The breaches to which we are subjected in this country today are of the most fundamental sort and go to the heart of a free society. I hope that today&#146;s breach will be the fatal sword in the heart of plans for the national identity database and the stimulus for the rethink of the whole sorry mess that my noble friends and I have advocated today.</p>

The most graphic incident in recent times was reported to another place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2007 when he revealed that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs had lost personal data, including bank account details, relating to families in receipt of child benefit, affecting around 25 million people in total. Although the information that the disks contained was password-protected, they were not sent by registered or recorded delivery. As your Lordships have heard this afternoon, there have been many other examples, on a somewhat more modest scale, of equally meretricious conduct on behalf of government departments.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08061266000372"></a>Those are the facts, and in my view one is led to the inevitable conclusion that these lapses flow from the low value that the Government place on the protection of personal data. That is certainly the conclusion to which the Joint Committee on Human Rights came in its report printed on 28 March this year. At paragraph 27 on page 14, the committee said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000560"></a>&#147;it would be wrong to see these errors and lapses as unfortunate &#145;one-off&#146; events. In our view they are symptomatic of the Government&#146;s persistent failure to take data protection safeguards sufficiently seriously by defining data sharing powers more tightly in primary  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_740"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 740</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation and including detailed safeguards against arbitrary or unjustified disclosure. The rapid increase in the amount of data sharing has not been accompanied by a sufficiently strong commitment to the need for safeguards. The fundamental problem is a cultural one: there is insufficient respect for the right to respect personal data in the public sector&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80612-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08061266000373"></a>The report goes on to reflect on why that is so. It places responsibility in two areas: first, in the manner of legislating; and, secondly, in the nature of the relationship between the Ministry of Justice, the various departmental ministries and the Information Commissioner. On the first reason, I understand it has been the Government&#146;s view that adequate protection is already provided to the citizen by a combination of Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights and the various relevant articles in the Data Protection Act 1998. Consequently, the Government conclude there is no need for a detailed framework of primary legislation in each particular Bill which deals with personal data retention and distribution.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08061266000374"></a>This attitude is a fundamental misreading of Article 8 which gives the citizen a general right to privacy. This right is qualified by various public interest factors such as public security, public health, public order and so on. The relationship between the general right and the particular way it is constrained will vary enormously, depending on the area of legislation and the kind of data we are talking about. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talks about data in relation to children; that raises quite different issues from, for example, DNA data. These issues should be dealt with discretely and specifically by a proper analysis by the Government of the way in which Article 8 works in each case.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08061266000375"></a>The point is again made by the JCHR report at paragraph 20 on page 12. The committee says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08061266000539"></a>&#147;We fundamentally disagree with the Government&#146;s approach to data sharing legislation, which is to include very broad enabling provisions in primary legislation and to leave the data protection safeguards to be set out later in secondary legislation. Where there is a demonstrable need to legislate to permit data sharing between public sector bodies, or between public and private sector bodies, the Government&#146;s intentions should be set out clearly in primary legislation. This would enable Parliament to scrutinise the Government&#146;s proposals more effectively and, bearing in mind that secondary legislation cannot usually be amended, would increase the opportunity for Parliament to hold the executive to account&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80612-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08061266000376"></a>The second area addressed by the committee is the relationship between the Ministry of Justice, the individual departments and the Information Commissioner. It is plain, as a result of the evidence taken by the committee, that these relationships are in a state of deep occlusion. The Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice was interviewed by the committee. It summarise, at paragraph 24 on page 13 of its report, what the honourable gentleman, Mr Wills, believes is the nature of his ministry&#146;s task:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08061266000540"></a>&#147;Mr Wills went on to explain that he was responsible for overseeing the data protection legislation and did not have a role in relation to specific breaches of data protection:</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08061266000541"></a>&#145;My responsibility is not for stopping any breaches of data protection personally, individually or even corporately within the department wherever and whenever they may occur. What this department is responsible for is the construction of a proper legislative apparatus which has proper protections in place.&#146;</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08061266000542"></a>Departments have &#145;operational independence&#146; to implement their own data protection arrangements, within the legal framework maintained by the Ministry of Justice, explained the Minister: &#145;we are not policemen in this department&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000519"></a>It is plain that, operationally, the view of the Ministry of Justice is that responsibility for these matters really lies with the individual departments.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08061266000377"></a>Mr Wills went on to explain that, more generally, apparently, individuals called human rights champions are located in every government department grade 3 level; and, later, evidence was given to the Joint Committee by an official that each department had an action plan for the delivery of in-house training to front-line staff. When representatives of the Information Commissioner were interviewed, they appeared to be totally unaware of such a network. The Joint Committee concluded at paragraph 34 that they had,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000561"></a>&#147;so far seen no evidence that the human right to champions in departments have made any impact, particularly in relation to frontline staff&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000520"></a>In view of this confused picture, the JCHR concluded that the Information Commissioner needs a much enhanced role in this area. At paragraph 39 on page 17, the JCHR makes the following observation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08061266000543"></a>&#147;We see the Information Commissioner as an important defender of human rights in relation to data protection and freedom of information. His office should be regarded as an important part of the National human rights machinery. We support proposals to enhance the Commissioner&#146;s powers and the resources at his disposal to ensure that he can discharge his responsibilities more effectively&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000521"></a>I should like the Minister to address himself to that conclusion of the committee and tell us whether he agrees with it.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08061266000378"></a>Finally, I turn to the Government&#146;s draft legislative programme outlined in May in which, among many other things, is proposed a communications data Bill. It appears that Home Office officials are considering a database that would record all e-mail and telephone communications in the United Kingdom. Can that really be true? If it is, it is a matter of deep concern to the Opposition and, I suspect, to those on the Liberal Democrat Benches. How can such a proposal have emerged, even if, on due reflection, the Government think again?</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08061266000379"></a>Why do the Government have so much difficulty with this area of individual rights, personal data rights? Is it because as a party for so long their focus has been not on the individual but on the collective&#151;and they find it exceedingly difficult to adjust to the idea of privacy and the protection of personal data? The Government have lost an enormous amount of ground in this area and, in a very traditional Victorian image, they need to pull their socks up.</p>

Little did I guess at the beginning that I would be able to debate collectivism and all its joys with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, but of course we are new Labour now, so I shall desist. I echo his remarks in thanking the noble Baroness,  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Miller, for giving us an opportunity to debate this most important subject, and pay tribute to her work on the late but, I would say, beloved Criminal Justice and Immigration Act and her formidable and persuasive powers, combined with the rather difficult deadline we were up against on the protection of personal data. I have to congratulate her on her timing for this debate which, as we have seen from the Statement, brings home to us the importance of the integrity and protection of data. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested that this Government are less concerned with the individual protection of personal data but, far from that, I very much share some of the concerns that have been raised. I in no sense seek to mitigate or underestimate the genuineness of those concerns. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, gave some very powerful examples of some of those matters, and I listened with great enjoyment to the interesting comments of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08061266000381"></a>I suppose that the heart of the debate is the question, which has sometimes been suggested, about us being in some kind of surveillance society and the fears that come from that. It is interesting that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, quoted from the JCHR report. I read the recent Home Affairs Committee report, of 9 June, with great interest; it looked at this whole question of whether we have a surveillance society. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08061266000544"></a>&#147;We reject crude characterisations of our society as a surveillance society in which all collections and means of collecting information about citizens are networked and centralised in the service of the state. Yet the potential for surveillance of citizens in public spaces and private communications has increased to the extent that ours could be described as a surveillance society unless trust in the Government's intentions in relation to data and data sharing is preserved. The Home Office in particular and Government in general must take every possible step to maintain and build on this trust&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000522"></a>It was a balanced and mature conclusion and one which, I suspect, all Members of this House agree with. That there is a sense that we are catching up with a massive social and technological advancement, which we have seen in the last few decades, is not in doubt. It is not surprising, but none of us quite knows exactly how we do that and where to get the right balance. I am clear that the Government are not in the business of storing and sharing information simply for the sake of it. There has to be a purpose.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08061266000382"></a>There is much to be gained from the proper use of the data, to which noble Lords have referred, but there has to be a balance between the positive outcome of much of that data use with proper respect for the individual&#146;s privacy. We have a sound legislative framework to preserve that balance, through the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. We will be informed by the representations made by the reviews taking place, on which I will respond in a few moments, but we have the essential foundation right.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08061266000383"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Erroll, raised some important issues, including anonymisation potential and our regulatory culture. He also raised the issue of the regulatory council&#151;the culture of uniformities, as he described it, versus flexibility. He particularly related it to the use of information. I will just say to him that the Hampton review propounded the concept of proportionate regulation. My experience is that that is  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_743"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 743</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>informing most regulatory bodies. I am going to take a punt and really champion the Health and Safety Executive&#151;not the most popular of agencies, but one which has come under considerable criticism recently for not prosecuting enough people. That is an example of a proportionate regulator that wishes to put most of its emphasis on working with people to improve their health and safety regimes, reserving prosecutions for the most serious offences. That is appropriate and proportionate regulation. I understand the comments the noble Lord made about RIPA. There are currently 795 authorised public authorities, including 474 local authorities. On the one hand, this is a very valuable tool for the investigation and prevention of all crime; on the other hand, I understand the concerns about the way some authorities are using it. Noble Lords will know that a new code of practice for the acquisition of communications data came into effect in October 2007 which gives much clearer guidance. We are committed to working with the police and other public authorities to create awareness of why and how such data should be used, which is only, of course, in a lawful way.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08061266000384"></a>A number of other databases were mentioned. On ContactPoint, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, while raising concerns about the amount of data, did not argue against the principle. The Climbi&#233; report detailed up to nine public authorities, all of which had information which, if it had been properly shared, might have saved Victoria Climbi&#233;&#146;s life. It was a very powerful message. It is, however, clearly important that the security of data within ContactPoint is maintained to a very high level. When I was in charge of the NHS IT programme, we had a lot of discussions with officials in ContactPoint to make sure that the levels of security were commensurate. On the NHS IT programme, I understand the sensitivity of personal health data held about us by a system as large as the National Health Service, but there is a huge potential in this programme. We have already seen it with X-ray data exchange. The Department of Health is criticised for the delays that have occurred but much of that delay is about needing to take people with it to assure people and give them confidence about the integrity of the data that are held.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08061266000385"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Miller, and others raised the issue of the national DNA database, but it has had a very positive, powerful impact on the number of crimes detected. The courts have recognised that the retention of samples and DNA profiles involves a triangulation of interests. The privacy of those subject to DNA data is important but also the purpose of criminal law to permit everyone to go about their daily lives without fear of harm to person or property. Getting the balance right is vital.</p>

<a name="80612-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08061266000386"></a>The issue of the national identity scheme has been raised. We could have many hours&#146; debate on that. The Identity Card Act 2006 has very strong provisions about unauthorised disclosure. Maintaining confidence in the integrity of the process, the efficiency and the protection of data will be very important to any successful implementation. There are concerns about how much closed circuit TV is used but again, where it is used efficiently and the right systems are in place, it has proven to be hugely important in the investigation of serious crimes. Again, getting the balance right is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08061266000387"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, for giving me some advance warning that he would be raising the issue of identity and passport services. I understand his point about remote communities and video-linked offices and the question that arises about taking fingerprints. I have not been able to get all the information that the noble Lord would require, so I wonder if I could write to him.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08061266000388"></a>On the national staff dismissal register, the point is that the Home Office did provide funding to the organisation, but that was related to setting up crime/business partnerships. However, the department was not consulted about setting up the staff dismissal register and will not be involved in any way in its operation. It is very much for the Action Against Business Group to ensure that its register complies with all relevant legislation. Further, I shall draw the question of the logo to the attention of the Home Office and get back to the noble Lord when I have a response.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08061266000389"></a>I turn to the question of the illegal trade in people&#146;s bank account details. Of course we are concerned about this issue and that is why we brought forward amendments to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act. We remain keen to ensure everything is done to inhibit the practice.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08061266000390"></a>Noble Lords have paid tribute to the Information Commissioner because the regulatory system we have in place is highly dependent on the commissioner, to whom I pay tribute for his work. He also takes a proportionate approach to regulation, but I understand that in 2007-08 the number of cases received by the commissioner&#146;s office was 25,670. Sixty per cent of those cases were resolved within 30 calendar days and 85 per cent in 90 days. On resources, we are considering the matter and a review is being conducted by the commissioner which I will come on to in a moment. It reflects the further question put to me about extending the commissioner&#146;s powers.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08061266000391"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was right to draw attention to lapses, but those lapses have not occurred because the culture of the Government puts a low premium on the protection of the individual; it is not that we are using data as a throwback to our belief in the benefits of democratic centralism, if I may use that term. We have been very concerned about the lapses, and that is why the reviews have been set up. On the relationship between my department and other departments, it is right that the responsibility should lie with individual departments, but with the Ministry of Justice in a role as a kind of overseer and co-ordinator. I am not sure how far he was going with his argument, but the potential for a Minister in one department almost taking responsibility for the actions of another is something we would seek to avoid. We are not seeking to avoid responsibility, but it is important that individual government departments should take their responsibilities seriously. On the question of the shape of legislation, even if we were to pursue the course suggested by the noble Lord in relation to specific and separate pieces of legislation, it would still come  down to the effectiveness of the machine itself to ensure that whatever was in the legislation was policed effectively.</p>

These are not just my own views, but also those of the committee. The particular value of setting out in detail in primary legislation the proper balance between the general principle of privacy and those public interest factors which might in one way or another dilute it is that the individuals in each department would be subject to those detailed rules in a way that they are not at the moment. That would solve in part the problem to which the Minister rightly refers: you cannot have the Minister of Justice interfering every five minutes into the affairs of another fiefdom. But if the officials in each department are properly informed by the legislation under which they are operating, you would not need to have interference of that sort by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

My department is working with the Information Commissioner at the moment on how that is going to be undertaken.

Without that provision, the working capacity of the Court of Appeal would be reduced for the period of the appointment of any existing Lord Justice of Appeal to the chair of the commission as that post is a full-time appointment.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08061266000406"></a>On first reading, the order appears to be relatively simple and straightforward, but it is important that I explain in more detail the background as to how this order came to be necessary, and something about the processes for appointing the chairman of the Law Commission and for the appointment of judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08061266000407"></a>Before I do that, I need to bring to your Lordships&#146; attention a small technical detail. There has been an inadvertent error in the Explanatory Memorandum to the order which means that it does not accurately describe the full policy intention. Although this has no effect on the drafting of the order, I apologise for this oversight. A replacement memorandum has been laid before Parliament and copies are available in the Printed Paper Office. Paragraph 7.5 of the original memorandum set out that, subject to selection by the panel constituted under the Constitutional Reform Act, the chairman of the Law Commission should be made a judge of the Court of Appeal on leaving the Law Commission. In fact, the intention is that it should be possible for the chair also to be a judge of the Court of Appeal at the same time as taking up the Law Commission post, whether by simultaneous appointment or by an existing Appeal Court judge taking the post. Your Lordships will also notice that slight clarification has been made to paragraphs 7.1 and 7.4.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08061266000408"></a>As your Lordships will know, the Law Commission is the statutory independent body created by the Law Commissions Act 1965 to keep the law under review and recommend reform when needed. It fulfils many functions with the key aims of ensuring that the law is as fair, modern, simple and cost effective as possible. The Law Commission also carries out research and consultation, making systematic recommendations for consideration by Parliament, including codifying the law, eliminating anomalies, repealing obsolete and unnecessary enactments and reducing the number of separate statutes. The commission&#146;s recommendations for law reform can shape the legal rights, duties and liabilities of large numbers of people, and large areas of the law have been renewed as a result of its  continuing work.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08061266000409"></a>The Law Commission has been recognised by successive Governments as making a valuable contribution within our legal system, and it plays a fundamental part in our constitutional arrangements. There are five commissioners, all of whom work full time at the commission. The chairman is a senior judge appointed to the commission for up to three years. The other four commissioners are experienced judges, barristers, solicitors or teachers of law. The Lord Chancellor appoints them for up to five years, although their appointments may be extended.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08061266000410"></a>Ever since the creation of the Law Commission, because of the demands of the job, its chairman has always been appointed from the ranks of the senior  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_748"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>judiciary. Indeed, Section 1 of the Act provides that the chair must be a judge of the High Court or of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Having a senior member of the judiciary as the head of the commission acts as both a guarantee of its independence and a pledge of the Government&#146;s continued desire for it to carry out its statutory duty. It is a guarantee, because the chairman is a member of the judiciary who cannot be said to be beholden to the Government in any way and who can deal with members of the Government without concern.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08061266000411"></a>As your Lordships will see, the chairmanship is an extremely important and demanding role. As the commission&#146;s principal public face, the chairman promotes its role and its work, leading the commissioners and representing their views to Ministers and others with a key interest in the law and law reform. The chairman also leads on law reform projects and has special responsibility for overseeing the commission&#146;s work on consolidation and statute law revision.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08061266000412"></a>During the passage of the 1965 Act, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Gardiner, said that in his opinion the chairman should be,</p>
<ul><a name="08061266000562"></a>&#147;not only a High Court judge but the High Court judge who, of all the High Court judges ... the Commission would be most fortunate to have&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/4/65; col. 426.]</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000523"></a>I am sure your Lordships will agree that the chair of the commission needs to be seen to be someone who has the status and authority to command the respect and confidence of the Government and the judiciary. The commission&#146;s work needs to carry the confidence of Parliament if the Bills that it drafts are to pass into law.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08061266000413"></a>Having a Court of Appeal judge&#151;a judge of the highest calibre&#151;as the chair of the commission will help to ensure that that confidence is maintained. Indeed, it is in the public interest that the most able senior judges fill such posts. That is truer now than ever before, in view of the recently proposed significant structural reforms to improve the effectiveness of the commission and its relations with Parliament and the Executive.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08061266000414"></a>I turn now to the issue of appointing Court of Appeal judges. It is precisely this issue that makes the order such a necessary and sensible, although precautionary, measure. Before the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 came into force in April 2006, Lords Justices of Appeal&#151;to give them their proper title&#151;were appointed by Her Majesty the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, who received advice from the Lord Chancellor. Before submitting his advice, the Lord Chancellor consulted the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and the other most senior judges. That made it possible for a High Court judge, serving as chairman of the Law Commission, to be appointed to the Court of Appeal on completion of their term of office at the commission.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08061266000415"></a>Following the implementation of the Constitutional Reform Act, the Queen still appoints Court of Appeal judges on the recommendation of the Prime Minister following advice from the Lord Chancellor. But the selection process is now the responsibility of the independent Judicial Appointments Commission. As a consequence of the newer, clearer and more accountable  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_749"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 749</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appointments process, there can be no absolute guarantee of simultaneous appointment. However, the order is an essential step in ensuring that the most experienced and suitable judges can continue to be appointed as chairman of the Law Commission, without adversely affecting the working capacity of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08061266000416"></a>It is in the interests of the proper and efficient functioning of the judiciary that the most able senior judges are interested in taking the chair of the Law Commission. Such a position provides a unique opportunity for the senior judiciary to acquire administrative and management experience, and familiarity with the workings of Parliament and the Executive. It is even more important that the most able judges should acquire those things, as the 2005 constitutional reforms transferred responsibility for management of the judiciary to the most senior judges. In future, having prior management experience will be even more important for them.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08061266000417"></a>The chairmanship of the Law Commission enables senior judges to gain a broader range of legal knowledge than they might otherwise achieve across a diverse range of subject areas, informed by comparative law, empirical research and impact assessments. For that reason and those that I have already mentioned, I commend this order to your Lordships. I beg to move.</p>

I welcome him to Ministry of Justice debates. I think that it is his first outing in this field. He has come in very honourably after his noble friend&#151;his noble boss, if I may put it that way&#151;Lord Hunt of Kings Heath responded today both to Questions and to two debates. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, deserves some time off. We wish him well wherever he has gone. I think he said that he was going to Birmingham&#151;perhaps he is going to Henley to help canvass for the Labour Party in the by-election there. I do not know, but we will see in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08061266000420"></a>The Minister introduced the order and made quite clear its purpose, which is to increase the number of Court of Appeal judges by one and, as I understand it, because the cost implications are relatively small, to reduce the number of High Court judges by one. Will he confirm that that is correct? If that is the case, the cost implications are marginal because it is a question just of the difference in salary between the two.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08061266000421"></a>Will he then offer us an assurance that the Lord Chief Justice, or whoever the relevant person is, is perfectly content that there should be one less High Court judge, that the High Court will be able to cope and that there will not be further delays in whichever division of the High Court those judges are removed from?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08061266000422"></a>Will he comment also on why all this is necessary? I suspect that the reason is the changes that the Government introduced as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Commission. Before that, as is made  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear in the Explanatory Memorandum, there was the unwritten convention that whoever was chairing the commission was appointed to the Court of Appeal and others were High Court or equivalent. As judges are now appointed by one method and those chairing the commission by another, the unwritten convention no longer works as it should. It seems, therefore, that the unwritten convention has almost to be codified in a way that strikes one as not particularly necessary.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08061266000423"></a>Will the Minister comment also on what is happening in regard to the appointment of judges? We heard rumours outside that there are considerable delays in appointments, that not enough of those who are suitably qualified are coming forward, that the whole process is much slower and a backlog is building up, and that there may therefore be a shortage of judges. I have no doubt that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is pleased about that and that savings are being made by the Government, but it does not help in the administration of justice.</p>

<a name="80612-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08061266000424"></a>I thank the Minister for his courtesy in ringing me up to tell me that there had been a mistake in the Explanatory Memorandum. I assured him that it was not necessary for him to have a copy sent up to my office and said that I would pick one up from the Printed Paper Office. As always, my incompetence is such that I picked up the Explanatory Memorandum for the Armed Forces (Alignment of Service Discipline Acts) Order. That will no doubt not matter, because the Minister has explained in detail the changes that should be made to paragraph 7.5, for which I am very grateful.</p>

Over the 43 years since then, the Law Commission has done a great deal of extremely useful work and has entirely justified its creation. Of course, during that time it has had long-running difficulties over obtaining implementation of its recommendations, even after they have been accepted in principle by the Government, because of the difficulty of getting parliamentary time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08061266000426"></a>I say in passing, although this is not directly relevant to the order, that I have very greatly appreciated the enormous effort that the noble Baroness the Lord President has put into designing a fast-track procedure that, it is hoped, will enable more uncontroversial Law Commission Bills to pass through your Lordships&#146; House and through the other place as well. So far as concerns your Lordships&#146; House, we approved the proposals of the noble Baroness two months ago in April, when we approved the recommendation from the Procedure Committee on trialling the new procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08061266000428"></a>The order is another step towards increasing the effectiveness of the Law Commission. The chair of the Law Commission is required by law to be a judge  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_751"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>either of the High Court or of the Court of Appeal. The result has been that a long succession of distinguished judges have chaired the Law Commission, starting with Lord Scarman&#151;then Sir Leslie Scarman&#151;who was the first commissioner, down to the present chair of the Law Commission, Sir Terence Etherton, and including one woman chair, who is now Lady Justice Arden.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08061266000429"></a>It has been a convention that the chair is an experienced High Court judge who is appointed to be a Lord Justice of Appeal soon after finishing his or her term of office as chair. No doubt this prospect plays some part in persuading high-quality High Court judges to accept the office of chair of the Law Commission. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, explained that the Constitutional Reform Act procedure for making appointments to the Court of Appeal does not fit in with this convention. We on these Benches agree that in future it should be the practice, though not a legal requirement, that the chair of the council should be someone who, at the time of appointment, already holds the office of Lord Justice of Appeal. I am interested in the noble Lord&#146;s reference to the usefulness of giving training in administration to a senior judge through his or her chairmanship of the Law Commission. It suggests that the appointment as chair of the Law Commission might be a step towards holding the office of Lord Chief Justice, which of course is now very much an administrative appointment. However, other administrative roles are played by some of the judges in the High Court and the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08061266000430"></a>It has certainly been regarded in the legal profession for many years that the Court of Appeal is the most demanding level of the judiciary in terms of workload and stress. The current rules provide for 37 places. It is clear&#151;and I quite understand why&#151;that none of those can be spared to become the chair of the Law Commission. Therefore, it is necessary and desirable to increase the number of authorised places for a Lord Justice of Appeal by one. I also understand that the effect of that will not increase the number of High Court judges sitting as such but that the place left open by the move of the chair of the Law Commission to the higher level will not be replaced, although I understand that there is no reason, and therefore no necessity, to reduce the number authorised by the present rules. We on these Benches are happy to support the order.</p>

He asked whether the total number of judges would increase. The answer is no. The Lord Chief Justice has agreed with the Lord Chancellor that the extra seat on the Court of Appeal will be offset by a seat being left vacant in the High Court. The costs of the changes are around &#163;23,000 per annum&#151;the difference between Court of Appeal and High Court salaries with longer-term pension implications. He asked whether that meant there would be enough members of the High Court with all the implications for workload. My own assessment of my brief is that, since the chairman has to be a High Court judge, it all nets to zero, but I will write to the noble Lord if that supposition is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08061266000432"></a>The system has worked for 40 years, so why do we have to change it now? The premise of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was that it was no longer acceptable for the Executive to be in charge of selection and appointment to the judiciary. The independence of the judiciary is paramount if the rule of law is to be upheld. The change has resulted entirely as a consequence of the desire for increased transparency and accountability in judicial appointments, which Parliament clearly supported. Yes, there was an unwritten convention. Was that good enough? No; we need this as a necessary condition to allow the simultaneous holding of both jobs and to maintain the capacity of the Courts of Appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08061266000433"></a>Commenting on how the JAC is doing, it is still in its early days and working hard to improve the speed of the process.

He is quite right about the wider implications of the new procedure that has been agreed. We share with him the view that the slow implementation of Law Commission reports is a bad thing. The new approved process recommending the creation of new House of Lords procedure for appropriate or uncontroversial Law Commission recommendations will address that. The noble Lord is right to suggest that the old system seemed, to any layman, to be a way of persuading a judge to take on this onerous task. I would not say that that was the case. We are turning the convention into a simultaneous appointment. That process, in itself, will take some getting right. I made the point that justices will need more administrative experience and skills, but I could not possibly comment on whether that is a secure route to becoming Lord Chief Justice. I commend the order to the House.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_753"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 753</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>maximum of five years, subject to an annual Order in Council in each of the intervening years. The continuation order that we are considering today is such an order. It is a routine item of business, but it is vital because it will ensure that the Armed Forces Act 2006 and the three service discipline Acts will remain in force for a further 12 months. When the 2006 Act was agreed by Parliament, it was expected that it would replace the three service discipline Acts. I can confirm that it remains our intention to repeal the service discipline Acts, but we need them to continue in force until the 2006 Act is fully in operation. That is why they are included in the order.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08061266000439"></a>I will give a short update on progress in implementing the 2006 Act. As I reported during the corresponding debate last year, officials are engaged in delivering the significant amount of work that will be needed to deliver the new single system of service law for our Armed Forces. Foremost among this work is the large amount of secondary legislation that will add much of the necessary detail to the provisions of the 2006 Act. Altogether, we now expect to produce around 80 statutory instruments, directly or indirectly, as a result of the 2006 Act. This is more than the 65 that we anticipated last year, and is due to the need for consequential changes to be made through separate statutory instruments, rather than through a large single order in the way that we had originally envisaged. The figure also allows for commencement orders, though these are not subject to parliamentary procedure.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08061266000440"></a>So far, we have laid about a dozen of the statutory instruments that we expect to produce. Many more are ready, apart from the need to add their transitional provisions. These transitional provisions will ensure that there is a working bridge between the old legal system and the new one. The overall transitionals regime will be complex, because of the extent of the changes made by the 2006 Act. The transitional provisions specific to particular statutory instruments will relate to a main transitionals order.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08061266000441"></a>We propose to lay this main transitionals order during the summer. It will be subject to negative resolution. Once it has been laid, the way will be clear for us to lay the other statutory instruments that have a transitional element to them. Since it is not possible to introduce some parts of the new service disciplinary system in advance of the other parts, we intend that all the statutory instruments should take effect together. Our target date for this is January next year.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08061266000442"></a>The majority of the statutory instruments are subject to negative resolution, so we propose to lay some during the summer months&#151;the orders will still come into effect in January 2009&#151;rather than lay them in much greater numbers in the autumn. We recognise that it would not help the House if they were all to be laid at the same time, so officials have looked to assemble statutory instruments in groups and lay them in relevant batches. We have done this in discussion with officials of the relevant parliamentary committees. By doing this, our aim has been to present the information in a way that assists parliamentary scrutiny and avoids the system being overloaded. The thinking here is that we give Parliament as much time as possible in which to consider the orders before they take effect. There  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_754"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 754</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can be no suggestion of them being quietly laid during the Recess and coming into force without proper time for parliamentary consideration. Officials have therefore been in touch with relevant committee staff to outline our approach. Although we make it clear that the programme is still subject to significant change, our efforts to plan and co-ordinate the work have so far been given a warm welcome.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08061266000443"></a>There is a great deal to be done but we hope that it should be possible to have everything in place in time to meet the January 2009 deadline. This will then become the point at which the Armed Forces will move from the three separate systems in place at present to the single up-to-date system that will replace them. Among other things, this change to a single system will have a bearing on service police investigations, summary hearings by commanding officers, prosecutions and court martial trials. The statutory instruments are just part of the picture. The services will also need to have manuals, guidance, instructions and training for the wide range of personnel and organisations involved in the service justice system. Work is therefore going on to provide everything the services will need to ensure that they will be able to change to the new system with the minimum of disruption.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08061266000444"></a>There are two other orders before us. The first amends various sections of the service discipline Acts in order to align them more closely with the 2006 Act. The changes are likely to help ease the transition to the new system if they are made before the main changes. They also introduce some safeguards which are in the new Act. This is being done now to ensure greater coherence between the legislation as it stands and the legislation as it will be when the 2006 Act comes into force. The order also ensures that some areas of incompatibility between the two systems are removed and introduces a number of safeguards to the current system.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08061266000445"></a>One measure in the order aligns the service discipline Acts with new provisions in the Armed Forces Act 2006 in relation to powers of arrest. Changes made by the order will allow service policemen to arrest service personnel of all ranks without the need to seek prior approval and to arrest a person whom they reasonably suspect of being about to commit a service offence. At present, the service police need to have prior approval if they wish to arrest somebody above the rank of warrant officer and they can make an arrest only while an offence is being committed or afterwards. These are therefore important changes for the service police, which provide them with greater powers than they have at present. The new powers are, however, broadly similar to those enjoyed by the civil police.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08061266000446"></a>The order also removes the ability of a judicial officer to authorise post-charge custody where the accused has previously deserted or gone absent without leave after being charged with an offence and released from custody. Authorising custody for this reason alone cannot be justified merely because the accused has previously absconded and the provision is therefore not relied on by judicial officers. The amendment clarifies the legal position.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08061266000447"></a>Under the Service Discipline Acts, the prosecuting authorities can require an accused person&#146;s commanding officer to consider a charge other than the charge on  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_755"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 755</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which the accused originally elected to be tried by court martial. This could create a disincentive to the accused electing trial by court martial and could therefore be subject to challenge. The amendments in the order allow the prosecuting authorities to refer a charge back to the commanding officer other than that on which the accused elected, but this may not be done without the consent of the accused. The one exception to this would be if the charge referred were to be one which the commanding officer could have heard if the accused had not elected trial by court martial.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08061266000448"></a>The order also removes the ability of the reviewing authorities to activate suspended sentences. This will align the Service Discipline Acts more closely with the provisions of the Armed Forces Act 2006, ensuring that only a court can activate a suspended sentence. The one exception to this rule is in relation to the Royal Navy where, until the Armed Forces Act 2006 comes into force, RN commanding officers will still be able to activate a suspended sentence of detention passed by a court martial. The order also provides for appeals against the activation of suspended sentences.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08061266000449"></a>Finally, the order repeals all powers of the reviewing authority to postpone the date on which a sentence is to take effect. The exercise of this power by a reviewing authority is not compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights, and the court martial will not have such a power under the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08061266000450"></a>I turn now to the third and final order. Section 334 of the 2006 Act and the regulations which have been made under that section allow members of the Armed Forces to make complaints about matters relating to their service. The Working Time Regulations 1998, the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000, the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 provide that a complaint cannot be presented by a member of the Armed Forces to an employment tribunal established under any of those regulations unless a complaint under service complaint procedures has been made about the same matter and not withdrawn. Quite simply, the order that we are considering today amends each of these regulations so that they correctly refer to the service complaints system as amended by the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08061266000451"></a>I should say a word about ECHR issues. Her Majesty&#146;s Government have given an undertaking that Ministers moving instruments subject to the affirmative procedure will tell the House whether they are satisfied that the legislation is compatible with the rights provided in the European Convention on Human Rights. The first order that we are considering is a brief document that raises convention issues only in that it maintains in force three Acts that, as they have been amended over the years, reflect convention rights. As for the 2006 Act, we consider that its provisions are compatible with convention rights. The second order will help to preserve convention rights and the third order has no bearing on them at all.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08061266000452"></a>In conclusion, I hope that it is helpful to have a brief update on the progress towards full implementation of the legislation. We will look forward to further

I thank the noble Baroness for presenting these orders and, through her, I also thank those responsible for drafting the Explanatory Memoranda, a duty performed with the utmost clarity. The continuation order is much the shortest of the documents before us and is altogether the most important. It serves to remind us and the Government that the existence of the Armed Forces is not simply a matter of executive decision but also a matter requiring continuing parliamentary consent. This should also serve to remind us&#151;and again, remind the Government&#151;that Parliament, having provided the existence of disciplined Armed Forces, also has duties with regard to their pay and conditions, their right equipment and their deployment, as is being increasingly recognised. Where the Government fall short of their duties in any of these matters, they must accept criticisms from within the Armed Forces themselves and from all parts of this House. This is not a party-political matter. It is a parliamentary matter. We and the Armed Forces themselves are entitled to expect that shortcomings will be recognised and will be remedied.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08061266000455"></a>The stated object of the service complaints order is so that the service authorities will be put on notice of an incipient complaint by a serviceman or woman to civil jurisdiction. This is to be achieved by initiating a service complaint first. Both I and my honourable friends in another place expressed our concern generally at the intermingling of service law and civilian law. It was one of the deliberate influences on the formulation of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This order seems to me to exemplify just such a confusion. I hope the Minister will be able in her reply to persuade me otherwise.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08061266000456"></a>Finally, I turn to the much longer and altogether more complex order, the Alignment of Service Discipline Acts Order, designed to amend the three single service Acts until the omnibus Armed Forces Act comes fully into effect. This, we are told, should be in January next year, some six or seven months from now. Thus, it is very much an interim measure. Noble Lords who have looked at the order will have observed that it comprises 14 pages of closely printed insertions and deletions and a three-page schedule of transitional provisions. It prompts me to ask the Minister how these changes will be promulgated. Will the Acts be reprinted? If not, how will those affected&#151;to say nothing of those advising or representing them&#151;be able to ascertain clearly what the law is in relation to these matters at this particular juncture?</p>

On these Benches we also support the thrust of these orders, but there are a small number of detailed questions which I would like the noble Baroness to answer. I appreciate that one or two may be of a certain technical nature. Therefore, if she would prefer to write to me I would totally understand. First, on the subject of the continuation order itself, what progress has been made on producing some form of loose-leaf volume which would contain all these separate Acts and orders for the use of practitioners both inside and outside the Services and for the judge advocates?</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08061266000458"></a>I have two questions on the Armed Forces (Service Complaints) (Consequential Amendments) Order. First, what happens if, on a complaint being made, a complainant is dissatisfied with the redress offered? I refer to where a complaint has been accepted by the defence counsel. Is the individual then entitled to make his complaint to an employment tribunal? Secondly, linked to that question, what is the effect on the tribunal proceedings of a decision made by the defence counsel? Do the employment tribunal proceedings start afresh or will the findings of the defence counsel be in evidence before it? In other words, to what extent is the employment tribunal influenced by the findings of the service authorities, or do they hear the case de novo?</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08061266000459"></a>On the Armed Forces (Alignment of Service Discipline Acts) Order, I am glad to see that there is an attempt to bring uniformity of powers and procedures to the three services. That makes it even more questionable why the Government resisted the Liberal Democrat attempts to allow courts martial to be heard by a mixed panel of all three services during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08061266000460"></a>When we had this debate last year, my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford spoke from these Benches. I should like to quote a paragraph from what he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08061266000545"></a>&#147;The noble Lord, Lord Astor, referred to the acquittals that have taken place. They have occurred not because of any weaknesses in the military justice system but, in my view&#151;I merely give my opinion and have declared my interest&#151;because of a lack of resources in the investigation phase and mistakes made at that point which led to the prosecutions that did not succeed. However, if the Government are prepared to provide the investigatory branch of the Armed Forces with full and proper resources and training so that they are on an equal footing with the investigation forces in the United Kingdom&#151;if they are capable of doing the same sort of thing forensically and so on&#151;I have no doubt that the procedures will be fair for everyone&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/6/07, col. 301.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061266000524"></a>The question to the noble Baroness that follows from that is: has there, during the past 12 months, been any increase in the resources made available to the prosecuting authorities?</p>

<a name="80612-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08061266000461"></a>Finally, what is the proportion of courts martial between the three services? Does any difference indicate a differentiation of resources? Having put those specific points to the Minister, I confirm that we are happy to support the orders.</p>

They are, as has been pointed out, quite detailed. Some of the points go very wide and we may return to them on other occasions.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08061266000463"></a>First, I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, about those responsible for drafting the Explanatory Memorandum. It is no mean task to explain these regulations in anything like simple English. When I was in another place, I made changes to the Explanatory Memorandum system that came before Parliament because those documents used to be as technical as the Bills. I do not underestimate the challenge that often faces those responsible for translating legalese into language that we can understand, and therefore I welcome the reminder of that work.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08061266000464"></a>With regard to the points that the noble Lord, Lord Astor, made about the continuation order, we absolutely accept that Parliament has a role. In my opening remarks, I tried to outline the degree to which we had attempted to involve Parliament and committees such as the House of Commons Select Committee and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments to ensure that there was sufficient consultation about the way in which we went about getting authority and approval for these very complex issues.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08061266000465"></a>On the comments about our duty of care&#151;the issues of pay and conditions, equipment and deployment&#151;all in the Ministry of Defence accept those responsibilities directly. We talk about them on many occasions. On accepting responsibility, noble Lords will be aware that in another place today my right honourable friend Bob Ainsworth, Minister for the Armed Forces, made in his Statement on &#147;Tireless&#148; a direct acknowledgement that the Ministry of Defence had been at fault. He issued an apology. We are not slow to accept responsibility where mistakes are made, even though our first priority should be to avoid incidents that require apology. We need to maintain our systems as highly as possible.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08061266000466"></a>On service complaints procedure and worries about the intermingling of service law and civilian law, I can reassure the noble Lord that a great deal of care has been taken on this issue. This is one reason why all these SIs are so complex and there are so many of them. We have to make sure when it comes to complaints that those in the Armed Forces have the right balance of rights and responsibilities, just as anybody would in a civil court. There are many parallels. The safeguards in the system should be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08061266000467"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Astor and Lord Lee, raised similar points about the need to make sure that everybody is informed about the complex changes taking place. At the end of the day the process will be simplified because we will have some more common systems, but it is right to say that we will have to be careful to ensure that people are aware of the changes that take place. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we will have written guidance. We will be drawing information together. As well as a new manual of service law, we will have to have extra training for those who are involved so that they are completely aware of what the new system entails. We are aware of that.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08061266000468"></a>I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned service complaints and welcomed the move that we are making from three strands to one single approach. That should work in the end. He referred to complainants going to an employment tribunal where their issue is   


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_759"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column 759</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one of discrimination, equal pay or something of that nature. There will be an opportunity to go to an employment tribunal in those cases. Other issues can go to the courts only by way of judicial review&#151;for example, if relevant evidence has been ignored. It is important to make that distinction at this stage.</p>

<a name="80612-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08061266000469"></a>On resources, the noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned comments from last year. I have not been aware of any problems with resources from the prosecuting authorities. I have not got the figures on the balance of courts martial between different services, but going down the path of courts martial is not something that people do lightly. All the services will take a lot of factors into account before anybody goes down that route. Those involved in both complaints and discipline take their responsibilities seriously. The new regulations that we are introducing are based on being fair to everybody. We are making sure that we have regulations that are easily understood, comprehensible and fair. I accept that we still have some work to do to make sure that everybody realises that, but I am grateful for the general welcome for the direction in which we are going.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061291000345"></a>The Secretary of State shall make an annual report to Parliament giving an assessment of the appropriate volume of onshore gas storage to ensure long-term energy security and to set out the progress that has been made towards reaching that target.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am happy to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Davies, to the arena. I understand that he was involved in the Energy Bill the previous time round and therefore brings great experience to our discussion today and throughout the days that we are without the noble Lord, Lord Jones, who is not well. We wish him well and hope to see him soon but, for the mean time, it is very nice to have such a heavyweight team to give in to all our amendments today.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000010"></a>Much of the Second Reading was spent discussing many crucial clauses that are not in the Bill. We seek to address that at the appropriate time. Meanwhile, we must not lose necessary additions or take our eye off what is in the Bill. What is in the Bill is, by and large, welcome and essential. We assure noble Lords that we do not intend to prevent the Bill proceeding through this House in a timely fashion. In order for it to do so we hope that noble Lords will join their open-minded scrutiny efforts with those of Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition to improve what is in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000011"></a>No single piece of legislation explicitly provides a framework for offshore gas supplies. We welcome an attempt by the Government to redress this issue. Gas storage is of crucial importance and was not debated comprehensively enough in another place. The UK is the third largest consumer of gas behind the United States and Russia. Recently we have become a net importer of gas and what we import seems likely to constitute half our supply by 2010. This has a substantial impact on our security of supply. As our dependence on foreign supply increases, so does our inability to meet our own demand. With any interruption to the flow in the interconnector, combined with a spike in demand in, say, a particularly cold winter, there is an increasing risk that there will be interruptions in supply. Gas storage is the obvious way to combat this problem.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000012"></a>Thus, it is welcome that the Bill provides for it. Yet what remains unclear is precisely how much is necessary. This amendment does what it says on the tin. It would place a duty on the Secretary of State annually to assess how much gas will need to be stored in order to  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC250"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC250</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>avert such interruptions and make certain that we can provide long-term energy security. This is as self-explanatory as it is necessary. After assessing the appropriate need for storage, this report would outline what is being done to meet the appropriate volume or storage and what still needs to be done to ensure that we have energy security.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000013"></a>The amendment hits right at the heart of what many of the Bill&#146;s provisions are trying to address: the future of the United Kingdom&#146;s energy supply. If we are to understand how we can keep Britain warm and illuminated, we must start with an assessment of the required effort. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000014"></a><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061291000386"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> I support the spirit of the amendment. I also echo the noble Baroness&#146;s words about the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham. I wish him a speedy recovery so that he can rejoin the proceedings at a later stage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000015"></a>The report is a good idea, particularly given the present situation with gas storage. Although the country&#146;s ability to store gas and other methods such as those at Milford Haven for the storage of LNG are being increased and we have the storage capacity, it is becoming more apparent that we are not getting the gas to fill it. We talked about the interconnector from Norway. There is a real issue about why the Norwegians are not sending us gas and it is going to the Continent for the moment. I tried to find out why gas is being moved from one part of the Europe to another, but it is very difficult to get information because of contractual law.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000016"></a>Even though we have the capacity to bring gas into the country and are building our storage in this country, whether we actually have the reserves is a major problem. A big problem at the moment is the fact that the cost of gas is rising so dramatically. By the winter, this will have fed through to consumers with the requisite pain and suffering, especially for those who are suffering from fuel poverty at the moment, mainly due to the inability to store gas and therefore being dictated to by the spot price of gas on the market&#151;one of the main reasons why we suffered so badly a year and a half ago. A report of this nature would not solve that, but it would help to bring before the House some of the reasoning behind the problems that are being solved in the gas market. There is always the cry that the market will sort them out, but even though we have dealt with some of the physical problems associated with gas storage, we will still have to face the very real problem of not being able to get the gas in the first place and the associated price.</p>

The amendment gives us an opportunity to reflect a little on some of the problems of increasing the capacity for gas storage. One is very obviously the planning system. No doubt we will be told that this is being addressed in the new Planning Bill. Rather surprisingly, here we are in the middle of June but the Bill has not reached this House yet. Apparently there are delays in another place. I should make it clear, as I have to my colleagues, that something  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC251"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>along the lines of the Infrastructure Planning Commission is necessary so that Ministers can identify gas storage as a priority, as successive Ministers have already done, that can be fully taken into account in the planning system.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000018"></a>I had experience recently of trying to keep abreast of two onshore gas storage planning applications. I was horrified by the delays, most of which occurred in the local authority and the Department for Communities and Local Government, before a decision could be taken. The second thing that distressed me about both applications was that very clear statements on the priority that should be given to gas storage projects had been made by Alistair Darling when he held the post in the then DTI and since then by Malcolm Wicks. Yet, in both cases, the reference to the priority was only one sentence in the 12-page decision by the Secretary of State at the DCLG. One hopes that that will be changed as a result of the planning legislation, because what is the point of having a government priority for vital infrastructure projects of this sort if when it comes to the planning system no one seems to pay a great deal of attention to it? That is my first point.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000019"></a>Secondly, I draw attention to the charts about gas storage in the winter consultation report, which was published two days ago by the National Grid. It has charts showing the gas storage withdrawals, the amounts from gas storage for 2007-08 and no doubt other noble Lords will have a chance to look at the charts to see what extraordinary peaks there were. That is the purpose of having storage: to be able to deal with peaks of demand that cannot be met by current supply. In the six months from October 2007 to March 2008 there were at least four or five major peaks, each covering a period of a few days when the storage was substantially drawn down, which is what it is for.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000020"></a>As for what it consists of now and the space that is available, by far the biggest storage site is the Rough gas field, which has a capacity of 3.3 thousand million cubic metres of gas. I think that that is right. The others are all very much smaller. There are the medium-range ones at 771 million cubic metres and the LNG storage at about a third of that. Withdrawal rates from all categories are approximately the same, so the difference is that the Rough gas storage provides one with long-term storage, which is extremely valuable, and at the moment the others are short or possibly medium-term storage. A later chart, table B3, shows what the consultation paper suggests may be the capacity and deliverability levels. Again, Rough is by far the biggest, and the deliverability of millions of cubic metres a day, from LNG, from medium-range storage and from Rough are all approximately the same&#151;</p>

I am listening with interest to what he is telling us. Does he envisage the government report that is advocated in the amendment having any more information in it than the report from which he is copiously quoting at present?</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC252"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000023"></a>The report shows the huge importance of storage, of which the Government have never made any secret. They want more storage. The question&#151;here I might satisfy the noble Lord&#151;is what the obstacles are to getting more storage. I have already referred to the planning system, and I will not say any more about that. There is the question of the appropriate size of storage. As I said, most onshore storage is only for short and medium-term duration, for the most part in salt caverns. There is in total about 1 billion cubic metres of gas storage capacity&#151;which amounts to only about one-third of the storage at the Rough gas field&#151;installed and operating at present. It is just about sufficient to meet the peak demand which we have at the moment, and it is very necessary that it should be there. Everyone including Ministers&#151;no doubt the Minister will confirm this in his reply&#151;agrees that there is a great need to encourage more offshore long-duration gas storage. There is a range of offshore storage locations, which are mostly available in the southern North Sea and the Irish Sea.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000369"></a>2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000024"></a>On the economic issue, it is a paradox that when gas prices are low, no one needs storage, but when gas prices are high, no one can afford to build new storage capacity. The big cost in this is the need to pay for the &#147;cushion gas&#148;; that is, the need to have a certain amount of gas in your storage before you can put any substantial new supplies in, otherwise the system does not work and does not function effectively as a gas storage reservoir. I am told that typical costs would run to between &#163;0.5 billion and &#163;1 billion in the current environment just for the storage of gas on a large offshore facility.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000025"></a>Evidence of that has come to light quite recently. Only yesterday, the Tullow company announced the sale of the Hewett gas field and the onshore gas plant to Eni for &#163;210 million cash. That is a measure of the value of an offshore gas field and of what Eni is prepared to pay for it. It is early days yet but it is thought that Eni might use it to build a new offshore gas storage facility. It is interesting that most of the competitors cannot see that it could be economic and that it could be justified to put the investment in. The announcement is that Eni has bought the gas field and therefore has the reservoir, but it will need to spend a great deal more to turn it into a working offshore gas storage reservoir.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000026"></a>My point about the amendment, and in response to the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, is that this is what the report has to address. It must not be just the tables of figures that we get from the National Grid and to which I referred a few minutes ago&#151;it may seem like years but it is only minutes. We would expect the report that my noble friend&#146;s amendment calls for to highlight, deal with and discuss the problems and to indicate what the solutions to those problems might be.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000027"></a>The Government will now be able to say, &#147;Look, Eni has paid over &#163;200 million to buy the Hewett gas field and the appropriate onshore facilities, so that shows that the market is working&#148;. This morning, the general view of people in the industry with whom I have been discussing this announcement, which was  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC253"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made only yesterday, is that they do not see how it can be economic. There are real problems if one is to get new large storage facilities offshore which are comparable to the Rough gas field. That is the only big gas field and the question is whether there will be more. At the present price of gas, the cost of providing the cushion to turn it into a working reservoir is very steep, to the point where some commentators say that it cannot be economic.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000028"></a>I hope the Minister may be able to give us some answers on that today, but my main point is that this is the kind of thing that the report that my noble friend&#146;s amendment is calling for has to deal with. Without that information, it just becomes another table of figures, as the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, rightly said. That is not what we are looking for. We are looking for a serious discussion of the problems of getting more gas storage, which is in accordance with the Government&#146;s wishes. I warmly support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000029"></a><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08061291000390"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I oppose the amendment, not because I do not want information but because the information is already available from a recognised source. Okay, it is a heavily regulated private monopoly&#151;a natural monopoly in a number of respects&#151;but the National Grid&#146;s information is normally regarded as extremely accurate and reliable. It is unlikely that the Government would necessarily be any more accurate or reliable in producing something roughly the same.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000030"></a>The amendment has fundamental flaws arising from certain assumptions. The first is that the Government can give an assessment. I mean no offence to the beleaguered forces of the Civil Service and the various departments responsible for gathering that sort of evidence, but, regardless of political complexion, Governments&#146; assessments of energy need and demand over the past 50 years have been consistently wrong. They have never been effective in doing so. It was best when we had supplies of coal literally standing outside power stations in good weather and bad. In the event of the industrial dispute in 1984, they were used, as it were, to fight the miners.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000031"></a>The idea that Governments can understand the nature of the level of demand leaves a lot to be desired. I do not see that there much worth in that, particularly when one of the virtues of having a flexible energy portfolio is that if gas is too expensive and you can get clean coal technology, you would switch to coal. You would have to ask why we do not have a report for coal or uranium, or for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.</p>

The only time that high storage levels&#151;levels such as those in the United States&#151;are any use is when petrol prices are so high that stores are raided to moderate the price levels.  My point is that this is guesstimating. Government

We may get nothing worth while.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000034"></a>I have long argued that we have not given sufficient weight to the need for gas storage in this country. For many years it was unnecessary; you only needed to turn the tap that much harder so that more gas could come from the North Sea. We no longer have that luxury, which means that we must be more inventive in addressing the issue referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. We might have to look at something like capacity payments, as we have in the past, or for coal-fired power stations to be used at specific times of the year, for example. However, that is a rather different issue, an issue of such complexity and seriousness that it will not be resolved by a tuppence ha&#146;penny report coming out once a year and bearing the imprimatur of BERR or whatever government department has the unfortunate responsibility of trying to get the information together. I hope the Government will oppose the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000035"></a><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08061291000393"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> I also convey my best wishes to the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, and hope that he can join us fairly soon. I shall touch on the last topic&#151;the question of capacity payments, forecasts and so on. I remember a few years ago, even when we still had 100 per cent North Sea gas supplies, which were clearly running out, one of our energy reviews under Brian Wilson was very dismissive of the need for storage and intervention. That is not that many years ago.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000036"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill that government forecasts of demand have never been right. The very first conference that I attended as a young economist was one forecasting the demand on the supply of coal. The amount of coal that the UK was forecast to need to produce turned out to be massively wrong&#151;and it did every time that the coal industry was reviewed. However, the issue of capacity payment is a real one, and the value of these coal amendments is that they enable us to discuss important questions, rather than the particular wording itself. Are the Government of the view that the marketplace and the market mechanism will be adequate to provide enough storage or do they, given the experience of recent years, feel that some kind of non-market mechanism, such as a capacity payment, might be needed? Is that at all under consideration or review? That would be helpful to know.</p>

The noble Baroness was kind enough to refer to my experience on the previous Energy Bill, an experience which I think that all those who spoke on the Bill regarded as an unalloyed pleasure throughout its long duration. That was a little while back. I am even worse at history

Consequently, I apologise for the fact that at fairly short notice I am substituting for what would have been the expert contributions of my noble friend. I, for one, will send him noble Lords&#146; good wishes, and mine in extenso, that he should return as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000038"></a>The noble Baroness has raised an interesting issue, as shown by the contributions of all noble Lords who have spoken to the amendment. This is clearly an important matter. The amendment seeks to define the volume of onshore gas storage&#151;and I emphasise onshore, although I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said about the offshore position and will talk about that in a moment. But the amendment is about the report on onshore gas storage that will be needed to secure our long-term energy security and ensuring that Government report annually on progress towards achieving it.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000039"></a>The amendment establishes a target. I know that my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill said it graphically, and I am sure that every Member of the Committee shares with him some doubts about the capacity to establish effective and active targets on this. The Government present an annual report already, which presents the energy markets outlook that gives guidance to the industry. That is rather different from this amendment, which would identify a target. In a sense, it envisages a different principal position from the one that the Government adopt. We believe that the role of government is to establish a regulatory framework and create the right conditions for investment in a fully competitive and transparent market. Well functioning markets are the best way in which to deliver security of energy supplies and to diversify sources, supply routes and import points for energy. That also obtains to gas, which certainly involves the issue of onshore and offshore storage.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000370"></a>2.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000040"></a>The amendment, however, concentrates on a target for onshore storage. That would interfere with the developing gas market by specifying the appropriate volume of gas to be stored. Within the UK&#146;s energy market, it is not for the Government to specify how much one particular form of gas market flexibility might be appropriate to help secure energy supplies. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, says about anxiety regarding security of supply. We all share that anxiety, particularly in circumstances where our own indigenous sources of energy supply, both gas and oil, are clearly reducing. Of course Governments must be concerned about the issues of security of supply. The question is whether the amendment and the substantial change to the Government&#146;s strategy that it envisages in target-setting for one aspect of the gas market would aid the situation.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000041"></a>In considering which investments to make companies have to take account of a range of different uncertainties. We all recognise that every provision of energy has a range of expectation to it, some of it very long term as has been indicated. That includes uncertainties about relatively current prices and long-term prices especially

The whole issue of energy demand is subject to great fluctuations. We also have the additional factor of carbon prices.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000042"></a>I believe that this amendment would send the wrong signal to industry that the Government have a clear concept that there is an ideal amount of gas to be stored and that this gas should be stored onshore. That looks like a very partial intrusion into the market without bringing any of the benefits suggested by the noble Baroness in moving the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, concentrated a great deal of his extremely interesting contribution on the problems of gas storage offshore, a very important and costly investment issue. I recognise exactly the points he makes. However, I am not sure whether he was suggesting that the position offshore would be improved by onshore targets in the way suggested by the amendment.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000043"></a>There are other ways in which companies can enter into long-term contracts, including contracts for liquefied natural gas. Britain increasingly has contracts for LNG and we are building terminals to provide increased storage for it. I accept that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is worried about aspects of planning as regards LNG. That is a very important reason why the Planning Bill has been drafted as it has. Although the noble Lord indicated that he is a little impatient with the Bill&#146;s tardy progress through the other place and arrival here, we expect that it will eventually arrive here for consideration. He is absolutely right that the way in which we facilitate planning consent for energy needs is an important concept behind that Bill. However, I do not think it is for the Government to second-guess the best or most cost-effective approach to gas supplies.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000044"></a>Lest it be thought that the Government regard this issue with anything other than the most extreme seriousness, I reassure the Committee that we want to ensure the long-term supply of energy, including sufficient supplies of natural gas. The difference between the Government and the noble Baroness and her amendment is the strategy by which that should be pursued. The market is already responding to the UK&#146;s need to import and to store gas. Some 1.2 billion cubic metres of gas storage capacity are under construction, and there are 8 billion cubic metres in various stages of the planning and development process. Some of this could come on stream within four years, doubling the existing gas storage capacity.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000045"></a>I do not underestimate the foresight of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and other noble Lords in the Committee. Indeed, the noble Baroness herself is addressing the question of how we guarantee long-term provision. However, I emphasise that there is a market response to what is already clearly defined as necessary changes in the British supply.</p>

I hope that I will be able to answer the noble Lord&#146;s question. I am struggling with where the figures are published. It appears that they are published in <I>Energy Markets Outlook</I>, so the document to which I referred contains that information. I apologise to the noble Lord that I could not answer him as directly as I wanted to.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000048"></a>The key part of the Government&#146;s role is to ensure that the regulatory framework is fair and fit for purpose so that projects do not face unnecessary obstacles and delays. That, as I indicated earlier, relates to the Planning Bill, which we will consider in this House in the not-too-distant future. In the Energy Bill, too, we have proposals for a new licensing regime that will enable offshore gas storage and importation projects to be built in the future. An important part of this Bill and its correlation with planning in those terms is to ensure that we increase storage and importation capacities.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000049"></a>The Bill does not deal directly with onshore gas storage, as the amendment seeks to do. I have it in mind that a number of the amendments seem to seek to add to the Bill rather than to amend it. In no way, shape or form am I expressing any reservation about that strategy; I am all too well aware of the fertile sources of ideas in both opposition parties and among Back-Benchers, but this is another amendment that seeks to add to the Bill rather than to amend it. The provisions for modernising and reforming the planning consents are already being catered for, as I have indicated. The Government and Ofgem have established a number of mechanisms that also help to ensure that the market is well prepared to meet the demand for gas.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000050"></a>Transparent, credible information is essential if markets are to function effectively, and energy suppliers need to be able to anticipate changes in energy needs sufficiently far in advance to provide the necessary supply capacity and delivery infrastructure. That is the purpose of <I>Energy Markets Outlook</I>. It is published by the department annually and therefore goes some way to meeting an aspect of the amendment that deals with the publication of information. It is certainly intended to provide information and analysis of future trends to help potential investors and others with an interest in the UK energy market to form a comprehensive overview of the likely development of the supply-demand balance in energy over the next decade or so.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000051"></a>In addition, shippers and suppliers that fail to provide enough gas to deliver their contracts on a daily basis must pay an imbalance charge or cash out price&#151;in effect a high market price, exposing themselves to potentially high costs, such as in the winter of 2006 where the closing spot price rose to &#163;1.65 per therm, which was 2.5 times the average closing price for that winter. The licensing conditions and network codes, implemented by Ofgem provide incentives on suppliers to ensure availability of supplies to domestic customers, even in the event of severe conditions.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000052"></a>Of course, I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, had to say about the problems of physical supply and the fact that, obviously, storage will be necessary on greater levels than in the past, when we could call upon natural storage&#151;namely, the ability to pipe gas from the North Sea, from its reservoirs there. We obviously have a massive change in perspective on  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC258"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our energy provision in those terms. However, Ofgem&#146;s work is to guarantee that there are incentives to suppliers to provide adequate supplies of gas and to penalise where people fall short of contract.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000053"></a>Together, these measures from Ofgem provide a strong financial incentive for gas shippers to acquire a portfolio of contracts and assets, which will enable them to provide a sufficient, flexible and competitively priced source of gas when needed, even when demand is high&#151;for example due to cold weather. The grid operates storage monitors, which are a tool to ensure that there is enough gas in storage, across all storage sites in the UK to underpin the safe operation of the gas transportation system in a severe winter. These monitors act to protect the gas supply of domestic customers and those whose gas supply cannot be safely interrupted.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000054"></a>I am aware that I have not answered all detailed questions at this stage and that there will be many opportunities as the Bill develops to flesh out a number of these arguments. This is a constructive amendment from the noble Baroness&#151;it is a proposal designed to guarantee the increased security of supply. I hope that she will appreciate that the Government have a different strategy from that envisaged in the amendment, while at the same time sharing the broad objectives of two things that the amendment considers: first, security of supply and, secondly, the necessity of adequate information, so that there can be market responses that meet the nation&#146;s needs.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000055"></a>I hope that within that framework my noble friend Lord Woolmer will also feel that I have answered his point on the Government&#146;s broad strategy and that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000056"></a><a name="80612-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08061291000397"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> Before my noble friend does that&#151;and, after all, as we are in Grand Committee she cannot do anything very much else&#151;will the Minister look at two other problems which would justify maybe not this amendment but some other form of building greater market transparency? That was what he was asking for, and we would all support that.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000057"></a>First, we will come to this later in the Bill, but all that I will say at is stage is that we will find that the storage facilities that exist, whether onshore or offshore, are in increasing demand for storing CO2. I do not know why the Minister looks so puzzled as there is a whole bit of the Bill about that. We have not come to it yet, but one question that I will certainly want to explore is how far there will be availability of storage and some form of good transfer for CO2 that is separated or sequestrated from fossil fuel operations.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000058"></a>On the second issue, the Minister rightly referred to the amendment relating to onshore storage. One thing that I am told about that is that it is becoming increasingly difficult; most of it happens in salt caverns, with a saline cap over the top. They are encountering environmental problems in some instances where it proves difficult to dispose of the waste salt created when washing out the salt cavern. That is pushing the industry to look more at offshore storage because it does not have that problem. It has other problems&#151;it is a great deal more expensive&#151;but it does not have the environmental problem of having to deal with the  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>salt that is washed out of the caverns. In addition, the salt caverns tend to be a great deal smaller than the depleted gas fields. The comparison is obviously with the Rough field and, in future, with the Hewett field.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000059"></a>These problems need to be brought out into the open. Some kind of report&#151;perhaps not exactly the one that my noble friend&#146;s amendment, to which I put my name, suggests&#151;would be helpful. Somebody, whether in the department or in Ofgem, should provide the market and Parliament with a regular appreciation of the situation on these issues, because if we are going to have more gas storage as a desideratum or an objective, these issues need to be addressed. The market and Parliament will need to know what the Government are going to do to achieve their objective of more gas storage. We will want to come back to this at some stage.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000060"></a>We have raised a number of issues, including the important issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. They indicate that something of this sort is going to be necessary if we are going to take this forward and increase the amount of storage. The problems need to be addressed. At the moment, I am not entirely happy that it is being done in a way that might achieve the objectives that the Government have set themselves.</p>

My surprise at his reference to carbon storage did not arise because I was not aware that the Bill concerns itself with the issue. He rightly said that he has trailed points that we will have to discuss in considerable detail when we reach that part of the Bill. I was trying to think of the direct application of carbon storage to our critical storage facilities for gas at present. We have alternatives to thinking that there is direct competition for the Rough storage facility between gas and carbon storage, but we will discuss that in due course. The noble Lord is right that we have to provide for substantial carbon storage, and we will need to use space that otherwise might be used for gas storage. I hope I will be able to demonstrate by then that we have adequate provision.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000062"></a>On the question about the technical problems with salt caverns, I do not have an immediate answer. The noble Lord raised an interesting topic and we will need to think about that. I hope he does not raise the question too soon&#151;that is, at the next Committee sitting&#151;because I might not be able to answer it then either.

<p><a name="08061291000064"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, who opposed the amendment so vehemently, that I come with a little information behind me, having served for 10 years on the board of a company called Cadbury Schweppes, which makes rather a lot of chocolate. We really did have to work out how many beans we needed for the chocolate for that year, and we held our procurement officers to task on making a report to us for what we needed. It is not beyond our capability as a country to know what we need. If the noble Lord was a little more familiar with the private sector, he would understand that in that area you lose your job if you get it wrong, and so do an awful lot of shareholders.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000072"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 2 is grouped with Amendment No. 7, which is consequential. The purpose of the amendment is to question the Government on what progress they have made on making sure that the provisions in the Bill match up with the Draft Marine Bill. The Minister looked rather shocked when we brought in a copy of the Draft Marine Bill. I am overjoyed that I am not going to be dealing with that Bill; there are 497-odd pages and then a section on impact assessment at the back, which is another 100 pages.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000073"></a>The issue raised by the Marine Bill is that this is draft legislation. Some of the provisions in this Bill refer to future infrastructure, which might affect the Marine Bill. The Government will say that there is joined-up government on all those issues. However, there is a slight contextual issue in that a number of different departments are involved in this Bill, let alone with the organisations involved with the Marine Bill; that is, DBERR and Defra. Under which department will some of the provisions for carbon capture and storage fall?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000074"></a>When this amendment was raised in another place, the answer was that these provisions would all be protected under the habitats directive. Therefore, even if new and novel devices go through, the marine areas will be protected. However, the Marine Bill in draft form is now coming to this House. I notice that since it was drafted there has been a slight change on page 14 referring to coastal access. One of the provisions was the exclusion of gardens and parks, which we now hear are not going to be excluded. But that is a whole different area which many colleagues will deal with under the Marine Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000075"></a>If Royal Assent is given to this Bill before the protected marine areas are designated by the Marine Bill, will any designation or licences that are given not be affected by the Marine Bill, as they would be retrospective? This amendment is to ensure that the Government can give us an assurance that all departments and/or their agencies will look carefully at that potential conflict. Structures on the seabed also fall under the Crown Estates and the operators. It would be interesting to know whether the Government have worked out precisely who will be responsible for dealing with any conflict of interest between areas designated for carbon capture and storage, and whether such areas would then be considered for protected marine status.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000076"></a>I could go further into it but this is just a questioning amendment rather than one to be pushed at a later stage. Are the Government happy that areas of carbon capture and storage will not change marine protected area designations? Of course, there might be a conflict of interest between the two groupings. Will this Bill, as it comes first, affect the protected area status? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000079"></a>I understand the spirit in which the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, moves Amendment No. 2. He has raised an important point on the interaction&#151;which has just been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley&#151;with environmental bodies when granting licences for offshore gas storage and unloading, on the one hand, and carbon dioxide storage activities, on the other. Through the strict wording of the amendment, the noble Lord seeks a requirement in the Bill that, before issuing offshore gas unloading and storage or carbon dioxide storage licences, the Secretary of State shall consult with the relevant environmental bodies, particularly on marine plans, when granting licences.</p>

We will be consulting early next year on the detailed provisions that will be required but we will also ensure that the resulting regime builds on the foundation provided by existing environmental legislation.</p>

The framework includes strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and habitats and birds assessments as and when appropriate. We have committed to ensuring that existing requirements applicable to offshore activities will extend equally to the offshore gas unloading and storage and carbon dioxide storage regimes. These requirements already require duties of consultation with the relevant environmental bodies, such as government departments and their agencies with particular responsibility for environmental issues.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000082"></a>I turn to the issues of marine spatial planning, which is a focus of the amendment. As many will be aware, oil and gas activities are not covered in the Marine Bill. A major part of the thinking behind that is the unique regulatory challenge posed by this large and complex industry, which is best addressed by tailored specific legislation administered by a specialist team expert in oil and gas issues. However, the expertise of the specialist team within the department is not just confined to oil and gas issues. The department has  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC263"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also built up considerable expertise in regulating and understanding issues unique to the offshore oil and gas sector in the context of sustainable development. It must also deal with marine spatial planning concerns, including the impact of oil and gas installations on shipping and navigation. That expertise must be used to understand and determine the impact on the environment from any future licence applications for new technologies, such as offshore LNG unloading.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000083"></a>My department consults Defra, other government departments and the devolved authorities, or their relevant agencies, as appropriate, and is in regular contact with the Marine and Fisheries Agency, which will be replaced&#151;as the noble Lord knows, of course&#151;by the new Marine Management Organisation. This arrangement works well and provides the flexibility to allow for the department to consult, for example, the new MMO and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency on matters in which they have an interest. We are keen to avoid imposing a requirement that would effectively mean that the department must always in every imaginable circumstance consult environmental bodies on a statutory basis.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000084"></a>Where the MFA or the replacement Marine Management Organisation or any other similar organisation has a clear interest, we will of course continue to consult. However, where a licence application clearly complies with any environmental or spatial planning concerns&#151;for example because the strategic environmental assessment, or other environmental assessments, has already ensured that the necessary consultation has taken place&#151;we would not wish to impose an additional statutory consultation process and further delay the licence process. We are serious about ensuring environmental protection, but we are also serious about removing any unnecessary barriers delaying these important investments in infrastructure. As so often in these matters, the objective is to get that balance correct.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000085"></a>The noble Lord posed two questions and I shall do my best to reply. The first is who will regulate the carbon storage regime. Decisions on the appropriate regulatory authority for the storage of carbon dioxide will be taken in due course once the arguments about which authority is best placed to exercise licensing and other functions are carefully assessed. This will be part and parcel of a consultation that the Government are launching shortly. Meanwhile, as I have just argued, regulatory agencies will continue to work together to develop the detailed regulatory regime.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000086"></a>The noble Lord also asked how we will ensure that CO2 storage does not conflict with the proposed protected areas under the Marine Bill. I have gone some way, I hope, to answering him on that. Let me go further by saying that activities that involve oil and gas will be subject to marine planning and conservation zones. Any application to undertake activities in these areas will be subject to appropriate scrutiny and controls. Regardless of whether that applies retrospectively, we do not expect the first licence for CO2 storage to be in place before the Marine Bill is enacted and comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000087"></a>I hope that I have provided the noble Lord with some reassurance that the environment is being, and will continue to be, adequately protected, which is something that everyone concerned with the Bill is very keen to see.

The Minister&#146;s reply has gone much further than could any earlier reply in another place because the Draft Marine Bill had not yet been published. I take on board the point that the licence for carbon capture and storage may well take place after the Marine Bill.

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000094"></a>The noble Baroness said: Perhaps I may digress a little before speaking to the amendment. We have had a change of Clerk and I think it would be a nice moment for us to applaud the way in which she trains for her work. On Tuesday she led the parliamentary women&#146;s tug-of-war team to great triumph and I think that we should congratulate her.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000095"></a>Amendment No. 3 deals with the decommissioning programme. This clause relates to the licensing of gas importation and storage projects and, more aptly, it relates to the offences of carrying out unlicensed activities. Yet it is concerned only with the duration of the projects and makes no provision for decommissioning them. This may be a dangerous oversight. The intention behind this amendment is to level the playing field in the energy sector to ensure genuine competition wherever possible. Other parts of the energy sector, such as wind power, are required to have full decommissioning programmes established from the outset. We want to ensure that this is spread across the entire sector. Sometimes rigs are abandoned in very rough seas or stop being used for whatever reason. Before a facility could stop being used for the importation or storage of combustible gas, it would be required to have a detailed proposal in place for decommissioning the site, which would have to be signed off by the Secretary of State. This could specify things such as what is required to be removed from the site to prevent  danger to shipping and the environment. It could  also specify the establishment of a decommissioning  fund similar to that proposed for the nuclear  decommissioning programmes. That would make certain that decommissioning occurred regardless of the circumstances of the owners or users.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>

I understand that we want to avoid conflicting penalty schemes and undue complication about what happens if the decommissioning programme is inadequate, but a few questions still need to be answered. Could the Minister explain the relationship between the extension of penalties and regulation under the Petroleum Act and the new licence arrangement that the Bill introduces? How will the licence programme in the Bill be integrated into the provisions in the Petroleum Act? The Petroleum Act allows the Secretary of State to require decommissioning security at any stage in the life of these facilities, but who decides this?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000097"></a>Is there a statutory obligation on offshore gas importation and storage facilities to have a comprehensive decommissioning programme from their inception? I beg to move.</p>

You look at the Bill and see paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) or whatever and ask yourself: what can I think of that is not covered there and will show that I have paid attention in class? I am exceedingly impressed because clearly we need provision for decommissioning, which is an important part of almost any energy project, investment or installation in any sector. Therefore, I shall be interested to hear from the Minister whether the Government deem that this is already covered in other areas.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000099"></a>The noble Baroness asked a number of other questions. The matter in which I am particularly interested concerns paragraph (b), which refers to another person carrying on the activity on behalf of the person who has the licence. Having read the section on licensing, I should be interested to hear what approach the Government will take to granting licences to ensure that subcontractors&#151;as I think of them from my industry days&#151;have the right expertise and qualifications to undertake work for the person who holds the licence. Clearly, this is an area where the quality control or the original granting of a licence could fall down as regards large energy installations where quality and safety are particularly important.</p>

I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that we need to ensure that the activities we are seeking to license in the gas unloading and storage regime are subject to a robust procedure for managing the final stage of the process, decommissioning. We shall hear a lot about decommissioning during the Bill&#146;s passage, but this is the first amendment which specifically addresses the concept. I agree entirely with her sentiments that there needs to be an offence defined, if there is not a successful and proper carrying out of any decommissioning programme. What she wants is that the programme must be approved by the Secretary of State at the time when the offshore gas storage or unloading facility is operational and the offence potentially occurs.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000373"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000101"></a>We are extending through Schedule 1 to this Bill the existing decommissioning provisions in Part 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998 to include offshore gas storage  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC266"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and unloading, and related activities. This means that operators will be required to draw up and carry out an approved programme for the decommissioning of their installations. Such obligations can also be placed on certain other interested persons, such as companies associated with the operator, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000102"></a>The problem with the amendment is that it would, in effect, create a different regime for gas unloading and storage from that which applies to oil and gas developments. We believe that there are virtues in consistency in the decommissioning regime across all types of offshore energy installations, which will help to ensure investors are clear about their obligations in respect of properly dismantling their structures. This has been a guiding principle and a strength of the proposals in the Bill, that we are continuing with existing tried and best practice on the issue of decommissioning.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000103"></a>Changing the requirements for decommissioning projects on a piecemeal basis, which would be one of the implications of this amendment, would lead to inconsistencies across the different applicable licensing regimes. For example, the decommissioning provisions in Part 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998, which will apply to offshore gas unloading and storage, provides a penalty, in the case of a conviction on indictment, of a term of two years&#146; imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. However, the penalty for the part of the Bill where the amendment is suggested is, in the case of a conviction on indictment, an unlimited fine&#151;that is, a lesser penalty regime than that of the relevant part of the Petroleum Act 1998. So we would be diluting what is already in place in relation to decommissioning regimes. By linking offshore gas with the existing regime, we provide an essential consistency, which is valuable to all those operating in the industry, and we make sure that changes made to the Petroleum Act regime, including the proposed changes in Part 3 of this Bill, flow through to the offshore gas licensing regime.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000104"></a>I assure the noble Baroness that we take the point about security of decommissioning very seriously, but we are providing consistency across regimes by continuing with the provisions on the Petroleum Act. We also have consistency in the operation of the regime. The changes that we are proposing to Part 4 of the Act under this Bill would apply equally to the offshore gas regime. Chapter 3 of Part 3 of the Bill amends the Petroleum Act, and noble Lords can identify exactly what it does. In several clear ways, it establishes clarity on the decommissioning regime for offshore gas holding.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000105"></a>I was asked what would happen if the contractor did not apply; that was the burden of the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. We are channelling responsibility to the licence holder, which will in this case produce a more effective regulatory regime whereby the prosecuting regulator is not required to examine the relevant chains of command and allocations of responsibilities between the licence holder and the various contractors.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000106"></a>The regulator would be able to target the licence holder in all instances, which should surely guarantee compliance with the licence holder&#146;s responsibilities. Due diligence will be found where the licence holder

Where a contractor is used to carrying out a particular operation, due diligence will be shown where proper steps have been taken to select a competent contractor and where there has been an appropriate level of supervision of the contractor&#146;s operations. I hope that the noble Lord recognises that we have addressed ourselves to the question of when the contractor can be guilty potentially of producing as large a breach in the licence holder&#146;s requirements as the licence holder themselves. But we think that we have got the appropriate rigorous regulation in place.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, made a point on who decides when a decommissioning programme must be in place. The offshore environment and decommissioning unit of the department will serve a notice on the owner of an infrastructure as soon as it has been constructed, notifying them that the department will call for a decommissioning plan at a suitable time thereafter. This will be closer to the end-life of the facility when the best technology is known and available. If there were anxieties or concerns about the installation, the Secretary of State could insist on it being earlier. I think the noble Baroness will accept why we would want an element of delay before judgment of that. Clearly, decommissioning techniques evolve over time and the contractor would, we would hope, employ the best technology available when decommissioning is necessary.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000108"></a>Certainly, the department has the responsibility for serving the notice and the Secretary of State has the responsibility for ensuring that a decommissioning plan is operated. But the operation of that requirement would be as close to the point of decommissioning as possible to make best use of available technology. I hope the noble Baroness will feel that she can safely withdraw her amendment.</p>

Naturally, at this stage, there is so little in the Bill and so much that will be in secondary legislation, which we cannot see right now. I have listened carefully to what has been said. It sounds good, although I should like to reflect on it. Perhaps some of our questions may also cause the civil servants behind the Minister to freshen up some of the things that he has said today.

We are not entirely convinced that the fines are an adequate deterrent to the offences under this section. The statutory maximum fine, as mentioned in the Explanatory Notes, is &#163;5,000 for England and twice that for Scotland. The companies developing these facilities have very deep pockets and it might even be worth their while to take the hit and continue in breach of the law. We are very keen to see the chance of that happening taken out of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000115"></a>I understand that there may be some provision in regulation to place such a bar on bodies seeking future licences if they are in breach of the law, but does the Minister think that that is sufficient? How is it triggered? Does it require the Secretary of State to judge the nature of the offence himself and then personally decide to bar future applications? It seems that the Government are not opposed to the idea of barring future applications for offenders; it is merely the mechanism that we are discussing. Surely having something in the Bill would be the most effective way in which to deter such offences. If there is a quasi-subjective power for the Secretary of State to bar someone after they have committed an offence, this seems like a much weaker deterrent. At best, under the mechanism in the Bill as it stands, we can hope to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. Does the Minister not agree that deterrence is the goal here? If so, is not having something in the Bill the most effective deterrent? I beg to move.</p>

As we are talking about very large contracts, is it a person or a company who is the licence holder? Can companies act as licence holders? I ask for personal information on that matter. If the company holds the licence, the provision and fine seem extremely small, since the companies could be very large.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000118"></a>First, on Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, Clauses 8 and 9 relate to the enforcement provisions of the new offshore gas storage and unloading regime. In particular, Clause 8 stipulates that it is an offence to undertake any of the activities set out in Clause 2, such as the unloading of gas to an installation or pipeline, without a licence granted under Clause 4. Meanwhile, Clause 9 specifically covers offences once a licence has been granted&#151;for example the breach of certain specified licence conditions.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000119"></a>The clauses form part of a suite of provisions designed to ensure that a licence is obtained for the activities listed in Clause 2 and that the terms and conditions governing the licence are adhered to. Adherence to the terms and conditions of licences will ensure that the necessary safety, environmental and other protections are in place for the offshore storage of gas and unloading of LNG. We believe that the proposed penalties for  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>failing to obtain a licence, or for non-compliance with licence conditions, are proportionate and sufficiently strong to deter licence holders from committing the offence. The penalties for any person found guilty under either Clause 8 or 9 consist of a fine of up to the statutory maximum, which as the noble Baroness said is currently &#163;5,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and &#163;10,000 in Scotland.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000120"></a>The noble Baroness has suggested we add to the existing offences to provide a power for the Secretary of State to stipulate that a person guilty of an offence under the gas unloading and storage regime will be barred from applying for future licences for a period of time to be determined by him. We have given some thought to those issues, and I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her amendment, as it gives me the opportunity to give voice to these points.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000121"></a>I am confident that we have the right penalties for these offences without the need for this particular amendment. The penalty provisions contained in Clauses 8 and 9 are based on an existing enforcement regime which has worked successfully to date&#151;the penalty provisions of the submarine pipelines regime in the Petroleum Act 1998. If the noble Baroness thinks that we are leaning too much on past experience, that is a tremendously important Act that has governed an important development in our energy supplies. We have that experience to draw upon. The risk of a potentially unlimited fine will act as an effective and proportionate deterrent to operators engaged in offshore gas storage.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000374"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000122"></a>However, if in future it was felt that a broader range of penalties were necessary&#151;as the noble Baroness suggests with her amendment&#151;including a bar on persons found guilty of an offence, the Bill already provides for that possibility. The power afforded to the Secretary of State by Clause 5(a) allows for regulations to be made detailing who may apply for such licences. These regulations could therefore adequately provide for such a measure of restriction if we deemed it necessary. Our intention is to consult on the regulations and the requirements for applying for a licence prior to their being adopted. This would be the subject of secondary legislation and full consultation will take place before any of that is proposed.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000123"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will recognise that we have thought seriously about these issues and that we have already catered in the legislation for the specific points she picks up on in her amendment. She wondered whether a fine was sufficient to guarantee that companies did not break licence conditions. Companies will be subject&#151;to answer the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale&#151;to a maximum fine but may also be subject on conviction or indictment to an unlimited fine. You cannot have a greater financial deterrent.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000124"></a>There was a question about whether the entity committing an offence may be a company rather than an individual. If it is a company, that company will be liable for the penalty. In certain circumstances, officers of the company would also be liable. We accept the noble Lord&#146;s point that an individual and the company may bear the responsibility. Certainly the penalties we envisage in these terms apply to both.</p>

I will then set out why we think the amendments to revoke a licence if an offence is committed against an inspector or other person acting on the directions of the Secretary of State, or Scottish Ministers in relation to carbon dioxide storage in Scottish territorial waters, is not necessary.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000126"></a>Provisions under Clauses 13 and 27 give the Secretary of State, or Scottish Ministers, the power to appoint inspectors to inspect facilities used for gas or carbon dioxide storage under the seabed, offshore unloading of LNG or related activities. They also provide a power to make regulations setting out the powers and duties of inspectors. Examples of powers that might be set out in regulations include the right of entry to premises, powers to carry out an investigation, to require information or to take samples. The regulations may also specify the assistance that must be offered to the inspectors.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000127"></a>To encourage compliance with these requirements, Clause 13(5) specifies that these regulations may also create offences relating to inspections. An example of an offence might be obstructing an inspector in exercise of his duties under the regulations. The clause lays down the penalties that may be imposed for such offences. Such offences would be punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or a lesser amount specified in the regulations, and, on conviction on indictment, by an unlimited fine. As before, the maximum penalty provisions contained in Clauses 13 and 27 reflect the penalty provisions for offences against submarine pipeline inspectors in the Petroleum Act 1998. That enforcement regime has worked successfully to date. I believe that the threat of an unlimited fine will act as an effective and proportionate deterrent.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000128"></a>However, if it is felt that financial penalties are insufficient in relation to offences committed against inspectors, revocation of a licence is also available as an additional sanction. Under Clauses 6 and 20, the licensing authority could include a provision in a licence that specified that the licence could be revoked if the licensee committed any offence as set out in the relevant regulations. Moreover, in the case of carbon dioxide storage, the appropriate sanction might not be revocation of the whole licence, but rather withdrawal of the rights of the operator to continue storage activities. That is because we may wish the operator to continue to be bound by the monitoring and remediation obligations under the licence, even if it no longer has the right to continue storage activities.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000129"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will recognise that we have considered these issues very carefully and that the Bill and the Petroleum Act provide the necessary penalties and requirements that she identified in her amendment.

<p><a name="08061291000332"></a>As I understood the noble Lord, he said that the regulations could specify as a class those who had previously been guilty of certain offences. I question whether that would be an appropriate use of that regulation-making power. It could be open to challenge on the grounds that that was not what the legislation had in mind. When legislators talk about classes of persons, they are not thinking of particular people who may have offended the law in another respect. I am not a lawyer&#151;at least it is a very long time since I was involved in the law, and I do not claim any expertise&#151;but I hope the Minister might be prepared to get his lawyers to look at this again and satisfy themselves that Clause 5(a) could legally be used to make a regulation that would exclude the kind of people that my noble friend&#146;s amendment addresses. I wonder whether that would be a viable use of that regulation-making power.</p>

I respect the point he made. We would use Clause 5(b), but that may not change the burden of the noble Lord&#146;s point. I shall respond to it in any case. We will look at the clause to make sure that it would be entirely appropriate that any regulations laid down by the Secretary of State about classes of persons could have this element of disqualification in it because the person had committed an offence under an existing licence, which would be the reservation that would be entered. We consider that to be appropriate at this point. He has raised his doubts. If he has doubts, so have I. I will ensure that we look at this further. I assure the Committee that we will be able to respond even more positively to the point if necessary at a subsequent stage of the Bill.</p>

I should have thought that my original suggestion on Clause 5(a) and a class of persons who could be excluded by regulation from being given a licence is what he initially suggested. The noble Lord has undertaken to write to me and perhaps he can cover that point as well. It is very important that we get this right.

However, I have an awful feeling early in the piece that we shall keep hearing the words &#147;Petroleum Act&#148; coming up again and again. I had not realised how often I would hear them. The &#163;5,000 fine looks small for the offences and companies we are likely to be dealing with. In ignorance I must ask, how long ago was the Petroleum Act enacted? Has time moved on as regards these sums as it has for the price of houses? Are we working backwards to a fine that seemed a heck of a lot at the time? I am not a lover of retrospection but perhaps the Minister could return to the matter. He may not be able to respond to it now.

There may very well be circumstances in which that is necessary. However, this open-ended power still makes us on this side of the Committee shudder a little. Therefore, our amendment would make a simple change, requiring that there be consultation on changes to the licence arrangements.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000154"></a>It has been said before and will be repeated throughout our debates on this Bill that industry confidence will be a cornerstone to the success of the Bill&#146;s provision. Thus we seek to provide another layer of transparency to make certain that concerned parties will have their say. If the goalposts keep moving, we will not see progress.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000155"></a>I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, will tell me that the amendment is unnecessary and that any sensible Government would consult on changes that are of any degree of importance. However, without such an assurance in the Bill we will never be certain&#151;and I hope that the Minister will reassure me with a further explanation. I beg to move.</p>

Although CO2 has been pumped into the North Sea over many years to recover oil supplies and is therefore not a new technology, the scale on which we are looking at the recovery of CO2 from power stations onshore and pumping it through a line system down into a reservoir that shall be capped is a massive undertaking. Of course, one problem that has been highlighted with the move towards the competition for carbon storage and capture is that the whole process relies on government subsidy and a potential tax advantage to make it workable. That is why two of the schemes that went forward failed on that basis.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000157"></a>The purpose of the amendment is very welcome. One problem that many companies will face is that an enormous amount of investment will be needed to undertake this. If regulatory positions suddenly change without adequate consultation, and if the tax regime changes for one reason or another, the investment will be in jeopardy. If there is to be change in the regime, it seems only right and proper that in respect of the enormous amount of investment and risk that these companies are undertaking they should be kept informed of why any change in the regulation is taking place and how it should affect them. I know that the Minister says that this is all speculative, but there have been a number of complaints from companies in the North Sea about changes in the regulatory system that have changed the very nature of their investment opportunities and how they operate within the North Sea. This will be very detrimental in this new area of carbon capture and storage.</p>

I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment, but I will not become involved in the fuller argument until a little later.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000160"></a>On Amendment No. 8, the nature of carbon capture and storage means that the facilities will have a very long life. Indeed in theory, as far as we are all concerned, they will have an infinite life, or at least hundreds and hundreds of years, which is their whole attraction. That gives rise to the question of the length of the licence. What length of licence is envisaged in this area? Secondly, the licence will carry certain obligations to deal with the maintenance of the facility. Once it is full, it is still storage and it still has to be maintained.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000161"></a>Things could go wrong over a very long time. If there is a similarity to anything, it is to nuclear waste disposal. It would therefore be helpful if, at this early stage&#151;we may well come back to this later&#151;the Minister could now, or later, tell us a little about the Government&#146;s thinking on the length of the licences and how, given the peculiarly long lifetime of the investments in the facilities, they intend to deal with matters such as long-term maintenance, long-term reassurance about things going wrong and the kind of financial provision that would have to be made.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000162"></a><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08061291000424"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. Let me deal first with what Clause 20 attempts to do. I will then look at the amendment and do my best to answer my noble friend&#146;s questions.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000163"></a>Clause 20 allows licences for carbon dioxide storage and related activities to be granted on such terms and conditions as the licensing authority&#151;that is, the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers, as appropriate&#151;or an authority to which the licensing function is transferred, sees fit. The power will allow case-specific requirements to be included in licences in relation to each carbon dioxide store. The clause also provides an inexhaustible list of examples of the sorts of conditions that licences may contain, including financial security provisions, the right for the licensing authority to modify the licence and provisions about closure of the storage site and termination of the licence. In addition, we expect that all licences will include provisions relating to monitoring and remediation, reporting, record-keeping, notification obligations and the requirement to have a valid lease from the Crown Estate for the relevant site.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000164"></a>This general power in Clause 20 is in turn subject to regulations that may be made under Clause 21, which may prescribe the terms and conditions that must be contained in licences. In circumstances in which the licensing authority is other than the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers, regulations made under Clause 21 will help to ensure that provisions that the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers consider to be essential will be included in all licences.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000165"></a>Amendment No. 8 would insert a provision requiring the licensing authority to consult the licence holder prior to making any modifications. However, the licensing authority&#151;the noble Baroness made this point&#151;would retain the power to modify the licence without the operator&#146;s consent, provided that the operator had been duly consulted. The noble Baroness will not be surprised to hear me say that we believe that the clause  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC275"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already allows for such consultation to be carried out, as it gives the licensing authority power to modify a licence &#147;in specified circumstances&#148;. Such circumstances, which would be specified in the licence, could include a requirement to consult the licence holder prior to introducing any modifications to the licence. Indeed, our intention is to consult the licence holders in any event, in keeping with the current practices in the oil and gas regulatory regime.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000166"></a>So far, I have not disappointed the noble Baroness; now I am going to surprise her. In the interest of regulatory certainty and to reassure the future operators of carbon dioxide stores, we recognise the benefit of making the intention explicit in the Bill. I hope that finds favour with all sides of the Committee. If the noble Baroness would be good enough to withdraw the amendment, we will consider it further and respond at the next stage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000167"></a>Before I sit down, I must do my best to answer the preliminary questions asked by my noble friend Lord Woolmer. He may not be entirely satisfied by what I have to say, but this is just a starting point. How long would a licence last? It is obvious to say that it would be decided on a case-by-case basis. While carbon is injected, which I am advised may be for 20 to 25 years, depending on the size of the store, the licence holder will be in charge of the store. That licence holder will also be in charge for a number of years after that, to ensure that the store is safe and secure, and the licence will then be terminated. On that basis, the licence would last for anything between 30 and 35 years in that instance, which certainly for all of us here is a long time; I agree with my noble friend.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000168"></a>My noble friend asked what happens with ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the store after it is effectively closed. The licence would stay in force until the Secretary of State is satisfied that the store is both safe and secure. After the licence has been terminated&#151;which is the expression that is used&#151;the responsibility for the store will pass to the state, and monitoring will continue for as long as is necessary and at such frequency as is necessary to ensure that the store is safe. Those are the kind of parameters, by way of example, that I can give my noble friend at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000169"></a><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08061291000425"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> To clarify that, in this particular kind of investment, the businesses that are properly meeting our needs are making money setting up the store and storing the liquefied carbon dioxide. When that is full, the state will take on all obligations of risk and maintenance for ever, as it were, in this instance, as I understand it.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000170"></a><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew26"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0004.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="08061291000426"></a>Lord Bach:</b> That is not so immediately the store becomes too full, as it were. There will be an obligation on the licence holder, as I understand it, who will be in charge for a number of years, to ensure that the store is safe and secure. So the licence holder&#146;s obligations will not end on the day that the store is full; there will be obligations for that time.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000171"></a>The comparison with the nuclear industry is obviously in my noble friend&#146;s mind. We will come to that in due course in debates on the Bill. The arrangements are

We think that it is reasonable for the licence holder to have an obligation for a number of years after a store is full, with the licence continuing, but the licence will be terminated once the store is safe and secure, and it will then become the obligation of the state.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000180"></a>The noble Lord said: Apart from our concerns about consultation, to which my noble friend referred earlier and which the Minister said he would take up, Clause 20 seems to be perfectly sensible, so far as it goes. Yet, as with the Bill as a whole, it is missing some important components. Remarkably, I can find nothing

<a name="80612-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000181"></a>We appreciate that there will be an inspection system, and we share the Government&#146;s view that inspections should be thorough and robust, but Amendment No. 9 would place the onus clearly on the operator of a facility to report accidents and near accidents. The amendment stems from the firm belief that safety is paramount and that the risks to both the public and the environment must be minimised.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80612-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000182"></a>The second strand of thinking that generated Amendment No. 9 is that experience makes a vital contribution to safety. Mistakes, gaps in protocol and close calls are all revealed in the operation of these facilities. It is essential to ensure that all accidents can be lessons to make certain that future precautions are adequate. I think that we would all agree that it is impossible to foresee every problem before it rears its head. The most robust system of safety precautions will never be perfect, so a precautionary approach is favoured. It is therefore essential that the onus is placed on the operator to advise of accidents and near accidents. The technologies that we are talking about are, in some cases, in their infancy, especially those that detect leakages. We appreciate that operators will take safety extremely seriously, but they also have a duty to their shareholders to reduce, or to maintain, costs. We must be sure that cost reductions do not come at the expense of precautions.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000183"></a>When the amendment was debated in another  place, a somewhat strange position emerged from the Government Benches. We quite understand that  the specific provisions outlined in this clause as to the responsibilities of licence holders are not intended to be exhaustive but, during the debate in the other place, the Minister for Business said that operators would be obliged to report these things as a matter of course. He claimed that reporting leaks and accidents was,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000359"></a>&#147;so blindingly obvious ... that reference need not be made to them&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Energy Bill Committee, 26/2/08; col. 226.]</ul>
<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000184"></a>Let us look at something that is specifically referred to: granting the Secretary of State explicit power to review the licence in subsection (3)(c). That seems to me equally, if not more, obvious, yet it is included. The Minister in another place gave assurances that provisions about accidents will be,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000360"></a>&#147;a very significant part of the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Energy Bill Committee, 26/2/08; col. 227.]</ul>
<p><a name="08061291000334"></a>Why do the Government not think that this is the appropriate place in which to make such a provision?</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000377"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000185"></a>There is a dangerous tendency toward the suppression of important elements of legislation into delegated powers and guidance notes. With an issue as important as accidents and leakages, even if it is obvious, it is important to try to defy that gradual shift and have it planted firmly and clearly in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000186"></a><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08061291000433"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> This is an interesting and important amendment. It would amend subsection (3), which starts, &#147;A licence may include&#148;. As the noble Lord,   


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord De Mauley, suggested, &#147;may&#148; is almost too easy in that sentence. A reporting structure must be included in the Bill, so this is a positive contribution to the debate. I shall be interested to hear the Government&#146;s response on why compulsory reporting of such matters is not in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000187"></a>As this is the first time that I have intervened since we moved on to carbon storage, and as I am probably not entering into the areas on which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will speak, I shall ask the Government more generally about these measures. First, on where storage can be licensed, Clause 17 in Chapter 3 defines a &#147;controlled place&#148;. Licences can be granted only for controlled places, which are defined in two ways &#151;as a,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000361"></a>&#147;territorial sea, or ... waters in a Gas Importation and Storage Zone&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061291000335"></a>Am I right to conclude from this that the Bill allows storage only offshore, below the sea? I am surprised that the clauses relate to temporary as well as permanent storage. It seems strange to me&#151;although perhaps I do not understand the industry sufficiently&#151;because there might often need to be temporary storage on land. I cannot see how the clause in any way allows for temporary storage to be licensed and therefore approved other than above or below the ocean or in the waters defined as an importation or storage zone.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000188"></a>Furthermore, have the various issues around international treaties been resolved by the British Government? I refer to the Ospar treaty and, I think, another treaty&#151;maybe the Treaty of London&#151;under which this is still seen as a pollutant, and storing and disposing of potentially environmentally dangerous or polluting products at or below sea is specifically prohibited. Have the Government resolved all those international treaty issues to allow carbon storage to take place, especially in areas such as the North Sea?</p>

<p><a name="08061291000189"></a><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061291000434"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> As I understand it, it is, in principle, possible to have carbon storage on the floor of the ocean, if it is deep enough. I also recall the Government saying that although that is technically the case, it is not their intention to do so, certainly in the early days. Is it possible to find areas within the 88-mile, or whatever, area away from our 12-mile limit where it would be technically possible to store carbon dioxide on the bed of the ocean at sufficient depth, or is that an interesting theoretical possibility that could not realistically apply within UK waters?</p>

<p><a name="08061291000190"></a><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08061291000435"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has raised an important issue. I shall try to explain why we have drafted the provisions in Clause 20 as we have and set out why the amendment, which would include a provision about notification of accidents, near accidents or leakages relating to a carbon dioxide storage site, is unnecessary. The noble Lord could have chosen other examples to put in, but we would equally have argued that they were unnecessary because they are so obvious.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000191"></a>Clause 20 allows licences to be granted on such terms and conditions as the licensing authority sees fit. The power will allow the authority to include case-specific requirements in relation to each carbon dioxide store. This clause provides a non-exhaustive  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>list of examples of the sorts of conditions licences may contain, including: financial security provisions; the right to modify the licence; provisions about closure of the storage site; and provisions about the termination of the licence.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000192"></a>Notification obligations are not mentioned expressly in Clause 20(3) because the list of potential licence conditions in that clause is non-exhaustive. Trying to provide an exhaustive list would not be possible at this time, for reasons I will try to outline. Instead, Clause 20(3) aims to set out examples of some of the less obvious provisions that may be contained in licences. To a certain extent, it is a matter of opinion which are obvious and which are not, but in other circumstances it is obvious which are clear and which not.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000193"></a>There are two reasons why an exhaustive list of licence terms and conditions cannot be provided at present. First, there is only very limited practical experience worldwide of licensing the permanent storage of carbon dioxide, and the detailed arrangements will inevitably develop as experience grows. In the mean time, the relevant licence terms and conditions will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Secondly, international legislative developments, which the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked about&#151;for example, the EU proposal for a directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, which is currently under negotiation&#151;mean that the licensing regime, including the applicable licence terms and conditions, will need to evolve and be adjusted with time. Therefore, because of the above flexibility that we require, we have restricted the list in Clause 20(3) to examples of the less obvious conditions that may be included in licences. We will also be consulting on our proposed licensing regimes in the near future.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000194"></a>We expect all licences to include as a matter of course&#151;with the onus on the operator, too&#151;provisions on monitoring, remediation, reporting, record-keeping and notification obligations. This is because these licence provisions will play a fundamental role in ensuring that the CO2 storage sites are run in a way that pays due care and attention to environmental and health and safety considerations.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000195"></a>I reassure the Committee, particularly the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that notification obligations will be included in every licence as a matter of course, due to the importance of keeping the regulatory authority informed of any leaks or other significant developments in relation to the storage site. Clause 23(1) specifies that it will be a criminal offence to fail to notify the regulatory authority as required by a licence, which necessarily implies that notification requirements will be included in a licence.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000196"></a>I was asked about the clause not allowing onshore storage of CO2. I am advised that the onshore storage of CO2 is not permitted because of the EU landfill directive. That is why the Bill focuses on offshore storage. The other elements of CCS&#151;capture and transport&#151;can be licensed under the existing regulatory framework, so the Bill does not have to deal with them.</p>

Is that what the Minister is implying? Obviously I do not expect him to answer immediately, but perhaps he will do so at the end of his replies to other points.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000198"></a><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08061291000437"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. I will come back to him.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000199"></a>On international treaties, Norway has already ratified the amendment to the Ospar Convention, to which the noble Lord refers, to enable the UK to store CO2 in the near future. Contracting starts soon, and there has to be notification for it to come into force. The London protocol has also been amended so that carbon dioxide can be stored on the seabed.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000200"></a>My noble friend Lord Woolmer asked why CO2 is stored on the seabed and not under it and whether such opportunities exist in the UK. Again, under Ospar, the international agreement, this would not be permissible because it prohibits storage in the water column itself.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000201"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked why the power in subsection (3)(c) was not blindingly obvious. This and other provisions are not obvious because they may affect the rights and expectations of licence holders in one way or another. This includes the power to require financial security or to modify a licence. Another group of not obvious provisions include provisions that are specific to CO2 storage.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000202"></a>In answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, the Bill states that interim measures prior to the permanent disposal of carbon will also require a licence. What situation is that intended to cover? While unlikely, we are not ruling out the possibility that it may be necessary to temporarily store CO2 offshore in one location before transferring it if, for example, an operator has a portfolio of sites that are in close proximity. As to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, about details in relation to onshore siting, the best thing that I can do is write to him with a more exact position than I have been able to describe up to now.</p>

I cannot believe that that is right; I see that certain heads are nodding. That sounds patently absurd, because there are perfectly good saline aquifers in this country that would hold sequestrated carbon dioxide in perpetuity. I see absolutely no reason why Brussels should insist that we cannot do that. I hope that the noble Lord will take on board&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, suggested&#151;that this whole business needs to be firmly and swiftly revisited.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000205"></a>Will the Minister clarify whether the Ospar Convention and the Treaty of London conventions have been concluded? I was not clear from his remarks whether those had now been tied up, done, ticked and finished, which would mean that we move on with the landfill directive and being able to implement the Bill once it receives Royal Assent.</p>

I declare an interest as president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association. First, to comment on the question by the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, the possibility of storage of CO2 on the deep sea floor has been recently floated by respectable international scientists, simply because they were concerned at the slow pace of the proceedings with the rest of the sequestration proposals, such as saline aquifers and appropriate traps under the sea.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000207"></a>It only becomes practicable to store CO2 on the ocean floor at considerable depth. It becomes denser than sea water at depths of about 3,000 metres, so you must have that sort of depth before you can put in CO2 and it will sink to the bottom. The proposal is that it would pool. However, that is clearly precluded by the present law of the sea. It would require a really significant change in international opinion for that to happen. We have none of those depths within the UK jurisdiction, so it is not really relevant to our problem. </p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000208"></a>In terms of land storage, which the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, raised, the reason why not much attention has been given to that in the UK so far is that it is pretty expensive by comparison with disposing under the North Sea. All the attention so far has been directed at the North Sea where, in a number of cases, there is a possibility of secondary oil recovery to reduce costs. I simply do not know what the licensing procedure would be for storing CO2 in repositories on land in saline aquifers in the UK. I do not know whether the Minister knows that.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000209"></a><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0005.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08061291000441"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord whose comments, which displayed his obvious expertise, certainly educated me and perhaps other Members of the Committee. I hope that I can add to them.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000210"></a>I am advised that onshore storage is not permitted because of the current EU landfill directive but that negotiations are under way with a view to introducing a change in the policy by 2009. Under the new directive it may well become possible to store CO2 on land. I was right in what I originally said to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, but he was right to wonder why that was the case. It looks as if the EU may be catching us up. We are one of the countries proposing an alteration to the existing directive to allow a more flexible response.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000211"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, rightly pressed me on the extent to which Ospar and the London protocol have been agreed. The London protocol is completed but Ospar needs to be ratified by seven contracting states. Norway has already done so and we shall do so shortly. I am delighted to say that the helpful lesson that we have just had from the noble Lord in relation to storage on the open sea comprises exactly what I had to say, although not in the same words. I have tried to explain what we are trying to do. Including all

</ul>
<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000222"></a>The noble Lord said: This group relates to the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 simply change the wording of Clause 29(2)(b) to strengthen the protection of commercial interests. We propose to do that by removing the unreasonable degree test. We do not want to place the Secretary of State in the position of deciding at what point interference into commercial interest is unreasonable. The change in wording is slight, but we on this side feel that to have the subsection state that the information should not unduly prejudice them is a sufficient condition for protection.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000223"></a>Amendment No. 13 would have a more substantive impact than perhaps Amendments Nos. 11 and 12. It would change the period of confidentiality of commercially sensitive information otherwise due to be included in the public register. As it stands, the Bill would exclude from the register for four years information that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000362"></a>&#147;would prejudice to an unreasonable degree a person&#146;s commercial interests&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061291000336"></a>Projects of the nature that we are considering are typically very long term. Four years seems to us to be an inadequate protection. We appreciate that access to  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>environmental information can be important to achieving sustainable development because it fosters a public role in decision-making in a transparent and helpful fashion.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000224"></a>However, that obviously must be balanced with the fact that some information is crucial to business competitiveness and to national security. The Minister in the other place noted that the period of confidentiality could be extended at the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion following an application by the person who might be affected. But that, we believe, is inadequate. We support a flexible system, but that flexibility should be rooted in something that already provides adequate protection and can be adjusted when necessary. Four years does not seem to us to provide the adequate base position upon which changes or extensions might be granted. Commercial confidence depends on the knowledge that a participant&#146;s interest can be protected and an extension, purely at the whim of the Secretary of State, might not be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000225"></a>The Minister in the other place outlined the safeguard; that is, the Government&#146;s,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000363"></a>&#147;usual reasonable approach to these matters&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Energy Bill Committee, 26/2/08; col. 255.]</ul>
<p><a name="08061291000337"></a>That seems to me to be a matter open to debate. Regardless of this Government&#146;s reputation for reasonableness on these matters, it is important to note that this is legislation for future Governments of whatever colour. To depend on a future Secretary of State to be reasonable does not seem the best course of action when the stakes are this high. A lack of commercial confidence could wreck these projects and protecting the information that needs to be protected is part of the foundation of this confidence.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000226"></a>I understand that the timeframe of this clause comes from the Food and Environment Protection Act, but does the Minister not think that, given the very long-term nature of many of these projects, the four-year period should be reconsidered? What consultation has occurred with respect to this time period? Does the Minister not see that there are substantial differences in the use of the time period governing the Food and Environment Protection Act and this Bill? A letter sent by the Government to my honourable friend Charles Hendry in the other place outlined the process to some extent, but they admit that the decision is up to the Minister. Is there anywhere to which these bodies will be able to appeal if their application for an extended period is denied by a Minister?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000227"></a>While the decision as to what is an adequate period is a subjective judgment, and we have suggested 10years, we on these Benches feel strongly that the mechanisms regarding confidentiality need to be seriously reviewed and rethought. I beg to move.</p>

In keeping with the principle of public access to information on environmental matters, Clause 29 requires the Secretary of State to maintain a public register of specified information related to carbon dioxide storage licences. It replicates existing arrangements under Part 2 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Access to environmental information is required by international,

Moreover, and importantly, the public&#146;s right to be informed about certain environmental matters has long been seen by the Government as essential for achieving sustainable development because an informed public can play a more active role in effective decision-making. The information to be included in a public register will be set out in regulations, but is likely to be very similar to the types of information already made available under Part 2 of FEPA. As is the case with that Act, suitable protections will be put in place to exclude from the register commercially sensitive information and information that prejudices national security interests.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80612-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000229"></a>I shall take Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 together. They would change the test for establishing the grounds of commercial interest on the basis of which information may be excluded from the register of CO2 storage licences. This exclusion would be at the discretion of the Secretary of State. The proposed amendments replace the current test that the disclosure of the relevant information would have to prejudice a person&#146;s commercial interests &#147;to an unreasonable degree&#148; with a new, and possibly less onerous, test that disclosure of information would have to prejudice a person&#146;s commercial interests unduly. At first sight, and maybe even at second sight, this looks like a lawyer&#146;s distinction, but we think that it is worth standing out on this. As I have already mentioned, the provisions of this clause largely replicate those contained in Part 2 of the FEPA, where the unreasonable degree test is used. I remind the Committee that the FEPA governs temporary depositions of materials on or under the sea bed and, while not suitable for regulating the permanent storage of carbon dioxide, it sets a valuable regulatory precedent for the test establishing commercial sensitivity. The test has been applied in the context of FEPA for a number of years and has worked effectively.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000230"></a>Moreover, by lowering the threshold for the commercial sensitivity test, if that is what we would be doing, the proposed amendments may have negative public rights implications. As I said, international, European and national legislation gives the public certain rights of access to information on environmental matters. Lowering the threshold for the test of commercial sensitivity, on the basis of which information may be excluded from the public register, would unjustifiably undermine those rights to some extent. Our view is that in relation to the register of carbon dioxide storage licences, only information that would prejudice the operator&#146;s commercial interests to an unreasonable degree can be afforded protection. We do not agree, on this occasion, with the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000231"></a>Amendment No. 13 relates to the length of time during which information ought to remain excluded. The suggestion is that where information is excluded on the grounds of commercial sensitivity, it ought to remain excluded for 10 years rather than four years. It will be for the Secretary of State to decide what information ought to be excluded on the grounds of commercial sensitivity. The Secretary of State will also have the power to exclude information on the grounds of national security, and there is no time limit after which that exclusion is deemed unnecessary.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC285"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000232"></a>In the case of commercial sensitivity, there is a presumption that information that is excluded will remain excluded for four years only, but that period can be extended at the discretion of the Secretary of State on application by the person whose commercial interests are affected. I refer noble Lords to Clause 29(4) on that.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000233"></a>We do not think that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, which goes from four years to 10 years, is appropriate. First, 10 years seems too long. The four-year period provided for in the Bill strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, ensuring that companies&#146; commercial interests are not unreasonably prejudiced while, on the other, protecting the right of the public to access this information. I stress again that the provision replicates the equivalent provision of the FEPA, where, again, we argue that it has worked pretty successfully over the years.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000234"></a>Secondly, if in the future it transpired that information was still sensitive after four years, the Bill has adequate safeguards. Subsection (4), as I have said, gives the Secretary of State power to decide, upon application from the operator, whether the information ought to continue to be excluded. This is an important provision that will enable periodic reassessment of the excluded information and will help to ensure that where there are sound reasons for excluding information, that information will continue to be protected. Our response, which is to be found in the Bill, is a flexible one&#151;even a reasonable one. I hope that provides sufficient reassurance that the Bill contains a number of safeguards that will ensure that commercially sensitive information is appropriately protected, including the ability to extend the period for which it remains off the register.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000235"></a>Regarding companies&#146; attitudes and responses to any consultation, we have not had any opposition from companies to the four-year provision. Is the FEPA a reasonable or good precedent? The noble Lord pressed me on the length of information exclusion because, he pointed out, there are differences between the licences. My response is that both short-term and permanent disposal under the sea are environmentally sensitive in their own way, so this is not a bad precedent; in fact, it is quite a good one. Not only has it worked well in the past but the Bill allows for the flexibility that I think the noble Lord wants to see.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000236"></a>To whom can someone appeal if they disagree about extending protection? We have had a lot of discussions with industry about this whole matter, and as it happens that has not been raised as a concern, although that is not to say that he is wrong to raise it as a concern. Should this prove to be a problem, companies will be able to seek judicial review of the relevant decisions concerning information exclusion. However, we are pretty confident that that will not be necessary. The same arrangements, I repeat, have worked pretty well under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, so I hope the noble Lord will, at least to some extent, be reassured by what I have had to say.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000244"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment concerns the way that storage facilities will be closed and how this process will be inspected. It is a reaffirmation of the role of the inspectors in the closure of facilities and makes plain that it is the operator of the facility who will bear the cost. That point relating to the costs remains unclear in the Bill as it stands, and we hope that the Minister will be able to provide some clarification on the point, as well as the reasons for omitting this from the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000245"></a>We welcome the confirmation from the Minister in the other place that the liability and responsibility for the store will remain with the licensee. Yet he also said that the licence, and therefore the liability, would be terminated only when there was,</p>

<p><a name="08061291000338"></a>Can the Minister explain the criteria in more detail? It seems that the people making such a judgment will be inspectors of some sort. Will the cost of the final inspection still be borne by the licensee?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000246"></a>Clause 27 gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations specifying the powers and duties of inspectors. We do not seek to replicate those powers with the amendment or cause an instance of unnecessary duplication in the legislation, but we do think that this is the sort of assurance that ought to appear in the Bill. What assurances can the Minister give regarding the shape of these regulations? Will specific mention be made of inspection of facilities when the licences are being terminated?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000247"></a>Noble Lords will understand our concern on this point. A real danger is posed when these facilities are closed down and we want to be absolutely certain that all efforts are made to ensure the safety of the public and the environment. I beg to move.</p>

It reminds me of the story about the keebird, which flies around and around in ever-diminishing circles. In the interests of propriety, I shall not go any further than that. He is absolutely right in that you cannot have regulations imposing obligations on yourself. Something has gone wrong in the drafting. The noble Lord has raised an interesting if minor point.</p>

First, I shall address the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, appreciates, inspectors will perform very important functions in relation to carbon dioxide storage sites, ensuring compliance with the relevant licence conditions and adherence to high standards of environmental protection. I therefore agree with him that the regime set up for inspectors in this chapter deserves our close attention. I shall briefly outline the provisions of Clause 31.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000251"></a>One of the key areas covered by the regulatory framework in the Bill concerns the closure of carbon dioxide storage facilities. The purpose of the framework is to ensure that carbon dioxide is stored permanently in geological formations. We have already discussed some of the existing constraints on this matter. However, operators as commercial entities cannot be responsible for carbon dioxide storage facilities indefinitely due to the geological timescales involved, a factor that I am sure is recognised by all Members of the Committee. We are talking about very long time periods indeed.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000380"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000252"></a>Clause 31 therefore provides the Secretary of State and, in relation to licences granted by them, Scottish Ministers, with the powers to make regulations specifying requirements for the termination of licences and the arrangements for the long-term stewardship of closed carbon dioxide stores.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000253"></a>We expect licences to include provisions requiring the carbon dioxide stores to be monitored for a period of time after closure to ensure the safety and security of the relevant stores. During this time, the responsibility and liability for the store will remain with the licensee for a reasonable time after closure. Only when there is sufficient evidence to confirm that the stores are safe and secure would we expect to consider terminating a licence.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000254"></a>If I understand the amendment correctly, it would include an express provision in this clause allowing inspectors to examine carbon dioxide stores following their closure. I do not believe that the amendment is necessary because there are already powers elsewhere in the Bill that would allow us to deliver the same objective. The noble Lord is concerned about the long-term security of the environment, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000255"></a>First, requirements for inspection of carbon dioxide stores, both during the operational phase, when carbon dioxide is being injected, and during the monitoring phase, when the carbon dioxide store has been closed but the licence has not yet been terminated, could be  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>included in the specific licence terms and conditions of any carbon dioxide storage facility. The power for the licensing authority to prescribe such, and other, conditions is already in Clause 20, which governs the terms and conditions of licences.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000256"></a>Secondly, such a provision would duplicate powers in Clause 27, which would give the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers the power to appoint inspectors and make regulations prescribing their powers and duties. That would allow the regulators to specify the inspectors&#146; responsibilities in relation to both operational and closed carbon dioxide stores and in relation to any inspections that may need to be carried out prior to the termination of a licence.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000257"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has clearly identified an area of concern. What is the nature of the powers of inspection? How do they relate to when carbon dioxide is being injected, and when the site has been closed but has not been rendered sufficiently safe and secure for the licence to be terminated? What happens after that? I assure the noble Lord that there are powers in the Bill that meet the anxieties reflected in the amendment.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000258"></a>Let me deal with the question about the criteria for closure of a store, which was asked by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. We need to consult on those issues, and we intend to do so shortly. The criteria will have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. We do not have any experience in regulating the closure of such stores, for obvious reasons. Therefore, international experience and evidence will have to be relied on, at least in the first cases. However, the guiding principles will be clear, well known and, I hope, acceptable to the Committee; namely the polluter pays principle, the essential protection of the environment and the necessary protection of the interest of the taxpayer regarding these issues.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000259"></a>We must consult on this. Noble Lords have raised anxieties about the issues, and we recognise that we are breaking new ground on them and that they are of profound importance. They relate to other issues regarding closure and safe storage, which we will debate later in the Bill. They are profoundly significant. In asking the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment, I also express gratitude that he has given us the opportunity to clarify that we have addressed the issues that he identified and that we will be consulting in due course on the crucial issue of the criteria.</p>

It was raised, but he has not really addressed it. He made a passing reference to &#147;the polluter pays&#148;, but am I right that the licensing authority will be a charging authority that will charge for the inspections functions that are carried out as part of the licence process? The question of cost does not really arise because it is part of the licence fee, which reflects it. The cost argument does not really enter into this, except when a licensee breaks the safety regulations and therefore incurs penalty charges.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000268"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise to Members of the Committee because some of them like the sentiment behind the amendment but the wording causes some problems. The purpose of the amendment is to look at the question of the competition for carbon capture and storage. The Government announced that they were going to look closely at this and launch a competition for a technology that would bring about a working model for carbon capture and storage. This was welcomed by those on all sides of the House, and in many debates it was seen as an excellent situation. Indeed, knowing some of the civil servants from the DTI who were transferred to the competition team, I thought that it was excellent.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000269"></a>However, we see a problem. Due to costs&#151;this is a capital-intensive process&#151;the Government are looking at backing one technology. To a degree, that is putting all your eggs in one basket. Indeed, the Government are looking at post-combustion technology rather than pre-combustion technology. Post-combustion technology seems the more logical choice for carbon dioxide, but looking at only that in the competition rules out a

The issue is to what extent we are ruling out valuable technologies that will provide an enormous amount of cost and carbon savings.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000270"></a>These issues cannot be underestimated. At a Royal Society meeting, the figure given for the cost of carbon capture and storage was 40 per cent of the energy coming from the power station. I have been given many figures between 10 and 40 per cent. We cannot be certain to what extent there will be an energy and carbon cost in dealing with carbon until these technologies are tested. However, I hope that the Government will take this on board. We are not saying that all technologies should be assessed regardless of how abstract they are. There are issues with some of the more fanciful ideas about dealing with carbon; somebody put forward the idea that we should load nuclear waste into rockets and send it towards the sun. That is obviously not such a great idea.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000271"></a>Our issue is that the Government have talked about the value of carbon capture and storage as a new technology that many other countries will want to buy into. If we limit ourselves to one technology, which might turn out not to be the most effective over the short-to-medium term, would that not be an unfortunate position?</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000272"></a>There were discussions in another place about post-combustion technology being applicable to developing markets such as China and India, which will rely on a raft of coal to meet their energy needs. We are not suggesting anything more than a widening of the Government&#146;s ability to analyse other technologies. The current position is reasonably restrictive. If new technology comes on stream to deal with those issues, that might also fall foul of the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000273"></a>I declare an interest as a shareholder in a new technology looking at a post-combustion means of removing carbon; it will not come on line for quite some time. However, the whole issue is extremely interesting. The technologies we are now looking at might well change in very short periods of time because we are talking about such large programmes.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000274"></a>Finally, the Government deciding to go for one technology has put the stoppers on vast amounts of research and development in other areas. Whole teams have been pulled off looking at certain areas because of the Government&#146;s position, which is unfortunate. We had an early opportunity of taking the lead in wind technology and becoming one of the leading players in its development. We lost that position to the Danes, who have created a massive number of jobs and put a great deal of investment in the country to deal with that technology. As we know that this will become one of the leading technologies in dealing with climate change, it would be very unfortunate if we limit ourselves to one technology and allow other countries to develop a range of other measures. I beg to move.</p>

Arguments for both pre-combustion technology and post-combustion technology will be that no matter how good the &#147;post&#148; is, the &#147;pre&#148; will be just as valid. Governments have to make choices if they are constrained by resources. Some people would argue that this is harkening back to the old backing-winners approach to technology and all the problems that we have had over the years in that area.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80612-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000276"></a>However, there is a case for the Government to be of some assistance, but the way in which this has been portrayed is that if you do not back both technologies, the pre-combustion technology will never happen in Britain. There are more ways to attract capital, to seek tax relief, to get allowances and to get the kind of support that that technology requires. As I understand it, in a market economy, an element of risk is involved. It would appear that there is greater potential for post-combustion technology in so far as very few other countries are concentrating on it. The two countries&#151;America, and I think Norway&#151;that are looking at carbon capture have gone for &#147;pre&#148; and we are going for &#147;post&#148;. There is nothing to stop British companies joining Norwegian or American allies and getting involved. It is a gross overstatement on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, to suggest that somehow it is being outlawed. Ultimately, if you do not win, you have had to spend the money anyway and you will lose anyway. The winning is a bonus. It is not a pre-condition of starting the game that you are going to win: there will be only one winner. Several companies, universities and utilities may well want to get involved in this.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000277"></a>This is a phoney debate. If you want to have &#147;pre&#148; and &#147;post&#148;, say that and tell us that there will be two winners. If you do not want that and you say, &#147;Let us just go with &#145;pre&#146; because one or two people have been trying that out&#148;, we should get rid of &#147;post&#148;. To be honest, I do not think that this kind of ambivalence, this mugwump approach, is intellectually very robust. If we want to support carbon capture globally, we have to make choices. Governments have to shoulder that responsibility when they are resource-limited. This will not be cheap or easy and it might end up like fusion, but it is a great idea that will be realisable in anything from 20 to 35 years&#151;that being a rolling timescale.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000278"></a>I am not cynical. It can be done, but we have to have priorities. We have taken a priority that does not always suit the commercial ambitions of some of the people who are already in the field. Let us face it, if it was that good an idea and the Government had not introduced a competition, these people would have been investing anyway.</p>

To my mind we are in a global economy where alliances between companies from across the world present us with myriad opportunities. However, we are talking only in terms of the UK.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000281"></a>As regards Denmark and windmills, we did not need windmills because we had oil and gas. We did not need to get involved in it. No one thought about it. The Danes have a one-trick pony of an economy; they do not have much other than Carlsberg. They are doing rather well out of windmills. If there is such a demand for windmills in Britain, British business should set up plants to build them here. One was started in Campbeltown but folded because it could not get orders. Such was the state of the windmill industry in Britain. Let us talk about serious industry here. If Government have to get involved in it, they have to make choices and have priorities. This idea that there is a limitless pot of money that you can throw at every bright idea under the sun is not the way things are done.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000282"></a>I want carbon capture and storage to work. It seems ridiculous that we should not be able to make use of coal as one of the elements of our generating portfolio. Let us choose a model to produce this technology, but if a Norwegian or an American model works better, we can produce it under licence, as is often the case. I do not think it would make that big a difference to our economy one way or the other if we produced it under licence or if we got all the licence money ourselves. As I say, I think that we should throw this amendment out when the opportunity arises because I am sure it will reappear.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000283"></a><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08061291000459"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> I believe that the carbon capture and storage competition was driven not by any urge to wrap a Union Jack round anything but by what was seen as a global need to develop carbon capture and storage technology in the shortest possible time, primarily on climate change grounds but also on energy security grounds. We have precious little time if we are to keep atmospheric CO2 down to a reasonable level by 2050, whether you choose 450 parts or 500 parts per million. It is often not appreciated outside the industry how long it takes to develop heavy engineering&#151;we are talking about really heavy engineering here&#151;which involves learning by doing.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000284"></a>The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, rightly pointed out that all sorts of people were gearing up to do this. However, that occurred in anticipation of the competition. The competition was pretty heavily trailed with the industry and the sums that were trailed were significantly larger than the &#163;100 million that was finally announced. The implication was that there would be two or three trials. In fact, a government spokesman said at a trade meeting that it might even be more. It was on that basis that a range of industrial partners said that they would give it a go. At present capture technology is simply not economic. It adds significantly to costs. No one knows by how much until someone has done it, but conservative estimates indicate an increase of about 30 per cent in the cost of electricity. People pre-invested large sums&#151;tens of millions of pounds&#151;in a combination of public and commercial spirit in order to kick-start their position in the competition.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000285"></a>There was considerable disappointment in the industry when the actual competition was announced, but one understands that we are in financially straitened times and if that is the money that is available, that is the money that is available. Personally I believe that the Government&#146;s heart or head was in the right place when they looked at technology that could be retrofitted, particularly in developing countries which as we speak are putting coal-fired power stations at an enormous rate. Frankly, unless we or someone else come up with a technology that can control those emissions, we are in a very bad position to manage climate change.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000286"></a>The Government did not get it quite right in specifying post-combustion rather than retrofit. There are three main carbon capture technologies, two of which can be retrofitted. One is more obvious&#151;the post-combustion technology&#151;but the other, the oxyfuel or oxyburn technology, can be done as well. It would have been better if it had been specified as retrofittable rather than simply as post-combustion. But that is water under the bridge. Overall, the industry is delighted with the Bill and the reference made to carbon capture and storage; it is pretty happy with the provisions, and it sees the Bill as an important step forward.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000287"></a>I shall make a comment that is irrelevant to this debate but bears on what we were discussing before. There did not seem to be an obvious place to bring it in. I hope that it is a helpful comment. The Government may wish to consider the separate licensing of sites as distinct from the licensing of organisations. I may have missed it in the Bill but that is probably going to be quite important. There are two elements: you have to have a site that meets a range of geological criteria, which makes it a sensible place in which to operate. It could be operated by a range of different operators demonstrating particular skills and competences. The Government may want to think about making that distinction.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000288"></a><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08061291000460"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I hesitate to add anything after the words of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, on this. I understand the points made by the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill. I read all the oral evidence that was given to the Committee in another place before it had its formal sittings and I found logical the arguments of Mr Wicks&#151;the Minister who gave evidence as well as being a member of the Committee; it was a slightly strange process&#151;that this technology was the one most likely to be sold.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000289"></a>What has not been recognised is the penalty for having gone down that road. I was given a briefing the other day by the oil company ConocoPhillips, which had the very large potential of a combined heat and power plant at Immingham, which would have involved pre-combustion technology. The company had taken that a considerable way, until the competition was announced and it was said that it would be post-combustion. I was told that the company has now moved its team of experts to California and will do it there instead. I shall not weary the Committee with all the figures that have been given, but it appeared to me, as a result of what the company said, that what it could have achieved in carbon reduction through combined heat and power using a pre-combustion technique was very substantially in excess of what  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be achieved by any other process. When the Government took their decision, which Malcolm Wicks enlarged on in the other place, did they realise that that would be the consequence? Perhaps the Minister will say that this substantial plant would not be able to proceed at this stage. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, said that you can license the process from somewhere else, such as California, but that is not as good as doing it oneself.</p>
<h5><a name="08061291000382"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000290"></a>There has been some discussion of the efficiency and cost penalties of CCS. The figures provided to me show that the efficiency percentage for an integrated combined cycle plant with no CCS is 38.4 per cent. If that plant must then have CCS, that figure falls to 31.2 per cent. In terms of increased costs, a coal plant will produce electricity at about &#163;30 per megawatt hour, a gas plant at slightly more and offshore wind at considerably more. A CCS coal plant takes that cost up to &#163;47. It must be realised that there is a substantial cost penalty with the technology as currently envisaged.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000291"></a>I am a strong supporter of developing this technology in one form or another, because the world has huge reserves of coal. As was pointed out in the International Energy Agency&#146;s compelling report, as reported in last weekend&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>, coal demand in 2005 was equivalent to just less than 3,000 million tonnes of oil. By 2050, that has multiplied by three under the business-as-usual scenario. That will be an enormous increase because of economics and availability. In those circumstances, as the IEA says, to go ahead without carbon capture and storage would mean that there was no chance of reaching any of the CO2 reduction targets that have been mooted not only in the European Community but internationally.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000292"></a><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08061291000461"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I am not clear about what the noble Lord said about coal generation. Was it combined heat and power that cost &#163;30, or was that simple generation?</p>

The main use of this will of course be with coal. As I was saying, the IEA has pointed out the huge reserves and the indication that they will be burnt over the next 20 to 30 years, come what may. To do that without CCS would jettison any idea of achieving the targets. The figures from ConocoPhillips I quoted earlier were based on its presumption of what it would be doing with the combined heat and power plant at Immingham.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000294"></a>One must recognise that Governments must make choices. Anyone who has been in government recognises that, and they are not easy choices. One cannot do everything. However, there is a price to pay for the Government&#146;s decision. It will be seen to pay off only if the winner of the competition produces workable technology that can be sold in other countries. I am told that the Government are shortly to announce the candidates for the competition, and that it will be a further 12 months before a decision can be taken on which candidates should go ahead and, as it were, do the demonstration plant.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC295"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000295"></a>There is another aspect that I would like to touch on. What are the Government going to pay for in that competition? As I understand it, and I have seen the original presentation by Mr Hutton, they will pay for the CCS plant, for the transport of the sequestrated CO2 and then for the storage of the sequestrated CO2. I have been asking in Questions for Written Answer what plans the Government have for establishing some sort of a CO2 grid. Is this going to become a widely used technology? Some of the scenarios that the ConocoPhillips people have been talking about would involve a significant grid, whereby people producing CO2 can discharge it into the grid and it can then be transported offshore and go into the oil fields. As was said earlier, the depleted oil and gas fields seem to be the best possible location.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000296"></a>The plant that the Government are going to support will presumably have a pipeline to meet the needs of that particular plant. It is not like an electricity grid, where once you put it in it is there and can take a substantial expansion. This will be a pipe for that plant. How far are the Government going to recognise that, if the technology is going to take off, from the start there needs to be the beginnings of a CO2 grid? Otherwise, it is not going to work.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000297"></a>This final point, which has been made to me not least by Dr Chapman, the chief executive of the CCSA, is that there is a feeling in the industry that the Government, having now announced their competition, are simply now going to sit back and wait for the results. What I am being told is that there is at the moment no incentive for anyone else to do anything about it. When the Prime Ministers met at the European Council in the spring of last year, they produced the requirement, under &#147;Energy Technologies&#148;, which,</p>
<ul><a name="08061291000366"></a>&#147;urges Member States and the Commission to work towards strengthening R&amp;D and developing the necessary technical, economic and regulatory framework to bring environmentally safe carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to deployment with new fossil-fuel power plants ... welcomes the Commission&#146;s intention to establish a mechanism to stimulate the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 demonstration plants&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000298"></a>The problem everyone else sees with that is that it may be an admirable aspiration, but the Community has done absolutely nothing to bring it about. Individual countries, like our own, are moving ahead with the demonstration project, and I applaud that. At the same time, under the previous paragraph, where is the economic framework to which other countries are going to be able to look to see where this all begins? The Bill provides a regulatory framework, which is certainly important, but there is no financial framework. That is what is lacking. If we are really to see carbon capture and storage move ahead, there has got to be a more positive approach to providing incentives and encouragement to companies to do the work. That may involve a lot of companies with different sorts of technologies that can then be put together. That is what we are lacking in this area. &#147;We have a demonstration plant; let us wait and see what happens&#148;; that is the feeling that there is. I do not find that very satisfactory.</p>

I share the views expressed by my noble  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend Lord O&#146;Neill. However, this competition is about looking not only at how to capture carbon but at how to bring together capture, transport and storage. Those issues will be addressed by the winners of the competition. How that is done is as important as the technology of capturing carbon. If you cannot transport and store it cost-effectively, it does not matter how efficient your capture process is. This is about much more than carbon capture; hence, it is to be warmly welcomed. I will come back to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000300"></a>There are questions about the financing of the successful competitor, and the noble Lord touched on many of them. In the end, however, this will work financially only if carbon is expensive enough. That is what this really comes down to. You can state-aid as much as you want in the experiment. I noted that the Government have ambitiously said somewhere that the financial support is for about 15 years, at the end of which they hope&#151;rather than expect&#151;that carbon capture, storage and transport will be financially viable.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000301"></a>Will the Minister, simply to update us, say whether the Government are optimistic, now that the price of carbon looks as though it is firming up in the years ahead, that by the end of the period for the winner of this scheme&#151;I think it is up to 15 years&#151;these carbon schemes will be financially viable? Much depends on the price of carbon, but, as I understand it, carbon storage does not qualify under the European Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon credits. Am I right? If I am, will that change? If so, when will it change? If carbon capture does not qualify, it will clearly be a disaster. I assume that the latest Commission consultation paper says something about this. It is clearly an important issue.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000302"></a>This technology also bears on discussions that we had on the Climate Change Bill and on disagreements that were aired across the Chamber, not least between the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and me on whether CDMs will be allowable. China and India will be devastatingly badly hit if Europe and the UK limit the CDMs that qualify. Again, that will affect the financial liability of those schemes. These things are linked together in the end as they progress around the world.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000303"></a>On pipelines and a network, a number of schemes are being proposed, the most promising of which seem to be on new-build power stations rather than on retrofitted old ones. That is really quite interesting. I declare an interest as I was for a number of years chair of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Energy forum, which brought together producers and users of energy. Earlier this week, I visited Drax with the All-Party Group on Energy Studies. In Yorkshire, there is a proposal for a new build in Hatfield and a pipeline across to the south of the Humber Estuary, but with the intention of linking it to Ferrybridge, Eggborough, Drax and Killingholme. In other words, it recognises that in a part of the country where something like 17 per cent of the UK&#146;s electricity is generated by coal, if we do not retrofit carbon capture technology into the Yorkshire and Humber region&#146;s power stations, we will not make a big dent in emissions from coal.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000304"></a>It is enormously important that schemes that come forward are able to make sense of the transport schemes that prevent every coal-fired power station having its

That seems to be madness. I would not expect the Minister to make any comment today because competitions are on and submissions will be in, but it is enormously important that proposals are considered that have a hope of building up a proper transport network as well as dealing with the technology issue. I would be grateful if the Minister could inform the Committee about where we stand on carbon emissions capped in this way in the Emissions Trading Scheme. That is a fundamental issue.</p>

Most CDMs are traded by commercial organisations that have no interest in the UK carbon account concept, so it does not affect the demand for them among commercial organisations. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, is right&#151;and I know the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has said this many times in this House&#151;about the price of carbon. It is the only way that this will work within a market area, as the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, rightly highlighted. I do not think it is in that scheme at the moment, but it needs to be in it post-2012.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000306"></a>To make sure that that price of carbon happens, are the Government insisting in the EU-ETS post-2012 negotiations that the power industry pays through auction for all its allocation of EU-ETS? Once that regulation is laid down at European level, that is the way the price of carbon comes in. I looked at the spot price a couple of weeks ago, and phase 2 of the EU-ETS is between 20 and 30 euros, which shows the credibility of that scheme. I know it gets more complicated outside the energy industry where there are international competition issues, but within the power industry we do not have them, and auctioning post-2012 EUAs is fundamental to making this technology work.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000341"></a>which is 27 euros. The headline to the article says that the IEA is arguing that if we are to achieve the CO2 reductions that are now being sought by 2050, that will have to rise to $200 a tonne, which will make it very expensive. We cannot get rid of CO2 without recognising that there are huge expenses. Would the noble Lord agree with that?</p>

The noble Lord is right that this is not an easy thing. If all sides of the Committee accept that we need to move into that area, there is a heavy cost to pay. The only thing that one can say about it is that, given how little the big changes in the price of oil have affected the economy in the first stages, maybe the global economy can find a way. However, it is going to be quite a challenge.</p>

There is a risk, even after a competition and trial scheme, and emission allowances are effectively by plant. This is a way of providing risk capital. I am entirely in favour of substantial auctioning, but there is an argument for a proportion of allowances to be allocated free to power generators only if they spend money on installing carbon capture.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, that it is important that a scheme designed to encourage innovation through a competition should not prejudice any particular approach.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000311"></a>While we are not yet convinced that the amendment is necessary, we support the principle behind it. It cannot be denied that dithering cost the United Kingdom the installation of the carbon capture and storage facility that BP proposed for Peterhead. We sincerely hope that more delay will not cost the United Kingdom the benefit of future projects, just as we hope that the Government will not engage in picking winners that might suppress better technologies from emerging.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000312"></a><a name="80612-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08061291000469"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken on this humble amendment, which has covered most energy policy&#151;certainly that on carbon capture and storage. I am grateful for the range of contributions to the debate, not least that of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, who responded accurately to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, using phrases that would perhaps not be entirely appropriate from the more dispassionate position of the government Front Bench. Nevertheless, he gave a real riposte to some of the points of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000313"></a>At that time, however, we were still largely concerned with the amendment; I confess that we have subsequently been concerned with energy policy. I will do my best to answer the points of Members of the Committee, but they will forgive me for being ill equipped to deal with some of the more general ones. Initially, however, I must at least put the amendment into some kind of context, and give the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale his due. He has put forward an amendment which deserves a government response.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000314"></a>I am conscious that the ground has been prepared for detailed discussions, both in the other place and during the House of Lords debate on Second Reading, on the broad issues of carbon capture and storage, particularly the competition for the demonstration project. However, I emphasise again what the Bill is meant to achieve. The Government&#146;s commitment to all carbon capture technologies is clear. The key reason  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the Government making a technology choice for our competition for a commercial-scale demonstration project is obvious. The project already involves the Government committing hundreds of millions of pounds, and it is inconceivable for us to put the same level of investment into the range of potential technologies available. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is absolutely right. As always, he identified with great accuracy aspects of the costs of the choice that is made. There will be the costs for those who are disappointed. We know immediately that one British company was severely disappointed at the origins of this, having taken a lead on this work. In its view, the way in which the competition was set up was not entirely appropriate. My noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill identified why the Government are bound to make some choices, which is the nature of the exercise.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000315"></a>I want to emphasise that the Bill is an enabling framework which will allow the safe storage of carbon dioxide offshore, paving the way for wider deployment of carbon capture technologies. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, expressed it in terms of the grid. I do not have anything positive to say in response to that, except that in the not too distant future, clearly, there is no point in getting the industry fitted with the necessary technology to capture the carbon if we cannot get it to safe storage. That implies the nature of the grid.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000316"></a>The Government are not out to regulate which technologies may be deployed in various ways or to regulate the activity of carbon capture at all. That is not what this Bill is about. It simply provides a regime to regulate the activity of the storage of carbon dioxide offshore. Although I respect entirely the opportunity which the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has brought forward to advocate other aspects of carbon capture, the provisions in the Bill are technology neutral. It does not specify what technology should be employed.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000317"></a>There is a unity among all sides of the Committee that the potential contribution that the technologies can make to tackling global climate change is very significant. The Stern review estimates that carbon capture and storage could contribute up to 28 per cent of the carbon dioxide reductions needed by 2050, if the aim of restricting the temperature increase to 2 degrees is to be achieved. We must remain focused on carbon capture and storage as a global solution to climate change.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000318"></a>My noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill identified that other countries are pursuing different strategies. Certainly, it will be appreciated that in Norway and the United States there are different approaches. This Government support a range of carbon capture technologies through a variety of different means. In April 2008, the Environmental Transformation Fund was set up to encourage and fund industry-led demonstration of carbon abatement technology projects, which includes components of CCS. To date, some &#163;2.2 million has been granted as funding to one project. We have put &#163;8.8 million into various research projects that are supported by the research councils and the Technology Strategy Board. My noble friend Lord Woolmer introduced the point that it is crucial that the Emissions Trading Scheme should take account of carbon capture  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and storage issues, which we are pressing for. We have some optimistic responses on that. I am not sure that I am able to quite commit the Government to a date of achievement on that or any matters relating to negotiations in Europe, but I emphasise that the directive on this was introduced on 23 January 2008 and we would hope that it will be negotiated by the end of the year. But my noble friend will recognise that that is bound to be an aspiration and not a government policy, as EU directives generally require a certain amount of negotiation.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000319"></a>The only area on which the Government have made a deliberate choice is in relation to the competition for a demonstration project. Of course, there are powerful reasons for having done so, and I am sure that noble Lords will have heard through debate in this Committee about the nature of those reasons. We have also seen the formation of the Energy Technologies Institute, which also considers CCS as one of its possible future technology themes. That has a budget of &#163;1 billion and brings together government and some of the world&#146;s biggest companies with a view to accelerating the development of low-carbon energy technologies towards commercial deployment.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000320"></a>Not all the eggs are in one basket. That is the point that I seek to emphasise. We also take on board the point that others may make breakthroughs in other countries from which we derive development. What is absolutely clear is that without this technological breakthrough the capacity to reach 2050 targets is greatly limited.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000321"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, pressed me very hard, so I want to emphasise that we did look to see whether it was possible to have a competition inviting more than one technology. Of course, the issue came down to the question of cost. I understand what the noble Lord says on the pre-combustion techniques; there is potential within the competition for wider technological breakthroughs than the narrow one that he apostrophised. I am not able to avoid the obvious fact, when he complains that that choice was made, that there were costs involved. While companies were planning pre-combustion projects&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, identified exactly that fact&#151;a choice had to be made by the Government, and it was so done.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000322"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that the issue does not stop there, however. It is important that a range of initiatives are pursued; the Government will give what support they can in these terms. The only way in which the amendment might be relevant to the Bill is if the Bill circumscribed, checked and controlled the potential for other opportunities. That is not the Bill&#146;s intention and it is not what the Bill does. That is why I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on having taken advantage of this opportunity to present the case as he has for pre-combustion technology, but the Bill is not an inhibiting factor in those terms. That is why his amendment is not necessary and I hope that in due course he will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000323"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, for putting all these issues into an erudite context. He is right that the issue of choice involves costs and represents  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC301"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the cost bond by the Government, but he is right, too, when he says that on the whole the industry is supportive of this measure. It is aware that despite the fact that the competition involved a choice by the Government, the Bill itself is open-minded about the question of development of technologies. That is why it has the breadth that it has and why I would want to resist today any suggestion that the Bill provides a constraint on fertile developments, which must be grasped if we are going to make the necessary progress.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000324"></a>I am not sure whether I should be speaking on general energy policy, ill qualified as I am to do so; but I have been forced to do so by the nature of the questions addressed today. To go back to the amendment, it has been the trigger for a very significant debate and has raised very significant questions, which we all need to address. I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that it would not aid the Bill&#146;s openness or its technology-neutral quality for the amendment to be accepted. I hope that therefore he will withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="08061291000325"></a><a name="80612-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80612-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061291000470"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> The debate has been rather wider than I expected and has riled some noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, said that the amendment should be thrown out. Some of his comments were extremely interesting, particularly as regards buying in technology from the States. However, that would add to the fuel costs for any generator in this country if the technology was not developed here. We could develop the technology here. That was one of the reasons for the competition. I am not against the role the Government have played in backing carbon capture and storage; I welcome it. I never suggested that the Bill&#146;s provisions setting out a means for disposing of carbon dioxide in the North Sea were not very worthy. I did not question that at all, although the Minister gave the impression that I had.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000326"></a>The Minister mentioned Stern. The real issue here is that carbon capture and storage is seen as one of our main planks in dealing with carbon dioxide. I take him back about four or five years to a debate in which he said that carbon dioxide did not have a cost, which  


<notus-date day="12" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC302"></a><b>12 Jun 2008 : Column GC302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was the case at the time. However, it has a significant cost now. I was surprised when the tradable value of carbon dioxide was mentioned as I thought that was slightly wide of our discussion. However, this is becoming one of the main issues as regards energy generation. Later amendments deal with carbon dioxide being one of the main costs of energy generation.</p>

<a name="80612-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061291000327"></a>We do not object to the Government holding a competition. We realise that there were very many reasons why they took the route they did down one avenue. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that the industry was slightly disappointed with the amount of money available. In one respect that is very unfortunate because this will take an enormous amount of pump priming. I say to the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, that to develop some of these technologies requires government money; it does not come from industry alone. The risk factors are enormous. When we are talking about companies spending, and wasting, tens of millions of pounds&#151;as has happened, especially with BP&#151;that is a signal which the market takes on board. If schemes are abandoned, it will be much more difficult to get others started in future. The Minister made the fair point that the market is open for any company to come forward and produce this technology. However, given the problems that have arisen in the past couple of years, you would have to be a very brave chief executive indeed to take that route, especially in the current credit market. However, I take the Minister&#146;s points on board. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<I>Financial Stability </I><I>Arrangements</I><I>: Supervision, </I><I>including</I><I> an Update of the Roadmaps</I><I>&#151;</I>Ministers agreed a unified set of council conclusions on arrangements on financial stability and supervision, building on the EFC draft council conclusions on supervision and an update of the road maps on the review of the Lamfalussy process, the strengthening EU arrangements for financial stability, and on actions taken in response to the financial turmoil. The UK supports this work, which should help ensure that actions taken by the EU complement those taking place at international level. The UK also welcomes the inclusion in the conclusions of the UK proposals for supervisory colleges, intended to improve cross-border supervisory co-operation.<I>Communication on Financial Education</I>&#151;The council agreed to conclusions on financial education, which suggested some initiatives and practical assistance for helping member states to improve the levels of financial education within their countries. The UK recognises the potential value of this work, on which the UK has a strong track record at domestic level.<I>White Paper on </I><I>Mortgage</I><I> Credits</I>&#151;Member states agreed to council conclusions on a possible single market for mortgages.

Member states were unable to agree council conclusions on VAT fraud, and will return to the subject at future meetings of ECOFIN. The Commission also committed to bring forward in the autumn new proposals on conventional measures to combat fraud. The UK remains strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against missing trader intra-community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.<I>Savings Taxation</I>&#151;The Commission provided an informal oral report on the functioning of the savings tax directive in view of recent developments involving Liechtenstein investment vehicles and following the request of the March ECOFIN Council. In recognition of the importance of ongoing work to combat tax evasion, Ministers and the Commission agreed an accelerated timetable for the production of the final report, which the Commission will produce and will then be followed up by specific proposals on extending the directive. The UK strongly supports the Commission's continued dialogue with third countries with a view to bringing them into the savings tax directive.<I>Good Governance in the Tax Area</I><I>&#151;</I>Member states agreed conclusions containing a specific provision on good governance in the tax area.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08061270000059"></a>Political agreement was achieved on the working time and agency workers directives. A good outcome was achieved for the UK on both these important dossiers. On working time, we secured the continued right for individuals to opt out of the 48 hour week, with no suggestion of end date or phasing out (for which many others have pressed); a work-life balance provision that is in keeping with current UK policy on the right to request flexible working; a secure solution to the problems raised by the SiMAP and Jaegar judgments meaning that inactive on-call time does not have to count as working time; satisfactory safeguards on use of the opt-out, with necessary flexibility for short-term contracts; and a maximum cap of 60- 65 hours, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08061270000060"></a>The agreed text on agency workers will enable us to implement the recent CBI-TUC agreement in full, setting a 12-week qualifying period for equal treatment and addressing a number of subsidiary issues as set out in that agreement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08061270000062"></a>Political agreement was reached on a council decision on the 2008-10 Employment Guidelines. The presidency and Commission emphasised the primary importance of their implementation and the chairman of the Employment Committee presented an opinion from the committee on youth unemployment, which he hoped would be helpful to the council as the Lisbon deadlines approach.</p>

The UK stated our commitment to increasing skills for all, including young people and disadvantaged groups, by 2020. This was essential in the face of globalisation and there is a useful role for collaboration at European level on analysis and policy responses. The European Skills Review would also be invaluable in this respect.</p>

France also expects to deal with the European Parliament opinions on the Agency Workers and Working Time Directive.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="08061270000076"></a>We expect the June European Council to focus on the policy implications of high global food and commodity prices, including oil.  We need a co-ordinated international response to the challenges posed, and ensure that we do all in our power to maintain open markets, fair trade and sustainable economic growth. We will push for all partners to reaffirm their development commitments and give fresh impetus to the achievement of the millennium development goals. We expect some discussion of Lisbon treaty implementation, though we continue to stress that no decisions can be made prior to ratification of the treaty. We also expect discussions on freedom, security and justice, and will be pushing for heads&#146; consideration of EU input into external relations priorities such as western Balkans, Burma and Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="08061270000079"></a>Kosovo, Serbia, and Macedonia will probably be the focus of discussion. On Kosovo, Ministers will discuss the adoption of the new constitution on 15 June

The Government continue to support the reconfiguration of international presences in Kosovo, which should continue and intensify following the adoption of the new constitution. On Serbia, Ministers are likely to discuss the latest developments in ongoing coalition negotiations. The Government continue to hope a new Serbian Government will make further progress towards the EU. On Macedonia, Ministers are likely to discuss the recent elections and the reruns that will have taken place on 15 June. The Government are strongly concerned over incidents of electoral malpractice and violence and looks to the Macedonian Government to take the necessary action to prosecute those involved.  It also hopes the new Macedonian Government will continue to press ahead with reforms needed to progress towards the EU.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="08061270000080"></a>In addition to discussion in these areas, Ministers will also sign Bosnia-Herzegovina&#146;s stabilisation and association agreement. The Government welcome this progress and look forward to Bosnia and Herzegovina building on the agreement to advance reforms.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="08061270000082"></a>Ministerial discussion is expected to focus on the situation on the ground in Gaza, the West Bank and southern Israel, highlighting the need for progress on the political process. Discussion may also focus on the EU&#146;s relationship with Israel ahead of the EU-Israel Association Council which will be held the same day. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is expected to debrief partners on his 8 to 9 June visit to Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="08061270000083"></a>On Lebanon, the Government welcomed the Doha agreement that brought an end to last month&#146;s crisis in Lebanon. President Sleiman&#146;s election provides and opportunity to rebuild political and economically in the interests of all communities in Lebanon. Agreement on a Government of National Unity is a crucial next step.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="08061270000084"></a>The Government are committed to supporting the process initiated at Annapolis, which has put the Israelis and Palestinians on a path to real negotiations in 2008, leading to a final settlement of two states living side by side in peace and security.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="08061270000086"></a>Conclusions on the Great Lakes region are expected to acknowledge the progress made towards peace in the region in recent months. The conclusions will emphasise member states&#146; duty to act to prevent support from reaching the Hutu FDLR militia. The Government recognise the role played by the FDLR in destabilising the region and firmly support such action by EU partners. The GAERC will also focus on the continued suffering caused by abuses of human rights in DRC and call for reform of the security sector in that country. Respect for the rule of law and an end to impunity for those guilty of the worst abuses of the civilian population are crucial. Embedding them is part of a wider effort to improve governance and security as DRC emerges from conflict.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="08061270000088"></a>We expect detailed conclusions on Sudan, expressing concern over the recent fighting in Abyei, urging respect of the north-south comprehensive peace agreement. We also support conclusions that condemn the Justice and Equality Movement's attack on Omdurman on 10 May. We supported discussion of further measures against any party impeding the Darfur peace process, blocking UNAMID aid or obstructing humanitarian access.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="08061270000092"></a>We expect detailed discussion of Iran at this GAERC, following the visit of Javier Solana and E3 political directors to Tehran. Solana will brief on the trip and his delivery of the refreshed E3+3 engagement offer. Following the commitment at the December European Council to consider further EU action in light of a new UN Security Council resolution, the Government fully support the strengthening EU sanctions and will continue to press partners to take a firm stand on this issue. We will be pressing for a robust EU implementation of UN Security Council resolution in July in the form of a new common position.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="08061270000094"></a>The Government expect discussion of China to focus on the upcoming Olympics and attendance by EU heads of Government/state. Following links made between the March violence in Tibet and calls to boycott the Olympics, the European Parliament has called for a common position on member state attendance; a call which the Government do not support. The Government will be stating that it is for individual member states to decide on Olympics attendance and that our position is clear; my right honourable friend the Olympics Minister will attend the opening ceremony and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will attend the closing ceremony. The Government are opposed to boycotts of any part of the Olympics, whether at national or EU level.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="08061270000096"></a>Although discussion of this topic is not yet a certainty, it is likely to focus on the process of the Doha negotiations over the coming weeks. The Government expect partners to express a range of views both on the current state of the negotiations and on the content of the revised texts (issued on 19 May). The Government strongly support the negotiating process led by WTO director-general, Pascal Lamy, and our objective at the GAERC will be to ensure continued member state support for the European Commission, in order that it can negotiate the best possible DDA deal in 2008.</p>

We will also seek to draw the council's attention to the continued lack of political progress, the regime's unacceptable decision to press ahead with its bogus referendum and to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi by a further year. </p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="08061270000103"></a>In December 2006, we consulted on proposed changes to charges for use of the Dartford Crossing to address continuing congestion pressures. The proposals were to tailor charges better to the conditions at the crossing, including raising cash charges to &#163;1.50 for cars in the daytime and removing charges altogether at night when traffic flows more freely.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="08061270000104"></a>In response to that consultation exercise, there were calls to introduce a discount scheme for local residents.

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="08061270000105"></a>We launched a consultation on the local discount scheme on 16 February 2008, and it closed on 16 May 2008. Sixty-seven responses were received.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="08061270000106"></a>The Government are today publishing a summary of responses and our conclusions following the consultation exercise. I am placing copies in the Library of the House. The Government have taken careful note of the responses received and have concluded that the scheme should be implemented as proposed, subject to removing to the requirement for an initial sum to be credited to accounts. The key proposals relating to eligibility, the annual administration fee, entitlement to 50 free journeys, and journeys charged at 20p thereafter, are confirmed.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="08061270000110"></a>Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="08061270000111"></a>The level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on operational advice.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="08061270000112"></a>Control orders continue to be an essential tool to protect the public from terrorism, particularly where it is not possible to prosecute individuals for terrorism-related activity and, in the case of foreign nationals, where they cannot be removed from the UK.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="08061270000113"></a>As stated in previous quarterly Statements on control orders, control order obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and are based on the terrorism-related risk that each individual poses. Each control order is kept under regular review to ensure that the obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold Control Order Review Groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review, and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, five CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

One further non-derogating control order was made but has not yet been served.</p>

Two individuals subject to a control order live in the Metropolitan Police Service area; the remaining individuals live in other police force areas.

A right of appeal exists in Sections 10(1) and 10(3) of the 2005 Act respectively against decisions by the Secretary of State to renew a non-derogating control order or modify an obligation imposed by a non-derogating control order without consent, and against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse a request by a

<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="08061270000117"></a>Four judgments have been handed down by the High Court in control order cases during this reporting period. Three of these judgments have related to the substantive reviews of control orders under Section 3(10) of the 2005 Act. A judgment in the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AE was handed down on 20 March 2008; the court upheld the necessity of the control order on national security grounds and ruled that the control order hearing complied with Article 6 of the ECHR. In the same judgment, the court dismissed an appeal by AE against the increase in the length of his curfew, but upheld an appeal relating to the restrictions on visitors to AE&#146;s residence. On 9 April 2008, a judgment was handed down in the case of Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AF. The court found that further disclosure of closed material by the Secretary of State would be necessary in order for the hearing to comply with Article 6 of the ECHR. The control order remains in force while an appeal by the Secretary of State is considered by the Court of Appeal.</p>

The court upheld the necessity of the control order on national security grounds and ruled that the control order was compliant Article 5 and Article 3. The court also ruled that the hearing complied with Article 6 of the ECHR. In addition, an oral judgment was handed down in the case of GG on 2 May 2008 in which an application for interim relief was refused by the High Court.</p>

Appeals were lodged on Article 6 grounds against the High Court judgments in the cases of AN and AM which were handed down in the previous reporting period. An appeal was also lodged against the judgment in the case of AF handed down on 9 April 2008. Three appeals have been lodged by, or on behalf of, controlled persons with the Court of Appeal. AE is challenging the judgment handed down on 20 March 2008 on Article 5 and Article 6 grounds. Special advocates in the case of AF have lodged an appeal against the closed judgment handed down on 9 April 2008. AH has applied for permission to appeal the judgment handed down on 9 May 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="08061270000124"></a>We are determined to unlock the talent and potential of all our people. We therefore need to give people the skills that will be required in today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s labour market.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="08061270000125"></a>To achieve this, we are extending entitlements to training for young adults in work and also looking at how everybody can have their own personal skills account so that they can get the training that they need and the jobs that they want.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="08061270000126"></a>The right skills are crucial to getting people who are out of work into a decent job or helping them start their own business. They are also crucial to getting a better job, too. We will now make sure that when people sign on for benefits, they sign up for skills as well. Increasingly, addressing skills needs, where they are preventing someone returning to work, will be an important part of receiving out-of-work benefit.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="08061270000127"></a>The paper also shows how we are radically improving the delivery of our welfare and skills services. This will ensure our services work more closely together, and that they are driven by those who know best how to shape support to meet local needs.</p>

<a name="80612-wms0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="08061270000128"></a>With this package of proposals we will develop the talents and skills of our people and build stronger foundations for the future success of Britain and her people.</p>
