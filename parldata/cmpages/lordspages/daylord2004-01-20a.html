<a name="40120-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Draft Disability Discrimination Bill: Timetable</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their proposed timescale for the draft Disability Discrimination Bill.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, the draft Discrimination Disability Bill will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. We expect the committee to report at the end of April and that we shall publish our response in the summer. The legislative programme for the next Session of Parliament will be announced in the usual way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that practically all of the major disability organisations have given a very warm welcome to the Bill because of its important provisions and that practically all of these organisations are concerned that there may be an undue delay because it is only a draft Bill? In view of the fact that we have had consultations for more than four years with disabled people, business, trade unions and the public sector, will the Government try to expedite the enactment of the Bill so that disabled people can soon get the extra protection against discrimination that the Bill will afford?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, it is our intention that the Bill will be passed this Parliament, although obviously I cannot pre-empt exactly what will be in the Queen's Speech.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that, while the draft Bill is welcome, there is widespread concern that it has not been introduced as a substantive Bill at this stage? The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, said that there have been years of widespread consultation and a general consensus seems to have been reached. Will she tell us which particular aspects of the Bill made it necessary to send it to a Joint Committee? Are we to understand from what she has just said that the substantive Bill will not be introduced in this Session and that instead we shall have procrastination in the Joint Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I would not use words such as procrastination; that is quite inappropriate. There are procedures, including roll-over, which are available to the usual channels, if that <P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is what they want to pursue. To go back to the substance of the noble Lord's question, Bert Massie, who is the chair of the Disability Rights Commission, said this month:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The pre-legislative scrutiny process offers to engage a wide range of stakeholders in understanding the current law and benefits of the proposed changes as well as to explore ways in which the Bill might be further strengthened to the benefit of disabled people".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-01_para0"></a>I think that answers the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give us some indication of the Government's thinking about the implementation of any final Bill? One of the problems with the original legislation was that it took so long to be implemented that it went from being a long-term project, to a medium-term project, to a panic. Can we make sure that there will be better planning over time for the final implementation of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords. That is again where we would expect the support of the scrutiny committee. I am sure your Lordships are aware of the membership of that body. It includes, for example, from your Lordships' House&#151;it will be on the Order Paper tomorrow&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Addington, Lord Carter, Lord Rix, Lord Swinfen and Lord Tebbit, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins. Given that degree of strength on the Scrutiny Committee&#151;I do not know about your Lordships but the committee certainly terrifies me&#151;I am confident that they will not allow any such delay or hesitation in implementation as the noble Lord suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, for how long do the Government expect the Bill to remain a draft? Are the Government already receiving proposed amendments and additions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I had attempted to answer that. I clearly did not. This is a draft scrutiny Bill. The committee will be receiving the evidence and reporting to the Government by the end of April. It is our intention that a Bill will be introduced into Parliament and completed before this Parliament ends. We are on track to meet our manifesto commitments in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, I, too, most warmly welcome the Government's enormous progress in this field and congratulate my noble friend and her ministerial colleagues, more especially, of course, Maria Eagle, as Minister for disabled people. But can my noble friend say whether the draft Bill will be available in all the different formats necessary to make it accessible to blind people and others in need of them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords. My noble friend is right, it is important that, if one is having a draft scrutiny process, all possible stakeholders are aware of the issues involved. As a result, the Bill is already available in Braille, it is on the DWP's website and by the end of the week there will <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be an easy-reading version for people with learning difficulties. I have a draft with me. It has cartoons and so on and may be of particular appeal to your Lordships. Also, and more interestingly, if I may say so, by the end of the month we expect to have a video available in British Sign Language. All of the obvious formats are covered in ways that probably have not been done before in legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, as much as the Bill is enabling in nature, will my noble friend give an assurance that the draft regulations will be made available at the earliest opportunity so that the Joint Committee can give proper scrutiny to the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that the regulations will not be ready in draft form while the committee is sitting but that the officials intend to submit an explanatory memorandum describing the import of the regulations which I trust will be of value to the committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the definition of disability could be improved to include people with mental health problems who currently have a lot of problems and suffer a great deal of discrimination in getting benefits and claiming protection under the DDA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords. The definition of disability, as opposed to sickness, is that it is long-standing and has an adverse effect on daily life. It tends to mean, for example, that if somebody has severe mental health problems, they would normally have lasted perhaps 12 months or be of a recurring nature. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that it is one of the biggest growth areas, if I can use that phrase. Of the increasing numbers of people claiming disability benefit, nearly one-third have mental health problems and learning difficulties. They are people who find it extremely difficult to re-enter work, whereas people with what would appear to be more severe disabilities, such as blindness or deafness, actually manage to re-enter the labour market more effectively. I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that it is a very difficult area. I certainly compliment the Schizophrenia Fellowship and the Richmond Fellowship on the work that they do in trying to help people with severe mental health problems to build their confidence and re-enter the labour market. As I say, this is an extremely difficult area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to hear what the Minister said about including cartoons for those who have difficulty reading. Is she aware that 10 per cent of the population have dyslexia? Is the Bill written in accordance with the recommendations of the Dyslexia Association whereby the correct fonts, the correct spacing and the correct colour of paper are used? Has she followed those recommendations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that that has been done regarding <P>


<a name="column_898"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 898</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>font size and so on. However, I shall check on the point about colour as that also affects people with red/green colour blindness, not just dyslexics.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Greaves </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they intend to carry out a review of the voting system for Westminster elections following the European elections next June, to be co-ordinated by the Department for Constitutional Affairs.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, no decision has yet been made on the timing and structure of the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I have prepared two supplementary questions, one in the event that the Answer was yes and one in the event that it was no. However, I am not sure which Answer I have been given except that the Minister responding to the Question is not the constitutional affairs Minister. Will the Minister confirm the report in the Independent of 23 December last year that states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"SECRET TALKS between the Government and the Liberal Democrats over reforming the voting system have begun in a move which could see the abolition of the first-past-the-post method"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-01_para1"></a>I am not asking about the last part of that quotation but about the first part. The article continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The review is expected to be co-ordinated by the [wrong] Department",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-01_para2"></a>but nevertheless we now know which department it will be. Will the Minister confirm that a promise of such a review was to be found in the Labour manifesto at the previous general election? Will he also confirm that his reply meant that such a review is to take place but the Government have not yet decided when and how?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the 2001 manifesto clearly set out our commitment to review the experience of the new systems and the Jenkins report to assess whether changes might be made to the actual system of elections to the House of Commons. As to the report <P>


<a name="column_899"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 899</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the Independent, which I read with interest as one always does with newspaper reports, I think that the noble Lord is much better placed than I am to check with Charles Kennedy whether he considers that to have been an accurate newspaper report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister bear in mind that what are referred to in the Question as "Westminster elections" are elections to the sovereign Parliament of the United Kingdom, and that it is important that the government of the day should have the choice of the timing of those elections within five years rather than that choice becoming subject to any kind of European influence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, on the first point, the Question is, indeed, about the electoral system to the sovereign Parliament of the United Kingdom, more specifically to the House of Commons. On the second point, there is no focus to my knowledge of this being about any European regulation or directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, in considering the review, will my noble friend give particular attention to the Westminster voting system in Northern Ireland where the situation is rather different from the rest of the United Kingdom, where there is a different voting system for European elections anyway and where a fairer result might be achieved by a change in the system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware that in Northern Ireland for all elections apart from elections to the House of Commons STV is the electoral system that is used. One knows well the history and reasons for that having been introduced in the Province. No doubt that is one of the issues that would be on the list for consideration when a review is carried out.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister made any assessment of the impact of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 which brought in closed lists and which was valiantly opposed by my late noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, as the noble Lord will remember? Has he made any assessment of the impact of that on all elections and on voter turnout in those elections?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I think the likelihood of there being an impact from the closed list system regarding European elections on other electoral systems is fairly remote. As to the impact of closed list systems on turnout, voter confidence or any of the other criteria that one might wish to inspect as part of an assessment of how a different form of PR is operating, it is a little too early to judge. We shall be best placed to do so post-June 2004 when we shall then have seen two rounds of European elections on a proportionate basis. No doubt the academics and others will inspect those results with considerable interest as a consequence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, the system of all-postal voting which is to be piloted in the European elections makes secrecy of the ballot far less certain. Does the Minister agree that before we go ahead with rolling out this pilot into the Westminster elections, we must have full research into possible voting abuses? Does he accept that that research must involve proper random sampling of the voters to check on possibilities of personation or pressure on electors and that the investigation must not just rely on complaints?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord's ball is out of court but in a spirit of charity I shall nevertheless respond. Clearly we see the benefit in piloting in the European elections in June the further operation of an all-postal voting system, as the House well knows. However, the noble Lord will also be well aware that the Electoral Commission has signalled some important issues for consideration, one of which he referred to, before there is an introduction of universal postal balloting in a Westminster parliamentary election.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend forgive my over exuberance as chair of Make Votes Count in welcoming his confirmation that in this Parliament&#151;unlike the previous one, I am afraid&#151;we shall carry out our manifesto pledge to stage a review? Will he ensure that when that review is carried out it takes full account of the superb work being done by the independent commission on precisely this subject? It was set up by the Constitution Unit, under the chair of David Butler and Peter Riddell, and will help to prepare the ground for a review that is appropriately timed for after the next round of elections.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the independent review of proportional representation systems by the Constitution Unit will be extremely interesting, both to the Government and to those in politics and academic life who take an interest in electoral systems. We look forward to seeing its report in March. One should put on record the Government's remarkable achievement in bringing in proportional representation. Every single new governmental organisation introduced since 1997 has had a proportional representation system. Without being too party political, we have seen more PR systems introduced by this Government than by any other party, or combination of parties, in the past 100 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister cannot tell us when the review is due to start, when will the Government decide when the review will start?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has been the total cost to public funds of the Millennium Dome since its closure on 31st December 2000; and when it is anticipated that it will cease to require the expenditure of public money.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, the New Millennium Experience Company was responsible for the Dome until June 2001 and incurred post-closure costs, met by the Lottery, of £4.3 million after deduction of income.
<P>

<a name="40120-02_para0"></a>English Partnerships took over in July 2001. Up to September 2003 it incurred costs, after deduction of income, of £26.6 million. English Partnerships's expenditure will reduce when construction of the new arena begins and will cease when it is completed. English Partnerships's costs will be recovered from sale proceeds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, but I am appalled when I think how that amount of money could have been spent so usefully on, for example, schools, hospitals and other worthwhile causes. The Minister said that he expects the spending to end, but when will sums actually flow back to English Partnerships and NMEC under the Government's deal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the final Section 106 agreement for the planning application is being put together as we speak. It is probably the most complex and large Section 106 agreement ever conducted on any planning application in the UK. The deal will become unconditional later in the spring; construction cannot start for a year, because contracts have to be bid for and completed; and then there will be the time that construction takes. Meanwhile, English Partnerships is looking after the security, the rates and insurance for the Dome. The costs incurred by English Partnerships are infinitesimal, compared to the returns in due course once the arena is constructed. The income after the Greenwich peninsular is developed will make the figures that I have given today look like seed corn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that in the year that the Millennium Dome was open, although it should have been sited in Birmingham, it was the most well attended visitor attraction in the whole of the United Kingdom? Will he remind the House of the benefits that the Dome has left behind?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, there were 6.5 million visitors. It was the most successful visitor attraction in the country. Regarding its legacy: 300 acres of derelict <P>


<a name="column_902"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 902</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>land have been dealt with; currently 800 homes are complete or under construction; there is an ecology park, 50 acres of parkland, a new primary school and health centre, a small hotel and a 14 screen cinema; and £280 million of private finance has already been invested. As for what will happen when the planning application is finally agreed and put together, there will be an arena with a capacity of 26,000, 10,000 new homes&#151;4,000 of which will be affordable&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for falling into ODPM ministerial speak. They are all affordable but 4,000 will be for key worker accommodation. There will be a four or five-star hotel, a secondary school and community facilities, three and a half million square feet of commercial office space, significant transport infrastructure, £550 million of cash returned and 20,000 permanent jobs&#151;including over 5,000 for Greenwich Thames Gateway. I could go on&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the legacy of what will come from dealing with a site that was left derelict for many years will be massive for people in that part of London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that he left out one significant fact? The Millennium Dome proved to be the most wonderful venue for a recent carol service before Christmas, attended by more than 7,000 people. So it is not a totally wasted asset.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, no, it is not. One of the difficulties while income has been small is that the Dome is so large that there is a limited number of enterprises and events that can fill it. The best has been done to generate income and I am pleased to hear about that latest event.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the problem is that the Dome has not been affordable? I thought it significant that the word "affordable" was used. We have waited for 20 months since conditional contracts were signed with developers. In particular, what is the long-stop date in the contract after which the Government can withdraw should that be necessary if the negotiations can not be concluded? In a Written Answer to me on 11 December 2003, the Minister assured me:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All of English Partnerships' costs in relation to the Dome will be recovered from sale proceeds".&#151;[Official Report, 11/12/03; col. WA79.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-03_para0"></a>We have heard that he is optimistic about that, but was that statement made with an unconditional guarantee by the developer or is it just a fond hope?
<P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, no. I draw attention to the Answer I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, on 11 December at cols. WA78&#150;79 of the Official Report. That remains the position. All of English Partnerships's costs in relation to the Dome, including those incurred over that year after the deal becomes unconditional, will be met and will be recovered from the substantial amounts of money received from the sale of the Dome&#151;close on half a billion pounds, although that is £240 million at net present value.
<P>

<a name="40120-03_para1"></a>I have said that as we speak the Section 106 deal is being put together and the deal will become unconditional around May this year, by which time there will have been a period of three months that has to be left in case there is a judicial review, but there is no sign that that will happen. The developer then will have a year to let the contract. It is expected that the arena built inside the Dome will be open in 2007. Many of the other developments that I mentioned will be ongoing while the arena is constructed. It is not a question of one thing following another. We expect that there will be a successful outcome to the negotiations, led by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of how much I have enjoyed listening to his expose of Never Never Land? Have the Government ever undertaken an exercise to compare the cost and value to this country of keeping the Royal Yacht, compared with the cost and value of the Dome?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it is not Never Never Land, because I invite the noble Baroness to visit the Greenwich peninsular and see what is there now&#151;not what will be there in the future. Then she can return to this House and say that she would prefer it to remain derelict, as it was for many years. The nearest thing to Never Never Land was the recent announcement by the Conservative Party in its so-called campaign on waste regarding figures used for the Dome. They do not stack up and can not be justified by those who made the claim for what was put in Yard 10. I am not surprised that no one has had the gumption to raise that today, because they know those figures. That is the Never Never Land of the Tory Party regarding the Dome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in the light of recent financial scandals and evidence of tax evasion, they propose to review their relations with offshore financial centres under British sovereignty.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, it is important that all financial centres comply with international standards, regardless of whether they are offshore or onshore. The Government are firmly committed to seeing international standards of regulation and anti-money laundering implemented effectively throughout the world. We are equally firmly committed to encouraging the Crown dependencies and overseas territories to match international standards on exchange of information for tax purposes and on fair tax competition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. Does he accept that, on some estimates, nearly half the offshore business which goes to offshore financial centres goes to such centres under British sovereignty&#151;both in the Crown dependencies and in the dependent territories? Therefore, it would seem to be a duty for the British Government, in particular, to consider the role of offshore financial centres in the world economy. Is he familiar with the recent report of the Public Accounts Select Committee in another House, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Around a quarter of serious fraud cases investigated by the [Inland Revenue] involve the use of offshore accounts and structures"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-03_para2"></a>Did the noble Lord see the report in the New York Times which stated that, of the 881 subsidiaries of Enron in offshore financial centres, 692 were in the Cayman Islands, 119 in the Turks and Caicos Islands and eight in Bermuda? Does he recall that in the Parmalat saga, both the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands played a substantial part in the disappearance of money? Is it not time that the British Government examined the costs and benefits to the world economy of those offshore financial centres, which are under our eventual control?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, to begin with, I believe it would be wise for the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, to distinguish between the Crown dependencies and overseas territories. Crown dependencies are far more limited. They have different tax regimes but we are satisfied that they comply with all the regulatory conditions that we have in this country. We are also satisfied that they have adequate protection against fraud.
<P>

<a name="40120-03_para3"></a>As for overseas territories and other offshore jurisdictions, this country, together with the OECD in particular, has been relentless in pursuing cases of fraud and bad regulation. I shall not comment on the <P>


<a name="column_905"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Parmalat aspect of the Cayman Islands, but those islands, as an overseas territory, were on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and have been taken off because they have conformed. They have still not conformed to the savings directive but we are working very hard at that. If the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, looks at the record, he will see that we are collaborating powerfully with other OECD members in pursuit of the non-co-operative jurisdictions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there is often a fine line between tax evasion and tax avoidance, particularly in the case of offshore islands? Is it not possible to ask the Inland Revenue, the Treasury or Parliament to decide how to deal with some of the large amount of tax avoidance which is really tax evasion by another name?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was always taught that tax evasion was illegal but that tax avoidance was not. It depends on the tax jurisdiction with which one is dealing. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I believe we should make a distinction between the offshore jurisdictions which are attractive because they have low tax regimes, which is legitimate, and those which have poorer regulation and which fail to comply with international standards of exchange of information or, indeed, of withholding tax. That is the direction in which we should target our efforts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, turning to the financial scandals aspect of this Question, can the Minister say whether this is one of those rare occasions when the Government can throw the challenge where it should lie&#151;that is, with the leading firms in the major financial centres? I think particularly of the City and Wall Street and the leaders of those leading firms. Is it not the case that a year ago on Wall Street an unprecedented ramp, fraud or conspiracy&#151;call it what you will&#151;took place, involving more than 50 of the leading merchant banks there, including all the major players in the City of London, and where the 11 malefactors were fined £1.35 billion for concerted fraud? Is it not the case that, unless these great firms show an example, frankly, laws will not do the trick?

<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that those who practise to deceive do, indeed, weave tangled webs. One of the tangled webs that they weave is the use of offshore havens. I believe that it would be good advice to investors in any country to look at the extent to which the companies in which they seek to invest use offshore tax havens and the extent to which they seek to complicate, and therefore to obfuscate, the nature of the financial control. I believe that that is all good advice for investors, wherever they may be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred to tax evasion and not tax avoidance. Will the Minister say whether he believes that the Government have in place adequate <P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>measures to deal with tax evasion in these offshore centres? If he believes that they have, will he say what effect those measures have had?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we pursue tax evasion at every possible opportunity. We are frequently criticised for the complexity of the Finance Act and of our tax legislation. Much of that complexity arises from the necessity to do precisely what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said&#151;to pursue tax evasion. We do not apologise for the complexity when it is necessary for the effective pursuit of tax evasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, there is concern both in Britain and in the United States about the use of offshore credit card accounts as a means of tax evasion. Are the Government paying particular attention to that and are they also collaborating with the United States on the use of Caribbean tax havens?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not familiar with the point that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is making. However, I shall become closely involved in it as I pursue the draft Gambling Bill, which is now before a Joint Committee, because clearly offshore credit cards are a particular risk there. I take seriously the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and I shall pursue it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, the Minister put up a spirited defence of complicated tax legislation. However, that was not the question that I asked him. Will he say whether the measures that have been put in place are effective against tax evasion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, they are generally effective, but people find ways of getting round them. The lawyers and accountants available to the private sector are paid more than the lawyers and accountants available to the Government. Sometimes they are ahead of us, but we catch up.

<P>
<UL>Whether European Union students at British universities will enjoy the same access to student loans for the payment of fees as British students.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, we are planning to abolish up-front payment of fees for full-time undergraduates from 2006. From that date, European Union students will have access to loans for payment of fees on the same basis as British students.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. Can she confirm that, at any <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>one time, approximately 10,000 students from the European Union are resident in the UK as students and that each of them would therefore be eligible in 2006 to take up a £3,000 loan? Can she tell us how the Government propose to pursue the repayment of the loans from those students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, in answer to the noble Baroness's first question, I cannot confirm that 10,000 students from the European Union are resident in the UK because, in fact, 35,000 students&#151;35,641 to be precise&#151;come to our universities in order to study. However, I can tell the noble Baroness that the Student Loans Company already has in place a system to collect maintenance loan debts from those who live outside the UK. It is exploring, and continues to explore, ways of building relationships with other European states, including those which may join the European Union in the future. That system will continue to operate successfully when the changeover takes place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I have had personal experience of the great difficulty involved in collecting money from someone who has returned overseas. Can the Minister tell me whether any system will be in place whereby a surety or a guarantee in this country will be required? Will the loans be covered under English law? What will be the jurisdiction and what action will the Government be able to take if the money is simply not forthcoming?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, there are already a number of systems available through existing international money transfer facilities offered by financial providers. International trace agencies are used by the Student Loans Company, which is used to tracing students and recovering debt. There are also issues that we can pick up through legal and commercial recovery systems, if need be. These are well established routes that have been successful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, will British students at European universities be able to avail themselves of these loans?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spmin1"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  My Lords, with permission I wish to make a Statement on the case of Angela Cannings.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para0"></a>Yesterday's judgment in the Court of Appeal in the appeal against conviction of Angela Cannings has serious and far-reaching implications. The judgment has demonstrated that, in relation to unexplained infant deaths, where the outcome of the trial depends exclusively, or almost exclusively, on a serious <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts, it will often be unsafe to proceed. I share the unease expressed by the Court of Appeal in relation to such convictions.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para1"></a>Following similar reported comments of concern by the Court of Appeal at the conclusion of the hearing of this tragic case in December, I asked for all cases potentially involving sudden infant death syndrome to be identified as quickly as practicable. To date, some 258 convictions over the past 10 years have been identified involving the murder, manslaughter or infanticide of an infant aged under two years by its parent.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para2"></a>Those cases will be considered further as a matter of urgency to establish whether any, and if so, how many, bear the hallmarks of a conviction which the Court of Appeal judgment yesterday indicated may be unsafe. I expect this process to be completed swiftly over the coming weeks. I propose that in all cases which appear to meet the criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal the convicted person will be informed of these developments as soon as possible. The possibility then will be for the case to be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission or for the convicted person, with legal advice, to consider an appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has the power under the Criminal Appeals Act 1995 to consider whether the convictions should be referred to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para3"></a>I am particularly concerned about cases where the defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is still being served. We have so far identified 54 such cases which may involve sudden infant death syndrome. These will be accorded the highest priority.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para4"></a>I have already spoken to the chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission and will be meeting him in the coming week to discuss how the review of these cases can be expedited. I have also asked the Crown Prosecution Service to conduct a review of the 15 ongoing cases involving an infant death of the sort described in yesterday's judgment.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para5"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Attorney-General for repeating that Statement. But does he find it extraordinary that he has to be dragged to the House to repeat word for word&#151;I believe he changed three words: "today", "today" and "today" were changed to "yesterday"&#151;a Statement he made in written form only yesterday? He had to be dragged to the House purely in response to a Question tabled by my honourable friend Dominic Grieve in another place.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para6"></a>Clearly the Speaker thought the matter important enough for a Question; obviously the noble and learned Lord thought it was important, because he said that the case has "serious and far-reaching implications". Therefore would it not have been better had he volunteered a Statement to the House from the start&#151;I believe that he was present yesterday&#151;rather than first making a Written Statement and then <P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>repeating that Written Statement in the manner of an oral Statement to the House? I have never known that in my 25 years in this House.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para7"></a>This is an important matter. I understand from the Statement that some 250 criminal cases are involved. There are 54 women still in prison. Will the noble and learned Lord tell us how the review will be structured and what urgency will be given to dealing with those cases where the convicted are still in prison? With what urgency will he be able to deal with them and ensure that they are released as soon as possible?
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para8"></a>Will he tell the House how long the Criminal Cases Review Commission intends to take in its review of the case and whether that is a further review over and above the review that the Government are mounting? Still on criminal matters, will he comment on the various adjustments that have been made to both the burden of proof and standard of proof in various Criminal Justice Acts in recent years? Does he agree that this matter shows how dangerous that can be? It would be best if we could see in all criminal cases the need to maintain the rule that no one should be convicted unless&#151;I stress&#151;the prosecution can show beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para9"></a>I turn to the civil aspects. We understand from what I suspect was a rather ill judged interview in the Sunday Telegraph with Margaret Hodge&#151;whom I gather is called the "Minister for Children"&#151;that some tens of thousands of cases might be affected by the evidence of Sir Roy Meadows and others. Will the noble and learned Lord tell us how many cases there will be; whether the Government will appoint a judge to review all those cases; what note they will take of the GMC's review into the evidence of Sir Roy Meadows and others; and whether legal aid will be available to all those involved?
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para10"></a>It may be, as the so-called Minister for Children said, that it will not be possible to return those children to their parents. Even so, they have a right to have their cases reviewed, because they are entitled to have the stigma of their children's removal removed from them. Will the noble and learned Lord tell us how those civil cases will be resolved?
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para11"></a>Finally, following what I described as her rather ill judged interview in the Sunday Telegraph, what advice will the noble and learned Lord be offering to the Minister for Children, particularly in regard to her statement that it would not be possible to return children to their parents? Is that the case for every case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches welcome the Statement by the Attorney-General, although we agree that it would have been better if an oral Statement had been made yesterday. This is clearly a high profile matter that has caused great public concern. It would plainly have been appropriate for the Statement to be made orally.
<P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para12"></a>Does the noble and learned Lord agree that these cases show the vital importance of ensuring that the innocent are not convicted and that the law does not assist in convicting them? Does he agree that the prosecution must avoid using experts who have a personal commitment to a contentious view; and that it is the prosecution's job to put a case fairly and in a balanced manner before the jury, which should not involve the use of committed experts where their views are open to question?
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para13"></a>The case recalls to mind the Orkney case some years ago which came under Scottish rather than English jurisdiction, where children from several families were taken away from their parents and some parents put on trial on the basis of what appeared ultimately to be the wholly inaccurate views of experts who believed that the children were being abused by families through satanic rituals. How quick will the review be? There are 258 cases. Some of those 258 will probably be found to have been rightly convicted, but it is clear that many appeals will be allowed; some may involve mothers who have spent years in prison wrongly convicted of a heinous crime.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para14"></a>Resources must be made available to ensure that appeals are heard as quickly as possible. Can the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General give any timescale? Do the Government intend to compensate those who have been convicted on the basis of discredited evidence put forward on behalf of the prosecution? What about babies who have been separated from their families and taken into care because a previous sibling has died unexpectedly? The mother may not have been prosecuted but taking away the baby in those circumstances is a hideous punishment for a crime of which the mother has either been acquitted or not been charged.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para15"></a>Will the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General assure the House that unless there are grounds for suspicion over and above the fact of the unexplained death of a previous baby, babies will not be removed from their families? Will steps be taken to restore children already taken away to their birth parents? Removing a new-born baby from birth parents and taking it into care is immensely damaging both to the child and to the child's family. Surely, removal should happen only where there is not just a risk but a substantial risk that the baby will become a victim of murder.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for welcoming the Statement. I may have missed it, but I did not notice that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, did that. I would have hoped that Members of the House would welcome the fact that within a very short time of an important judgment being given, I was able to announce an important review and to give an indication of the steps I was proposing to take and was taking in order to deal with that matter.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para16"></a>I take my responsibilities to this House very seriously. That is why yesterday I ensured that I put in the House by way of a Written Statement details of the <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>steps I was taking. I am glad that noble Lords and other Members of the two Houses are interested to know more on this issue and want to ask questions about it. I am happy to answer questions, but perhaps I may respectfully suggest that it is simply a political point to complain about being dragged to the House when I have made such an effort both to identify the steps that should be taken and to take them.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para17"></a>I shall move on to the other questions raised. The noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, asked, very understandably, about the time the review would take. As I have said, before the judgment in the Cannings case was produced but as a result of comments made by the Court of Appeal, I asked to identify as quickly as we could all the potential cases which might fall within the category which the Court of Appeal has now identified; that is, a category of case where the conviction is based exclusively or almost exclusively on contested, disputed, expert evidence. The interdepartmental group that I set up in the light of the Sally Clark case was able to identify 258 cases.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para18"></a>I have made it clear that it is extremely unlikely that more than a small proportion of those 258 cases fall within those criteria. Those are cases of infant deaths; infants killed by a parent in the past 10 years. Sadly, in some of those cases there will be clear evidence of violence having been used by a parent on a child, and such cases do not fall within that rubric. The most urgent step is to deal with the cases that I have also identified where a parent is currently serving a term of imprisonment, to consider those cases and to identify which may fall within this category so that they can be reviewed urgently and as the highest priority. I shall want to see the other cases identified. As I indicated in my Statement, I hope that that process of identification will be completed within the next weeks.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para19"></a>As to the next step, again, as I have indicated there are two possible courses: first, for the defendant himself or herself to consider appealing to the Court of Appeal, which may be possible&#151;that may depend on what has happened before&#151;or secondly, for the matter to be dealt with by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. I have therefore spoken twice with the chairman of that commission and, as I have said, I shall meet him again in the next few days to discuss how the commission can be in a position to expedite such cases that come before it. I agree with everything said by both noble Lords about the importance of urgency in relation to these cases.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para20"></a>As I indicated in my Statement, I asked the Crown Prosecution Service to conduct a review of the 15 ongoing cases in which the same issue may arise. I am very pleased, but not the slightest surprised, that the Director of Public Prosecutions has already issued guidance to his Crown prosecutors asking them personally to review all such cases within the next 28 days and to send them to him so that he can consider them and decide whether any such case should be pursued. I am not at all surprised by that immediate action by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para21"></a>I turn to the other points raised. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked whether this is in some way indicative of problems resulting from a change in the burden and standard of proof in various criminal statutes. I am not aware of a change in the burden or standard of proof in any of the criminal statutes. The burden of proof remains very clearly on the prosecution. The standard of proof, except in those exceptional cases where the burden is upon the defendant to prove, remains for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the defendant so that, as is said these days, the jury feels sure. As far as I am aware, that remains true in all respects and I regard it as a very important part of our justice system.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para22"></a>Still on the question of the criminal cases, before I turn to the other cases, I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, whether this case shows the vital importance of the courts not being used to convict the innocent. I agree absolutely with the noble Lord. The purpose of the criminal justice system is to convict the guilty but to ensure that the innocent are acquitted. Whenever we have a circumstance in which that does not appear to be working as it should, we in the justice system must pay the closest attention to it. That is why I have acted as I have done in this case.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para23"></a>The noble Lord raised the question of experts. Experts need to be used in many cases. Frequently, without expert evidence in criminal cases, it would not be possible to bring a criminal to justice. The noble Lord is right to say that it is important that when experts give their evidence to a court they should do so objectively, dispassionately and impartially and should put their own expert experience before the court, not some personal commitment to a particular cause.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para24"></a> There is one other matter with which I should deal which touches on the criminal cases. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, also asked whether the Government intend to compensate any persons who have been wrongly convicted. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me; it is too early to make a Statement in relation to that as we are simply on the eve of considering these cases. It is a proper question to raise and no doubt is one to which we shall return in due course.
<P>

<a name="40120-04_para25"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Goodhart, both raised questions about civil cases. As noble Lords will appreciate, such cases raise different issues and different considerations. In a criminal case what matters is, "If you cannot be sure on the evidence that someone is guilty, that person must go free". In children cases, the paramount consideration is always the welfare of the child, which gives rise to different considerations. DfES Ministers, who are responsible for children at central government level, are considering the implications of this judgment for care and adoption cases. I am sure that as soon as they have reached a conclusion they will announce whether any&#151;and, if so, what&#151;steps need to be taken in relation to those cases. Noble Lords will know that it is not simply central government who have a responsibility in this area; indeed, if anything it is much more local authorities which have a responsibility in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>relation to child cases, and other cases are matters between private citizens. So, the role of central government is much more limited than in the case of prosecutions. I hope those answers deal with the questions raised by the two noble Lords.

<A NAME="40120-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, it is not the function of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to concern himself with the Family Division. Can he tell us whether the Official Solicitor is taking or contemplating taking action to investigate this situation through the family courts? On one other matter, the Attorney-General has quite rightly said that there have not been specific changes in recent legislation; for instance, the Criminal Justice Act 2003. But what has been sought to be done and admitted by the Home Secretary is that he wishes to shift the balance between the prosecution and the defence. That is why we had long debates about the admission of previous convictions, bad character, propensity and the like. So there is substance in the proposition that we should watch with great care the extent to which we yield to proposals to alter the balance between the Crown and the litigants, be they criminal or civil.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his questions. He asked whether the Official Solicitor is taking action. I believe the position is this: since the passing of new legislation the Official Solicitor does not have a role at this stage. The matter has become one for local authorities which, having taken care proceedings, are under an obligation to review those orders with regularity. They are required to bring matters back to court if that is their opinion. That, as I stand on my feet, is the answer I give to the noble and learned Lord but I shall see if there is anything further I can say or any correction to be made. If so, I shall send it to the noble and learned Lord and put a copy in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40120-05_para0"></a>As regards his second point, I am grateful for his confirmation that there is nothing that he is aware of that has changed the burden or the standard of proof. I am well aware that there are many noble Lords and other commentators who will be watching the operation of the Criminal Justice Act as it goes through. I will not make any comment on particular provisions; we debated those at considerable length. We stand by the fundamental proposition that the prosecution must prove guilt and must prove it to the criminal standard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Aberavon: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the Attorney-General on the speed with which he has acted, the all-embracing nature of his proposals and the priority he is giving to those in prison. Will he confirm that the category he is looking at is much wider than the cases involving Sir Roy Meadow. Further, given the eminence of Sir Roy in this field, what influence has he had on other experts in cases in which they have given evidence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble and learned friend for his opening remarks. <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Coming from a former Attorney-General, it is gratifying to hear his approval. He is absolutely right in saying that the category is wider than those covering Professor Sir Roy Meadow or indeed the other expert, Dr Williams, whose name was mentioned in connection with the Sally Clark case. The Court of Appeal said in its important and thoughtful judgment that it is necessary to recognise that medical science is at the frontier of knowledge. There may be cases where there is no apparent explanation for a death or series of deaths but it may still be entirely innocent and not consistent with a criminal act. The review will go further and look at all cases where there is a sudden unexplained infant death and where the conviction appears to have been based almost entirely on expert evidence, whichever expert that may have been.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord address the particular problem which many feel is the most difficult issue that came out of the interview in the Sunday Telegraph referred to by my noble friend Lord Henley. In that interview the Minister said that it would not be possible&#151;one assumed never would it be possible&#151;for women who were found subsequently to be perfectly innocent of harming their children ever to get their children back. That matter worries many people because nothing could be worse than the denial of one's child. Will those women who had their children taken from them wrongly ever get them back?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I fully understand the concern which underlies that question. As I indicated before, the responsible Ministers in the DfES are considering the implications of this judgment and what, if any, steps need to be taken. I do not wish to prejudge what they may say. As a lawyer rather than the Minister responsible, I will simply say this. I do recognise that in children's cases the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. I will say no more than that I can understand that there will be some cases&#151;I do not say all cases&#151;where a child may have been adopted or put into some long-term relationship. That child now has new parents, new family, new brothers and sisters. For any court dealing with that situation that may be a difficult issue to deal with&#151;whether it is right to unravel that or to recognise that the child's best interest may be to be left where the child is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Laming: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for his very helpful Statement. I am sure that the whole House is appalled at the idea of an innocent person being convicted of such an awful crime. Does he agree that we need to keep a very open mind in these matters? Sadly, there are parents who do deliberately harm their children. That being so, does he accept that we will always need expert witnesses? Rather than lose confidence in their role, is it not important that we take this opportunity to improve their training? Only this evening, guidance will be <P>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>produced for those in the paediatric services on how people in this field can be alerted to early signs of deliberate harm.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right in everything he has said. We must all be appalled at the thought of a mother tragically losing her child or children and then, even worse, being accused and convicted of a crime which she did not commit. I made that point clear in an answer in the House to a Question put by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont of Lerwick. He is right. It sadly is the case that there are parents who do deliberately harm, even kill, their children. They are among the most vulnerable of our citizens and we plainly have to do as much as we can to protect them properly. The noble Lord with his experience from the inquiry he chairs knows better than most just how awful that can be and how parents can do that. We will therefore need expert evidence in cases. However, he is also correct to say that we need carefully to consider how that expert evidence is produced. I would not go so far as to confirm today that we should have some overall training exercise for experts. The noble Lord mentioned one field for which the Home Office is responsible where further training is being given to pathologists and I very much welcome that fact.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I too commend the noble and learned Lord for the way in which he has dealt with an extremely difficult matter. Given his unique position in terms of public access via the broadcasting media, perhaps I may ask him to get across two matters over which there is huge public misperception? The first, already referred to, is the paramountcy of the interests of the child which is the prevailing principle in civil matters. However, that has no bearing at all on criminal trials. There has been a tendency&#151;and perhaps by juries too&#151;to believe that somehow a different standard of proof is involved where a child is the subject of an alleged offence.
<P>

<a name="40120-05_para1"></a>Secondly, some noble Lords may have heard last night a leading spokesman for one of our most famous children's charities, suggesting&#151;quite explicitly&#151;that while no innocent parents or mothers must be convicted wrongly, no malefactors must ever be acquitted wrongly. That of course is an impossible proposition. There are a great many cases of greyness where one cannot be certain one way or the other. Unless the great British public&#151;and particularly the tabloids&#151;accept that to maintain the much admired standards of our system we must accept a certain number of wrong acquittals as the price of no false convictions, we will not get very far.
<P>

<a name="40120-05_para2"></a>Finally, I do not think that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General responded to the point on legal aid raised by both Front-Bench spokesmen. If there is&#151;and it seems inevitable&#151;a large number of difficult and perhaps long cases arising out of the review, will he assure the House that legal aid will be available on the normal terms; and in particular that the extra sum, which may be large, will not be part of <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>its annual total? That would further reduce the amount available for civil legal aid, which is already in crisis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his commendation. He is absolutely right that there is a great difference&#151;as I tried to explain&#151;between civil and criminal cases. The paramountcy of the interests of the child is what rightly drives us and our family courts. That has no bearing in criminal trials. I am not sure that I share the noble Lord's worry that juries are affected by that in their verdicts. Of course we do not know exactly what is in the minds of juries, but I can assure noble Lords that all judges summing up in such cases will remind juries clearly and repeatedly that it is their job to convict only if they are satisfied on the evidence and to put emotions out of their minds.
<P>

<a name="40120-05_para3"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord that it would be remarkable and wonderful if we had a system of justice that would always convict only the guilty and never acquit the guilty. However, we cannot have quite such a system. Our strong approach in this country&#151;which I entirely endorse and which the Court of Appeal endorsed in its judgment yesterday&#151;is that, occasionally, by relying on the burden and standard of proof&#151;as high as they are&#151;there will be some who are guilty but who will in fact escape because the evidence is not there. That is how it should be; and has often been put in the terms that it is better that some guilty should go free than that an innocent person should be convicted.
<P>

<a name="40120-05_para4"></a>I cannot while standing here give the noble Lord the assurances that he asks for regarding legal aid&#151;would that I had that control over a budget operated by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. Obviously, I have that issue in mind, and I shall want to make sure that there are no obstacles to the review taking place as it should.

<A NAME="40120-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   My Lords, from my point of view, the extent to which the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General has been able to bring forward proposals for dealing with this complex issue in such great detail, considering the time that has elapsed, is highly to be commended. Certainly, I appreciate it very much.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para0"></a>I am very concerned about the Family Division and the county courts' work on the family side. The Attorney-General was&#151;I have no doubt&#151;immensely helped in bringing forward today's proposals by the fact that the Crown Prosecution Service has overall responsibility for the criminal cases which are likely to be affected by this judgment; whereas in the family jurisdiction, particularly in view of what he has said about the Official Solicitor, there is much less of an integrated national system for finding out quickly which cases might be affected.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para1"></a>In children's cases&#151;as the Children Act makes clear&#151;unnecessary delay is very harmful from the point of view of the most satisfactory outcome. I understand fully and accept what the noble and learned Lord has said about the difficulty of uprooting <P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children&#151;who may have been wrongly removed in the first place&#151;who have now settled down in their new situation and extricating them again because the original decision was wrong. I can see that problem.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para2"></a>However, in view of what has happened, some kind of system for looking at the cases where the fundamental reason for the intervention has been an allegation that a parent has harmed a sibling of the child affected by the custody or the care order is highly to be sought. I know that it is not the Attorney-General's direct responsibility to look after these matters, but I take the view&#151;I think rightly&#151;that the Attorney-General has a general remit for helping the Government to reach a proper result in matters of law. I am sure that advice will be available to the Ministers in what is now the Department for Education and Skills. The issue used to be dealt with in another department, but it has now been moved.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para3"></a>It is very important that a national review is put in place as soon as possible. I appreciate the difficulties and the obstacles there will be, but I think that people and families&#151;mothers particularly&#151;who have been affected by such judgments are entitled to have the situation reviewed with the interests of their children still being paramount and very much the principal interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord for what he said at the beginning and also for his recognition of the difficulties that there are in the children's cases. When the noble and learned Lord held the high position of Lord Chancellor I know that that was a matter of great interest and concern to him.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para4"></a>I take the noble and learned Lord's point about there not being the same national system to enable cases to be identified as there is in the criminal system. That is the consequence of responsibility being with local authorities. I understand that point.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord makes important points about what should happen now. It is not possible for me to go further than to say that those very important points will be drawn to the attention of the relevant Ministers. Indeed, one is sitting next to me on the Front Bench. I know that careful consideration is now being given to the implications of the judgment in those cases.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para6"></a>On my own position, I have provided&#151;and, indeed intend to provide&#151;such advice and assistance to Ministers in that department as it is within my ability to give to help to solve these difficult issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, following on from a previous answer by the noble and learned Lord, perhaps he will tell the House how many of the 258 defendants were actually charged or could have been charged with the crime of infanticide, as distinct from murder or manslaughter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I cannot. As the Statement says, the convictions are for murder, manslaughter and infanticide&#151;in relation to infants under two. I do not know at this very early stage how <P>


<a name="column_918"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 918</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many were for infanticide. I do not know whether any in the other categories might have been charged as infanticide. I suspect not, because that is a verdict to be preferred in a case where the conditions were met. But, if I am in a position to give a further breakdown once the review is completed, I will. Plainly, when we have broken down the issue, I shall want the House to know the number of cases affected by the judgment. If I can give some further breakdown in the way that the noble and learned Lord requests, I shall seek to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware of how deep and wide this evil runs? In my daily life, I see the little end of it, where the theories of experts are allowed to terrorise parents of children with special educational needs, particularly ADHD, dyspraxia, and the fringes of autism. All that needs to be mentioned is Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, and the parent is suddenly an evil person at the wrong end of social services and officialdom, without help and is suspected of being the one who is causing her child difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para7"></a>We have allowed the expert to start a witch hunt in a general way, which has terrorised tens of thousands of parents. They are among the most heart-rending things that I must deal with. Can we not use the terrible events that the noble and learned Lord has so rightly thrown light on to, and expressed an entirely admirable willingness to investigate, to reach down into the depths of our system and make sure that we offer relief in relation to not only these big cases but also the little cases? Can we ensure that we restore again the presumption that by and large parents care for their children and do not wish them harm? Will the Minister ask the Department of Health to withdraw their circular approving of this utterly discredited diagnosis of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, this is the wrong moment in the debate to get into such controversial issues as the noble Lord raises.

<a name="40120-06_para12"></a><P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-06_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I will speak also to Amendments Nos. 14, 15, 134 and 135.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para14"></a>In his disarming speech when he wound up at Second Reading, the Minister described the Bill as having had a drubbing. He also said that he recognised the concern about the democratic deficit, and he said that he had got the message. If the message that he then identified led to the government amendments on a democratically elected sphere of government having a role in regional spatial strategy&#151;we will debate them later&#151;something has been lost in translation.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para15"></a>Many of us are enthusiasts for devolved government. Everyone in this House would say that we want to see government at the lowest practicable level, although our differences would be in identifying where that level is. Few in this House would say that powers should be transferred upwards and become more centralised. Yet, we have a Government who have promoted devolution and had the guts and the energy to enact a lot of it. Those of us who would have liked to go further are ready to acknowledge that. The Government have produced a version of devolution that transfers powers and responsibilities from an elected sphere&#151;the counties&#151;to, bluntly, itself.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para16"></a>There is not merely a democratic deficit in the new proposals; there is a loss of democracy. I am genuinely sad to have to start the detailed work on the Bill on this note. There is much in the Bill that I support. When I said yesterday to the Minister that I was coming round to seeing the virtues of some of the later proposals, he told me not to apologise for that. Among the things that I support are regional and sub-regional planning. We have a regional spatial strategy, which in its first incarnation as the Secretary of State's regional planning guidance&#151;I understand the Government's need to avoid a vacuum&#151;is to be revised by a regional planning body that is designated by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para17"></a>The draft regulations for the composition of the regional planning body provide that recognition&#151;and the Government are honest enough to say that that means funding&#151;is dependent on at least 30 per cent of the membership with voting rights being from other than local authorities. I would have some reservations even if 100 per cent were from local authorities in this model. That comes from my experience of an indirectly elected body. For eight years, I chaired the London Planning Advisory Committee, which dealt with London planning issues after the abolition of the <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>GLC. The members, who were members of borough councils, did the job with interest and with some application, but it was not their prime responsibility, and reasonably so. Their first responsibility was for their own boroughs. One would routinely encounter members having to leave meetings early and some being less focused on strategic issues than they were on local issues. That response was entirely reasonable, but it is an inevitable outcome of one being indirectly elected.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para18"></a>I am sure that the Minister will later remind the House of his amendments and the Deputy Prime Minister's statement in announcing them. That is the role of the local authorities. I am delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister was able to say that the Local Government Association and the County Councils Network have agreed to give,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"full support to making the new regional planning arrangements a success".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-06_para19"></a>Their members are reasonable and responsible people&#151;of course they want to make the new arrangements a success. That does not mean that the government amendments are the best or the only way to deal with the democratic deficit that I have identified.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para20"></a>Our amendment is a sunrise provision to the effect that the regions should take on the functions of regional spatial planning when there are elected regional bodies to do so, working with the counties and the districts. Until then, let us find a way&#151;the way that we are proposing is the right way&#151;of observing the principles of democracy and accountability. That would mean retaining the status quo on the role of the counties. The Minister may say that we will have the status quo, because regional planning guidance will become the regional spatial strategy. Structure plans will be saved&#151;that is the term&#151;for three years. That does not meet our concern, but it makes it clear that there is an opportunity to get the structure and responsibilities right. I make it clear to the noble Lords opposite who, among others, may feel that by starting off in this way we are setting out the wreck the Bill. That is not so, and our amendment is not as devastating as it may be painted. In another place the Minister, Mr McNulty, said that some of the matters that I am referring to are matters for a regional powers Bill. Quite so.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para21"></a>In 1998 the Government identified problems with the production of regional planning guidance. Your Lordships should not be too impressed that I am about to quote from a document. I went to the website to see which documents were relevant to the Bill, and printed one off before I realised that it was five years old. However, it identified the following, and I think it is worth considering these criticisms.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para22"></a>According to the document, regional planning guidance lacks regional focus and vision and spends too much time reiterating national policies; apart from housing provision, it lacks targets which can be monitored and reviewed; it is too narrowly land-use orientated; it lacks sufficient environmental objectives and appraisal; it takes too long to produce; it does not command commitment from regional stakeholders, and the process of producing it is insufficiently <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transparent. I agree with much of that critique, but it does not seem to us necessary to reduce the role of elected representatives in order to meet those criticisms.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para23"></a>There is a practical aspect, too. It was expressed to me by a county councillor from North Yorkshire as follows: the likely outcome of the Government's proposals is that county council resources and expertise will slowly wither away and that political commitment will decline as a core function at the present time becomes, at best, an ancillary activity in future years. On Second Reading, many of your Lordships expressed concern about the lack of planning expertise and about expertise leeching away.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para24"></a>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15, which propose that an elected regional assembly shall be the regional planning body, follow on from this. Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 are also consequential. It took me some time to find in the Bill how county structure plans were being dealt with and, having found the references, I thought I would add them to the amendment. But the more serious point is that buried in a schedule are these unusual provisions which say, in effect, that unless an authority has got to such and such a point in its structure plan, it shall do no more. That is an interesting approach to what is very close to the repeal of primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para25"></a>No doubt we on these Benches will be teased because we have been vociferous advocates of regionalism. Indeed we are&#151;but of devolved, elected regional government, not of the emasculation of counties and certainly not of centralisation. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40120-06_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I want to make it clear at the outset that I support the noble Baroness's amendment. While we are not at all in favour of regional government&#151;and that was made very plain in our discussions on the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill&#151;we are equally completely opposed to the proposals for an arrangement whereby a body, which is still largely unidentified, made up of largely unknown persons, produces a document of such significance as a regional spatial strategy. In particular, it will have to contain the regional guidance as laid out by the Secretary of State.

<a name="40120-06_para26"></a>Where the Secretary of State is becoming involved to such an extent, there must be not only scrutiny of his policies but effective decision-making by elected members on the applicability of those policies. This is a paramount requirement, particularly when the Secretary of State's guidance may, and almost certainly will, include such matters as the provision of large-scale housing developments, infrastructure provision in the region&#151;possibly including new methods of energy provision and the siting of wind farms&#151;and the identification of preferred areas for housing.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para27"></a>The Secretary of State's policies under Clause 1 appear to be mandatory&#151;a mandatory part of the spatial strategy&#151;and his directions unchallengeable. Without elected members' input into these documents, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>they will be put together, presumably by the civil servants of the regional government offices. Unless amendments regarding the county councils are agreed later in the Bill's proceedings, their role, which was formerly to deal with the structure plans, will be confined to assisting&#151;I think that was the word used by the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;the regional planning body. I am aware that the Minister will be moving an amendment to give the county councils this statutory advisory role. We will discuss then whether that is an appropriate and strong enough commitment. But I am bound to say that unless the Minister's words change my view, I do not believe that that is sufficient.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para28"></a>It still means that the primary work will be done, at best, in conjunction with the regional planning body, whatever that ends up as being. At worst, it will be done only by the Civil Service.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para29"></a>If the regional planning body were to be the regional assembly, that, too, would be unsatisfactory, as only a small proportion of the membership of those bodies is made up of elected members. The rest are appointed from business, the unions, environmental organisations and other interested organisations. While they are of course extremely interested and extremely valuable in the role they play at present, they are not democratically accountable for what is produced on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="40120-06_para30"></a>All in all, we believe this to be extremely unsatisfactory. The impact of regional spatial strategies on communities could be immense. The means whereby those communities can play any part in vetoing any aspects about which they are concerned or do more than comment, in an advisory capacity, is opaque. For this reason, we believe that in the event that there is no elected regional assembly, there should be no possibility of Clause 1 being implemented. I support the amendment.

<A NAME="40120-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I declare an interest as an Oxfordshire county councillor. County councils are, in most places in the country, the absolute epitome of democracy. There are high turnouts in county council elections, even in the years when there is no parliamentary election coincident with them. Admittedly, turnout was more than 80 per cent last year but normally it is well over 60 per cent in the county I represent, which is higher than in very many elections. Usually, the results of those elections are fairly proportional across a county, as between parties, which is not the case at parliamentary elections.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para0"></a>Most county councillors are known to a high proportion of their electors. Most of my colleagues attend meetings of parish councils once a month, and some attend as many as 13 or 14 of these meetings each month. There they give their reports and they hear questions and comments from members of the public assembled there. On planning matters, large numbers will often attend.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para1"></a>County councillors represent and serve people, and reflect their views in the council chamber, on structure plan working parties, and are well aware of housing pressures, educational difficulties, school and social services problems and matters affecting the police, the fire service and the libraries, to name some of their responsibilities.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para2"></a>I acknowledge that there is some place for a regional spatial strategy&#151;there has to be one below central government. However, my main point is that I sincerely believe that the severing of the link between the electorate and those responsible for the structure plan will be a problem for the Government&#151;and I strike a note of great caution here. We often make unpalatable decisions which we can sell to the electors because we know who they are; we can talk about trade-offs and everybody takes a share of what is unpleasant because they can see fairness within the county. However, the Government run the risk that taking those decisions away from the county will leave local people alienated and disaffected because they will see results and decisions being imposed on them by an unelected regional assembly to which, in most cases, they have no sense of belonging.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My support for the amendment should certainly not be taken as support for elected regional assemblies. To my mind there is absolutely nothing whatever to be said for them. I have always suspected that the Minister agrees with me, but because of the position in which he sits he cannot say so. Elected regional assemblies at best will be an expensive waste of time and at worst will hasten the Balkanisation of Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para3"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is very useful, if only because it is a timely reminder of the sharp practice in which the Government are indulging. I believe that all along the Government's plan has been to give regional bodies powers that they should not have anyway, and then to plead that now that those bodies have the powers, there is deficit of democratic accountability, so we must have regional assemblies. That is the argument behind all that they have been advancing. Therefore, the obvious course is not to have regional assemblies, but to try to demolish the bureaucracies that at present are being created in regional government up and down the country.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para4"></a>In the regions, which are completely artificial creations and which in no way reflect natural loyalties or communities of interest, regional bureaucracies are already blossoming and one has only to read the Guardian to see the non-jobs that are being advertised for them. I have invited noble Lords before to take an interest in what is going on in the government office of the East Midlands. As long ago as 2002 that government office was advertising for the post of director of infrastructure and community affairs. The fatuous job description said:
<P>
<br>

<FONT SIZE=3>Such utter rubbish goes on and on. The Government should be busy dismantling such bureaucracies now rather than arguing that because we have them we should have some kind of elected assemblies to try to embark on the impossible task of knocking them into shape.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para6"></a>The passage of the Bill will perform a useful purpose if it reminds people of what lies behind it and the link between this Bill and the Government's plans for regional assemblies. The passage of the Bill will perform a useful purpose if it wakes people up to the fact that the Government's plans for the regions do not involve devolving power from central government to the regions; they involve robbing existing authorities like the county councils of powers such as planning powers. In other words, powers that have been part of our local government structure for generations will be taken away from authorities. That structure is well known to people and they can relate to it. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on the fact that our local authorities are well respected and work extremely well as democratically elected bodies. Powers will be taken away from those well respected bodies and given to new authorities that will be more remote from the people. What good will come of that? I can see no good whatever coming from that.

<A NAME="40120-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I declare an interest as a county councillor in Suffolk and I inform the Committee that I have been a local authority member since 1991, involved both at district council level with development control and with the more strategic planning functions at county council level.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para7"></a>I support my noble friend Lady Hamwee. I should be grateful to the Minister if he could address a practical issue that has caused me some concern. In the east of England we are, by the Government's own calculations, at least seven or eight years from an elected regional assembly, assuming that the people of the east of England want such a body, which is open to question. At the moment there is an embryonic planning function at regional level but because it is a very small operation and because there is no real elected or effective regional body, there is a very small staff and, in the main, the technical advice for the regional planning function comes from the county council.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para8"></a>I believe that the diminution of the county council's role to that of an advisory body, although it is now to be statutory, will have two effects. First, I believe that it will lead to a massive haemorrhaging of experienced planning staff from county councils who will be able to see their future role disappearing and therefore they will move away. Secondly, and more worryingly, county councils with a lot of pressure on their budgets will simply lower the level of resource that they put into what now is to be simply an advisory function. If that happens we shall have the worst of both worlds: we shall have an emasculated county council planning function but no robust regional planning function to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>take its place. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain to me and to the Committee how that problem is to be addressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-07_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I support the amendment moved very ably by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I declare an interest: I am a local councillor on the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk, although I am not a member of the Development Control Board.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para9"></a>I support the amendment for three reasons. First, planning is very prescriptive and therefore should take place as close as possible to the local area. The Bill replaces local plans, which have been developed very well since being introduced by the previous government. It gives developers and local people much more certainty of what would receive permission. That, in turn, leads to the speeding up of the planning process and allows many more decisions to be delegated to the officers of the council if the application falls within the guidelines. The local plans work well; they deliver the right kind of targets; and they are updated constantly by local people subject to the planning guidelines handed down by regional planning guidance or by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para10"></a>The new development framework, as proposed in the Bill, which is to be made up of local development documents, is the old development plans with a nasty new twist, which is that the Secretary of State is to be given powers to intervene in the preparation stage in a way that is wholly unjustified. What right has the Secretary of State to direct the local planning authority to make amendments to the scheme as he thinks fit?
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para11"></a>My second reason is that the introduction of a regional spatial strategy is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has just mentioned, an attempt to give legitimacy to the shadow regional planning bodies that currently exist, without any form of authority, but which still wield power. The problem of giving power but no democratic legitimacy is that it creates huge resentment in the tiers below. At Second Reading the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The counties will be consultees on regional plans, and will continue to be responsible for transport, waste, and mineral plans. The regions can use the counties as agents on sub-regional planning".&#151;[Official Report, 6/1/04; col. 100.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-07_para12"></a>With a swipe, the power of the council is removed from the elected bodies and transferred to an unelected regional planning body that is directly under the control of the Secretary of State. An example of the danger in that policy&#151;it was mentioned by my noble friend on the Front Bench&#151;is likely to be the attitude taken to wind turbines. I am quite certain that it will become a regional planning policy directed by the Secretary of State, and local councils and county councils will not have any voice in its implementation.
<P>

<a name="40120-07_para13"></a>Norfolk is designated to produce more than 10 per cent of its energy requirements by renewable resources, excluding what might be generated out at sea. It will require a veritable forest of wind turbines to generate that amount of energy. Without the consent of local people, that will be deeply resented.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="40120-07_para14"></a>Thirdly, in attempting to reform local government, the previous Conservative government tried to do away with many counties and local authorities and replace them with unitary authorities. I am sure that the Minister will recall that. There was an outcry from almost every part of the country, and different solutions had to be found. It would be wrong to go down the route that the Government propose without the consent of the people in the form of a referendum. Let us trust the people for a change.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Woolmer of Leeds: </B>   I oppose the amendment, although I assure Members of the Committee that there will be many times during our proceedings when I shall be critical, as I would like to see many changes in the Bill. On this occasion, however, I oppose the proposal. I declare an interest in that I am the director of two businesses involved in the development world and consultant to a number of others.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para0"></a>The amendment says that Part 1 should not come into force unless there is an elected regional assembly. A number of the speeches seemed to indicate that that was a wrecking move, because if there were no elected regional assembly, there would be no Part 1. The question is, what is Part 1 trying to achieve? There is a need for a regional spatial strategy on a statutory basis. Such a strategy should be drawn up by a body that has its heart and soul in the development of that region. Regions vary considerably across the country, and solely leaving everything to regional guidance from central government has failed in the past, and continues to fail, to do justice to the regional variety and dynamics of the regions throughout England.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para1"></a>In my view, we need a regional spatial strategy that is based as firmly as possible within each region. I would much prefer that to be a body that is part of and responsible to a directly elected assembly. If, on the other hand, people from different regions decide that they do not want a directly elected assembly, that does not in my view diminish one jot the fact that we need strong regional strategies. It is best if they are drawn up, taken through and led by elected bodies but, if they are not, we still need such regional strategies.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para2"></a>The amendment, as I read it, says that if there is no directly elected assembly, no regional spatial strategy will be drawn up by people largely or entirely drawn from the individual regions. That would be a great loss. In my own region of Yorkshire and Humber, it is not simply a matter of county councils&#151;as much as I admire and respect the role of the local county council in North Yorkshire. It is a great mix of large cities, all-purpose authorities, county councils, district councils and so on. That does not result in a coherent, strong regional policy&#151;and nor will it, in my view.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para3"></a>Therefore, I oppose the amendment, which is a wrecking amendment in some parts, and expresses a desire to put one's credentials on the line in respect of directly elected assemblies. I would love to see them throughout the regions, and certainly in my own region. In the absence of that, the amendment would effectively wreck putting a regional spatial strategy on a statutory basis, drawn up by and driven by people <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>who are genuinely interested in taking their region forward. In my view, that would be a great mistake on the part of noble Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment, and I do so from a slightly different point of view, although I agree with everything that she said. I also agree with one thing that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said. He said that there was a danger that under the Government's proposals for the regional assemblies, for which it is intended that we shall have referendums in three northern regions this autumn, the regional assemblies would be an "expensive waste of time".
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para4"></a>I take a diametrically opposite view of regional government to the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, as I believe very strongly in effective, strong regional government based essentially on devolution of powers from the highly centralised state based in Whitehall and Westminster. However, my concern about the Government's proposals for regional assemblies is that they will be weak, will not have anything to do, will be expensive for what they do and that they are basically taking powers upwards from local government rather than devolving them from London. That is a concern, and a concern held by many people in my region of the north-west. I wish that concern was not there.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para5"></a>The amendment gets to the heart of one issue. If the people in the north-west, and in Yorkshire, are to be persuaded to vote for the Government's regional assemblies later this year, there will have to be seen to be a clear difference between what happens when there is a regional assembly and what happens when there is none. Merely having an elected body of probably quite well paid politicians who are not seen to do very much will not be a difference that people will appreciate.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para6"></a>People will have to see reasons why there should be an assembly. I have tabled Amendment No. 10, which does a similar thing to this amendment but in a less drastic way. This amendment says that, when one has a regional assembly, the position is quite different, because the region will have something important to do, and that when one does not have a regional assembly, it will not. That is a basic issue that the Government will have to think very hard about across all sorts of policy areas in the next few months. We are discussing planning here, so we will talk about planning.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para7"></a>I remember vividly that during the Committee stage of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill, the Minister kept repeating a mantra: "no more powers, no more money". I believe that there ought to be more powers where there is an elected regional assembly. In this case, the regional spatial strategies will not simply consist in taking over what exists at the moment in terms of regional planning guidance at regional level, but will take powers upwards from local government in the form of the structure plan powers. Not only the county councils but the unitary authorities will be involved, such as the area of Leeds which the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, represents very well in a general sort of way. Leeds will lose powers to the new regional <P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assembly or to a non-elected regional assembly, under the Government's proposals. Powers will go upwards from all local government, and not just the counties. If that is going to happen, the only possible justification for it is if the body that is taking over at regional level is elected.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para8"></a>The democratic arguments apply, but so do the practical arguments. I do not believe that the Government will persuade people in the north-west to vote for their regional assembly, unless it has an important series of jobs to be done. We can address the planning issue here by passing my noble friend's amendment.

<A NAME="40120-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I support the amendment and the remarks of my noble friend Lord Ullswater. I take heart when I listen to the Prime Minister talking about the introduction of democracy to Iraq. I wish that he would bring that same sentiment closer to home and be as fond of democracy in the United Kingdom and this Chamber. However, democracy is a dirty word as regards application in this country. What is important is to pass powers upwards: to have things dictated by people who are sufficiently expert and broad in their vision to take decisions which, in the Government's view, need to be taken without bothering to consult people too much.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para9"></a>It may well seem to people who do not live in Norfolk that during the 50 years or so while we wait for global warming to transform it into a marina it would be a good idea to build a few wind farms there. One cannot impose such decisions on people and maintain a respect for and agreement to government. Governments depend on our agreeing to be bound by the strictures that Government put on us and to feel that it is government with our consent. Things that happen locally require decisions to be taken locally or we shall lose the feeling of consent.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para10"></a>It is a problem for the police. They have lost their local presence. They have lost the local policeman. Therefore, the police are alien to us. When they stop us for some minor offence they are not our police but the state's police. That is not constructive. It leads to a gradual diminution of people's enthusiasm for involvement with the state, with public processes, and a commitment to the way in which they are governed. If we allow this sort of thing to continue, it will have great consequences. The only way to stop it continuing is to deal with each of its minor appearances. We are here talking about imposing things on people which need not be imposed. We can gain consent locally albeit a little more slowly and with a little more trouble. Some areas may say no and create difficulties. But it is important to involve people and obtain their consent.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para11"></a>The development industry and the Government will find that inconvenient from time to time. But unless we proceed with people's consent, in the end we will <P>

<A NAME="40120-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskins: </B>   I declare an interest as chairman of the Campaign for Yorkshire Devolution. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that natural loyalties and communities of interest are strong and flourishing in Yorkshire. I point him towards the front page of today's Financial Times which shows the underperformance of all our great provincial cities of Britain compared with the equivalent great provincial cities of Europe&#151;and if we had had the same report on the great provincial cities of the United States, alas, we should have seen the same thing. The difference between those countries and ourselves is that they have elaborate regional democracies in place and we do not.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para12"></a>The objective of the campaign is to raise the democratic process by assuming substantial powers away from Whitehall. If that does not happen, we shall have failed in our efforts. Secondly, it is to call to account the unelected quangos&#151;I am a member of one or two&#151;about which the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is understandably concerned. The only way to call them to account, if we have any regional structure, is to have regional democracy alongside us. We have to tackle the bureaucracy which, rightly, worries most of us, particularly around Whitehall. The purpose of such devolution is to undermine that bureaucracy and the second guessing which takes place. The basis for that regional democracy is a strong alliance between the county councils and the regional democracies, to strengthen the local authorities in their role in our modern government.
<P>

<a name="40120-08_para13"></a>I believe, therefore, that the Government's proposals in this respect work best when devolved government is in place. I hope that Yorkshire will, not for the first time, show an example to the rest of the country in the referendum later in the year and that lessons will be learned from the success of devolution in Yorkshire so that the poor people of the east of England will be encouraged to follow with great enthusiasm in the years to come.

<P>

<a name="40120-09_para0"></a>I am a great believer in democracy. I can assure the Committee that the feeling on this issue of citizens who have not been directly involved in local government is very strong. They wonder where democracy is going.

They can shake their heads all they like. I am on my feet now and I shall not give way.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para2"></a>We seek to do it a different way. Some regions may not want regional elected government. We are giving the people the choice. The first three referendums will be held later this year. One cannot assume what will happen after that. The Liberal Democrat policy is clearly to impose regional government.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para3"></a>Having listened to noble Lords, there has been a big squeal of vested political interest in virtually every speech. People listening to our debates could be misled. No noble Lord mentioned that the planning authority which will deal with the planning applications for the citizens of this country is the elected district council. Nothing is changing. Anyone would think that we are wiping out the district councils: they are the planning authorities which will make the decisions on the planning applications. No one mentions that because we are having a different debate: one of political vested interest from the county councils. Heads may be shaken but that is the reality.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-09_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I wonder whether the Minister heard my speech. I devoted at least a third of it to local development plans and queried the need for the Secretary of State to involve himself personally in the new development framework. Local development plans which I said have worked well have already been mentioned in the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I have not come to that. We shall have similar debates about the accretion to the Secretary of State of so-called powers which, frankly, is not of the scale which has been alleged compared with the status quo. There are no substantial massive changes there. The district councils are the planning authorities. They are democratically elected. When citizens put in a planning application, they will deal with their local council as they do now. Nothing will change. But the debate so far is clearly designed to prevent the reform of the regional planning system, which is what we are talking about here, and not development control. It is a fair point to make; it is a fair way to begin debate on the Bill. I do not object to that.

I do not think that anyone, including the noble Lord the leader of his county council would claim&#151;I invite him to do so&#151;that Essex is the region. One has to be realistic. I do not believe that that is a realistic proposition. Nevertheless, many legitimate points have been made and I shall do my best to answer them.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para4"></a>The bottom line is that this group of amendments, important though they are, is designed to prevent the reform of the regional planning system, which is what the Bill is about. To that extent, they are wrecking. I do not mean that in a pejorative sense, but it would simply undermine the whole purpose of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-09_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   When the Minister begins a speech in so belligerent a manner, he creates the suspicion that he may be trying to distract the attention of the Committee from something. He has increased the Committee's curiosity as to what that might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   So far as I am aware, the noble Earl was not here for most of the speeches that I have just listened to. Therefore, I am in no position to look into the window of his mind to see what he thinks I am about.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para5"></a>I have not been belligerent at all. I have made the point that I have heard a lot about political vested interests. I do not think that anyone is denying that. There are people here representing county councils, which they see as under threat. I do not see it that way, but it is a legitimate point to make.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para6"></a>I think the Liberal Democrats take the view that there ought to be regional government. They say that; indeed, they would impose it. We want to give people a choice on regional government. There is nothing belligerent about that. I do not have to sit here, listen and accept everything I hear. I want to try to make a legitimate response to what has been said. I have no hidden agenda: everything is out in the open. I am not trying to sugar-coat the Bill. I would not try to do that anyway.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para7"></a>The point about this group of amendments is the proposition that there should be regional spatial strategies and regional planning bodies only in areas where we have elected regional assemblies. I do not want to go over the previous Act now, but it is a step-by-step process if people decide whether they even want to have a referendum. One cannot assume what the end-game might be. Everyone knows that there will be three referenda later this year. That is the effect of this new clause in Amendment No. 1.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para8"></a>Amendment No. 14 would require the elected regional assembly to be the regional planning body. Amendment No. 15 would remove the provisions that relate to setting <P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the criteria for recognising a body as the regional planning body in regulations, the powers of the Secretary of State to withdraw that recognition by direction and his power to exercise regional planning body functions where there is no regional planning body in place. Amendment No. 134 would alter the transitional arrangements for structure plans. It would provide for authorities to continue with alterations or replacements of structure plans provided no elected regional assembly was in place.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para9"></a>To say that I am disappointed by these amendments is a fair assessment of the situation, though not in any kind of belligerent way. They offer no solution whatever to the problems with our planning system and our system of plans. They appear directly to undermine the reforms. The existing system is bogged down by too many plans that are often out of date&#151;we have heard some examples of that in previous legislation&#151;and not in line with one another. We also have three tiers of plans, which we believe to be simply too many.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para10"></a>We accept&#151;and I do not think there is any difference between any of us on this&#151;that we need strong regional planning. For the avoidance of doubt, when I say "regions" I am talking about the regions as set out by the previous government, not the counties. Regional planning policies that form part of the development plan are needed to address the particular opportunities and challenges faced by an individual region. In effective regional planning policy, we think it is vital to tackle the historic regional disparities that exist and to respond to the challenges of a modern economy. The point made by my noble friend Lord Haskins is wholly legitimate in this respect, given those figures that I, too, saw this morning on the front page of the Financial Times.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para11"></a>We need strong local plans at a level where the community can really engage with the process of plan making, where proposals to develop particular sites can be properly debated. That situation is absolutely fundamental. We want to make regional spatial strategies statutory and so part of the development plan. We do not think we should continue with a system where outdated lower-level plans can take precedence over more up-to-date regional plans in key planning decisions. That is the position that exists today. We want a system for strategic planning that is based around areas that are interdependent on the ground, not one constrained by administrative boundaries. I believe I said in a previous debate that when I visited the Thames Gateway, I flew over it at 500 feet as a lot of it is inaccessible. The great advantage of that is that you do not see administrative boundaries. You see it in a completely different way. I am not knocking the boundaries, but the fact is that we are tied down to some of the historical administrative boundaries and we need policies that are not necessarily constrained by those boundaries.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para12"></a>The county boundaries do not work as the basis for effective strategic planning. That may be a point of disagreement between some of us, and we can have lots <P>


<a name="column_933"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 933</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of debates about it. But, by and large, there must be a consensus between the two Houses to make the point that counties cannot work as the basis for strategic planning at the level required. Many strategic planning issues&#151;I do not claim all&#151;cut across county boundaries and are best dealt with at a regional or a sub-regional level, certainly not at the county level.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para13"></a>The regional planning process needs to be driven forward by a body able to represent the region and to take a strategic view. The regional chambers are best placed to fulfil that role. I do not accept that some sort of democratic deficit now arises as a result of regional chambers having responsibility for regional planning.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para14"></a>This does not represent a new departure. Responsibility for preparing regional strategies already rests with regional planning bodies which, since 1 April last year, have been the regional chamber in each region. We are proposing that these arrangements should continue, provided that the chamber is sufficiently inclusive. We are not suddenly transferring powers from counties to regions.
<P>

<a name="40120-09_para15"></a>Under the existing system, county structure plans should be in line with and follow the strategic planning framework set in the regional planning guidance. What we are doing is removing a filter that has slowed down the expression of strategic regional planning policies in local plans. We are clearing out a system that allows out-of-date structure plans to take precedence over up-to-date regional plans. Now, hands up anybody who is in favour of that continuing? It is barmy. You cannot explain to the public that out-of-date structure plans, years old in some cases, should take precedence over up-to-date regional plans. You would have a hell of a job explaining that to the general public when they were concerned about their particular locality.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I see that we now have an offer from a Liberal Democrat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   Yes, wisdom comes from all parts of the Chamber. Does the Minister really believe that structure plans are all many years out of date and will always be many years out of date; and that his wonderful new regional plans will all have been agreed and decided last week?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Perhaps I may comment on that point before the Minister answers. With structure plans one could have county spatial plans. It has not been the county structural plans that have held up the system; it has been various governments who have put various timetables on it. The faults have not been with counties but with governments on timetables. You could have very speedy county spatial plans in a modern way. Therefore, we cannot agree at all with what the Minister has just said.
<P>


<a name="column_934"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The short answer to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;and the only one he is going to get&#151;is "No". That is the answer to the question. We are going to argue about this, I suspect, for some time. I take the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   Does the&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I gave the noble Lord an answer. He asked me a specific question, and I answered him, "No". I am not going to elaborate. He may not like a one-word answer, but that is the answer I shall give however many times he asks the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   What the Minister does not realise is that I am not going to ask the same question again. I want to point out that the whole of the Minister's argument has been based on his allegation that structure plans are always out of date and that the new regional spatial plans will always be up to date. That is the whole of his argument. He is asking: "Will people agree with that?" When I ask him whether that will always be the case, he says "No". So he has undermined his own argument, absolutely and completely in one word.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If the noble Lord checks Hansard tomorrow he will realise that he has put words in my mouth that I do not accept.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew8"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I know what I said and I did not say what the noble Lord claims I said.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para0"></a>I accept that the chambers are not directly elected and that that is a bone of contention. We are being realistic about that; no one is arguing to the contrary. On the other hand, although there are all kinds of democratic structures, the levels of directness of democracy vary widely. For example, the parliamentary second chambers of some of our European partners are not directly elected but are composed of people elected in a different way. I am not arguing that that is not so. Those chambers are not directly elected, but they are representative of both local authorities and stakeholders more widely in the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para1"></a>Local authority members represent their local authority on the regional planning board. Members from other stakeholder groups such as business or the voluntary sector will equally speak up for the interests they represent. They will have been put there through some kind of process for the particular body concerned. However, that is not democratic in the sense that we understand the term, at a local government ballot box. Nevertheless, they are there as a voice to ensure that we have the widest possible sounding board for the region. I think that that is legitimate.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para2"></a>Through legislation and guidance we are ensuring that everyone in the region with an interest can get involved in the regional planning process. There will be consultation, representations and, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, an examination in public conducted by an independent panel. For the <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first time we are requiring rather than encouraging consultation while the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy is being prepared. Ultimately, the regional spatial strategy is the Secretary of State's document and he is democratically accountable for it to the electorate and to the other place. 
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para3"></a>We have heard that we must delay our reforms&#151;a point put by one or two noble Lords&#151;until the elected regional assemblies are in place. However, knowing the process being undertaken, anyone who makes that case should realise that such a move will simply delay putting into place the more effective planning system that we so urgently need. Planning Bills are not often considered by Parliament but are a double-decade opportunity. Currently there are too many plans and too much confusion. Our reforms will produce a simpler, faster and more flexible system that creates plans and delivers policies at the right level. They are the right thing to do and it is about time that we made the changes.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para4"></a>On referendums, which I mentioned already, we have not yet set dates for the other regions. We clearly stated why we have not set dates when we debated the previous legislation. We have made it clear, however, that a referendum will be held in a region if there is sufficient interest in holding one. These amendments are a recipe for muddle because there is no guarantee that referendums will be held in a particular region. There would be different structures for plan making between areas with elected regional assemblies and those without. In short, we believe that our planning reforms will produce a simpler and more comprehensible system and that these amendments would just cause more confusion.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para5"></a>Where an elected regional assembly is established&#151;where there is a successful referendum; and legislation will be introduced in Parliament if there is a successful vote in one of the three regions&#151;it is unarguably right that it should take over responsibility for regional planning. However, we should not conflate that with reform of the planning system. That reform needs to happen now. We cannot wait for such reform until the creation of elected regional assemblies, if that is what the people in those regions decide. As I said, the matter depends very much on the choice of people in those regions.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para6"></a>The assemblies may come to pass or they may not. However, our planning reforms&#151;I plead with the Committee&#151;should not be dependent on decisions which will be taken for wholly different reasons. These reforms stand on their own. Although they may be connected to the reform and election of regional government, for heaven's sake, given the current difficulties with the planning system, they should not be dependent on that. I therefore hope that the amendments will not be pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-10_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   When asked how long I thought debate on Amendment No. 1 would take I said one hour. I shall therefore try not to extend the debate.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, and the Minister both used the word "wrecking" but then rowed back a little. This is not intended as a wrecking amendment. <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, described a body with its heart and soul in the region as the body to take responsibility for these matters. I wholly agree. Unfortunately, the criteria for the designation of regional planning bodies do not use that sort of language.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para8"></a>If there is no elected assembly then the Government's proposals will not be the way to go. If the Committee accepts the amendment some matters of detail will have to be considered. If the amendment is not accepted, a great deficit in the first part of the Bill will have to be addressed at the next stage. I did not try to rewrite the whole Bill for the Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para9"></a>The main point is that there seems to be nothing to prevent the current regional planning guidance involving people in the region and becoming much more effective. That could trickle down in the way that the Minister says the Bill will allow. The Government themselves say that they will "save" structure plans for three years. So do we not have to an opportunity to get this right? In the Minister's presentation it seems that convenience overrides the issues of democracy and accountability to which so many noble Lords have referred.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para10"></a>The Minister suggested that noble Lords had perhaps based their arguments on a misunderstanding of how planning works, by ignoring the issues of development control and of dealing with individual planning applications. As the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, said, he did indeed deal with that. Furthermore, Clause 18&#151;the provision that deals with local development&#151;says that the local development document "must have regard to" the regional spatial strategy for the region. Is it not verging on the disingenuous to suggest that the regional spatial strategy has nothing to do with how planning applications are dealt with? From the moment that the Green Paper was introduced many practitioners said that many problems could be dealt with without primary legislation. I suggest that this is one area where we do not need to take the drastic steps that the Minister is asking us to agree.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para11"></a>The Minister said that the proposed regional planning body needs to be sufficiently inclusive. It is up to the electors to decide who should represent them through that body. Regulation 4 of the draft regulations states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The criteria prescribed for the purposes of"&#151;

<a name="40120-10_para12"></a>the relevant clause of the Bill&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-10_para13"></a>This provision divorces the electorate from the body that is going to take the decisions.
<P>

<a name="40120-10_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that we should be prepared to fight certain battles. This is not just a bone of contention, as the Minister described it; it is fundamental. This is a battle that we are prepared to fight. I should like to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-11_para1"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) The RSS shall include a statement of community involvement."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: After the excitement of the previous debate one may have to change some of one's speaking notes regarding other amendments. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para3"></a>This is the first amendment that I shall move on this legislation. I look forward to working with the Minister and the Committee to try to improve the Bill. At Second Reading two weeks ago the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, pointed out that the Bill received a drumming. It has also received a drumming as a result of the first amendment on which we have just divided.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para4"></a>It is important to keep stressing the message that this legislation could ruin our planning system. As some noble Lords mentioned at Second Reading, this legislation will break up a planning system of which we should be proud. We agree with speeding up the planning process but not with throwing out the baby at the same time as the bath water.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para5"></a>During the past few weeks I have had many meetings with many professional organisations. There is widespread consensus that, if we are not careful, in three years or so a new Bill will be presented that is designed to sort out the problems caused by the one that we are discussing. It is important that the Government listen to the arguments now. It is all too easy to upset the balance between democracy and efficiency. It is all too easy to call the planning system old and deny its many strengths in order to put something new in its place simply for the sake of newness. However, it will be much harder to undo any damage to the planning system once it has been done.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para6"></a>On Second Reading I said that it would be much better to reform the current system&#151;I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, also mentioned that&#151;than to throw the whole thing up in the air. However, as we are where we are in the legislative process regarding this Bill, it is incumbent upon us all, regardless of our political hue, to do what we can to prevent the emasculation of the democratic element within the planning system.
<P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para7"></a>We must be aware of paying lip service to democracy and community participation while casting these out with the county structure plans. We debated that matter just now. People must have a voice in planning decisions and those decisions must be made at as local a level as possible. The regional planning bodies must not simply be branch offices of Whitehall doing the Secretary of State's bidding.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para8"></a>Amendment No. 2 would require the Government to put on the face of the Bill a measure to ensure that regional spatial strategies include statements of community involvement. The purpose of having such a statement of community involvement in each regional spatial strategy is threefold but each element is fundamentally aimed at addressing the democratic deficit that lies at the heart of this Bill. First, a statement of community involvement would ensure that the regional planning body must engage with the community that it serves. Planning authorities must make decisions that serve the people of an area; that is, decisions that are representative of those people. If regional spatial strategies do not include statements of community involvement, we shall have no mechanism by which to relate plans to the people they serve.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para9"></a>Statements of community involvement must establish minimum standards that regional planning bodies will have to meet in order to have any democratic legitimacy whatever through the regional spatial strategies. Without those minimum standards many potential problems threaten to emerge. People may feel that regional spatial strategies are irrelevant to them as they have no input or stake in their preparation. They may feel quite legitimately that their democratic right to express their concerns about development has been taken away. Local people will inevitably feel frustrated if they perceive that unwelcome planning decisions have been foisted on them by the Secretary of State or a regional planning body located miles away.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para10"></a>The second purpose of including statements of community involvement in regional spatial strategies, and following on from the first, is that they will allow a more general scrutiny and accountability of regional planning bodies. Through the statement of community involvement it will become apparent if a regional planning body is able to involve the community in the decision-making process in a meaningful way, let alone whether it is doing it well. People have the right to know how the RPG can affect public decisions that affect their lives.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para11"></a>The third purpose of the amendment is that it will make a new planning system fairer and more consistent. Clause 17 requires local planning authorities to prepare statements of community involvement. How can the Minister justify the current logic of the Bill whereby local authorities must work out how they will engage their communities, while regional planning bodies are under no such obligation?
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para12"></a>The Minister will be aware of the research conducted by the Local Government Association in September/October 2002. It asked planning authorities if it would be easy for regional spatial bodies to secure meaningful community involvement in regional planning&#151;95 per <P>


<a name="column_941"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cent of planning authorities said it would not be easy. Lest there should be any suspicion of counties wishing to do down regions, counties constituted less than 10 per cent of respondents to the survey. My speech could be changed following the debate on Amendment No. 1, but we are still possibly going to have regional spatial strategies in those elected regions and we have a long way to go on the Bill, so I wish to pursue my arguments. Among the experts and those currently involved in delivering planning locally, there is real concern about how community involvement will be achieved.
<P>

<a name="40120-11_para13"></a>Those three reasons that I have outlined in some detail on this important part of the Bill are crucial to securing greater community participation and democratic accountability in the planning process. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, we also have Amendment No. 59 in the group. It approaches the matter in a slightly different way, but they have the same objectives. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, provides for a statement of community interest to be included in the regional spatial strategy. We suggest that a statement of community involvement and consultation&#151;the first of the subsections&#151;is part of the process in moving towards a regional spatial strategy. But the thrust is much the same.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para0"></a>At a regional level I acknowledge it is more difficult to ensure that all necessary views are collected, but that does not mean that there is no responsibility to do so. I prefer to think of such matters in terms of participation, because planning is one of the activities of governance. Like other such activities it requires public trust, credibility and support. The "experts" cannot know it all. Indeed, sustainable development and sustainability are unachievable without public involvement, because changes of attitude and behaviour are fundamental to sustainability. We all need to think of "we" and "our" responsibilities, not "they". It all takes time and effort, but that is well spent.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para1"></a>The draft consultation on PPS 11 includes an annex on community involvement. I hope that the Government are open to that. I am sure they are, because all Ministers know that in any subject the more participation from interested people, the better the outcome. If the Government support that approach then why not put it on the face of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   One can ponder on whether the amendments are helpful or not in their precise wording, but I hope that in responding to them my noble friend will not dismiss out of hand the thinking behind them. If one is to make a success of this new strategic approach, and I want to see the policy succeed, it is essential that the maximum good will is generated among those who carry the relevant responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para2"></a>We all know how life develops in the public sphere. If people are not involved, there is a tendency for energy, commitment and professionalism to go into the negative rejectionist mode, instead of endorsing <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what is proposed. I hope that in all that is done and put forward, there will be a real drive to generate a momentum of public good will and involvement.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para3"></a>In saying that, I should declare an interest. I am an active vice-president of the Council for National Parks and a member of the north-west regional committee of the National Trust. I am also a supporter of various environmental agencies such as CPRE. Therefore, I hope&#151;not because of my involvement in those agencies but because of the argument I put forward&#151;that my noble friend will be able to make reassuring comments in relation to these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I was not present at Second Reading of the Bill, but I believe that no one quoted that memorable observation of the Deputy Prime Minister in the early stages of the previous Parliament in the context of the decision relating to Stevenage. In effect, he said of the administration that the green belt was the achievement of a Labour government and that they proposed to build on it.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para4"></a>I am the first to acknowledge that that should not be taken literally, but its spirit is bound to have aroused the suspicions of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the Minister must allow for us being vigilant during the passage of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para5"></a>My suspicions are prompted by a further consideration. I was a veteran of the Commons Committee stage of the Greater London Authority Bill, as I told the Minister yesterday. The Mayor was responsible for ensuring the setting out of a large number of strategies. During the deliberations, I asked Glenda Jackson, who was at that stage leading for the Government, what would happen if the strategies were in conflict with each other. She memorably replied that they could not be because the Bill prevented them from being so. That did not seem to me to be a certain consequence of the relationship between human beings and legislation. I am wholly in support of the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield to ensure a degree of restraint and contribution by electors within the regions concerned if the Bill were to become law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Plumb: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment for many reasons. I have not today heard anyone refer to the areas of outstanding natural beauty. Those areas and their representatives are many. I declare an interest as president of the Cotswolds AONB and there are 17 local authority members. In addition, some 40 park wardens, all voluntary, work successfully in the areas in monitoring the activities there and the people who wish to visit such a wonderful part of the world. Those people need to be consulted because they are on the ground and are concerned.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para6"></a>I am concerned that on reading the Bill there appears to be some superimposing of yet another tier to govern the existing bodies. The areas of outstanding natural beauty, and that in which I have an interest, have with a good deal of support been built up over a short time. I remember saying at our first meeting, over which I was presiding, that it was remarkable that the representatives of some 17 local authorities were all in agreement.
<P>


<a name="column_943"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 943</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para7"></a>They were in agreement on a matter of concern to them all and they are the people who really matter. Adding words to the Bill which would make it clear that full consultation must take place would be effective and would demonstrate to those concerned that they are to be consulted and involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   As the noble Lord referred to areas of outstanding natural beauty, perhaps I may draw to his attention my Amendment No. 36 and three others which address the issue. I hope he will be able to support me on them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, spoke of vigilance. If I were on the Back Benches, I would be watching myself here very carefully! That may be a Spoonerism, but I agree with him. There is no point of disagreement whatever. Furthermore, there is no departure between us on our aims. The Bill puts forward proposals for meeting those, together with background material, but there is no question that the involvement of the communities means that better quality decisions are reached. That is fundamental.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para8"></a>I shall deal with Amendments Nos. 2 and 59 together. I agree with all noble Lords that those with an interest in what the revised regional spatial strategy will look like should be consulted while it is being prepared. The regional planning body should from the very beginning plan for community involvement throughout the process. Perhaps the point of difference is how much we put on the face of the Bill and what is put in regulations and guidance. In terms of principle and practicality, there is no difference between us.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para9"></a>I want to remind the House of our existing proposals for community involvement in the context of the regional spatial strategies&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way. He said that the regional planning bodies would be responsible for preparing the regional spatial strategy. Will he point me to the place where that is stated in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Someone will give me a note and I will then answer the noble Baroness's question. It is not relevant to the point I am about to make, but it is a relevant point overall. There is a procedure which we explained yesterday to noble Lords who attended the meeting with me at which officials were present to answer some of the technical issues. I made it clear that that will happen, but at some point today I will explain the connection and how one will become the other. The answer is fairly straightforward, but I do not want to get it wrong off the top of my head.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para10"></a>Perhaps I may remind the House of our existing proposals for community involvement. In addition to the duty we are placing on the regional planning body to seek advice from counties and other authorities with strategic planning expertise in Clause 4, we are placing extensive statutory duties on the regional planning <P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>body to consult in secondary legislation. The question is how much will be on the face of the Bill and how much in secondary legislation and other guidance.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para11"></a>Under the draft regulations to Part 1, to which reference has been made&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Perhaps I may pose a question. Why are the Government putting on the face of the Bill a statutory duty for local authorities, district councils and so forth but not for the regional planning bodies? If the duty should be in the Bill for one section, why not for the other? That seems logical.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_time0"></a><H5>5.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That is the point that I shall explain. We do not disagree with the principle or practicality of the consultation. The question relates to what is in the Bill as opposed to how it comes about in a statutory way. I shall explain that and, because it is important for those outside who watch our proceedings, I shall stick fairly closely to the briefing. Therefore, I shall go back and start that paragraph again.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para12"></a>Under the draft regulations to Part 1 of the Bill, the regional planning body will have a duty to consult certain bodies while preparing the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy. To the extent that the regional planning body considers that it is affected by the revision, the RPB must consult a specific list of bodies&#151;for example, county councils in or adjoining the region, local planning authorities in or adjoining the region, regional planning bodies for adjoining regions, and regional development agencies for the region and adjoining ones.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para13"></a>To the extent that it considers it appropriate to do so, at this stage the regional planning body must also consult organisations that represent the interests of particular groups; for example, voluntary sector bodies&#151;exactly as the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, stated&#151;ethnic minority communities or, indeed, businesses.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para14"></a>When the regional planning body publishes the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy, it must consult both the bodies that it has consulted during the preparation of the draft and any other bodies and persons which it thinks may wish to make representations.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para15"></a>Although they are too detailed to be set out on the face of the Bill, those statutory requirements are just the bare bones of what we expect to see in terms of consultation and community involvement.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para16"></a>The draft planning policy statement on regional planning&#151;PPS11&#151;sets out what that consultation should and could look like as initial ideas and options are turned into firm proposals. It will involve more than sending out draft documents and collating responses. We expect the counties and other bodies with strategic planning expertise to be closely involved or to take the lead on sub-regional studies or other work that will underpin the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy.
<P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para17"></a>To involve the community more widely, planning policy statement 11 suggests that the regional planning body holds workshops or seminars across topics and themes in the review. Once the regional planning body has identified a preliminary list of issues for the revision, it should hold a one-day public conference to seek agreement that the issues identified are the right ones. It should consider establishing a group, chaired and comprised of people from outside the regional planning body and local authorities to be consulted at key milestones as the draft regional spatial strategy emerges.
<P>

<a name="40120-12_para18"></a>The regional planning body should plan for consultation and community involvement from the very beginning. PPS11 requires the regional planning body, as part of its project plan for the regional spatial strategy revision, to set out how it will involve the community throughout. That involvement needs to be documented. Draft regulations place a duty on the regional planning body to submit to the Secretary of State, at the same time as the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy, a statement setting out how it has consulted stakeholders in the revision process and how the issues raised have been addressed in the draft revision document. That can be compared with what it said it would do in the project plan.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040120/text/40120-13.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Perhaps I may&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   If I may just complete this part, I shall be glad to give way to the noble Lord. In testing the soundness of the regional spatial strategy, the extent of community involvement and stakeholder participation will both be taken into account in the panel's examination of the draft revision. The Secretary of State could reject the revision if he was not satisfied that it had been properly prepared.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para0"></a>We believe that that all adds up to a comprehensive package of community involvement in the regional planning process, with checks in place to ensure that it does take place. Given the way in which it will be carried out, we do not consider that a statutory statement would add value, bearing in mind the process that we are to undertake. I shall now gladly give way to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   Some of what the Minister has described is set out in draft planning policy statement 11 on regional planning. However, there is one point on which I should be grateful to receive the Minister's advice. The document states that, after discussing community involvement, as the noble Lord outlined, the RPB may also wish to consider the likely cost to participants and whether there is any scope for it or other stakeholders to provide financial support for community and voluntary groups in order to assist their ability to participate in the process. Does the <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister agree that that should not be discretionary and that, if one is to involve communities in the way that he described&#151;I approve of everything that he has said thus far&#151;there must be some financial burden on the RPB to assist that process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I wholly agree with the point that the noble Lord makes. The short answer is that that is one reason why the Government have increased substantially the funding available for planning aid. This is a genuine issue. Off the top of my head I do not know what the figures are, but we have substantially increased the funds available for planning aid and for organisations in order to help in the exact circumstances identified by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para1"></a>Perhaps I may complete this part of my answer and I shall then turn to the points raised by the noble Baroness. I hope that it is fair to say that we need to get away from assuming that what is right at a local level might also be right at a regional level&#151;that is, in terms of simple replication. A regional spatial strategy is a different document with a very different purpose from a local plan. To begin with, it will not be site-specific. The regional spatial strategy sets out the strategic framework for the region, and the local plan documents detail which sites should be developed. There is no reason why two such different documents should be subject to the same procedures in their preparation. However, in any event, community involvement is fairly important.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para2"></a>The statutory statement of community involvement is a case in point. Although it would not be valuable at a regional level, it would be valuable at a local level in setting out clearly for the local community how it would be involved in a plan-making process that might affect what its neighbourhood would look like in the years ahead. Local plans are literally much closer to home&#151;that must be accepted&#151;and the community has a far more direct stake in the process. Of course, members of the community may have an interest and want an input into the strategic policies in the regional plan. I go back to what the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, said and the example that he gave of 17 local authorities in one area. Those policies would not be site-specific, but the communities would be absolutely entitled to be consulted right at the beginning and throughout the process.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para3"></a>In principle, there is no argument at all between us in terms of what happens at the local and regional levels. It is a question of how much detail would be on the face of the Bill, bearing in mind that some of that detail would be statutory&#151;that is, in secondary legislation. I cannot recall whether the procedure would be affirmative or negative. However, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships' House will bring forward suitable amendments to meet those recommendations in due course. I can say that now, without having the detailed report in front of me.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para4"></a>I have a list of the bodies which the regulations would require the regional planning body to consult. I shall place that list on the record, first, because it is important and, secondly, so that there is no doubt <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about the detailed attention that we intend to pay to this issue. Earlier, I gave a summary of the list but I shall now give it in full.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para5"></a>To the extent that the regional planning body considers that the draft revision affects a body, the RPB must consult: a local planning authority, any part of whose area is in or adjoins the RPB's region; a county council, any part of whose area is in or adjoins the RPB's region; a parish council, any part of whose area is in or adjoins the RPB's region; the regional planning body for each adjoining region; the Countryside Agency; the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England; English Nature; the Environment Agency; the Strategic Rail Authority; a regional development agency whose area is in or adjoins the regional planning board's region; any strategic health authority which exercises functions in the region; and any telecoms and infrastructure service provider which exercises functions in the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para6"></a>The RPB should also consult, as it thinks appropriate: voluntary bodies, some or all of whose activities benefit any part of the region; bodies that represent the interests of different racial, ethnic or national groups in the region; bodies that represent the interests of different religious groups in the region; bodies that represent the interests of disabled persons in the region; and bodies that represent the interests of persons carrying on business in the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para7"></a>Once the lawyers get to work on that list, it covers an incredible spread of opinion. Most organisations will fit one of those criteria because they will be found to have an interest in the region. It is just a question of what we put in the Bill. I agree that the Bill is too long and already too detailed. That is always a difficulty, and one draws a compromise. In this case, there will be regulations and secondary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sheppard of Didgemere: </B>   I understand the Minister saying that the Bill already covers the community involvement issue; therefore there cannot be much incremental work. I therefore cannot understand why he resists the small number of words in the amendment; they at least would demonstrate that we support democracy upfront in Clause 1.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My noble friend has encouraged us to watch his back. I assure him&#151;and he knows&#151;that I am not watching his back with any sense of hostility on the issue. I have the feeling that he shares our concern and our objectives and it is a matter of how we get right the Bill's wording. It is good to have a Minister with such sensitivity.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para8"></a>Does my noble friend agree that the trouble with illustrative lists is that the organisations that do not appear on the list inevitably hold some significance? I refer to my interests on the previous amendment: for example, there are two organisations&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, referred to areas of outstanding natural beauty, but I refer also to the national parks&#151;that have tremendous responsibility on behalf of the <P>


<a name="column_948"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nation, not simply the local community, for protecting and enhancing those assets for the nation as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para9"></a>I listened carefully&#151;I have a problem with my hearing; however, I do not think that this was due to it&#151;but I heard neither the areas of outstanding natural beauty nor the national parks mentioned in the illustrative lists the Minister gave. I hope that he can say something from the Government Front Bench to the effect that those specific bodies, which carry terrific responsibility, will be consulted in the development of any strategies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   It is not my job to make policy at the Dispatch Box; I am not the planning Minister, but the answer has to be yes. There is no question about that. They may fit the descriptions I have given&#151;frankly I would have thought that they do. They may fit under the definition of local authorities; the national parks are planning authorities, so they are probably defined in the law&#151;I see the Liberal Democrats nodding, so apparently I have got it right off the top of my head.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para10"></a>So while I am not making policy on my feet, the answer to my noble friend's question must be "yes". We do not have a point of principle or difference between us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sheppard of Didgemere: </B>   Will the Minister answer my question: therefore, why does he resist the amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I was about to utter the immortal words, which are not on my brief: we will consider the matter. If anything has been missed out, that is no good because it undervalues what I have said. We need to be clear. As we are in Committee stage and at the moment the score is "county councils 1, Government 0", I will go back to the Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Keith Hill, the planning Minister, who proved to be good listening Ministers following the drubbing the Bill received on Second Reading. After Second Reading, we tabled massive amendments to Clause 4, to consider the matter and see whether we could accommodate the points I have made without adding masses of extra pages to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para11"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the Bill does not say that the regional planning board is to prepare the regional spatial strategy. The Bill creates the regional spatial strategies from the existing regional planning guidances under Clause 1. I do not have the Bill in front of me, but there is a redefinition that one instrument becomes the new instrument. As we explained yesterday, that was done so that there are not great delays that take years. We take the existing regional planning guidance, which becomes the regional spatial strategy. Its revision in due course will be covered by many of the points I made earlier.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para12"></a>There cannot possibly be a case for pressing the amendment on the basis of what I have said. I hope that we can move on to the next debate with a degree of goodwill.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-13_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Could I challenge the Minister a little further? I accept that the regional planning guidances will be at least part of the regional spatial strategy, but it does not say anywhere that they will be all of it. A number of discussions will ensue to shed light on what is involved in the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para13"></a>It seems more than a little relevant that the regional planning board is responsible. The Bill does not say that it will do anything that the Minister said in his response. Clauses 2 and 3 give the RPB some general functions and say that it must keep the regional spatial strategy and the development of its regions under review and it must monitor and implement. It does not say anything about producing or about being responsible for the original implementation of the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para14"></a>The regional planning bodies are being given a lacuna under the Minister's reply&#151;I accept that the provision is in guidance, but it is not written in the Bill. Too often we rely on what goes into Hansard to justify the Bill and people have to go rummaging around to find the reference, when one subsection under Clause 1 would simply say that the regional planning body is responsible for introducing and implementing the regional spatial strategy. That is the reality of the situation, as the Minister indicated.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para15"></a>I am happy for the Minister not to reply tonight and to receive his reply at a later stage, but it would be helpful not only to us here, who are steeped in Bills and sentences and what people say. It is when it goes beyond here that we need to make clear what it is all about. I ask the Minister to review that provision and to ensure that we may return to it by putting it into a clause if he does not respond quickly. It is an important issue.
<P>

<a name="40120-13_para16"></a>While I am on my feet, I declare the appropriate interests, such as being a member of a local authority and a member of a local planning committee, so that that is understood from the outset.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The declaration of interests in this place has always been a mystery to me. They are peculiar and I do not see why they have to be declared. I do not think that one has to apologise in this place for being a member of a local authority, but an apology is almost what a declaration of interest amounts to here. It has nothing to do with the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para0"></a>I have had a note that might help the noble Baroness. If there are any lacunas we will consider them. There will be nothing in the regional spatial strategy that is not in the regional planning guidance, but some parts of the existing regional planning guidance will not become the regional spatial strategy. It will be that way round. I am not sure about the mechanism for transferring one to the other; it may just be a direction. We will clear up those issues during the Bill's passage.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The Minister said that the existing regional planning guidance becomes the RSS, except for those parts that they decide to strike out. Could that be embodied in Clause 1(2)? Instead of giving the Secretary of State carte blanche to implement whatever policies he likes in the RSS, it could limit him to such of those policies as are embodied in the regional planning guidance at the moment when the Bill comes into effect, or something similar.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   That sounds okay, but I think that my right honourable friends might have a problem with that, simply because the process of achieving regional planning guidance is one where there is a prescribed set of procedures which the Secretary of State has to ensure that he follows. So, I do not think that that will be a runner. However, it is a suggestion made in Committee and we shall consider it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before the noble Lord responds on his amendment, perhaps I should remind my noble friends, if no one else, of the amendment to which the Committee agreed a few moments ago. I for one will not roll over, accept this and say, "We know that this will be undone at the other end when the Bill goes back there". Clearly, there are knock-on effects as to who creates the regional spatial strategy, which, as I have said before, for reasons of practicality have not been addressed in all our amendments.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para1"></a>Perhaps I may add briefly to what has been said. If there is no reference on the face of the Bill to a statement of community involvement as regards the regional spatial strategy but there is, and I welcome it, as regards local development, it must be implicit that less weight is attached to it&#151;even though it is spelt out at 15-page length in guidance&#151;if it does not appear in primary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   As regards the amendment I moved a few moments ago and the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he pointed out what might be in secondary legislation and for going through all the consultees, and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para2"></a>The fact that this is not on the face of the Bill is worrying. When we refer to regional spatial strategies, often we are referring to numbers of houses within a community. The Minister knows very well&#151;earlier, he declared my interest as leader of Essex County Council rather than me having to do that&#151;that I am involved in two particular areas: the M11 corridor and the Thames Gateway, where considerable amounts of housing and infrastructure development are planned. To say that the region would not consult and involve those communities in that area&#151;my noble friend referred in the earlier debate to his involvement in a discussion on development in the region&#151;is disappointing. We are not talking about many words here. To repeat what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, if it is included for local authorities why not for the regional spatial strategy?
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para3"></a>We have heard what the Minister said and we shall read and consider it. But this is an issue to which we might have to return. However, I hope that the <P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Minister will think again and include these few words in the Bill. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The RSS shall consist of&#151;
<br>
(a) a concise strategic framework for the spatial dimension of Government policies in delivering and maintaining sustainable economies, communities and environment in that region, including other regional strategies and programmes that have a bearing on the use of land such as (but not limited to) the regional economic strategy, the regional housing strategy and the regional cultural strategy;
<br>
(b) the regional transport strategy;
<br>
(c) policy and general proposals in respect of the development and other use of land in that region (including measures for the improvement of the physical environment and the management of traffic); and
<br>
(d) such other matters as may be prescribed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-14_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The subject of Amendment No. 3 has been trespassed upon in a debate on the previous grouping. The same question arises as to what should be on the face of the Bill and what we should leave unsaid and assume will come out all right in the wash when all the guidance, instruments, and so forth are produced.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para7"></a>Regional spatial strategy is a relatively new phrase. It is used with increasing frequency and is at the very heart of the Bill. Yet nowhere in the Bill does it state what is meant by those three words. The purpose of tabling the amendment is partly to tease out from the Government what is meant by regional spatial strategy but also why it should not be set out clearly on the face of the Bill as previous planning legislation sets out, for example, the scope of a structure plan and other elements of the planning system.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para8"></a>The regional spatial strategy has been explained in various documents, in particular the annex to RPG11 and the information in PPS11, in other explanatory information and in interesting comments by the Minister. It is clear that the RSS will consist of two things which eventually will be the legacy of the two elements that will go into the RSS at the very beginning. The first is the regional planning guidance. In the debate on the previous grouping the Minister explained which parts of the RPG will become the bulk of the temporary RSS, the transitional RSS. The second part will be the successor to the existing structure plans in the case of county councils and to those parts of the unitary development plans in the case of unitary local government.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para9"></a>There are two clear sections to RSS. At the beginning they will be very obviously separate and different. It seems to me inevitable that that will continue to be the case even after the revisions have taken place. Therefore, we should set out what the RSS consists of. I do not claim that the words I suggest are the last words in perfection. But I have set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) what seems to me to be a concise summary of what the Government have stated in RPG11 and PPS11 will be in the RSS.
<P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para10"></a>Paragraphs (c) and (d) contain the wording that applies to structure plans in the 1990 Act, with a little missed off the end. In other words, the Government state that this is what the RSS will consist of as it becomes the transformation of the RPG; this is what the RSS will consist of in so far as it will take on immediately the existing structure plans and, in due course, those structure plans will be turned into sub-regional strategic planning documents. That, as far as I understand, is how it will work.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para11"></a>Having read much of the Bill, much of the documentation and listened to the Minister, I am increasingly surprised that he claims that this will be a simplification of the system and will reduce the number of layers and complications. The more we look into it, the more complicated the whole issue seems to be.
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para12"></a>I tabled the amendment to ask the Government, first, why the definition of RSS, which is so important and so fundamental to the Bill, should not be on the face of the Bill and, secondly, to probe as to how, once the transitional phase is over and we have the RSSs in all their new super-efficient up-to-date glory, they will differ from existing regional planning guidance. Obviously they will differ in detail, but how will they differ in scope and style, in so far as they refer to sub-regional strategic planning, from the existing structure plans?
<P>

<a name="40120-14_para13"></a>The more I read about this, the more it seems to be about process. However, in 10 years' time the documents will not differ much from existing structure plans; they will just have been put together by different people in a different process. In the case of Lancashire, for example, if the North West planning body decided to appoint Lancashire County Council as its agent for sub-regional planning in Lancashire, which would be sensible and practical, the documents will be put together by the same people, the only difference being the political accountability. So how will RSSs differ on those two levels and why should this not be on the face of the Bill? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   Amendment No. 7 stands in my name and is grouped with Amendment No. 3. It addresses the same basic point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;what should be on the face of the Bill? We both believe that the Bill needs to be more specific about the issues that should be covered by the RSS. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has provided a detailed list of appropriate topics. My amendment is more concise, which should appeal to the Minister. It simply proposes the specific inclusion of major transport and infrastructure provisions. It seems to me that the reference in Clause 1(2) to development and use of land within a region is too vague. It does not seem necessarily to cover major regional planning issues such as motorway or trunk road construction and airport development. These are of major strategic importance at regional level. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<A NAME="40120-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   When the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, moved his amendment, he said the objective was to tease out more information from my noble friend. I rather took it from that that this amendment would <P>


<a name="column_953"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 953</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be pressed to a Division. I hope that in replying to the interesting observations made from the Liberal Democrat Benches and the Cross Benches the Minister will say in the context of this debate what I have heard him say powerfully on other occasions; that is, that one of the key planning purposes in our overcrowded, over-stressed society is the enhancement of the countryside and not simply for the benefit of those living there. Psychologically and physically it is absolutely indispensable for the health and well-being of the whole nation. Will the Minister say authoritatively that all that is being done shows the Government's determination to ensure that this rich resource&#151;the countryside&#151;is enhanced as an asset for the nation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-15_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   On this occasion I rise to help the Minister by opposing the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said that it is a probing amendment. I hope he will take my remarks in the spirit in which they are made. I have always accepted that there should be regional planning guidance. Such guidance has informed the making of local plans and structure plans for many years and has been extremely successful. In another life I was Minister for Planning and therefore had a certain responsibility. I have already expressed my opposition to a statutory body such as the RSS without an elected assembly but I recognise that it is restrictive to put such constraints on the face of the Bill, as this amendment seeks to do. I hope that the Minister may find a way of writing into the Bill the fact that the RSSs will be the embodiment of RPGs instead of us having to rely on his words in Hansard. That would help the construction of the Bill and also your Lordships' understanding of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister about one issue included in my noble friend's amendment. I refer to the regional housing strategies which are the responsibility of regional housing boards. Can the Minister explain either now or later exactly how he sees them tapping into this structure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I should like to ask a question before the Minister comes to reply. I have read carefully the passages under the heading, "What is an RSS?" in the Consultation Paper on Draft Planning Policy, Statement 11. I see nothing in there about the specific question of wind power which has been quite controversial. Many applications for planning permission for wind turbines on land have been turned down on environmental grounds. While I accept entirely what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that the primary objective of the RSS should be the enhancement of the countryside, I do suggest to the Minister that there are many areas, which are neither areas of outstanding natural beauty nor national parks, where wind farms would be perfectly suitable. I say that in the context of agriculture in this country. The primary agricultural purpose of land has become unprofitable. Many farmers are looking to alternative ways of making money. In upland areas, one of them could be the use of land no longer suitable for <P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sheep. Unless there is something in the RSS which specifically refers to it, will not local authorities continue to be as negative as they have been in the past?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I do not know the answer to the noble Lord's question except that I was minded to look into the Moses Room where the Energy Bill is being discussed. That would be my immediate reaction. On the point that he raises, I have no doubt that I will get a note to help me to respond.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para0"></a>To respond to what my noble friend Lord Judd said, the Bill deals only with certain aspects of changes. As I said in my closing speech at Second Reading, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working to a master plan&#151;the Sustainable Communities Plan published on 5 February last year. We make it clear that we are interested only in sustainable developments. We want to redevelop the cities to make them living bodies. My noble friend Lord Rogers of Riverside said on Second Reading that the only real sustainable community is in a city. The other side of the coin is that the countryside is protected. It stops the flight from city to countryside if cities are good for living, working and quality of life.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para1"></a>In the Sustainable Communities Plan there is a map on Page 43 which I have used many times at various meetings. It shows the amount of land in England covered by national parks, green belt, and areas of outstanding natural beauty. You can superimpose the urban areas. It is an interesting set of statistics. We have to be very careful. What we have said is that in building sustainable communities, particularly in growth areas, we may have to impinge on certain parts of the green belt. However, we intend to grow it and leave more statutory green belt than we started with. We have already done this. There are an additional 30,000 hectares of green belt land now compared with 1997. I realise a large part is in one area of the country but nevertheless it is statutory and far bigger than it was. I would also say that green belt is not the same as AONBs. Most green belt serves as a buffer around urban areas. It is not land of high visual quality; it is purely designed to stop cities and towns joining up, which is quite right. But green belt and AONB are not the same thing and are separate from the statutory national parks.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para2"></a>This is an important issue. Quite obviously noble Lords are testing the Bill to discover the Government's thinking behind these issues which legislation in the form of a Bill does not always set out. I shall try to set out our thinking and also address the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. Somewhere in my notes is a reference to regional housing boards and I can definitely say that I will cover the noble Baroness's point.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para3"></a>Amendment No. 3 would amend Clause 1(1) to provide that the RSS must consist of the following: first, a concise strategic framework for the spatial dimension of government policies in delivering and maintaining sustainable economies, communities and environment in the region. That would include other regional strategies and programmes that have a <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bearing on the use of land, such as the regional economic strategy, the housing strategy and the cultural strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para4"></a>Secondly, it should include the regional transport strategy. Thirdly, it should set out the policy and general proposals in respect of the development and other use of land in the region, including measures for the improvement of the physical environment and the management of traffic. Finally, it should include any other matters that are prescribed.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para5"></a>Amendment No. 7 of the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, would amend Clause 1(2) to provide that, among other things, the regional spatial strategy must set out the Secretary of State's policies for major transport and infrastructure provision in the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para6"></a>By what I have said previously, I hope the Committee can agree that the Government concur with much of what is said in the amendments concerning the content of an RSS. We differ on whether it needs to be set out on the face of the Bill rather than in policy pronouncements and guidance and, if necessary, in regulations.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para7"></a>Paragraph 1.3 of draft planning policy statement 11 makes clear that the RSS should set out the regional transport and major infrastructure proposals that are necessary to deliver the strategy set out in the RSS. Detailed policy and guidance on what the regional transport strategy should contain are set out in Annex B to the document.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para8"></a>It is crucial that the RSS sets out the regional transport and major infrastructure priorities. In issuing an RSS the Secretary of State will endorse the principle of these proposals as he sees appropriate, taking full account of the report of the panel following the examination in public into the draft proposals. There will then be an opportunity for people to make representations on the precise location of these proposals through the normal statutory routes. The procedures for doing so include a planning inquiry, a highways inquiry and an inquiry into a Transport and Works Act order.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para9"></a>The RSS must be careful not to stray into such site-specific proposals and thereby subvert these statutory procedures and the safeguards they provide.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para10"></a>So, we want to emphasise the role of the RSS in relation to establishing regional priorities. Proposals of national importance need to be considered at the national rather than the regional level. The principle of the need for nationally important proposals will have been established not in an RSS but rather&#151;for example&#151;in a White Paper or in debate in this Chamber. A good recent example that I have used elsewhere is the airports document. The Bill changes how major infrastructure inquiries will be dealt with, but the key to making that change is a clear statement of policy by government on what the issue is&#151;whether it be airports or other matters. So that is necessary; otherwise, the system will not work.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para11"></a>I turn now to the detail of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Paragraph 1.3 of draft PPS11 makes clear that the RSS should provide a broad development strategy for at least a 15-year <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>period. It goes on to state that the RSS should, among other things, identify the scale and distribution of provision for new housing and priorities for the environment, transport, infrastructure, economic development, agriculture, minerals extraction and waste treatment and disposal. I think that demonstrates that if we were to prescribe on the face of the Bill what the RSS should contain it would have to say more than the selective references to such matters as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the improvement of the physical environment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-15_para12"></a>to which the noble Lord's amendment refers.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para13"></a>I say that only because otherwise the legislation is left wide open to people who wish to frustrate development or misuse the proposals. All it does is to make loads of money for the lawyers and slows down the decision-making process. Whether the decision is yes or no does not matter; it slows it down.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para14"></a>Paragraph 2.8 of PPS11 makes clear that the RSS should provide the long-term planning framework for the three regional strategies&#151;to which the noble Lord refers&#151;and the other relevant strategies. I have already referred to the policy and guidance in PPS11 on the contents of the regional transport strategy and to the role of that strategy as an integral part of the RSS.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para15"></a>There is, therefore, no issue between us of what the RSS should contain but merely where we should say it. We are not arguing on any issue of what it should contain. In our view it would be a mistake to fossilise it on the face of the Bill because we would be making references to what matters the RSS should contain, which may change in the future. This is where I turn to the example and answer the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, refers in his amendment to a new type of strategy introduced last year after the Bill had been introduced&#151;the regional housing boards. Who knows what the future may hold? If we put things in great detail in primary legislation, we are making a rod for our own back with other changes that may occur in the future. There is a procedure for doing this. There is the policy and the guidance and, if necessary, the power to use regulation to make good any items that are missing or changes that have come about. So it is only a question of where the issue is written down.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para17"></a>I have some specific answers to give to points raised by Members of the Committee, which I hope I can deal with adequately. The RSS is not site-specific and so would not identify areas for wind farms. It will define broad locations and criteria for wind farm development, to be taken forward by the local development framework. The RSS will plan positively for renewable energy&#151;I think that we take that for granted&#151;but it would not go into that detail.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para18"></a>The regional housing strategy assesses the regional housing needs of the region. This is a fairly new process, which is less than a year old. It will identify housing investment priorities. The information forms the RSS, which sets out the housing requirements for which the planning authority should provide. The <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point was well made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that these issues are very delicate and sensitive, but unless there is planning we end up with sprawl, unsustainable growth and unsustainable communities and we diminish people's quality of life. Therefore, there are some tough decisions to be made.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para19"></a>I hope that the noble Lord in his guise as a local government bigwig of some quality will help me with the communities plan in the growth areas. Of course, as I have told my colleagues, I am working with people of quality in this place&#151;some more important than others&#151;because they carry a lot of clout on the communities plan.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para20"></a>I shall deal with how RSSs will be different from structure plans. Many structure plans repeat what is already national or regional policy. They do not address planning issues that cross administrative boundaries; in other words where the problems are. I explained that matter earlier. We want to explore that area in consultation. The boundaries are important but they are not the be-all and end-all. We need to reach across them. The problems stretch across the boundaries.
<P>

<a name="40120-15_para21"></a>It is not true that RSSs will consist of the regional planning guidance and Part 1 of the UDPs and the structure plans. RSSs will be the regional planning guidance and, through time, the sub-regional policies that are actually needed in the relevant areas. They are obviously different around the country. They will not be the same in every area. The RSSs will evolve over time. It is a question of where it is written down&#151;it will be written down. That is the point, and I hope that I have made it clear. The issues will be written down; the question is where they are written down. They will be written down in such a way that people will not be able to avoid them. I am confident of that.

It is important that the Bill should state some of these important issues&#151;the Minister mentioned the airport issue, which would clearly materially affect a region if central government decided that was to be done. I feel that RSSs must take account of these major national issues to the extent that they affect a particular region. I ask the Government to think about that. I will not be pressing my amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that long and detailed explanation in reply to my point. I am grateful to the other Members who took part in the debate. Although the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has already gone, I will still say that he hit a crucial issue in this Bill. There is real concern that enhancement of the countryside is being downplayed. That concern goes right back to the genesis of the Bill, which now seems a long time ago.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para0"></a>As everyone knows, the Bill was at least in part a result of pressure being put on the Government by development interests, if I can call them that, to say that <P>


<a name="column_958"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development in this country is not easy enough. It is being restricted. As the Minister said, the system is wide open to people who wish to frustrate development. Clearly, there must be a balance. One of the reasons why this Bill started off through its various consultation processes was a belief that development ought to be made easier, in the interests of national economic growth. That concern is a thread that will run through the discussions on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para1"></a>The noble Viscount suggested that these proposals were too restrictive. There are two views and purposes of legislation. One is to allow people in authority, in particular the Government, to do what is thought to be necessary and to give rules and instructions and powers over people in the country to allow things to happen. The other view of legislation is that it is there to restrict the activities of people in power, including Ministers, to those areas that are thought to be necessary. Beyond those that are thought to be necessary, or perhaps highly desirable, they should not be allowed to do what they want, how they want in an arbitrary way. That is why, having listened to the debate, I still think that it would be a good idea to define this phrase in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para2"></a>Can the Minister tell us of anywhere else in planning legislation where a phrase as important as "regional spatial strategy" is included but not defined? I do not want an answer now; I am happy to have one afterwards. It is an unusual process to say that they will put the words in legislation and then the Government, Ministers or civil servants will write it all down on pieces of paper and tell people what the legislation means. It might trip up the courts to do that. It is unusual. Where else in planning legislation does that happen?
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para3"></a>As far as the difference is concerned, I understand now what will happen on structure plans. They will continue to exist as separate entities until they are superseded by the new sub-regional strategies. The Minister is nodding, so I understand how that will happen. How will the sub-regional strategies differ from existing structure plans, apart from boundaries? I understand that they may not follow the existing local authority boundaries, although not following them is a recipe for more confusion and more chaos. Again, I am happy for the Minister to tell us afterwards, or perhaps write to us. How will they differ? In what ways will they differ from structure plans? If we picked up a document, and it did not have a heading, would we read it and think that it was a structure plan, because it is simply the successor to those present plans? I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Nevertheless&#151;Part 3 is related to Part 2, so they are connected&#151;I would be interested in the Minister's response to the issue raised here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I am not certain whether I can speak to Amendment No. 5, because the Deputy Chairman said that it could not be called if we agreed to Amendment No. 4. As they are grouped together&#151;I will speak to it. This is an important amendment, so I want to go over it.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para7"></a>As the Bill stands, a regional spatial strategy is conceived as nothing more than a planning document that states the Secretary of State's policy agenda for a particular region. We all recognise the importance of the Government's role in giving strategic leadership to the planning system. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said during the debate on Amendment No. 1, Parts 1 and 2 of this Bill basically amount to the nationalisation of the planning system, and that is a very bad idea indeed.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para8"></a>This amendment is aimed at freeing up the regional planning bodies, via the regional spatial strategies, from being simply the mouthpieces of Whitehall policy. This is not a political point. This amendment addresses the concern, expressed by many interested parties, that unless there are changes in the way the regional spatial strategies are established in legislation, there will be no space for local accountability as planning policy is implemented on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para9"></a>We all want to help to speed up planning decisions. Centralised planning, while perhaps speeding up the system, will inevitably mean bad planning. Our current planning system needs reform, because it is too slow. We all agree on that. At least it has the distinct advantage of maintaining local accountability. As was mentioned at Second Reading, local responsibility for planning has meant that the quality of planning decisions has generally been good. At Second Reading, most noble Lords said that we probably had the best planning system in the world. Good quality planning must continue to be the key objective of any planning legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para10"></a>Thus, it is vital that we establish more mechanisms for the exercise of community participation at the regional level&#151;hence my earlier amendment and the long discussion that we had on that&#151;and bolster the capacity of regional planning bodies to respond to local conditions. At the moment, this legislation simply fails to recognise the enormous differences and variations between and within regions&#151;I know that well, in regard to the eastern region&#151;in terms of local land use and the development of future needs.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para11"></a>As it stands, Clause 1(2) would lead to the accelerated fossilisation of regional spatial strategies, because they would have to constantly keep up with the rate at which new demands emanate from Whitehall in order to satisfy the requirements set out by the Secretary of State's policies. If the Government are serious about devolving power to the regions&#151;we <P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have had lots of debates about this&#151;and if they are serious about devolution, then how do they square that with a policy that makes regional planning bodies&#151;even after the establishment of elected regional assemblies&#151;simply the agents of Whitehall and Westminster?
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para12"></a>Not only is democratic accountability being sucked out of the system by transferring powers upwards away from counties, but it also leaks out at the regional level. Regional planning bodies might find themselves accountable for policies that they do not support and over which they can exercise no control. In the brave new world of devolution and elected regional assemblies, one cannot simply transfer the old accountabilities on to the new regional structure.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para13"></a>The regional spatial strategy should not be a vehicle for simply setting out government policy. It should be a strategic vision that meets the planning needs of local communities. Their elected representatives should agree it. Of course, regional spatial strategies will still have to have regard to the Government's priorities, and this involvement maintains that important dimension.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para14"></a>This amendment would ensure that regional spatial strategies are permitted the necessary flexibility to respond to conditions in their areas. It would go a small way towards restoring a better balance between local accountability and central control. Ultimately, by reasserting the principle of subsidiarity and reversing the tide of centralism found throughout the Bill, the amendment would ensure better planning decisions than would be the case otherwise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 10. Noble Lords will not be surprised to hear that I agree with the sentiments expressed in favour of the two previous amendments in the group.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para15"></a>Amendment No. 10, like others in Clause 1, is now rather redundant, in a technical way, following the acceptance of Amendment No. 1. I had tabled it as another means of making a distinction between the situation in regions which had an elected assembly and those which did not. The distinction I was making was that where there is a legitimately elected body in the region, that body, rather than central government, should have control over the policy behind the regional spatial strategy. It would be a value-added feature of an elected assembly as opposed to a region which did not have an elected assembly. It is simply another means of making elected regional assemblies mean something in the regions that decide to have them; indeed, it could give them some meaning when people are being asked to vote for them.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para16"></a>While we talked about regional assemblies in debating Amendment No. 1, the Minister several times put himself forward not only as an expert on his own Bill&#151;which he is, and has every right to be&#151;but also as an expert on Liberal Democrat policy on the subject. He kept telling us that we were in favour of imposing regional assemblies throughout the country whether or not people wanted them. Since then, I have been able to get a copy of the motion that was passed <P>


<a name="column_961"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 961</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at the Liberal Democrat conference the last time the matter was debated and party policy was made. The Liberal Democrat party still makes party policy in an open and democratic way at our conferences. Quaint and old-fashioned though that may now seem in the political system, we believe it is something we should do.
<P>

<a name="40120-16_para17"></a>The motion was called "Creating Regional Government" and was passed at the federal conference of the Liberal Democrats in March 2002. I would love to read out the whole motion but it is about three pages long, so I will not. However, I am prepared to write to noble Lords and put copies in the Library if there is a demand. The relevant section says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Conference therefore calls on the Government to . . .  enable regional referenda to be held as soon as possible, and pass a Regional Powers Act"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-16_para18"></a>to say what powers they could take up.
It is quite clear from the policy document from which that is taken that the regional referendums would be triggered not by central government saying, "We think they'll do up north, but nowhere else, so they can have them whether they like it or not". Instead, referendums would be triggered by people in the region&#151;a proportion of local authorities or by 5 per cent of the electorate&#151;asking for a referendum. If there was a yes vote, they would get a regional assembly, with far greater powers, far more devolution and far more takeover of the regional quangos than the Government are proposing. But that is all for another day. If the electorate voted no, they would not get a regional assembly. I do not know where the Minister gets his information about Liberal Democrat policies from, but whatever his source, it is not very accurate.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I support the amendment spoken to by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield. In the days, long ago, when I attended the Harvard Business School, there was, in the first year, a course devoted to personnel activity, most of which seemed to me to be quite astonishingly obvious. But one thing was said to us during that course which struck me freshly, and I have remembered it ever since&#151;namely, one's responsibility, in any human organisation, for playing the part of a participant observer.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para0"></a>Those of us who sit on the Back Benches in debates of this sort, who embark on what will quite clearly be a series of engagements of test match quality, but who do not represent any particular interest outside which requires them to express opinions, have the opportunity for reflection during such a process. Other test matches in which they have taken part in the past, analogous to the one in which we are currently engaged, come back to them. The one which has come back to me is the Licensing Bill, and of those noble Lords in the Chamber tonight, it will also have come back to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for he was a veteran of the same Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para1"></a>My recollection of the Licensing Bill, which also ran into a reaction from local authorities which we sought to express during those debates, is that the legislation was unduly centralising and prescriptive. My recollection is <P>


<a name="column_962"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that in that Bill, local authorities&#151;which I substitute for the regional planning bodies and the regional spatial strategy in this instance&#151;were obliged to produce policies in relation to their licensing activities. However, those licensing policies had to have regard to the advice which they received from the DCMS. Those were the very words to which, if my recollection is correct, my noble friend Lord Hanningfield referred in this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The noble Lord may appreciate that the guidance has still not been published, after all these months. It has not yet appeared.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I do not want to press my analogy too hard, but I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing attention to that particular foible in the process.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para2"></a>The words in the Licensing Bill were regarded as unduly prescriptive by the local authorities and therefore, by definition, the words to which my noble friend Lord Hanningfield is objecting in his amendment are more prescriptive still. I totally appreciate that circumstances alter cases and that the history of planning may be quite different from the history of licensing. The Minister may therefore have arguments relating to planning history which invalidate the analogy I have made. But because I recall the reaction of local authorities to the way in which they felt they were being imposed upon by the Government in having to pay respect to a national policy, I certainly support my noble friend and will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I pray in aid the consultation paper on draft planning policy PPS11 in this regard. It says that the regional spatial strategy should be specific to the region; while it should have regard to national policies, it should not simply repeat them. That is not what Clause 1 says. Subsection (5) says that the regional spatial strategy for a region,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is so much of a regional planning guidance relating to the region as the Secretary of State prescribes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-17_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40120-17_para4"></a>What we have been talking about throughout our debate is what is involved in the regional spatial strategy and its position. Either the guidance is wrong, in which case it should not say "should have regard to" but should state quite categorically that the regional planning guidance, as laid out by the Secretary of State, has to be part of the regional spatial strategy, or it is not what the Bill says. That is precisely what my noble friend has just described. I should have thought that the guidance should be correct. The policies will lay out the Secretary of State's regional planning guidance, and it should draw attention to that. Clearly, those will be subsumed into local plans&#151;will be part and parcel of them&#151;where practical and obvious. The Government have to get the matter right and they have to decide what we are discussing and what is to be the rationale.
<P>


<a name="column_963"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para5"></a>While I am on my feet perhaps I could ask the Government not to split infinitives. "To better develop" is a split infinitive and when I was at school that was an absolutely heinous crime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We have here the possibility that regional planning guidance will be written in Whitehall which will not be applicable to particular regions or a particular region. On the other hand, if those in Whitehall write the strategies for regions, what are the people in the regions to do, if they must take account of that? We need some clarification because people must have room to move. One cannot centralise everything and expect someone below to interpret matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   As the Minister has explained, in the first instance, the regional spatial strategy consists of such parts of the regional planning guidance as the Secretary of State chooses to read across. Every part of the RPG that is relevant, goes into the RSS and there is no discretion there, according to the description that the Minister gave earlier today. If the Bill had said that, there would have been less anxiety about the centralising tendencies of the Bill. If all that is to happen on day one is that the RPG becomes the RSS and has statutory force, whereas the RPG does not, people will see that the opportunity existed at a later stage, when the RPG comes to do the first revision, for changes to be made on a much more democratic basis, as the Minister has outlined.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para6"></a>I believe that it would help the Committee enormously&#151;and I would like to know the answer&#151;if the Minister could say which parts of the RPG the Government intend not to read across. The Minister has already said that parts will not go into the strategy. That is why he was reluctant to accept the notion that one could alter the wording in Clause 1 so that it said precisely what he has said from the Dispatch Box&#151;that it would consist of the RPG less whatever words the Secretary of State chose to leave out. That could have been expressed as giving the Secretary of State a power to transfer the RPG in total, less any words that he would designate by an order.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para7"></a>He also said that nothing can be inserted in the RSS which is not already in the RPG. That is equally important because it means that until the first revision, which is conducted under Clause 5 by the RPB, nothing can go into the RSS at the whim of the Secretary of State unless your Lordships choose to amend the Bill in such a sense. In this Committee we are perfectly free to instruct the Secretary of State to put matters into the RSS or to say that the RSS can contain certain matters, but the Minister has told your Lordships that the Secretary of State is to bar himself from putting anything into the RSS which is not already in the RPG. If that had been made clear on the face of the Bill in Clause 1 a lot of trouble would have been saved.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his questions, which have enabled me to find what I hope is a satisfactory answer. I almost rose before the noble <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Hanningfield, because the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, did not actually move the amendment. She specifically said that she was not going to pursue it. I thought that would be one debate that we would not have and all of a sudden we have had a debate. The words, "I beg to move" have not been uttered. I have been careful on this point. We are making laws under the Bill, and we have had a debate on a group of amendments. I have a very short speaking note and I hope I have an answer to the central issue.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and I will never come to an agreement on Liberal Democrat policy, but the whole thrust of all the speeches from Liberal Democrats in this Committee is that there will be regional governments in every region. That is the underlying assumption of every speech to which I have listened and I have listened to too many. That is why I made the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   The Minister is mistaking party policy and our faith that if there is a referendum in any region on a decent regional government we can persuade people to vote for it.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I shall stick to the issue. This group of amendments raises the issue of what is a regional spatial strategy. I realise that so far I have been inadequate in explaining it. The amendments raise the issue of whose policies such a strategy will contain and what those policies may address. As drafted, Clause 1(2) defines the regional spatial strategy as setting out the Secretary of State's policies, however expressed, in relation to the development and use of land in the region. Clause 1(3) clarifies that the regional spatial strategy may contain policies for sub-regions.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para9"></a>Amendment No. 4 would remove both that definition and the clarification. Amendment No. 5 seeks to alter the nature and contents of the regional spatial strategy. Instead of setting out the Secretary of State's spatial policies, it would simply have regard to those policies. Amendment No. 10 would specify that the regional spatial strategy would set out the Secretary of State's policies only if there were no elected regional authority for the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para10"></a>Noble Lords have made quite clear their view that they do not believe that there should be regional plans for which the Secretary of State is ultimately responsible. They want the regional plans only where there are elected regional assemblies. However, their approach would create and not solve problems. Our regions are not identical. Their circumstances and the challenges that they face are each different and unique. We need regional plans. Without the plans there would be a vacuum. It is only at regional level that we can sensibly address important strategic planning issues. Many of those issues are region-wide and those that are not&#151;sub-regional issues&#151;do not respect the boundaries of county areas. It is that latter point that demonstrates why Clause 1(3) is a vital provision in the Bill.

<a name="40120-17_para11"></a>It will not surprise noble Lords to learn that Amendment No. 5 is not acceptable. If an elected regional assembly were responsible for the revisions to the regional spatial strategy, the right relationship to the Secretary of State's policies would be that of having regard to them. But this amendment foresees two sets of regional spatial policies: those in the regional spatial strategy and those of the Secretary of State. I cannot imagine that the noble Baroness would want the Secretary of State to have policies for a region that had its own elected governance&#151;that is a different issue&#151;if that is the result of the referendum.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para12"></a>The regional spatial strategy must set out the Secretary of State's policies in relation to the development and use of land in the region. The regional spatial strategy can include different policies for different areas within a region. If there is any conflict between the policies and any other statement or information in the regional spatial strategy, the policies will prevail. All current regional planning guidance, with a few exceptions, will be converted to the regional spatial strategy in regulations. Those exceptions will be RPG3, which covers London; 3A, strategic views in London; 3B and 9B, the River Thames; and 9A, the Thames Gateway. Those documents will be replaced in large part by the Mayor's London plan and were not subject to public examination when they were prepared.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para13"></a>I wish I had been able to say that earlier. The notes were there for another debate and they are quite specific because reading the Bill as drafted, and with what I had said earlier, that cannot happen, but it might have appeared as though the Secretary of State, at a whim, on a hunch, or on a prejudice, could influence the regional spatial strategy in a way that would be wholly unacceptable to the Committee, to the other House and to anyone else who is a democrat. That cannot happen anyway under the rules for the regional planning guidance, and the way in which they are put together. There will be nothing in the regional spatial strategy that is not in the RPGs, but it may not include all that is in the RPG. I did not give examples of what is not in it because one could make a big policy change by omission&#151;which is what the suspicion would be.
<P>

<a name="40120-17_para14"></a>By making clear the specific exceptions, I hope that I have knocked on the head any suspicion, which would legitimately have been there&#151;although it would be a very unfair aspersion to cast on the character of my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister. Nevertheless, in being specific about that, I hope that I have satisfied the points that were made. We shall obviously return to the issue, particularly in view of the Government's defeat earlier.

<A NAME="40120-18_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I wish to say something before my noble friend on the Front Bench decides what he is going to do with his amendment. The Minister is making a fundamental error. He has not accepted that current planning guidance&#151;RPGs&#151;are there to guide the structure plans, which are open to examination and inspectors' reports. They are not structure plans; they are guidance. The Bill turns guidance, which for the <P>


<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moment is guidance for the making of structure plans, into spatial strategy plans. Guidance now becomes statutory. What is unsettling is that something that is now a form of guidance is to become a statutory framework.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   This is where we go into the areas where, in some ways, we need the lawyers at work. RPGs may be guidance, it is true, but my experience in the past couple of years or so with some of them is that they are treated as being almost statutory because we wish to change a figure or suggest a change here and there. I am not saying that they are more than guidance, but I say that because of the way in which they are produced, following public examination, because of the way in which I in my day job conduct discussions on the growth areas, particularly in the south-east, and because of the care, attention and detail that people bring to what is in them. I may be wrong&#151;I shall return to the issue if need be&#151;but I do not get the impression that they are informal, casual guidance documents. They are treated much more seriously than that, even though they do not have the statutory back-up that they will get when converted to regional spatial strategies. I have probably dropped myself in it by saying that, but that is the impression that I get doing my day job.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   Well, indeed, the Minister's impression from his day job or night job is correct. However, I wonder whether he would accept that the reason why the guidance is taken so seriously is that it is currently put together by members of local authorities. The only structure available to produce the guidance comprises members of authorities who have been responsible for producing unitary development plans and county structure plans in their own authorities. One thing that makes us nervous about any proposal to lessen the involvement of county councillors&#151;for example, in planning in their area&#151;is that in the intervening period before the creation of some sort of elected regional body there will be a hiatus during which no one feels any real ownership. At that point, the Minister is in danger of losing the coherence that he has rightly identified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   If my noble friend Lord Hanningfield will indulge me, I have a question similar to that asked by my noble friend Lord Ullswater. I am a bear of very little brain and, although I heard what the Minister said about regional planning guidance that was omitted from the generality of the list, I want to test my understanding. Is it simply a matter of chronology that the regional spatial strategy has already been dealt with by the mayor and is shortly to be published, so that the documents that have been eliminated become academic once the mayor has taken his action?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I do not know. I do not have the detail of the way in which the London plans are put together, as it is some time since I dealt with it. I do not know whether it is a matter of chronology.

<P>

<a name="40120-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord's intervention has given me the opportunity to receive a note, which points out that the same people prepare the draft revisions of the regional planning guidance as the regional spatial strategy; in other words, the same people prepare the revisions. I hope that answers the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para1"></a>The answer to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, is "Yes".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I return to my original amendment, which would have removed the word "must" and put in the words "have regard to". We shall have a lot of discussions about the whole issue, during the passage of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and the Government do not seem to realise this, but we are here to help. We would all like planning processes to be speeded up, and we would all like local people to be involved. We shall have a discussion about the definition of "sustainable" at some point&#151;but we would all like to see the involvement of local people and sometimes difficult decisions taken that benefit communities.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para2"></a>We believe very much in a bottom-up approach, while the Government seem to believe that it would work to have a top-down approach. We do not believe that will work. The Minister was kind enough to make some kind remarks about me, and I had some meetings with him yesterday with my other hat on. That sort of discussion is what achieves results&#151;not the Secretary of State saying, "You must do this" or "You must do that". That builds up enormous resentment locally, and will not achieve what the Government want.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para3"></a>I hope that in the course of our discussions in the Chamber we might improve the Bill, and that we will take away the "nationalisation" of the planning system, as it has been described, which is very much resented by local authorities, and even more resented by people in the localities. They want to be involved in discussions that go upwards and end up in development. It simply will not work otherwise; as I said earlier, we shall be back here in three or four years' time looking at another Bill. If the Secretary of State believes that he can impose regional policies, it will not work.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para4"></a>As my noble friend Lady Hanham said, there is conflict between what is said in the Bill and in the guidance, which we have just considered. There is a whole raft of things that need to be questioned and discussed, but we may end up speeding up the processes if the Government will only listen to us a bit more about local accountability, and the need for local people to be involved and for the process to go up rather than down the whole time.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para5"></a>We shall have many discussions along those lines in the next few days. I am sure that we shall return to the matter. Although I shall not press my amendment today, we shall have to pursue the matter further as the Bill progresses.

I wanted the debate because of the amendments connected to it, and the debate has been very useful. However, for reasons that Members of the Committee can see&#151;particularly with the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves&#151;what happened earlier this afternoon has caused complications. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-18_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40120-18_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I wish to make it clear that I do not dispute the need for Secretary of State to have the right to inform the regional planning authority of the direction that he wishes it to take&#151;if necessary in some detail. The Secretary of State already has such a right, and our planning system has worked well, with overall central control in the hands of the Secretary of State implemented on the ground by elected councillors. That is the system that I wish to see continued, but we must avoid unnecessary hazard&#151;and I believe that the words "however expressed", referring to the policies of Secretary of State, is such a hazard.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para10"></a>I give an example. Let us suppose that the Secretary of State has issued precise guidance on a controversial matter. He is invited to appear on the BBC's "Today" programme at eight o'clock and faces some critical, perhaps hostile, questions. He replies forcefully and well and may express himself with some freedom, perhaps exceeding the more cautious words in his more formal guidance. As I understand the phrase "however expressed", his words on the radio interview then have legislative effect. That is legislation by mouth.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para11"></a>Perhaps I may remind the Minister of a celebrated case in which one of his predecessors was involved. The year is 1947. The Minister is Mr Silkin. The issue is the designation of Stevenage as a new town. The decision to so designate the first new town had been taken before the necessary legislation had been enacted and had aroused fierce criticism locally. The Minister went to Stevenage to explain the decision and he had a rough time of it. At one point he said, "It is no good your jeering. It is going to be done". The Minister was taken to court and Mr Justice Henn Collins held that the order was not ultra vires but that the Minister had been biased in his consideration of the order and he quashed the order. Some weeks later, when the Bill had completed its passage through Parliament, the decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal by a committee presided over by Lord Oaksey.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para12"></a>I wish to avoid any such embarrassments in future. I hope that the Minister will understand my motive in seeking to delete the two unnecessary words. My intention is to be helpful to him by improving the text of the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40120-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We on these Benches support the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, says, at a public meeting there could be some extraordinary expressions from the Deputy Prime Minister or the Secretary of State and we could have some very funny policies. One could have planning policy by e-mail, for example. They would be expressions of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40120-18_para13"></a>Through this provision, the Government seek to give themselves maximum latitude in setting planning policies. The noble Lord must consider whether these words are appropriate. I hope that the Minister will say that these words are unnecessary. They seem extraordinary and somewhat absurd to most of us.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   I support the amendment. If these unnecessary words are excluded, they should be deleted also from Clause 11(3) on page 6 of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   They also appear in former Tory legislation which I presume Conservative Peers voted for in this House. Perhaps the noble Lord was not present then.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para0"></a>I give an example. While I fully respect the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, it is not legislation by mouth. I understand the reaction&#151;shock and abomination&#151;on first seeing such words in legislation. It is not quite as bad as it seems. The amendment deletes the words. However, I hope to demonstrate that that would undermine our intention for a more integrated spatial dimension to policies. That is true: it is not just because it is stated here. The words are important.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para1"></a>We have used the word "spatial" a great deal. It is not a new idea. The concept of a "spatial strategy" is already on the statute book in the form of the Greater London Authority Act provision for the Mayor's spatial development strategy. Therefore, it is time to remind ourselves of what we mean by spatial planning and why it matters.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para2"></a>Spatial planning goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for the development and use of land with other policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they function. That includes policies which impact on land use, for example by influencing the demands on or need for development but which are not capable of being delivered solely or mainly through the granting or refusal of planning permission and which may be implemented by other means.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para3"></a>The current wording of Clause 1(2) makes it clear that the regional spatial strategies can contain such policies&#151;that is, not those exclusively for land use. To delete the phrase "however expressed" potentially limits the scope of the regional spatial strategy to be what its title says it should be: that is, a spatial strategy for the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para4"></a>There is a good precedent. The words "however expressed" can be found in a number of Acts of Parliament, including relevantly&#151;if I were to quote an Act which was not relevant to the Bill it would probably undermine the point&#151;in paragraph 17(3) of <P>


<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Part II of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This provision is not unique. It is not designed to allow the Secretary of State to operate "policy by mouth" in a radio interview; far from it.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para5"></a>The inclusion of the phrase absolutely does not mean that the Secretary of State can create regional planning policy outside the regional spatial strategy. He can issue national policy statements. They would affect the region. What it does mean is that those policies within the regional spatial strategy can properly be spatial, as I outlined earlier, and not within narrow confines. So the words have an important legal meaning with regard to the Bill and a genuine spatial strategy. There is a precedent in the Town and Country Planning Act which I suspect was not debated in this House when it went through Parliament in 1990.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I wish my noble friend Lord Greaves was present. This discussion is closely linked to the question he raised about what is a regional spatial strategy. The Minister's remarks will repay careful reading.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para6"></a>Although this point may not be right having heard his last sentence or two, what may be meant is "wherever expressed". It is about spatial strategy but it might not have the heading of regional spatial strategy. That is why I link it with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Greaves. I am so ashamed of myself. Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has not formed part of my bedtime reading. The fact that terminology is already in legislation does not mean that it is unchangeable. It means that one should hesitate to change it. But if it is causing the confusion which still reigns in my mind, despite the answer, it bears closer examination.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I do not wish to prolong the proceedings. However, what the Minister has just said will confuse readers of the proceedings today when they look back to what has been said on previous amendments.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para7"></a>The noble Lord made clear that the initial RSS would contain nothing which was not in the regional planning guidance. Certain exceptions which are at present in the regional planning guidance&#151;the Minister helpfully outlined what those are&#151;may not appear in the RSS. How can one express something in addition to what is in the RPG? The words "however expressed" mean that at some point between the passage of the Bill and the first revision, dealt with under Clause 5, an idea might occur to the Secretary of State. He expresses it in whichever form he chooses. It may be an order or a speech in Parliament. It appears to give him a discretion and latitude which the Minister's previous remarks did not claim. He sought to tell the Committee&#151;I found it reassuring&#151;that there was no intention by the Secretary of State to lay down in an RSS anything which was not already contained in the RPG; and even that was not the totality of it because there were certain exceptions which the noble Lord outlined.
<P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para8"></a>The words "however expressed" seem to indicate that the Secretary of State is giving himself the right, at some point in the future, to put things in which are not in the RPG, because otherwise there would be no purpose in having the words. The reference back to the 1990 Act, with great respect to the Minister, is not relevant in this context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   Contrary to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I am profoundly reassured, for personal reasons, by what the Minister said in response to the debate. I am genuinely fond and admiring of the Deputy Prime Minister, but even his closest friends would not deny that he has certain stylistic idiosyncrasies of personal expression. The fact that the Minister has been able to quote legislation, and particularly copper-bottomed legislation brought in by a Conservative government, indicates that there was no such consideration in those words in parentheses. I am greatly reassured that that is so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   I am grateful for the Minister's reply to my question. As I listened to the comments on my amendment, it seemed to me that the nature of the communication between the Secretary of State and the region will be of fundamental importance. Will it simply be an anthology of the existing guidance that he wishes to see reproduced&#151;we were given that impression earlier this afternoon&#151;or will he issue some more binding instruction? It is not altogether clear where we shall end up. I suspect that there will be further debates on this subject as the Bill proceeds. Therefore, I do not intend to pursue the matter further this evening.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para9"></a>However, there is another way of doing this. There is something to be said for a degree of formality in the communication between the Secretary of State and the regional planning authority. Indeed, one might go so far as to suggest that this should take the form of an order under a statutory instrument and that the Select Committee of the House that studies these matters might be able to give him some helpful advice on how that should be formulated. That degree of formality would not be very much in accord with the discussions that we have heard this afternoon, but the nature of this communication is, in itself, fundamental. We shall have to return to the matter at a later stage. For the present, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem that has plagued the country for more than 40 years. It is the problem of where Travellers and Gypsies can find to live in a countryside that is increasingly used for other purposes, where many of the stopping places which the travellers used to frequent have now become overrun by buildings, roads or other structures.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para14"></a>The number of Traveller caravans on unauthorised sites increased by about 600 between January 2001 and January 2003, according to the count which was made by the local authorities and published by the ODPM. This is the direct result of the repeal by the Conservative government in 1994 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, which placed an obligation on local authorities to provide accommodation for Gypsies residing in, or resorting to, their area. Up to that point, and for the next few years after repeal, the local authorities had been getting on top of the problem. If they had continued to develop new sites after 1997 at the same rate as in the years before that date, then, as a matter of simple arithmetic, we would have 1,000 more pitches now than there actually are. It was impossible for the private sector to make up for this loss. We told the government then that a time would come when the losses would begin to show up in increased numbers of unauthorised sites. The then Labour opposition, led by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, agreed with us.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para15"></a>One way of remedying that deficiency and preventing an indefinite increase in the number of homeless Travellers year on year in the future would be simply to restore the duty on local authorities to provide sites. That was, in effect, one of the main recommendations of the Birmingham University report by Pat Niner to the ODPM on which Ministers have said that they will comment in April. My impression is that they had already ruled this out before they brought in Mr Bill Forrester from Kent County Council to look at these issues. It would be very helpful if the Minister would tell us exactly what his terms of reference were.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para16"></a>But if local authorities are not to provide sites then they must at any rate grant planning permission for sites in the places where the Travellers are at present having to camp on the roadside, on somebody else's land, or on their own land without planning permission. That is a phenomenon that has caused a great deal of complaint. This morning, I was talking to officials of the Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council who are currently having difficulty with an unauthorised site that is occupied by about 21 Gypsy families, on which the local authority has obtained a court order for possession. The point there is that there is nowhere for these people to go. If they are driven off that site, the local authority is not making alternative provision for them but has told them that they have to seek land on which planning permission might be granted. We all know how difficult that is.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para17"></a>I am sure that it is not necessary to persuade the Government that circular 194 has been a failure. That was the Tory government's feeble attempt to persuade local authorities to have regard to the needs of Travellers in their development plans. Of course, hardly any of <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them did so. As a general rule, Travellers have been able to make only insufficient provision for themselves by purchasing land, applying for permission and then going to appeal when they meet the inevitable refusal. In spite of the clear evidence of the January counts, which show that this haphazard process is not delivering, the Government have been deaf to the suggestion, made to several Ministers since Labour took office in 1997, that we should monitor the rate of success of Traveller applications for planning permission and of appeals. Ministers have told me that the planning inspectorate has the figures&#151;the Minister will recognise that phrase&#151;but Donald Kenrick has shown that they are seriously inaccurate.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para18"></a>In the debate that we had last June on Gypsies and social deprivation, the Minister who replied, the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, offered some encouragement. He said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government are reviewing planning procedures, and gypsy and traveller provision will be looked at as part of that review".&#151;[Official Report, 5/6/03; col. 1581.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-19_para19"></a>So this is the moment when the Government can deliver on that undertaking and also take into consideration what the Minister said on an earlier amendment; that is, that this is a once in a double decade opportunity. He is absolutely correct, because the last occasion when we had the opportunity of solving the problem of Gypsies at a single stroke, as it were, was after the report of Sir John Cripps in 1977. So 26 years have elapsed since then and if we do not take this chance that we have under the planning legislation, we may wait another 25 or so years for a solution.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para20"></a>The first of these amendments requires the Secretary of State to set targets for the regional spatial strategy in each of the regions for the amount of land which is to be allocated to Traveller caravan sites and group housing schemes in the same way as the Minister has described on an earlier amendment that there will be a numerical target set for the regions for the amount of housing that they will contain. I should perhaps explain that the phrase "group housing" refers to schemes that have been developed in the Republic of Ireland and which have since been extended to Northern Ireland. They have proved very popular with Travellers because they allow extended families to remain together, as their culture demands, while at the same time putting down some roots. Although many travellers still aspire to a nomadic way of life, or at least to be able to go to festivals up and down the country and family occasions, some are happy to settle down as long as it does not mean their separation from the extended family. We have not tried group housing in Britain, but it is an idea that I have been pressing on Ministers for some years. It was among the recommendations made by Pat Niner.

<a name="40120-19_para21"></a>The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Evans, also said in the June debate:

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para23"></a>I suggest that in order to do that we need to look at the numbers who are at present homeless, and that means the number living on unauthorised sites who are by definition homeless according to the definition in the Housing Act 1996. It should be a simple matter of arithmetic to calculate how much land would be required to accommodate all the gypsies in a particular region just by taking the number on unauthorised sites and applying to them a density which we know is appropriate from the provision that has already been made.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para24"></a>The next question is how responsibility is to be divided among the local authorities in the region. That has always been the major difficulty because, even when the local authorities have a duty, every time that there was a proposal for a site there would be objections and councillors were reluctant to get into arguments with vociferous groups of their own constituents. It was always difficult to persuade residents within a particular locality where a traveller site was planned that a well designed and well managed site would be a much better alternative than an unauthorised site where there was no rubbish collection or proper sanitation, inhabited by people without a stake in the neighbourhood and that cause trouble.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para25"></a>In the planning system now being created by the Bill, as I understand it and as I think the Minister made clear earlier, the provision of housing in each local authority will be decided initially by the Secretary of State, no doubt after consultation, as the Minister has explained, with all the local authorities in the region. Since travellers normally live in caravans, I suggest that it would be a breach of the ODPM's obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act if, in carrying out the function of preparing instructions for counsel for the drafting of this legislation, the department had not paid due regard to the need to promote equality between travellers and the rest of the population in terms of housing accommodation. That means that whatever provision they make for housing should be accompanied by an equivalent traveller site.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para26"></a>I should say at this point that although gypsies were defined in non-ethnic terms under the Caravan Sites Act 1968 there are now recognised groups of travellers who are defined in ethnic terms; those are the Romanies and the Irish travellers. It is considered by many that Scottish travellers are also a separate group, although that has yet to be clarified by the Scottish courts or the Scottish Parliament. It also follows that the descendants of marriages between members of these groups and the settled population are entitled to the same consideration under the RRA. Since there has been a great deal of intermarriage over the generations, it is best to assume that people claiming the status of travellers possess it. That would be in compliance with the OSCE's principle that to belong to a national minority is a matter of personal individual choice.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para27"></a>Therefore, if there is to be a development plan document for housing, then either it must detail the provisions that are to be made for traveller accommodation so that travellers are not disadvantaged by the travelling system, or better still, as the second of these amendments suggests, there should be a separate <P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>DPD spelling out the provisions to be made for travellers in each planning authority. That, as I say, is the purpose of the second of these amendments.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para28"></a>The development plan document is defined in Clause 36(3)as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a document which . . .  is a local development document, and . . .  forms part of the development plan".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-19_para29"></a>The DPDs taken as a whole, plus the RSS&#151;or in the case of London the Mayor's spatial development strategy&#151;form the development plan as defined in Clause 37. I have to acknowledge that my scheme is incomplete because it does not require the SDS to contain a target for the amount of land to be allocated to traveller sites in London. That is because it may be appropriate for the Mayor to set that target rather than for Parliament to do it for him, though I have to say that I am uneasy about giving Mr Livingstone that discretion considering the lack of interest that he has displayed in traveller issues in the past.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para30"></a>The ideal would be for local authorities in each region to consult among themselves and decide what provision each of them will make in its DPD for traveller accommodation. If they do that, and if at the end of the process the contribution that they make collectively adds up to the target set in the RSS, then the shortage of traveller accommodation will be on the way to a solution. If there is any shortfall then my third amendment gives the Secretary of State the power to issue directions to any local authority requiring it to provide land for extra sites. Of course the Secretary of State already has a power of direction, but I am spelling it out in this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para31"></a>The power is modelled on a similar power that exists in the Caravan Sites Act, and that proved most effective when it was used sparingly in the last few years of the Act's existence. There, of course, the requirement was for the local authority to construct and to run the site. Here it is to allocate the land in a DPD and it would still be for private enterprise of an RSL or for the gypsies themselves to undertake the construction work and to operate the site.
<P>

<a name="40120-19_para32"></a>In view of the fact that the Minister has been very sympathetic, and that we know that Miss Yvette Cooper, the Minister responsible in the ODPM for gypsies, has herself been touring the sites and seeing for herself at first hand the effects of the lack of provision, I hope that the Government will seize this opportunity and either accept my amendments or come forward with alternatives themselves to solve this problem once and for all. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40120-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   In supporting these amendments, I am aware that the Government are carrying out a review of accommodation for Roma, gypsies and travellers, set out by my honourable friend Yvette Cooper in her letter of 15 January to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I appreciate this long overdue concern which does the Government credit. But whatever the conclusions of the review on means, this Bill gives an opportunity to create the necessary framework for further steps which should not be missed, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said.

<a name="40120-20_para0"></a>I know personally of Roma families who cannot get authorised sites&#151;I will not weary the Committee by detailing their insecurity. These people are our oldest indigenous minority and the prejudice and discrimination that they suffer is no less severe by being usually unacknowledged. It is seen in the higher mortality rates of their children, lack of educational attainment, even of attendance, poverty and ill health. I hope that my noble friend can help now.

<A NAME="40120-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I strongly support the words of my noble friend Lord Avebury except possibly for his views on the Mayor of London&#151;who may not always be the Mayor of London and who, as my noble friend sitting next to me has pointed out, may even be the outgoing Mayor.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para1"></a>I was in local government when the first major changes regarding travellers were made. I think that we forecast what would happen. My noble friend Lord Avebury has very graphically explained it, and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has backed that up. I am fortunate that I live in the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed where the local authority has an absolutely excellent traveller site. Anyone who goes on the railway line can see it from the line&#151;it is absolutely spotless. It is right in the middle of the town and we have no problems. I was also a councillor in Southampton where we also had a very successful site. Where the sites exist, it works. It is in the interests of the travellers. The children go to school and are enabled to live life as they wish to do. Given everything we have heard from the Government, I hope that they will take this opportunity to do something about it, even if it is not exactly what we are asking today.

<A NAME="40120-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I want to be as helpful as I can but I shall probably not be as helpful as noble Lords would wish at this stage of the Bill. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for bringing forward the amendments which provide us with the opportunity to put some of the issues on the record regarding the accommodation needs of gypsies and travellers and how they might be addressed in the new planning arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para2"></a>There is no question that this is an important point; namely, how the needs of gypsies and travellers, both those wishing to settle on sites and those who still travel for a living, might be met under the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para3"></a>As the noble Lord knows, we are currently undertaking a review of our gypsy and traveller policies. The review includes consideration of how site provision will be secured under the new planning arrangements and we are taking close account of the ideas proposed by the Institute for Public Policy Research in its document Moving Forward which I understand will be published shortly. I certainly do not wish to prejudge the outcome of our review, but it might be helpful if I sketch out one of the ways in which gypsy and traveller needs might be identified and incorporated into the new planning regime.
<P>


<a name="column_977"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para4"></a>The leading option we are considering is to assess the site and pitch needs of gypsies and travellers under a process similar to that used for housing need assessments&#151;possibly as part of that very same process. Under such an arrangement gypsy and traveller site needs could be identified and incorporated into the regional housing strategy which, under our current proposals, is then reflected in the regional spatial strategy in terms of numbers of sites by local planning authority. The identification of where the sites should be in each authority's area would then be the responsibility of the local planning authorities in preparing their local development documents.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para5"></a>Clearly, once site and pitch requirements are identified in the regional spatial strategy they may be subject to public examination and the Secretary of State must agree the finalised strategy. It will, of course, be a requirement that local development documents are in general conformity with the regional spatial strategy. I should stress that our ideas of exactly how we will ensure the needs of gypsies and travellers will be met are at an early stage. But we are satisfied that we shall be able to integrate their legitimate requirements into the new planning arrangements without amending the Bill in this respect. I say that in Committee but certainly we have ongoing work in this respect.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para6"></a>The ODPM review of gypsy and traveller policy is reviewing all aspects of ODPM policy responsibility, including planning, site provision and managing unauthorised encampments. It is not the case that Ministers have ruled out an expansion in provision. I do not know where that rumour has come from. However, it would be quite wrong of me to comment on any particular planning case. I understand these situations. As I say, for a year I was the planning Minister at the ODPM and dealt with several cases. I have part of some correspondence between the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and Yvette Cooper, the policy Minister in the department. She indicated in a draft of the reply, which I do not think the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has yet received:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We will be conducting some seminars on this issue in the very near future in Cambridge, Liverpool, London and Derby starting next week to run to probably nearly the end of February going over the issues of land use policy, planning consent for private sites, improving access to health, education and other services, public site provision and management and general issues including unauthorised camping".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-20_para7"></a>We are in close contact with the organisations representing gypsies and travellers. Indeed, we shall let the noble Lord know the precise dates and locations of the seminars. If he wishes to take part in any of them, he will be more than welcome. I say that in a genuine spirit of helpfulness. I am not trying to avoid responding to the issues that have been raised. Some thorny issues will have to be tackled once we have conducted the policy review. I refer to the expenditure proposals and the 2004 spending round. Nevertheless, we treat the issue with the utmost seriousness. It is an important issue so far as the department is concerned.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para8"></a>I cannot go much further regarding that point tonight; otherwise, I shall go down the road that I hate going down; namely, that of referring to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Treasury and finance. The central issue is to establish the policy and to ensure that we put in place a process within the new planning system whereby it is not possible to avoid providing the required number of sites. The need must be measured and assessed openly. The connection between the regional spatial strategy and local development documents does not allow a local authority to opt out and say, "We are not having such a measure. We have no need of it". As I say, we shall ensure that local development plans by and large conform to the regional spatial strategy. We can solve this problem for the foreseeable future, not just for a few years. This is a generational issue for our fellow citizens. We shall do our best to come up with something that is acceptable to all parties concerned, including, of course, as a priority, gypsies and travellers themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful answer and for inviting me to take part in the forthcoming seminars. I shall certainly take up that offer when the dates are announced, just as I shall take up the invitation from Yvette Cooper who has kindly invited me to discuss the matter personally with her. I very much value that opportunity.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para9"></a>As the noble Lord suggested, the Bill can take care of the accommodation needs of gypsies just as it takes care of the accommodation needs of the rest of the population. I agree with the noble Lord that one of the best ways of doing that is what he called the leading option; namely, to assess the needs of gypsies as part of ordinary housing needs and therefore to incorporate their requirements in the regional spatial strategy. As I understand it, the RSS will set an overall target for every region regarding the amount of accommodation that is necessary for people in the settled population. It will also add a separate element of accommodation for gypsies. That was one of the two alternatives that I mentioned.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para10"></a>Then, as the noble Lord says, local planning authorities will have to identify in the local development documents what contribution they will make to the attainment of those targets. As the noble Lord said, there is no opt-out there. As I understand it, local authorities in a region will collectively have to provide a total number of sites that equates with the figure set out in the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord did not mention the third leg of the policy. If the total number of gypsy sites within a region did not match the target set out in the RSS, a reserve power of direction exists in the legislation. I referred to that in a separate amendment. I suggested that the power should not be exercised in the first year after the coming into force of the Act so that local authorities have every chance to get together voluntarily to provide the relevant amount of accommodation. If they have not achieved that objective after 12 months, the powers of the Secretary of State will come into play.
<P>

<a name="40120-20_para12"></a>I am sure that we ought not to take the matter any further this evening in view of the helpful reply that the Minister has given. Therefore, I shall withdraw the amendment and hope that it will not even be necessary <P>

<A NAME="40120-21_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos)</B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 17 December 2003 be approved.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of the draft Primary Medical Services (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 is to make the legislative changes to allow the implementation in Northern Ireland of the new contract for the provision of general medical services by GPs. It amends the provisions of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 and replicates measures introduced in England and Wales by the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 and in Scotland by the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para3"></a>The new contract represents the most radical change to the way in which general practitioner services are delivered since the inception of the National Health Service. The contract was negotiated with the profession in response to UK-wide demands from GPs for new working arrangements that would enable them to control their workload and achieve a better work/life balance. The new contract has the overwhelming support of the profession and the changes it will introduce to GPs' working arrangements should ensure that qualifying doctors continue to be attracted to general practice for the future.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para4"></a>As well as being good for the profession, the contract will deliver real benefits to patients, other health care professionals and to primary care as a whole. The emphasis it places on team working and the opportunities it offers to provide a wider range of services at the primary care level will facilitate the future development of primary care for Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para5"></a>I shall comment briefly on the main provisions of the draft order. Article 3 inserts provision into the 1972 order to place a new statutory duty on health and social services boards to provide or secure the provision of primary medical services for persons in their area. The responsibility to provide such services currently rests with the general practitioners.
<P>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para6"></a>Article 4 inserts into the 1972 order broad regulation&#151;making powers which will be used to set out the detail of the terms and content of new contracts, including who may provide services and the rights and obligations under such contracts.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para7"></a>Article 5 introduces powers to make transitional arrangements in respect of persons who are providing services under the existing general medical services contract and for the resolution of disputes in relation to new contract. The measures are intended to ensure continuity of service in the period spanning the date of implementation.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para8"></a>Article 6 amends existing legislation to reflect the fact that the current changes have implications for those who are providing services under a personal medical services arrangement and Article 7 abolishes the statutory requirement to pilot such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para9"></a>Article 8 provides regulation-making powers to prescribe the way persons providing general medical services under the new contract are to be listed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council for her clear explanation of the order. In paper terms it is quite large. However, as the introduction tells us, it takes Section 4 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act and transfers it into law in Northern Ireland. My party had no dissent with Section 4 of the Act and hence I have no dissent in principle with the order.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para11"></a>I have some questions. I am a little concerned about costs. The Explanatory Memorandum tells us in paragraphs 19 and 20 that extra cost will be incurred. I am always somewhat suspicious when the Government admit that something they are doing will increase costs. My life experience tells me that significant change in most matters&#151;certainly in business life&#151;almost invariably incurs extra cost. I hope that those costs will prove to be a sound and profitable investment and the investment will be delivered in improved service. In principle, I support the order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council for introducing the order. Its aim is to replicate in Northern Ireland some of the PCT elements that pertain in England and Wales. The main provision is new GP contracts. That is a matter which the Liberal Democrats have supported.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para12"></a>However, there are concerns about the provision of out-of-hours services. Previously general practitioners were contracted to provide out-of-hours services that are now the duty of primary care trusts in England and Wales. PCTs there are having problems in providing services at night. That is a particular problem in rural areas, where there may be only one GP. Given that we are aware of the difficulty, can the Minister say what <P>


<a name="column_981"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 981</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>steps the Government are taking to ensure that the problem does not arise in Northern Ireland, where there are many rural practices?
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para13"></a>Furthermore, in England and Wales there is provision for lay members on PCTs. That is also true of the health and social services boards in Northern Ireland. But they cover large areas. Have the Government any plans to introduce a more local lay element, other than at the sub-regional level, of the health and social services boards?

<P>
<A NAME="40120-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   My Lords, my colleagues and I welcome the new medical practitioner contract, but while I feel that the legislation comes not a moment too soon, the Government must be scrupulous in ensuring that the interests of both the patients and the general practitioners are protected.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para14"></a>I understand the difficulty of out-of-hours working, but will the proposals under the new legislation provide a better service when GPs are under contract and do not provide an out-of-hours service but instead register with some agency or body that does? Will the position be similar to that of the nursing profession? Ultimately, agency nurses cost the health service more than it can by directly employing them. Consequently, hospitals should be encouraged to build up their own nursing banks, rather than go through agencies, because otherwise they have to employ the agency staff above their permanent staff. The issue must be carefully considered regarding GPs.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para15"></a>Apparently, recruitment to GP training schemes in Northern Ireland is declining and if GP services are improved in Great Britain, there would be&#151;I realise that I will sound selfish, but it is realistic&#151;a movement of many Northern Ireland doctors to the mainland. I can understand why our recruitment is declining. In the past many of our young graduates from Queen's University doing their junior house and senior training found it exceedingly difficult to find GP training posts in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para16"></a>We must arrest that decline in recruitment to GP schemes in Northern Ireland. We are still producing medical graduates. If we do not produce more of our own GPs who will remain in Northern Ireland, particularly, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, implied, in rural areas, we will have further difficulties in providing the service that the taxpayer has come both to expect and deserve.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para17"></a>The new legislation prescribes a practice-based contract, instead of a contract for individual GPs. Who will be responsible for seeing how that contract is implemented? Will a senior GP in a practice say what his staff should be paid or will the staff be employed directly by an outside service? Regarding finance, I welcome the guaranteed increase of 34 per cent over the next three years, but the Government must provide funding after that. Will sufficient funds be made available to maintain the changes after they have been put into place?

<a name="40120-21_para18"></a>It is unclear why we are emphasising heart diseases, strokes, asthma&#151;from which I suffer&#151;diabetes, epilepsy, mental health problems and other chronic diseases as indicators to encourage our GPs to organise their practices better and to be more responsive to patients' needs. When we start especially prescribing like that, there is a temptation to focus on just those conditions. It is an issue that has not been properly thought through. Therefore, I ask that other important issues, particularly children's health, are not overlooked.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para19"></a>Access targets have been mentioned for childhood immunisation for flu vaccines; routine monitoring of anti-coagulant therapy and rheumatology drugs; patients with depression; dealing with drug, alcohol or homelessness problems; and providing services for patients with a history of violence. These all are enhanced services, but who will be the doorkeeper? Will it be the GP who refers patients? How long will it take to get through to the enhanced services?
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para20"></a>There is an urgent need to reorganise the system and to do it as accurately as possible. I must remind the House that this is the first major shift in policy since 1948 and it might be well into the 21st century before we get a similar opportunity. We must get it right.
<P>

<a name="40120-21_para21"></a>The Government must ensure that this legislation, when implemented, is targeted at making effective changes that penetrate the top-heavy system as it now exists and provides a better deal for both patients and general practitioners.

<a name="40120-22_para1"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Rogan, expressed concern about out-of-hours services. Where GPs exercise their right to opt out, the responsibility for providing services will rest with the health and social services boards which, at the request of the department, are currently working with colleagues and other bodies on the details of the most appropriate alternative arrangements to put in place. I can assure noble Lords that contracts will be implemented in such a way as to ensure no loss of access to out-of-hours services.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, asked about lay members on the PCTs. The department introduced new structures in 2002 in the form of local health and social care groups whose membership comprises primary care professionals and community representation. I hope that that addresses the noble Lord's concern.

<P>

<a name="40120-22_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked a number of questions with respect to recruitment, training and retention of GPs. The new contract is specifically designed to make general practice more attractive to aspiring doctors. On the movement of GPs, the contract is UK-wide and will provide the same benefits to GPs in Northern Ireland. This will ensure that difficulties with respect to recruitment and retention, which are current in Great Britain, will be prevented in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para4"></a>On payments to practice staff, which was also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, they will be provided within practices. On agency nurses, agencies are private companies which negotiate their rates with the boards. GPs will contract with the boards on the basis of terms and conditions set out in the contract and laid down by regulation.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, also asked about priorities with respect to services. A number of additional services will be covered. The noble Lord was particularly concerned about children. This will include child health surveillance. The enhanced services will be commissioned by health and social services boards as a need is recognised.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para6"></a>I hope that that addresses all the points which have been raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, it was good to have her assurances about the health and social services boards making provision for night-time cover. Bearing in mind the rurality of Northern Ireland, can she give a hint of the kind of arrangements that the health and social services boards are looking at?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I do not have the detail of that because the health and social services boards are currently looking at the kind of arrangements which could be put in place locally to provide a comprehensive service outside normal practice hours. If the noble Lord will permit me, I will happily write to him once we have more information about the matter. It is clear that any arrangements put in place must include a proper set of standards which must be met by the providers of such service. I commend the order to the House.

<a name="40120-22_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the purpose of the draft Betting and Gaming (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 is to relax some of the existing statutory controls on betting and gaming in Northern Ireland. In doing so, the order will, for the most part, bring the <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland law in these areas more closely into line with the corresponding law currently applying in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para9"></a>The draft order will amend the 1985 order to ease restrictions on betting and gaming in the following areas: the regulation of football pools competitions; betting on race tracks, including a change to allow on-course Sunday betting and the provision of employment protection rights for track betting workers; the licensing and conduct of bookmaking offices; the registration of clubs under the 1985 order for gaming machine purposes; gaming machines, including the premises in which they may be used and the conditions applying; and the advertising of bingo. The order will also transfer responsibility for the grant of bookmaking office licensing from courts of summary jurisdiction to county courts.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para10"></a>During the recent consultations on the proposals for a draft order, interest focused mainly on the issue of a change in the law to allow on-course Sunday betting. The response to the consultation demonstrated clearly that there is strong support among race-goers and other racing interests in Northern Ireland for on-course Sunday betting. The consultation exercise, however, also recorded the concerns of those for whom Sunday is a special day. I have the utmost respect for their views, but of course this is a matter of personal choice. When the law is changed, people will be able to choose whether they wish to go to a racetrack and bet on a Sunday. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para11"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 12 January be approved.&#151;(Baroness Amos.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that explanation. For many generations, gambling has been an integral part of Irish life. On many occasions, it has led to considerable social hardship in many of the poorer areas of the 32 counties of Ireland, not merely the six counties. For many years when I served on the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, there was a considerable and strong Presbyterian movement against any form of active recreation or sport, which even included allowing the opening of public swimming pools and recreation centres anywhere in the Province. Only in recent years has that changed and mellowed, largely because of the excellent management of such centres.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para12"></a>I took some time to make inquiries about the consultation that took place and about the number of those who responded who were in favour and the number of those who were not. On reading the note that I received from the officials, I was satisfied that there was certainly a significant positive response. There was also a large negative response but, in my opinion and obviously in that of the Government, not sufficiently so to stop the order going through. However, we should not think that there are not a significant number of objectionists to gaming of this kind&#151;on Sundays, in particular.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para13"></a>I am encouraged by the order. I know that another Bill is to be introduced on betting and gambling in the United Kingdom. I believe that the more open the <P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>laws, the better they are managed and the better and more easily they can be policed, the less opportunity there is for significant illegal betting on all kinds of things&#151;that has always been part of Irish life&#151;and it is hoped that that will lead to a reduction in social hardship of one kind and another. I may be dreaming. I see a smile on the face of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. But drinking and betting, and all that goes with it, have always been a problem in Northern Ireland. I believe that when a government change the laws in this area, they need to be aware of the social problems relating to legal and illegal gaming, gambling and betting on Sundays. If the order is to help the policing and management of such activities, as I believe is the Government's intention, I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches echo the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I believe that the order brings Northern Ireland into the 21st century. We accept that some people believe that the Sabbath should be kept. However, I do not believe that the order affects the rights of such people because, as the Minister pointed out, this is a question of individual choice. Those who want to keep the Sabbath can keep the Sabbath and those who want to make merry can make merry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Laird: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the Minister's outline of the order. I rise today to make a few observations on it but, from the outset, I wish to add my support for the legislation as it seeks to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para14"></a>First, I welcome Schedule 1, which concerns the rights of betting workers as respects Sunday working. I am pleased to see that the new protection rights against dismissal purely on the grounds that a track betting worker does not wish to work on a Sunday will apply irrespective of age, length of service or hours of work. Your Lordships will be aware that a great number of people in Northern Ireland do not wish to find themselves compelled to work on a Sunday for whatever reason&#151;family, social or conscience&#151;and it is only right that their views are respected.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para15"></a>However, perhaps I may suggest that where, under the prescribed form "Statutory rights in relation to Sunday betting work", the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"your employer . . .  does something else detrimental to you",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-22_para16"></a>appear in paragraph 8(4) of Schedule 1, the word "detrimental" should be more clearly defined. The form gives the example of the employer failing to promote the employee, but other scenarios are apparent here. Does "detrimental" include failing to offer overtime or training opportunities, or does it go so far as to include a negative attitude, manifested in how the employee is spoken to and generally treated by the employer, which could seriously affect the employee's working life?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para17"></a>Moreover, if we are building into the legislation protection for those who disagree with Sunday working, should we not also be looking to protect <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those of other religions, such as the Muslim and Jewish faiths? Should we not protect the right of workers from other religious groups to observe religious holidays and respect their requests not to work on them?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para18"></a>I should also like the Minister to clarify the reasoning behind why the employee must give his employer three months' notice in order to opt out of Sunday working. That is absurd, given that most employers require only one month's notice to terminate a contract of employment. Why does the Minister expect it to take so long for a written notice to be adhered to?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para19"></a>I am slightly concerned about the potential impact of Article 4 relating to the relaxation of some restrictions on betting on horse and dog tracks and, in particular, allowing permanent structures on licensed tracks to be used for bookmaking purposes. With opportunities for betting on all kinds of sporting and other events substantially increased, it logically follows that a larger amount of money will change hands at the track. Therefore, is there not room for concern regarding security at these premises and the safety of bookmakers and their staff?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para20"></a>I also wish to raise some concerns about the reduction to one year of the notice and waiting periods for non-sporting clubs seeking registration under the 1985 order for gaming machine purposes. Can the Minister explain why that has been reduced and assure us that non-sporting clubs will undergo the same assessment procedure as before?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para21"></a>I also ask the Minister to explain why the Department for Social Development would look more favourably upon certain licensed bookmaking offices when deciding how many gaming machines they may have. Indeed, why is the department to be involved at all, given that, as it would appear from other sections of the order, the responsibility for granting permits for gaming machines at other venues, such as amusement parks, lies with the district council?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para22"></a>Article 10 outlines restrictions of access to gaming machines to people under the age of 18. I understand the intention of these provisions but wonder just how reasonable it is to expect all premises to ensure that £25-prize gaming machines are located in a separate area and protected by an effective physical barrier. Your Lordships will be aware that young people have a habit of duping bouncers into thinking that they are older, and they are often quite adept at knowing which establishments are more likely to let them in. Are we expecting someone&#151;say, from the district council&#151;to carry out routine assessments of such premises and instigate action against those who are not complying? Otherwise, how does the Minister expect these well intentioned provisions to be enforced?
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para23"></a>Finally, I hope that the Minister will say a few words to explain the staggered commencement date of the order. By not allowing the legislation to commence immediately, the Government are suggesting that they are somehow concerned about its implications and about how well it will be received.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-22_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken for the support they gave the order. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was concerned about possible social hardship. As the package of measures is so modest, we do not consider that it will increase the social dangers of gambling for vulnerable people, but I take the noble Lord's point and I welcome his comments on the importance of transparency in the policing and management of the issue.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked a number of questions. On detriment he was particularly concerned about employment protection. All track betting workers employed by bookmakers and Tote operators based in Northern Ireland, except those contracted to work only on Sunday, will have the right not to be dismissed, not to be selected for redundancy, nor subjected to any other detriment such as exclusion from a general pay rise or bonus and discrimination in promotion and training opportunities for refusing to work on Sundays.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para25"></a>Should an employee consider that he or she has suffered detriment, their employment rights may be enforced by way of a complaint to an industrial tribunal. The noble Lord, Lord Laird, will be aware that detriment is well defined in employment law and through case law.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para26"></a>On whether we should be looking to protect those of other religious faiths, the employment protection provisions are included in the order because it introduces on-course betting on Sundays.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para27"></a>On the issue of three months' notice, employers will be required to give every track betting worker who enters into a contractual agreement that includes Sunday working a written explanatory statement setting out their right to opt out. If an employer does not issue such a statement within two months of the worker entering such a contractual agreement, the three months' opting out notice period is reduced to one month. I hope that that response addresses the noble Lord's concern.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para28"></a>I turn to the issue of permanent structures on licensed track. The security of these premises and the safety of bookmakers and their staff are primary commercial issues for the trade interests involved and, if appropriate, the police.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para29"></a>The order will reduce notice and waiting periods for registration of clubs to one year to achieve parity with the notice and waiting periods for clubs applying for registration under the Registration of Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. The assessment procedure is otherwise unchanged.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para30"></a>On the question of the involvement of district councils, bookmaking offices are adult-only environments considered suitable for the use of higher-prize gaming machines. When they are licensed by the courts for bookmaking purposes, they will be automatically entitled to a maximum of two gaming machines. The department has no operational role in the process. It is also considered unnecessary to involve district councils.
<P>


<a name="column_988"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para31"></a>Age was a major concern for the noble Lord, Lord Laird. If the conditions applying to a permit are not complied with to its satisfaction, the relevant district council may refuse to renew the permit. In addition, Article 120 of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 provides that where any condition to which an amusement permit is subject is contravened, the permit holder will be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine of the statutory maximum, or six months' imprisonment, or both. On indictment, a fine, or imprisonment for two years, or both, apply. A court also has the power to cancel an amusement permit if the permit holder is convicted of an offence under Article 120.
<P>

<a name="40120-22_para32"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, raised the issue of commencement dates. The Government do not have any implications about how well the order will be received. The staggered commencement dates are required mainly for administrative reasons. Those provisions coming into operation after three months are those for which trade, legal and other interests require notice to make the necessary arrangements. Those provisions that come into operation by commencement order will require subordinate legislation by both the Department for Social Development and the Northern Ireland Court Service. I hope that that response addresses the points made.

<P>

<a name="40120-23_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order specifies a new initiative to provide facilities and activities intended to reduce the social exclusion of young people, to be funded by the National Lottery through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF).
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para1"></a>I shall explain the process which brings us to this point. We made a commitment last July in the National Lottery funding decision document to establish a new lottery young people's fund. At present, as is well known, the New Opportunities Fund can distribute lottery money only on projects which are designed to give effect to initiatives specified in an order by the Secretary of State under Section 43(b) of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. Those are at present health, education and the environment. We are adding "young people" to that.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para2"></a>Before I go further I should say that in my view the provisions of the draft order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para3"></a>NOF funding has produced more than £2 billion to a range of initiatives within the categories of health, education and the environment, which are making a real difference to the lives of individuals and communities <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>throughout the United Kingdom. Our proposals as set out in the decision document are designed to build on that success.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para4"></a>The decision document announced our intention to set up a young people's fund, funded initially with £200 million from NOF's balances. Our aim is that the young people's fund might develop into a cross-distributor programme adding value by drawing together the various strands of activity relating to young people.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para5"></a>The focus of the young people's fund will be on projects promoting youth inclusion&#151;in other words, against social exclusion&#151;specifically by providing facilities and activities both after school and in holiday periods. In England it will be very much in line with the aims and principles of the Green Paper, Every Child Matters, which we published last September. It will cover being healthy; staying safe; enjoying and achieving, including developing the skills for adulthood; making a positive contribution to the community; and overcoming socio-economic disadvantages to achieve full potential in life. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there will be a similar focus but it will be as determined by those nations to suit their own needs.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para6"></a>We are carrying out consultation with groups of local children and young people and we shall complete that before we make decisions. Involving people in this way means that we shall be funding provision that young people feel ownership of and will want to use. We have carried out consultation which reveals, as I think is well known, that young people are particularly concerned about the phrase "having things to do". That comes out in many aspects of social research. They would like more places to go where they can not only spend time in a safe environment but have access to more structured activities.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para7"></a>The young people's fund will be spread across the country but in order to help those most in need it will be targeted at those who are at greatest risk of social exclusion. It will build on the experience of previous initiatives including Splash, the lottery-funded Splash Extra and the Positive Activities for Young People initiatives.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para8"></a>We have carried out an evaluation of the Positive Activities for Young People. That suggests that those involved in the scheme both as professionals and as young people perceive the programme as working, with evidence of increased school attendance; reduced noise and youth crime; improved behaviour; and improved community cohesion.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para9"></a>Through the young people's fund we shall be able to offer young people an opportunity to take part in activities which they not only enjoy but which can help them to make a real difference to their lives and the communities in which they live.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para10"></a>The responses to public consultation on the decision document have shown clear support for the development of a young people's fund. They build on the work which NOF has already done to help thousands of communities to improve their health, education and local environment. This fund will address the particular <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I begin by thanking the Minister for his clear explanation of the provisions specified in the draft order.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para12"></a>As the Minister stated, the order establishes a new funding initiative, administered through the New Opportunities Fund by money raised as a result of National Lottery ticket sales. This new initiative, which will grant funding for facilities and activities, is intended to reduce the social exclusion of young people thus implementing the Government's proposal to establish a new lottery fund for young people. The initial funding for this initiative has been set at £200 million and the proposals are said to be closely aligned with the objectives detailed in the September 2003 Green Paper, Every Child Matters.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para13"></a>I read with interest Hansard from yesterday's debate in the 4th Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on the provisions of this draft order and I have a number of concerns, which I would be grateful if the Minister could address.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para14"></a>To begin with, I am concerned that the term social exclusion is rather vague and non-committal. Whilst I understand that the precise scope of the fund is still under consideration, would the Minister agree that it is imperative that the ambit of such an initiative should be closely targeted and monitored to ensure that it is working effectively? Her Majesty's Opposition have often expressed unease at the method by which the Government have altered the mechanism of lottery funding since they came to power in 1997. This criticism relates to the way National Lottery funding has been used to further Government spending objectives. The Government appear to have become increasingly willing to intervene in the way that National Lottery money is spent.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para15"></a>We welcome the assurance from the Minister in another place and the Minister's this evening that this new funding initiative will not be attributed to Government spending. However, we are keen to ensure that public confidence is restored, with lottery money being used to fund genuinely good causes, in particular helping young people and their communities. I should like to echo the concerns raised by the honourable Member for Surrey Heath yesterday in Committee in another place. The New Opportunities Fund must ensure that the money reaches the projects where it is needed and that any unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para16"></a>My Lords, make no mistake, I wish to support the purpose of this order. Indeed, as a mother with three teenagers, that phrase "having things to do" rings regularly in my mind. I remember being the same when I was a young person constantly complaining there was not anything to do. However, much depends on its effective implementation. We welcome the Government's commitment to promoting social <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inclusion for young people yet we believe that lottery funding should not be used to further Government spending targets or meet policy goals. The phrase "social inclusion" requires further thought and consultation and we welcome the Government's move to address this concern. It is for these reasons that we do not oppose this order and we hope that its objectives can be successfully achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-23_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches also thank the Minister for explaining the order. I have to confess we have little enthusiasm for it. It continues the practice we deplore&#151;the use of lottery money as a substitute for Exchequer spending. We have had discussions on this in the past. The New Opportunities Fund will now be permitted this additional project&#151;a young people's fund&#151;to add to the three which it already has: health, environment and education. The Minister has amplified some issues in the explanation. They all sound very worthy but are rather loosely presented. We would not disagree with any of them but we would not be so opposed to the setting-up of a young people's fund through lottery money if there were a clear good cause with long-term aims.
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para17"></a>In this order the vagueness of these proposals has been amplified by the Minister's amplifications. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has expressed some sympathy with them. I suppose if I thought a little longer I might well have the same sympathy. However, the irritation that the Government are meddling again in lottery funds makes that difficult for me to do. Perhaps tomorrow I may think more kindly of it. The Government are trying to do what is best left to the distributors. Persistent meddling of this kind with lottery funds goes directly counter to their own policy as stated in the July White Paper on the lottery. We would not have disagreed at all with the policy of additionality stated in it. All this takes place against a background of falling lottery sales that will ultimately dilute all of the good causes. Most of us have views on why sales are declining. I dare say the noble Baroness has similar views to mine. But when are the Government going to come out and tell us what their views are about this decline and what do they think can be done to address it?
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para18"></a>I take this opportunity to register a concern of noble Lords on these Benches. It is a concern, which has been echoed by the Government, about the £3 billion undistributed lottery moneys. They say that something will be done but nothing happens. What is going on? Is this some kind of float being used by the Government for future eventualities?
<P>

<a name="40120-23_para19"></a>To end, perhaps I may draw attention to the fact&#151;because I think it is relevant&#151;that since the lottery was introduced the DCMS budget has fallen by roughly one third. When registered as a percentage of GDP, in the year 1993&#150;94 it was 0.16 per cent and in the year 2003&#150;04 it has sunk to 0.11 per cent. In comparison with other countries the allocation for culture is absolutely pitiful. When represented as a percentage of state expenditure, the United Kingdom commits 0.29 per cent against 2.4 per cent, which is committed by both France and Germany.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to support the order. I declare an interest as the chair of the New Opportunities Fund. It seems to us entirely appropriate that the programmes that the New Opportunities Fund funds continue to fit strategically with government priorities, while at the same time aiming to meet the needs and wants of young people at a local level, particularly those in disadvantaged areas.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para0"></a>I have no doubt in assuring the House that the fund is a genuine good cause and that it will be spent in the interests of young people. In view of what has been said, perhaps I should also assure the House that the issue of balances is taken very seriously by the lottery distributors, as is the issue of additionality. The distributors feel just as strongly about that as do other noble Lords who have spoken.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para1"></a>In preparation for the young peoples fund, the New Opportunities Fund has undertaken a mapping exercise of organisations and programmes working with young people, which resulted in a database of relevant projects. In addition, members of the fund have held informal meetings with key players in the youth sectors. There are a number of themes which we want to pursue through this fund, including helping children stay safe, supporting activities and facilities for young people, and enabling young people to contribute to their communities through grants to individuals or groups of young people.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para2"></a>Once we receive the policy directions we will consult with key stakeholders in government departments and in the voluntary and community sector, outlining the prospectus or framework for the programme. We will also consult with young people. We aim to ensure that some elements of the fund are launched and open for activities by this summer and expect the remainder of the strands to be launched by the autumn.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para3"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may also point out that as young people have been involved in consultation about the programme they will also be involved in the evaluation of it, so that we can use this fund really to address the needs of this most important group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful for the responses of my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and less grateful for the response of the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is of course entirely right that it is important that what we do with this new initiative should be closely targeted and monitored&#151;I think those were her words. I hope that she has been given some reassurance by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para4"></a>I would also add that the proposed work builds on the Positive Activities for Young People programme, which I described and which has been closely targeted <P>


<a name="column_993"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 993</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and monitored and indeed can be well-defined as an appropriate good cause. The noble Baroness expressed some concerns about the way in which the objectives have been altered. The New Opportunities Fund has survived without its objectives being altered since the beginning. We were finding that the conditions on the New Opportunities Fund were a little tight. Confining them to concentrating on health, education and the environment meant that some things that were targeted on people rather than on themes did not fit into any of the categories. That will be possible now, with this additional initiative.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para5"></a>The issue of additionality was raised particularly strongly when the legislation to set up the New Opportunities Fund was introduced. We argued that through in some detail in this House at the time&#151;I remember it well. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is not right in thinking that it is necessary for public confidence to be restored. There has been continued public confidence. I certainly have not seen or heard the kind of generalised criticism that was anticipated when the New Opportunities Fund was set up.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para6"></a>Similarly, it would not be right to follow the advice of the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, and leave the matter to the distributors. We the people ought to have a say in this. We have been successful; the distributors have been successful in maintaining what they want, which is an arm's-length approach from government and the assurance that we are not spending the money on things that the Government would otherwise do. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that it is important to avoid bureaucracy. I am glad that she welcomed the social inclusion element of this new initiative.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para7"></a>I hope that the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, has helped to convince the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, that we have a clear and specific good cause here, not least because we have piloted it in the positive action for young people. Of course we are concerned with the decline in lottery sales. We rely on Camelot to redress that with continued new marketing initiatives and new products. It has approached this imaginatively.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para8"></a>The noble Viscount referred to "undistributed lottery money". It is only undistributed in the sense that it has not been taken up by those to whom it has already been committed. All lottery money, except for a margin, is committed. However, it is the nature of the beast that many of the projects to which it is committed take months or even years to complete. The money is not actually distributed until it is needed. In any case, any balances are held, and both the money and any interest on the money are devoted to good causes.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para9"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, talked about the DCMS budget falling as a percentage of GDP. The DCMS budget has not fallen in real terms. The economic policies of this Government have been so successful that GDP has been rising faster. Of course, we would all like more money for DCMS subjects. I will treasure his words and make sure that they are used in our submission for the 2004 spending review.

<a name="40120-24_para14"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) The RSS will set the spatial framework for the strategies of the regional development agency in its region."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-24_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would ensure that regional spatial strategies set the spatial frameworks for the economic strategies of the regional development agencies. The Bill is silent on how all the various regional strategies will relate to each other. Not only would this be a recipe for confusion, it could result in the strategies working against each other.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para16"></a>We do not support these moves towards regional spatial strategies away from county structure plans, but we recognise that it is important that the different regional strategies are integrated and co-ordinated and that provision is made for this in the Bill. If it is left to guidance, the mechanism by which we can deliver joined-up policies at the regional level will remain unclear and will not be subject to a proper debate in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para17"></a>The drawing up of planning responsibilities from counties to regional planning bodies in the Bill reinforces the importance of having one overarching spatial framework at the regional level. The negative consequences of this fragmentation can at least be partly offset by a clear hierarchy, in which a regional development agency's objective of maximising economic performances does not unnecessarily conflict with a regional planning body's statutory duty to provide sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para18"></a>It is not a question of the RPBs controlling the RDAs; it is simply a question of recognising the potential for conflict between the two and ensuring that regional planning becomes a genuinely spatial framework. If the regional spatial strategy does not set the spatial framework for the strategies of the regional development agency in its region, it will be neither regional nor strategic. If the Minister does not support the amendment, can he explain exactly how the Government will prevent the achievement of important cost-cutting objectives such as reducing the need to travel being undermined by conflicting strategies that have equal status?
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para19"></a>There is one final issue to which I draw attention in support of the amendment&#151;that of democratic accountability, which we have raised several times today. The Bill does not offer much comfort to those who believe in local democracy and it is deficient in the <P>


<a name="column_995"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 995</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions it makes for community participation, as we mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, regional planning bodies will probably offer more scope for democratic input than regional development agencies. As such, it is better if the regional spatial strategy is in some sense a pre-eminent strategy for the region, as this will go some way towards helping to strengthen the democratic dimension at the regional level of decision-making. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 which are grouped with Amendment No. 9. Their purpose is similar to that outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in Amendment No. 9. We seek to ensure that regional spatial strategies set a spatial framework for all other regional strategies, particularly&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred to this point&#151;the regional economic strategy. We believe that it also needs to be consistent with the regional sustainable development framework. We believe that, if regional spatial strategies replace all the regional planning guidance, we should ensure that we have an overarching regional spatial strategy that cuts across all other regional guidance.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para20"></a>One reason for exploring that at this stage is that there is a danger that the opportunity will be missed to get this part of the Bill right. I gather that in Committee in another place the Government indicated that the guidance will set out a two-way relationship between the regional planning body and the regional development agency. I shall quote from Tony McNulty, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in another place. When discussing this matter in Committee he indicated that the regional spatial strategy and the regional economic strategy should "reflect each other", which to us sounds a little ambiguous. The draft New Planning Policy Statement 11&#151;Regional Planning published for consultation in October 2003 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is essential that the regional spatial strategy both shapes and is shaped by other regional strategies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-24_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40120-24_para22"></a>Again, that could lead to some ambiguity and muddle. Experience has shown that despite the requirement for regional development agencies to further sustainable development in their operations, some in practice have actively tried to undermine the sustainable land use and transport objectives. There are several examples of that. I shall refer to a couple of them: first, a regional development agency in the north-east&#151;where I live&#151;was very resistant to higher brownfield housing targets in regional planning guidance, which other people thought would make better use of existing urban potential. Secondly, there was a problem in Birmingham&#151;which the Minister may know about&#151;where an enthusiastic regional development agency supported a western orbital road in the face of widespread criticism, which included an independent panel that had examined the draft of the regional planning guidance.
<P>

<a name="40120-24_para23"></a>If the Bill goes forward as set out, we need to try to sort out this point. It is important that the regional spatial strategy is a truly spatial framework. By <P>


<a name="column_996"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 996</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>definition it should integrate all the regional level planning strategies; and it should set the framework from within which other strategies operate, using their own expertise and resources to implement the spatial planning framework. I hope the Minister will recognise that from the discussion so far it is far from clear that we have the matter right in the Bill. I look forward to his comments.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I ask the Minister to say something about transport in the development of regional spatial strategies, particularly with regard to the plans developed by the delivery arms of transport, particularly the Strategic Rail Authority and the Highways Agency. Clearly, there is little point in regional strategies being drawn up that are simply wish lists of schemes that may well never take place. On the other hand, at the moment it is also clear that the kind of criteria that the Strategic Rail Authority or the Highways Agency use to develop their future schemes are rather different from those of the people drawing up the plans. I am quite keen to hear about how we can ensure that there is not some sort of mismatch between all those plan-making bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   This is an important amendment, because it relates to time-scale. Economic and other developments, such as transport, come and go and are crucially important for those who are around today. However, we must consider how the country will be in the time of our children and grandchildren. If we do not get the long-term pattern right, we could do irreversible damage.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para0"></a>I shall give what is perhaps a silly example, but one that helps to make the point. In a sense, setting up national parks was producing for those areas a regional spatial strategy&#151;I do not myself like that particular bit of jargon, but no one has thought of anything better. That means that there are many other possible uses for national parks, which are not taken into account. I hope that no one would think of putting a new town in a national park, because that is not what national parks are about.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para1"></a>The issue is the time-scale. If we get the spatial strategy right, we can have the economic and development policies that are appropriate to the time but do not pre-empt the long-term objective of keeping the country in the form in which we would wish to hand it on to our descendants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is right in saying that this is an important short debate. I am impressed and interested that all Members of the Committee who have spoken are concerned to ensure that the regional spatial strategy should fit, work, interact and interrelate with other strategies in the region. Their amendments give voice to that concern.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para2"></a>Amendment No. 9 would include a requirement that the regional spatial strategy should set the spatial framework for the economic strategy of the regional development agencies in each region. Amendment No. 11 would extend the requirement for the RSS to <P>


<a name="column_997"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 997</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>set the spatial framework to all regional level strategies in the region. As the regional economic strategy is simply one of a number of regional strategies, albeit a particularly important one, and for the reasons that have emerged in the few minutes in which the group has been discussed, it is important to take the amendments together.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para3"></a>Taken at face value, we would all want to support the principle expressed in the amendments, although not the inclusion of such statements of detail in the Bill. It is absolutely right that the regional spatial strategy should set the spatial framework of other regional strategies in the region, although that must happen as part of a two-way process. That was what the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, was suggesting. The regional spatial strategy needs to be shaped by other regional strategies as well as shaping them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   I wonder if I could clarify something. It was not me who suggested that; it was suggested by the Minister in another place. I am querying how practical it is, whether it is not a little ambiguous, and how we can ensure that it does what we want.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I take the point that the noble Baroness makes; I gathered that that was what she was after.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para4"></a>I suspect, however, that the intention of the amendments is to make the regional spatial strategy pre-eminent among regional strategies. I believe that that was what the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, was after, and it is certainly what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield was after. The Government do not believe that a hierarchical relationship with the RSS at the top would necessarily be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para5"></a>We would argue that each serves a different role and different function. What is essential is that those bodies responsible for drawing up the regional spatial strategy, whether economic or housing, work together to develop a shared understanding of the issues, objectives and opportunities. We emphasise that in draft Planning Policy Statement 11 on regional planning (PPS11). Even if securing pre-eminence for the regional spatial strategy among regional strategies is not the intention&#151;it is clear that it is&#151;the very fact that it could be construed as such means, we believe, that the amendments are flawed. Amendment No. 12 would amend Clause 1 to require the RSS to have regard to and be consistent with the regional sustainable development framework for the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para6"></a>The problem is simple. We cannot set this out in legislation as the regional sustainable development framework has no statutory basis itself. It is flawed in that simple way. Broadly speaking, we are supportive of the principle that the RSS and the RSDF&#151;although I hate the jargon it is necessary&#151;should be complementary and work together and, more than that, mutually support one another. PPS11 makes clear that the RSDF is an essential part of the background against which regional strategies are prepared.
<P>


<a name="column_998"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 998</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para7"></a>We cannot support the hierarchical notion. We recognise the importance and centrality of the regional spatial strategy. But it is important that these things work together. While we understand and support the principle of that, we do not think that the amendment is necessarily the right way to achieve it. We believe that we have the provision already in PPS11.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para8"></a>This short discussion is valuable. I understand the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, about the importance of democratic input. Given the fullness of time and the development of elected regional assemblies, we shall have that elected, democratic, over-arching body which we all support&#151;although not the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I am sorry to question the Utopian vision with which the Minister presents us, with every strategy being supportive of and consistent with each other. I wish I were quite so optimistic. I take the noble Lord's point that if there were elected regional government it would be easier to co-ordinate.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para9"></a>Can the Minister explain to the Committee the basis of the other strategies referred to? Do the Government's guidance or papers have the same weight as regards the new planning policy statement for the regional spatial strategy? I realise that it is difficult to pursue the point without understanding the genesis of those other strategies. Are they created in the same way? Do they go through the same consultation procedures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is unfortunate that the noble Baroness's question is not clearer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The PPS11 to which the Minister referred states that the RSS should be consistent with and supportive of other regional frameworks and strategies including the RSDF and the regional, cultural, economic and housing strategies. How do those come about? Do they go through similar processes to the regional spatial strategy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that I can answer the noble Baroness. The regional spatial strategy takes forward the regional housing strategy. The regional transport strategy is part and parcel of the regional spatial strategy. If there is an inconsistency between draft revisions to a regional spatial strategy and a regional economic strategy, when they are examined and made public documents there would be an opportunity as part of a consultation process to ensure that any inconsistencies at that point are ironed out. The documents are published; they are there for consultation. In a sense, the other regional strategies get pulled into the spatial strategy and that is the overriding driver for it.

<A NAME="40120-25_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   Is the Minister confident that if a group of people or a society has a real problem with a decision that comes about and chooses to seek a judicial review, the processes that he has outlined, with all their fuzziness, would stand up to a judicial review challenge which would seek to <P>


<a name="column_999"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 999</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demonstrate that a decision had not been made with due processes? It is very hard to pick out what those due processes might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that the process would be robust, because it would be informed and the strategies would be the product of a form of consultation which would enable people, organisations, local authorities, agencies and others to offer their views as part of the process. They would play a part in the creation of those strategies in the document. The answer has to be, "Yes, we think that the processes are robust in themselves".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   As the mover of the original amendment on this, I do not think that the Minister's replies have been that helpful. We feel&#151;not just those of us in the Committee but also professionals and people who have been involved in creating all these strategies&#151;that there could be a lot of confusion and that a definite system should be laid out so that everyone knows where they are. RDAs have considerable amounts of money which the planning side might not necessarily have. There could be undue influence because of the amount of money that RDAs have. There could be more influence from the RDAs over the regional spatial strategies than there should be. We are going to have to come back to this issue.
<P>

<a name="40120-25_para10"></a>We have noted what the Minister said, but&#151;going back to an earlier subject of laughter&#151;in some of these matters we are trying to help. If something is going to happen, it must work. I moved this amendment on the advice of professional people. Therefore, we should look at it again. I hope that the Minister will reflect on it.

I have outlined how we see the system working reasonably fairly and accurately, but we shall have a very close look at what has been said and endeavour to reflect on the important points that have been made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I thank the Minister for that comment. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 13:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 14, leave out subsections (5) and (6).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-26_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 13 aims to remove the power of the Secretary of State to make existing regional planning guidance, or parts of it, part of the regional spatial strategy, and so part of the development plan, without going through the procedures outlined in Part 1 of the Bill. The removal of subsection (6) is consequential.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para3"></a>This is a complicated amendment, but we feel it is very important. To elaborate further, Clause 1(5) strikes me as a strange and unwelcome piece of <P>


<a name="column_1000"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drafting. While the rest of Part 1 of the Bill establishes regional spatial strategies&#151;what they are, how they will be revised and so on&#151;subsection (5) undermines all of that by empowering the Secretary of State to decide which bits of regional planning guidance he wants to be in the regional spatial strategy for a region. Can the Minister explain why the Bill establishes the procedures for regional planning bodies to follow in order to produce regional spatial strategies&#151;only for it to render those redundant by giving the Secretary of State the power to dictate what will constitute a regional spatial strategy&#151;without going through any of the processes thought necessary for the construction of the spatial strategy as set out in Part 1?
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para4"></a>I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 47 and 48. The Bill contains the procedure for the preparation of revisions of the regional spatial strategy. Clauses 5 to 11 assume that there is a regional spatial strategy and that the responsibility of a regional planning body is to prepare a draft revision.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para5"></a>There are two reasons why a procedure for adopting a regional spatial strategy is necessary; one is practical, the other is principled. The practical reason is that the Bill does not put in place a regional spatial strategy by some other means. Under Clause 1(1) there is to be a regional spatial strategy. But there is merely a power to make regional planning guidance the regional spatial strategy for a region in Clause 1(5). Even if that power remains, it will not be necessary to exercise it. Furthermore, the existing regional planning guidance might be inappropriate as a regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para6"></a>I hope that I have made myself clear on all that, but it is very complicated. I just about understand it myself. I do not know whether I have been able to explain it to everyone else.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para7"></a>A regional spatial strategy is, after all, different; the Government intended it to be part of a development plan; they intend more weight to be attached to it; and they intend local development plan documents to be in general conformity with it. Draft Planning Policy Statement 11, on regional planning, says that these documents are intended to be more specific. So there needs to be a procedure to create a regional spatial strategy from scratch. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Our Amendment No. 23 is in this group&#151;which at least takes us on to page 2 of the Bill. Clause 3(1) provides that the regional planning body must keep the regional spatial strategy under review. We suggest that rather than it being required to do so,
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-26_para8"></a>That is perhaps a little tongue in cheek. The philosophical and political point is the autonomy and discretion of the regional planning body. The tongue in cheek bit is that they might think that the regional spatial strategy which they have inherited from the Secretary of State is so perfect that they do not need to revise it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   Amendment No. 24, in my name, is also in this group. As it raises an issue that has already been much discussed today, I shall be brief.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para9"></a>The idea is that the new regional planning bodies will have no influence on the initial RSS but only on its subsequent revision. The initial RSS is defined in Clause 1(5) as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so much of the regional planning guidance relating to the region as the Secretary of State prescribes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-26_para10"></a>The initial RSS is thus 100 per cent top down. While accepting that that deals with the problem of a possible vacuum in the transitional period, I think that the new regional planning bodies should have some input on the initial RSS and that the Bill should reflect that, if only the right to comment and to seek early review.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para11"></a>As I said, this matter has already been much discussed. I do not expect the Minister to change the views that have already been expressed on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made it clear that the amendments are really about making regional planning bodies start from scratch&#151;I think that that is what he is after&#151;in preparing a regional spatial strategy under the new arrangements, rather than allowing them to build on existing regional planning guidance.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para12"></a>Amendment No. 13 would delete from Clause 1 those subsections that provide for the Secretary of State to convert such guidance as he prescribes into regional spatial strategies. We do not see why the noble Lord would want to delete what seems to us such a commonsense provision. It is our intention that all current regional planning guidance, perhaps with a few exceptions, will be converted into an RSS in regulations. Those exceptions&#151;which are worth recording&#151;will be RPGs 3 (London), 3a (Strategic Views in London), 3b and 9b (River Thames) and 9a (Thames Gateway).
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para13"></a>These documents will be replaced in large part by the Mayor's London Plan and were not subject to public examination when they were prepared. In other words, each region will have a regional plan from the outset. We accept that those regional plans will not be perfect&#151;we expect them to be revised over the next few years and turned into more genuinely spatial strategies&#151;but nor should they be tossed aside. They express important regional policies that have been built up over the years and reflect the input of people across the region.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para14"></a>The consequence of not converting RPG in each region to RSS would be serious. It would leave a gap, certainly in the transition period and perhaps beyond that, prior to the preparation of a new RSS&#151;a process that would take at least two years&#151;in which there was no strategic regional level development plan document. We do not believe that it is sensible or practical in terms of regional planning for there to be no strategic regional level development plan document. This would make the preparation of new local plans almost impossible. It would create uncertainty for communities, developers and business. We do not believe that is desirable particularly in terms of economic regeneration.

<P>

<a name="40120-26_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred to Amendments Nos. 47 and 48. Amendment No. 47 would insert a new clause after Clause 4 to require the RPB to prepare a draft RSS if no RSS had been prescribed for the region or part of the region and apply Clauses 5 to 11 to the preparation of a draft RSS in the same way that they apply to the preparation of a draft revision of the RSS. I hope that the noble Lord followed that.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para16"></a>Amendment No. 48 would insert a new clause after Clause 4 to require the RPB to prepare the draft RSS and apply Clauses 5 to 11 to the preparation of a draft RSS in the same way that they apply to the preparation of a draft revision of the RSS.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para17"></a>Let me deal with these two amendments together as they are very similar. If the Committee accepts that Amendment No. 13 will be damaging, these amendments become unnecessary. As I have said, we can envisage no situation where it would be helpful for there to be no RSS for the region and the RPB to start from a completely blank sheet of paper. A revision of an RSS can and often should represent the opportunity for a radical reworking of the existing document. It is certainly not about tinkering at the edges. The Bill already provides for the RPB to do exactly that. The current wording does not need to be changed.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para18"></a>Amendment No. 23 would amend Clause 3 to require the regional planning body (RPB) to have regard to the need to keep under review the regional spatial strategy rather than simply stating that it must keep the RSS under review. We do not think that that amendment is helpful. Keeping the RSS under review is a central function of the RPB. The current wording of the Bill is clear and succinct in that regard.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para19"></a>Amendment No. 24 would amend Clause 3 to require the RPB to prepare the RSS as well as keep it under review. This amendment does not seem to us to be necessary. Clause 5(1) already provides that the RPB must prepare a draft revision of the RSS when it thinks it is necessary to do so, at such time as is prescribed or if directed by the Secretary of State. If the purpose of the amendment is to enable the RPB to prepare an RSS from scratch, I believe that we have already covered why that provision is not required.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para20"></a>For all those reasons we do not think that these amendments are helpful although we understand and appreciate the spirit in which they were tabled. With those comments I hope that noble Lords will not feel the need to press the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-26_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I wish to say that such issues take us back to a discussion that we had earlier. I am afraid that it is boringly repetitive. The Bill does not say anywhere, nor does the guidance in PPS 11, that the regional planning body is responsible for the preparation of the regional spatial strategy. But that is what it amounts to: the regional planning guidance will be the prescribed part of any regional planning guidance to form the basis of the regional spatial strategy; but the regional planning <P>


<a name="column_1003"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>body will then be responsible for ensuring that the regional spatial strategy is issued, implemented and reviewed.
<P>

<a name="40120-26_para21"></a>Half of the mischief is that the Bill does not say that. It does not mention the regional planning body in terms of the initial regional spatial strategy, nor does it in planning PPS 11. We will need to insert that in Clause 1 or 2, because that is its role. It may be, as part of that, that the regional planning body will then "take account of" or "have regard to" the regional planning guidance as laid down by the Secretary of State. As I said earlier, there is a lacuna here that the Minister may wish to address now. If not, or if there has not been a satisfactory answer, we will have to move an amendment at the next stage to try to insert that provision.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I have listened to the noble Baroness, but I thought that Clause 5 made clear that the regional planning body did have particular responsibilities. Clause 5(1) does say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The RPB must prepare a draft revision of the RSS".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para0"></a>The point is that the regional planning body inherits a body of knowledge, of experience, from what is there already. So, in a sense, we are talking about a strategy for dealing with revisions; that is what is required. It is not as though we are starting from scratch. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, wants us to start from scratch, but we do not. We do not start this with a blank sheet of paper&#151;we already have certain matters in place. Those strategies are there. In the real world we are talking about a strategy for revising and keeping that process going. I said earlier that we foresee potential for radical revisions of the current approach and strategy. Yes, there is something in place; yes, changes are expected; but we are talking here about having a process of revision, even though those revisions may be fundamental. That is our approach, it is quite plain in the Bill and I think that I have made it plain in this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   I am sorry that the matter has become tedious. The provisional regional spatial strategy is an initial document that arises out of subsections (1) and (2), but it does not say anywhere who is responsible for it other than to state that what the Secretary of State provides in the regional planning guidance is a mandatory part of the spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para1"></a>Clause 5 deals with revision of the RSS. The regional spatial strategy covers 15 to 20 years. It is proper for it to be revised. It cannot possibly stand as a document for 20 years without revision. That is what I understand Clause 5 to be about; but we have not yet reached it. I am complaining about the initial regional spatial strategy which is, apparently, to be dealt with by the regional planning body, but nowhere in the Bill does it say that that is the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I think that it is self-evident, it is axiomatic, that the regional planning body undertakes that process. I am sorry that the noble Baroness is not clear on that. If we need to do more to add clarification then we will be happy to <P>


<a name="column_1004"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1004</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clarify that in correspondence and share that with other noble Lords who have taken part in such an entertaining debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I thank the Minister for such an entertaining and short debate. His comments have clarified the Government's position. We are simply turning all the regional planning guidance that we have now into regional planning strategies. That is contrary to most of our discussions about consultations that involve people. For the time being we shall have to accept regional planning guidance as regional planning strategies. That point has therefore been clarified. In response to my amendment, we would have liked the new regional planning bodies to sit down, look at the problems of their region and devise their own strategies. But that clearly is not what the Government intend&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is important that the noble Lord understands that that is exactly what they will do. However, they cannot start from scratch because the world goes on. I made it plain that we cannot have a situation in which there is a gap of a year or two when nothing much happens because, self evidently, no strategic plan is in place.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para2"></a>If the noble Lord really wants the East Anglian economy to grind to a halt&#151;it would not do so&#151;because of the absence of a powerful economic strategy for the region, he can wish that on the greater region which is the county of Essex.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I wonder whether I can enter into the debate. I think I understand the sequence the Government are proposing, but it requires a regional planning body to be in place immediately in order to start thinking about revisions. Clause 2 provides that the Secretary of State may give a direction recognising an RPB. Can the Minister fill in any gaps about timetabling around that? Assuming that ultimately the amendment carried today does not remain in the same form&#151;and who knows?&#151;what timetable do the Government have in mind for creating the RPBs so that they can inherit an RPG, get on with it and turn it into their own RSS?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am reminded by my noble friend Lord Rooker that since last April the regional chamber has been performing that responsibility. Therefore, a structure is already in place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have had a considerable debate and we must return to these issues. The Minister has clarified the Government's position and we know how the proposals will work. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40120-27_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: We have moved on faster than we thought and we must therefore collect our thoughts as we move to Amendments Nos. 25 and 26. With this technical amendment, we return to the discussions that we have just had. We consider it right for the regional planning body to keep under review the regional spatial strategy. Surely, a given function of the planning system, and for those who oversee it, is to monitor existing policies to ensure that they continue to deliver the most effective planning framework for their area.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para16"></a>However, I am very concerned that the rest of the clause seeks to prescribe to the regional planning body in a great deal of detail&#151;earlier today the Ministers said that they did not want too much data&#151;exactly how and when reports to the Secretary of State should be made. I will come on to that matter later.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para17"></a>In Clause 2(3), the regional planning body is charged with keeping under review matters which may be expected to affect development in its area. Those are the words used, but it is not clear to me what is meant by the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which may be expected to affect".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para18"></a>What is the difference between saying that and saying simply "matters which affect"? To my mind, either something is relevant to the development of an area, in which case it should be kept under review, or it is not, in which case it need not be kept under review. I do not see what is to be gained by muddying the waters in this way.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para19"></a>The language used here is imprecise and too general and it should be removed from the Bill. Regional planning bodies must have a duty to keep abreast of current issues&#151;as we discussed just now&#151;which <P>


<a name="column_1006"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1006</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>might have an impact on development in their area. In doing that, they will be taking a flawed view. The current wording in the Bill does nothing to clarify that.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para20"></a>Amendment No. 26 is also a technical amendment. Put simply, we believe that reference in the Bill to the planning of development draws an unnecessary and unhelpful distinction with "development" plain and simple.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para21"></a>The sentiments of the entire Bill are that a new planning system should have the ability to be proactive and more flexible in its approach to development. It is obvious that, in keeping under review matters affecting development in the region, that must include the planning of development. Indeed, it is hard to see what else it could mean or what else a planning authority would be doing in keeping a spatial strategy under review. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  As the noble Lord has also spoken to Amendment No. 26, I should remind the Committee that, if that amendment is agreed to, it will be impossible to call Amendment No. 28.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-27_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29, which are grouped with the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. They do not concern the same matter but they relate to the same part of the Bill. That is presumably why they have been grouped in this manner.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para22"></a>The reason for tabling the amendments is, again, to attempt to point a dagger at one of the essential issues at the heart of the Bill&#151;that is, whether its purpose is to enhance and assist development per se or whether it is to improve and enhance the planning system in all its aspects. Clause 3 has the heading "RPB: general functions". Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The RPB must keep under review the matters which may be expected to affect&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para23"></a> (a) development in its region or any part of the region; 
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para24"></a> (b) the planning of that development".
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para25"></a>It does not say anything else. It does not say anything about the use of land in general; it does not say anything about improving the quality of the environment; it does not say anything about planning not to develop part of it but preserving it or enhancing its existing uses, which under planning law would not amount to development; and it does not talk about maintenance and management of the physical environment of the region. It simply talks about development.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para26"></a>There is a presumption here of change, of movement and of applications to do things and change uses. There is a presumption that that is what the Bill is all about but it seems to me that that is flawed. Good planning is, indeed, about the encouragement and management of good development. But it is also about resisting development where that is the sensible thing to do. It is about enhancing the environment and about enhancing the other matters that have been referred to in the context of sustainable development.
<P>


<a name="column_1007"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para27"></a>Therefore, at line 23 I would like to leave out subsection (2)(b). Subsection (2)(a) refers specifically to
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"development in its region or any part of the region".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para28"></a>My Amendment No. 27 would replace paragraph (b) with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the planning and management of that development and other use of land and of the quality of the environment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para29"></a>I am looking for a balanced approach, not a static approach that says there must be no change and no development. I am building on what the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, said earlier this evening about the importance of planning in, for example, preserving and enhancing the countryside. Often that does not involve development, but it is an important part of planning. There are of course many others.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para30"></a>At the end of line 23, which refers to the planning of that development, my Amendment No. 28 would insert,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and other use of land".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para31"></a>
The planning system is not about development alone, but the use of land overall. Some of that is changing uses and developing land, some of it is resisting change and development.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para32"></a>Amendment No. 29 would add a further paragraph to subsection (2), so that the RPB must keep under review the matters which may be expected to affect not just development and the planning of the development, but also,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the quality of the environment in its region or any part of its region".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para33"></a>That is a test of how genuinely the Government are looking to the new planning system not just to develop change or to promote development in the interests of faster economic growth, but to create a balanced approach that also considers the quality of the country in which we are living and all aspects of its environment.
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para34"></a>In researching Clause 3 I searched in the Bill for a definition of development. Like many other definitions in the Bill, it is the same as in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. What is the meaning of development in the Bill? Am I right in believing that it is defined in Section 55 of the 1990 Act? If I am not right, will the noble Lord tell the Committee where it is defined and on which definition we are working?
<P>

<a name="40120-27_para35"></a>Section 55 reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to the following provisions of this section, in this Act, except where the context otherwise requires, "development," means the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any building or other land".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-27_para36"></a>I believe that all of us who have ever been involved in the planning system in any way at any level are used to that definition of development and I am happy with it. But if this is the meaning of development in Clause 3, it means that it is just one part of the planning system when surely the regional planning board should be keeping under review the entire purpose of the <P>


<a name="column_1008"></a>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   It occurred to me to build on what my noble friend has just said. Clause 38 requires, among other things, any person or body exercising the function under Part 1 to do so,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-28_para0"></a>It could not do so and therefore have any meaning without some addition such as that proposed by my noble friend, because of the rather constricted nature of the description of its duties under Clause 3(2). I very warmly support, as I would have done anyway, the amendment spoken to by my noble friend. However, linking those two together adds to the need to be clearer in this early part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I think I have the answers; I hope that I have. The amendments all look to find a better form of words than we have so far discovered, with the help of the parliamentary draftsman, to express the regional planning board's review function in relation to what is happening in its region. In answer to a question on the previous debate, as far as the regional planning board is concerned, we intend to issue directions recognising bodies as regional planning boards very shortly after the commencement of the legislation. In other words, there will be no gap. I hope that that satisfies the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para1"></a>We do not think that we are fundamentally at odds with what we think the regional planning board should be doing in that regard; that is, its functions in relation to what is happening in its region. The regional spatial strategy sets out the spatial strategy for the region over a 15 to 20-year period. It is essential that the regional planning board reviews whether development is being planned and undertaken in accordance with that strategy having due regard to the economic, social and environmental considerations and the need to integrate land use and other policies. I shall explain briefly why I think the amendments do not improve what is currently set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para2"></a>Amendment No. 25 would amend Clause 3(2) to require the regional planning board to keep under review those matters that affect the development of its region or the planning of that development, rather than requiring it to keep under review matters which may be expected to affect these things.

<a name="40120-28_para3"></a>We are expecting the regional planning body to look forward as well as reviewing what is happening now. It will not always be possible to determine precisely what may affect development in its region&#151;change in national policy, demographic changes, and so forth&#151;but we would expect the regional planning board to be proactive about considering these, not restricted to considering only matters that it could be sure would affect development. That would be the effect of the amendment, so it would be somewhat restrictive.

<a name="40120-28_para4"></a>Amendment No. 26 would remove from Clause 3(2) the requirement for the regional planning body to keep under review those matters that it expected to affect the planning of development. It is rather strange that a regional planning body should not be expected to keep under review such matters. It is absolutely the regional planning board's role to take a step back and review not just development in the region but how that development has been planned for. As noble Lords will be aware, the Bill places a requirement for local development documents to be in general conformity with the regional spatial strategy and for local planning authorities to request the regional planning board's opinion on this issue. Central to the regional planning board's function is ensuring that at a local level the planning of development is taking place in line with the strategic regional framework.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para5"></a>In that respect, Clause 3(2) refers to development. That includes the use of land in planning legislation and it is unnecessary to state that specifically; that is, under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The planning of development, including the use of land, covers both conservation and change. I assume that there are accepted definitions of what we are referring to in the Bill, which have been tried and tested in the courts in the past. So, from our point of view we are in no doubt about what "development" means.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29 overlap but collectively they would amend Clause 3(2). I keep referring to "regional planning board" and "regional planning body". So far as I am concerned it should be "regional planning body", otherwise people will think that there is another body. I am reluctant to use initials. It sounds appalling if anybody ever tunes in. What I said at Question Time was bad enough today but to use initials is terrible.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para7"></a>I shall start again. Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29 overlap but collectively they would amend Clause 3(2) to require the regional planning body to keep under review not simply those matters that it expected to affect the planning of development but also the management of that development, the other use of land and the quality of the environment.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para8"></a>These amendments appear to swing a little too far the other way. It is properly the regional planning body's job to review what development is taking place and how that is being planned for. However, "management of that development" implies oversight that relates to operational rather than strategic matters. That is what management means: executive action; looking at things; making things happen on the ground. This is not the regional planning board's role. In case there is any misunderstanding, that is the situation. Creating the regional spatial strategies that look beyond narrow development considerations is at the heart of what we want to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para9"></a>Land use should not just be considered in terms of development, but also in terms of what is happening on the land&#151;what sort of environment is being created in that space&#151;and in terms of preservation of the natural <P>

<a name="40120-28_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40120-28_para11"></a>Sustainability is at the heart of the policies of my department. As the Committee will be aware, the Bill places a requirement on those making and implementing plans to do so with a view to contributing to the achievements of sustainable development. I daresay we shall have an over-long debate when we reach Clause 38.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para12"></a>We can agree with much of the intention of this amendment, but it is simply not necessary. Spatial and environmental considerations are already embedded in the regional planning body's survey role. I hope that is a satisfactory explanation on the definition of development to satisfy noble Lords that the amendments are unnecessary. As I said, we agree with the intention of them and I have every confidence that the issues will be covered in reality.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   I have great sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is saying. The Minister quoted those splendid words from, I think, Planning Policy Statement 7. Those are the sort of words I would like to see in the Bill. Is there any way in which that can be contrived?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   You cannot have everything in a Bill. We have a consultation draft out at the moment. It has been out for some time. I am not sure when consultation finishes. I remember I was part and parcel of the initial development and drafting of this when I was responsible for planning. The Government, through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, through the publication of Planning Policy Statement 7 on Sustainable Development in Rural Areas is saying those wonderful words. They are a statement of government policy. Planning authorities will be expected to make a reality of those words. Just because they are not in this Bill but in a planning policy statement on sustainable development in rural areas does not devalue them.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para13"></a>We expect that planning decisions made in rural areas will fit that definition of requirement to protect the countryside for the sake of its intrinsic character. That is very difficult to define but we know what we mean by it. I know what I mean by the intrinsic character of the beauty and diversity of the landscape and the wildlife and the wealth of its natural resources. We do not need to put that in this Bill. It is already written in a government document that will have to be followed as Planning Policy Statement 7 when it becomes a final document. I do not expect those words to change.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   The difference between a Bill and a planning policy statement is that a Bill is much more permanent. I am not saying that we should have all or exactly those words. Planning policy guidance&#151;as it <P>


<a name="column_1011"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1011</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was&#151;can, has been and needs to be changed. When one gets the rather general but very important intentions referred to in the new wording in PPS7, it would be nice to feel that that could be enshrined in primary legislation because, as we all know, other things are easier to change. Although I would have confidence that this Government would implement it, the Bill may well last longer than that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   All I can say to that is this is one quote that was offered in my speaking notes. I know and remember from the early drafts of the document that there are hundreds of such wonderful words in PPS7 on the rural areas, about which noble Lords could urge, "Get it in the Bill because it will last longer". But it is not possible to put that form of wording in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para14"></a>I suspect that the parliamentary draftsmen would find that quote appalling. Hence, the difficulty we have had on Clause 38&#151;with which we shall deal at some length later on&#151;in trying to get a form of words that puts across the required meaning, that is not worthless but which does not have the effect of allowing people all over the country to stop development in its tracks.
<P>

<a name="40120-28_para15"></a>I do not know for how long the previous PPS lasted on rural areas&#151;quite a while. This one will last for some time. It is a major statement from the department. It is in no way devalued by the fact that those words are not in the Bill. I will not satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, but we are at one in our aim to make sure that those words are a reality so far as concerns planning authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   The issue has become more interesting as a result of the Minister's reply. It was quite fundamental to a major flaw within the legislation. What the Minister seems to be telling the Committee is that it does not matter what is on the face of the Bill&#151;we do not need to put anything there&#151;because it is all going to be in documents issued by his department and sent out to people in the country; and nowadays what matters really is documents sent out by his department and not what Parliament actually entrenches as the law.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para0"></a>There is a fundamental difference between the two. We are talking about documents which the Government can or might change. Even this Government will not last for ever. They think they will, but they will not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to intervene. Honestly, what the noble Lord is spouting is absolute rubbish. I want to explain why and to give him an example. If a planning application is dealt with one way or the other and ends up with an appeal, it will go before the planning inspectors, which are independent bodies. In arriving at a decision on whether that planning application is good or bad, a range of issues will be put before that inspector, including not just primary legislation because that is not detailed enough but all the other guidance, documents and statements from which I have quoted.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para1"></a>The noble Lord may say, "Well, it did not go to Parliament. The Government have issued what they wanted". The planning inspectors will issue reports on <P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether or not to allow an appeal, which will go to the Secretary of State. If the precise rules are not followed then we will be subject to a judicial review. So the noble Lord's idea which implied that we act on a whim, that we are bypassing Parliament and that these things do not matter, frankly is absolute rubbish. I feel that he devalues the debate by what he has just said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I understand how the planning and appeal system works. I have been involved with it on many occasions. And of course what the Minister says is quite right&#151;not that I am talking rubbish.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para2"></a>The point I am making is that there is a fundamental difference. The Minister can indulge in all the personal abuse he wants, but it does not alter the fact that there is a fundamental difference between what is on the face of legislation and what is issued by the Government under that legislation. That might carry a great deal of weight. Because it is detailed, it might be what carries most weight of all the advice that goes to the planning authorities, the development control authorities and the inspector dealing with the appeal. That is not the point that I am making. What fundamentally matters is the primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para3"></a>We are not asking for all these great, exciting, flowery statements telling us what a wonderful countryside we want to live in to appear in the legislation. All that I am asking for in these amendments is some balance in what is set out in the Bill. What I am proposing is hardly longer than what is set out in the Bill, but it provides the balance. As far as I understood what the Minister said in response to my amendments, he agreed with them. He thought that they were basically right. That is what the Government were going to do, but he will not put them in the Bill. He did not provide any good reasons for that. I will read Hansard carefully, and I will read what the Minister said carefully, before deciding what further to do.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para4"></a>The Minister is saying, "let us have a one-page Bill that simply says there shall be a new planning system, and the details of this new planning system will be issued in statements sent out by the department". Let us argue each issue on its merits, and not on whether we are adding or taking out a few words in an overlong Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para5"></a>I asked whether the definition of "development" that is to be understood in reading this Bill is the definition set out in Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. If the Minister cannot give me an answer now, I would like it in writing. It is important. Is it the Government's view that the definition of "development" includes no change? Does it include a situation in which in planning terms there is no change, in other words, no material change in the use of land and no actual physical development that classes as development requiring planning permission? Is a "no change" situation in planning terms encompassed by the word "development"? If it is, that <P>


<a name="column_1013"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a new definition of the word "development" that we have never heard before, but it is one that we would like to take away and think about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   With respect, I have not given any personal abuse to the noble Lord&#151;far from it. I criticised the tone of his speech. When I spoke, I specifically answered both the questions that he just asked me. I can repeat what I said&#151;I will repeat it now, so it will force him to read Hansard tomorrow. I said that Clause 3(2) refers to development. This includes the use of land in planning legislation and it is therefore unnecessary to say specifically "i.e. that it is under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990". I said that when I spoke to start with in answer to the debate.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para6"></a>The answer to his question is "yes", but that is the reason why it is not specifically defined as such. I also said separately, but speaking at the same time, that planning of development including the use of land covers both conservation and change. One could argue that conservation might be doing nothing. In certain circumstances it may mean making adjustments, but it covers both conservation and change. With respect, if the noble Lord is still unclear, he can come back to me, but I answered both those questions&#151;both legitimate questions&#151;when I originally replied to the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I will be brief. I heard exactly what the Minister said when he replied. I did not understand what he was saying. I still do not understand what he is saying. That might be my fault; I will read it carefully in Hansard. The question that he has not answered is where the definition of the word "development" is in this Bill. Where do we go to for a definition of what the word means?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   I actually said that because of the way "development" is referred to here, this includes&#151;this is the way the accepted term is used&#151;the use of land in planning legislation. It is therefore unnecessary to say specifically "i.e. that it is under Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990". We think Clause 113 may be relevant, but I need to check that. We may have something that will help the noble Lord&#151;it will certainly help me. Clause 113(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Expressions used in this Act and in the principal Act have the same meaning in this Act as in that Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-29_para7"></a>That covers it: the principal Act is the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. There will not be different definitions of the same word in the principal and the non-principal Act. Referring to the other Act as the principal Act does not mean that we devalue this Bill&#151;it is no less important because it is not the principal Act. However, the definitions of the words are the same. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   I think the Minister is making my point for me, but I will do some more research on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   I should like to come back to my original two amendments. I have some sympathy with <P>


<a name="column_1014"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1014</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister; he has his parliamentary draftsmen, but I am sure that everyone preparing amendments is also getting advice and support from planning barristers, for example. I do not want to keep going over what "development" means, but there is some dispute over what development and the planning of development mean among people who participate in the legal side of planning. My amendments were intended to be helpful; they come from people who have been giving me advice on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para8"></a>We have had this discussion backwards and forwards, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, and we will read what was said in Hansard. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 28, leave out subsections (4) and (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-29_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40120-29_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would remove the duty on regional planning bodies to prepare an annual report for the Secretary of State on the implementation of the regional spatial strategy for a region.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para13"></a>We accept that a regional planning body should be monitoring and, if necessary, should be in a position to report on how a regional spatial strategy is being implemented. Subsections (2) and (3) of this clause more than satisfactorily make provision for that.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para14"></a>What the Bill proposes, however, is an unnecessary and expensive burden on a regional planning body. I think that generally, in their approach to other tiers of government, central government places undue faith on the virtues of reporting upwards. Of course, that may be a particular fault of these proposals&#151;perhaps where there is no democratic accountability, there is no mechanism other than to report to the Secretary of State for ensuring high-quality performance.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para15"></a>Reporting requirements may look innocuous in the context of a piece of legislation, but I can assure your Lordships that they look very different on the ground. They can be exhausting. In some instances, they drain the organisation of resources, manpower and motivation. To have officers working round the clock to produce reams of paper, endless reports to satisfy the insatiable demands of government departments, is futile and detracts from what the organisation is meant to be doing&#151;that is, providing a service.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para16"></a>As the Bill is drafted, the Secretary of State would have complete control over what the regional planning bodies will have to show him at the end of each year. I fail to see how the House can pass a measure of this sort without having an extremely good idea about exactly what these reporting requirements will consist of. Without knowing how onerous they will be, it is difficult to form a judgment about their utility.
<P>

<a name="40120-29_para17"></a>As all noble Lords know, regulation through reporting is a fairly blunt instrument. It depends on the notion of balance&#151;balancing the level of risk involved against the harm that might result from something going wrong. I should have thought, from the <P>


<a name="column_1015"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1015</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State's point of view at least, that there is very little that can go wrong. The Secretary of State is all over these provisions. To describe the provisions protecting the Secretary of State's interests as belt and braces would be to undersell them. There is in the Bill every conceivable mechanism to ensure that the Secretary of State's interests are protected. This is simply another such mechanism. I am sure that the Minister will be sceptical about the value of this amendment, but he will recognise that a process that lends itself to annual reporting also lends itself to arbitrary, counter-productive box-ticking. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40120-29_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I have also added my name to the amendment, but not because we do not believe that reporting is an important activity&#151;clearly it is. Our objection is to the prescriptive nature of the function. If the regional planning body is required to undertake its other functions, at least it could be given discretion as to when and how it reports and not have to do so to a pattern or to the tune of the Secretary of State. Other points have been made earlier and I support the deletion of these provisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am amused by this amendment. I am sorry but I shall make an accusation. I know it is late but I shall not detain the Committee long. I believe that noble Lords opposite should indulge in joined-up opposition. On a number of occasions I have spoken from the Dispatch Box against an amendment moved from the Benches opposite seeking to impose the duty of an annual report on the Government. Here we have an amendment to do exactly the opposite. I have often teased the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, that when stuck for an amendment on which to defeat the Government, the Opposition bring forward one that imposes a duty of an annual report. I am somewhat staggered by this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para0"></a>I am particularly amused and somewhat surprised, given that we have heard much about democracy and accountability in the context of the Bill. We believe that it is right that the regional planning body has placed upon it a duty to monitor and to prepare an annual report on the implementation of regional spatial strategies. It makes perfectly good sense to us. Planning is a continuous, ongoing process which needs to be reviewed and considered. We believe that it is absolutely essential. This amendment would drive a hole through what we believe is the very important process of review and monitoring. We also believe that that is how the regional planning body can keep a check on whether the strategy is effective and working and what changes need to be made.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that it was a burden. He probably wanted to know more of the detail. I shall provide that now as it is right that we do so. We expect regulations under Part 1 of the Bill, which we published in draft for consultation, to require the regional planning body to do the following: it must identify any policy in the regional spatial <P>


<a name="column_1016"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1016</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strategy which it thinks is not being implemented; it must cover in its annual report the reasons why; and it must set out what action it intends to take and whether it intends to prepare a draft revision of the regional spatial strategy to change the policy. Because the regional spatial strategy is also central to housing delivery, the regional planning body will also be required to report progress against its housing delivery policy.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para2"></a>The regional spatial strategy sets out the Secretary of State's spatial policies for the region so, in our view, it is right that the regional planning body should prepare an annual report to the Secretary of State. In that the regional planning body will also be required to make the report publicly available particularly through its website.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para3"></a>We all know that planning is not a one-off; it is not something that just happens every so often; it is a continuous process. Our view is that it is undermined if those policies are not delivered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I have tried to restrain myself given the lateness of the hour and the gathering of the Whips. Would the Minister reflect on the fact that one of the reasons that we have a problem with these provisions is that the regional planning body has no executive authority? It does not do anything. The noble Lord is suggesting that this is a way in which to hold it to account for elements of the strategy which are or are not delivered, but the body itself has no powers to deliver any of those things. What it will be doing under the provisions of the Bill is simply to go through a long and onerous task of examining the delivery that has been done by other bodies. It will have to explain, for example, why it is that the Highways Agency has not built a road or why some piece of land has not been brought forward for industrial development.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para4"></a>The point that we are making is that the Government seem to be asking the regional planning body to give an account of the progress or lack of progress, when it is simply not in its powers to do so. That is why we have such a problem with the measure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has a problem with that. However, she seems to have retreated to a position in which we just let things happen in a vacuum, without anyone holding anything together to see exactly where plans, processes and procedures have led us. The noble Baroness makes an acceptable point&#151;which is also, I suppose, fairly obvious&#151;that the regional planning body itself is not an instrument of delivery. However, surely it must be right that we know exactly what is going on. For that reason, we believe that the annual report and review and monitoring process should be put in place.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para5"></a>I know that Lib Dems have a problem with things being looked at and examined and processes being constant. I am sure that they would like to have things free-floating and airy-fairy; that seems to be within their spirit. However, that does not take us anywhere. <P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We need to ensure that the planning process is ongoing, continuous and understood, and that we can see what comes out of it and what is delivered.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para6"></a>I suggest that the amendment is actually extremely damaging. As I said at the outset, I am somewhat surprised, given that the opposition parties, which often argue the case for an annual report to ensure that we are being held to account, that things are there on the record and that we do understand what is going on, have done something of a volte-face in this Bill and want to undermine its effect by taking this important system of measurement away from the legislation. I hope that noble Lords opposite will retreat to a position of consistency with all other demands that they make under other forms of legislation, in which the monitoring and review of the process is firmly in place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The noble Lord says that he is amused by the amendment. He worries me terribly, and I believe that the mechanism controlling his amusement is badly in need of adjustment. However, that is perhaps not a matter for the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para7"></a>Parliament has a duty to scrutinise the acts of the executive and hold them to account. I cannot speak of the amendments to which the noble Lord referred, but that is why opposition parties very often propose the <P>


<a name="column_1018"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column 1018</B></P>

<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   We have had an interesting debate on the amendment, and we have noted the response of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. Wearing various hats, I am involved in many annual reports, and I have had several discussions with James Strachan of the Audit Commission, whose motto is, "deregulation, deregulation, deregulation". The Audit Commission is scrapping lots of annual reports of this type&#151;not of the type that reports to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para8"></a>We feel that that report is an onerous piece of bureaucracy to put on these bodies. Of course, they have to report, but the box-ticking of an annual report is not the right way forward. I am sure that we shall return to the matter, but for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I shall merely remind the Committee that members should speak standing and that the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. Speakers on the Back Benches should place themselves near a microphone so that Hansard staff may record them. There will be no Divisions. If there is a Division in the Chamber, which I believe there may be, speakers should stop speaking and the Committee will adjourn for 10 minutes.

<a name="40120-30_para14"></a>[Amendment No. 13 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith </B>   moved Amendment No. 14:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 8, after "payments" insert "from any revenues accruing to the installation, site or facility"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-30_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40120-30_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: As a prologue to the amendment, perhaps I may express my gratitude to my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding for taking on board my amendments last week when I was unable to attend. He has a frightening ability to read my mind and I am most grateful to him.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para17"></a>This is a small amendment that I have tabled to probe the Government's thinking about the sentence at the end of Clause 5(2). It refers to a direction giving the NDA responsibilities and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may require the person with control of the installation, site or facility to make payments to the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-30_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40120-30_para19"></a>My mind went straight back to the 14th century, when offices of profit were issued under the Crown and I found myself thinking, "What on earth are we talking about?" Why on earth is the poor individual, who may receive only a modest salary, making payments to the Secretary of State because of his responsibilities? The amendment is intended to probe the background to that simple statement.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para20"></a>It is not quite that simple. Clauses 3 and 4 deal with the responsibilities of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. That is perfectly plain and straightforward. Clause 5 also deals with the business of the Nuclear <P>


<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Decommissioning Authority, until we come to the last sentence when, suddenly, an unspecified individual is required to make payments to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40120-30_para21"></a>The individual may well be someone who is working in an appointment given to him by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, so there may be some rationale behind it. It may even be that this is an antique Bill-drafting convention that dates from the 14th century and that it has always been expressed in that way. In which case, all I can say is that it is time we changed. I find that wording in the Bill very strange. That is why I have tabled the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   If the money does not come from the revenues accruing to whomever is the operator of the site, where will it come from? The Government's answer may be that that is the only conceivable source and that we do not need to write that into the Bill. However, anyone reading the Bill might say that the authority can come along and simply make a charge for whatever reason. That would bear no relation whatever to the revenues that might be accruing from the operation of the site. My noble friend has made the case that the issue should be clarified. It is not clear at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, tempts me. There was a time when I was an expert on Tudor economic documents and I would love to follow him down the byways of yesteryear, when corruption was the order of the day and the only way in which the state was run. However, I shall resist the temptation and attempt to tell him what the clause is intended to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para0"></a>The noble Lord's amendment would remove the polluter pays principle. It would limit a private sector operator's liabilities for clean-up to future revenues from the installation or facility concerned. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, it is unlikely that there would be future revenues.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para1"></a>Where the NDA takes on designated responsibility for securing the clean-up of a site&#151;for which it does not bear the financial responsibility, let me make that clear&#151;the Government's intention is to recover the costs of clean-up from the operator concerned. That is an absolutely fundamental point to which we adhere.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para2"></a>That responsibility does not rest on the installation and its ability to cover its own clean-up costs; it applies to the operator under the existing statutory and regulatory regime. Whether or not a particular installation has generated sufficient revenue, the operator is not absolved of his responsibility to discharge any and all liabilities that arise as a result of operating that installation.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para3"></a>The NDA is likely to be involved only when an installation has to be decommissioned and cleaned up. No further revenues are then likely to be forthcoming. If insufficient provision has been made for the decommissioning of a plant from its own revenues, that would lead to a shortfall that the NDA would be unable to recover. We should not limit the scope of the NDA to recover its costs in this way.
<P>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC255</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para4"></a>Accordingly, on the clear principle that the reason the legislation is drafted in this way is not a carry-over from 16th-century economic legislation but to adhere to the principle that the polluter pays, I hope the noble Lord will feel that his amendment would detract from that fundamental position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Having heard the Minister's explanation, may I ask the noble Lord whether, if the installations, sites or facilities have polluted Scottish land, the payment would be made to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to the Secretary of State for Scotland or to Scottish Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We have an amendment to deal with the relationships between the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Scottish Ministers. We will discuss a range of issues that will arise today. I hope that I will be able to address the question within that context. Suffice it to say that within that debate I hope to give satisfactory answers to a range of issues. There may be one or two issues about which I may not be able to be entirely specific. At this stage, I am not in a position to give the noble Baroness a direct answer. I apologise for that, but I hope that when we get to the main debate on the issue I shall have an answer to give to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   With respect to the Minister, I am not trying to be clever about this. There are people who are concerned about this issue. It has been put to me that we need to find an answer to the problem. That is why I asked the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   That is entirely proper. I always assume the highest motives behind the noble Baroness's interjections for obvious reasons. I like to reply as accurately as I can.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para5"></a>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry gives all directions in Scotland but, as set out in the legislation, Scottish Ministers certainly have important roles in relationship to the process. The noble Baroness asked a precise question to which I do not have a direct, unequivocal answer at this moment. I beg for a little leeway on the issue. I shall certainly not forget the point made by the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   May I ask the Minister, first, how the payments will be assessed? Secondly, why is payment not made to the NDA rather than the Secretary of State? After all, it is the NDA that will incur the costs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The NDA will certainly incur the cost, but the noble Lord will recognise that it is working under the overall direction of the Secretary of State. When payments of such significance are to be made related to clean-ups, as an important principle of the Bill, it is right that we should identify the Secretary of State as the person to whom the payments are made.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para6"></a>The assessment of the costs will be what is reasonable in terms of necessary expenditure incurred for the process. I should have thought that the <P>


<a name="column_GC256"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>principle was obvious enough. The NDA is not seeking to wrest from the former operator any profit or advantage; it merely seeks to embrace the principle that, where pollution has occurred and has to be cleared up, the proper costs incurred should be met. The liabilities cost what they do to discharge them. The Bill provides that the Secretary of State funds the NDA through grant payments. The NDA returns any income that it gets. Obviously enough, although it is not extra income, the income derived from replenishment for costs that have been justifiably incurred on clean-up are payable to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am glad that I tabled the amendment, because it has provoked some discussion. I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that he has not satisfied me. I have no difficulty at all with the principle that the polluter should pay. However, I have difficulty with the way in which the Bill suddenly jumps from the responsibilities of the NDA and supplemental provisions designating directions to the NDA to this one simple sentence. I understand that it is not a problem for an individual, but a proper restatement of the principle that the polluter should pay.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para7"></a>I find it an oddity to include, as a sort of supplemental supplement, designations to the NDA. If we are to have the provision, it should be quite clear and plain that it is in the Bill in its own right. Putting it in in such a way is almost trying to hide it, so it makes me even more suspicious. Perhaps the Minister could give me a direct example of how it would work, but it might be unfair to bowl at him at this stage of the afternoon. He might want notice of how to answer that, so it would be prudent at this stage to express my concern and, having done so, to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para8"></a>Further explanation is necessary. I hope that we receive it, otherwise we will certainly need to return to the point simply for the sake of clarity of the meaning of the Bill. At the moment, it seems very obscure. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para10"></a>[Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 not moved.]
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para11"></a>Clause 5 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para12"></a>Clause 6 [Designations relating to Scotland]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin </B>   moved Amendment No. 17:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 22, at end insert "and obtain their approval before issuing the direction"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-31_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40120-31_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: This probing amendment is designed to elicit where the border lies between the overarching powers of the Secretary of State and the devolved powers of Scottish Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para15"></a>The fact that the Bill lays a duty on the Secretary of State to consult the Scottish Ministers implies that, were he or she not so instructed, he or she might not do that. It further implies that, in not consulting, he or she would be well within his or her rights. Consultation itself achieves nothing. It is the resulting action, if there is any, that progresses the situation. The Bill makes consultation mandatory but remains silent on how <P>


<a name="column_GC257"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC257</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>progress is to be accomplished. Agreement between the parties concerned is unlikely to cause a problem. On the other hand, dissension is a possibility and should be legislated for.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para16"></a>It is possible to envisage many situations that could result in disagreement. One such might involve waste disposal where it might be necessary for the Secretary of State to consult on the use of, for example, a remote Scottish island. Of course, there is no guarantee that the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry might have the same ideas about that island; they might want it to be on yet another island.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para17"></a>Under the conditions in the Bill, the Secretary of State could consult, overrule any objections, and carry on with the Whitehall plan. However, were he required to reach agreement, he might have to incorporate more stringent safety rules, transport arrangements, storage parameters and so forth. We need only glance at the kind of directions that might be given by the Secretary of State to understand how important that is and the sensitivity of the subject as regards Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para18"></a>For example, Clause 3(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before giving a direction under section 3",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-31_para19"></a>
the Secretary of State might have to give,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the NDA responsibilities for the operation in or on a licensable site in Scotland of a facility for the non-processing treatment of hazardous material".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-31_para20"></a>
Or the Secretary of State might have to give the NDA,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"responsibilities for the operation in or on a licensable site in Scotland for a facility for the storage of hazardous material".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-31_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40120-31_para22"></a>In the past, those of us who have been at the other end have known some extremely cantankerous Secretaries of State for Scotland. I can think of one from the noble Lord's party who had as much difficulty in obtaining agreement with his Cabinet as he had in obtaining agreement with us. On some of those issues, it is highly likely that that individual might take a totally different view to that taken by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I do not refer exactly to the Secretary of State for Scotland because he, poor chap, must feel like a displaced person in his own office. His powers have been so dramatically and drastically cut by devolution that now he is what might be called a part-time Secretary of State for Scotland whose main duties lie with transport.
<P>

<a name="40120-31_para23"></a>As regards Scotland, many issues are raised. I have given just one or two examples, but one does not have to look far in other parts of the Bill to see that there are much wider implications than at first might seem likely. We will return to this and other issues that affect Scotland, but I hope that the Minister will give us some reassurance that the Government are looking seriously at the matter. If he is unable to do so, we shall have to come back to the issue on Report to try to persuade him a little more. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-32_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My name is also attached to the amendments. I support my noble friend Lord Gray. I am perhaps not one to apologise for the slight hint of <P>


<a name="column_GC258"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a skirl of bagpipes in the background of the Committee. There are issues that concern Scotland. I am not fully aware of whether there are nuclear sites in Scotland where some of the non-processing of nuclear waste treatment is carried out, but, if it was introduced, one can understand that the Scottish Executive might feel that it should be subject to planning permission. We should like to know how far the powers of the Secretary of State in Whitehall would go in being able to overrule that.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para0"></a>Using the excuse that these matters are Scottish issues, the other amendments grouped with Amendment No. 17&#151;namely, Amendments Nos. 45, 51 and 52&#151;concern a single principle. The NDA prepares annual plans and reports progress against them. Those plans and reports are then distributed to all who are directly affected. However, there are others whose interests may be affected both by the priorities as set out in the plan and the nature of the progress achieved. If nuclear matters are not to any degree devolved and if they are in all respects a UK matter, all those affected throughout the UK should be kept as fully in the picture as is consistent with state security. If they are in any way devolved, that fact should be made clearer and the Bill drafted accordingly.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para1"></a>The order of priority given to the activity of the NDA may excite considerable interest among Scottish Ministers. At the moment, the dividing lines are blurred. For example, the nuclear industry employs people who require to be trained in order to play their part to best effect. The plans and reports of the NDA, even where they do not concern specific Scottish sites and facilities, may contain information relevant to future skills and requirements. That may be of value to Scottish Ministers in planning and providing the training necessary to cope with decommissioning when it directly affects them. The timetable laid down for producing the annual plans does not allow much time for skills training before the indicated action is due to commence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Will the Minister explain why Clause 6(1) states that a direction,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be given only by the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers, acting jointly",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-32_para2"></a>while Clause 6(3) states that the circumstances to which the noble Lord, Lord Gray referred, apply, namely that the Secretary of State must consult Scottish Ministers? What is the difference? As my noble friend pointed out, "consulting Scottish Ministers" is not the same as "acting jointly". If the Scottish Ministers said "no" to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about the island to which my noble friend referred, what would happen? We need to know that. Will the Minister explain the difference between the circumstances in which the Ministers have to act jointly and those where there is a consultation?
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para3"></a>On Clause 14 and annual reports, an important point should be made. It probably would not make much difference to the procedures. There are so many aspects in which there will be overlap between what happens south of the Border and north of the Border. Decisions taken south of the Border may affect those <P>


<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC259</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taken north of the Border later on. It would be so much better if the annual report had to be laid also before Scottish Ministers and the Scots Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   First, I shall address the common theme that has run through the contributions made by all noble Lords. The Bill touches on intricate issues surrounding the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and devolved matters. We must therefore proceed with considerable care. A vast amount of work has been done. That is reflected in the way in which the Bill depicts relationships between UK and Scottish Ministers. I bow to the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Gray, when considering difficulties that may arise through personal quirks of Ministers, but I assume that we are discussing the formal powers in the Bill. There will always be interaction between colleagues of which we must all take account, but which can scarcely be written into the Bill. If they were, we would find ourselves in difficult circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para4"></a>The issue of consultation was raised. Consultation is obviously different from having direct powers. Where the legislation requires consultation, the person who is required to consult&#151;in most of the cases covered by the clause, that will be the Secretary of State&#151;must set out the issues, hear representations, consider them and then decide. He must demonstrate that that process has been fully followed through. Consultation is a formal requirement that has weight in the process that the Secretary of State must follow.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para5"></a>However, there cannot be a requirement that the parties reach agreement. By definition, consultation is an attempt to work towards an understanding and agreement on action to be taken. We could not require agreement to be reached as a result of consultation; otherwise, we would be involving joint powers, not consultation. The issues involved in consultation are different from powers. The amendment, and the anxieties of Members of the Committee who spoke, relate to the extent of the definition of the powers in the Bill; the relationship with the Scottish Executive; whether its powers are clearly defined; and whether the balance is struck accurately.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para6"></a>The provisions on the level of involvement of Scottish Ministers reflect the extensive discussions that took place between the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers in the preparation of the Bill. The complicated nature of the provisions, at which the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, hinted, is unavoidable because of the various matters for which the NDA will have responsibility, and which are to be handled under the clear terms of the devolution settlement. The operation of the NDA, its United Kingdom responsibility and the specific requirements regarding the Scottish position are difficult areas.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para7"></a>The devolution settlement regarding nuclear matters is complex. Sites licensable under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and Crown sites are reserved matters for the Secretary of State. On the other hand, environmental protection and the regulation of the disposal of radioactive waste are, in principle, <P>


<a name="column_GC260"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>devolved matters. Members of the Committee, therefore, immediately will see a basis for difficulty and the need to get the legislation right.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para8"></a>The NDA's functions inevitably cover reserved and devolved matters. In some cases, it is difficult to draw the line between the two; hence the extensive discussions that we have been obliged to have with our Scottish colleagues&#151;with great enthusiasm, of course. It is always a pleasure to engage in discussion on such matters with our Scottish colleagues, as, I am sure, Members of the Committee will attest.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para9"></a>It has taken some time to determine the powers that Scottish Ministers should have in relation to the NDA's responsibility. There is no hiding the fact that the general principles behind the Act lead to some difficult issues, on which there has not always been easy agreement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-32_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Is the pleasure that the Minister mentioned enhanced by the fact that he and the Scottish Ministers are of the same political party at present? Those difficulties may be thrown into sharper relief when voting requires different political approaches at different ends of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am talking about the principles behind the Bill, so if ever there were changes in political representation&#151;a rather far-sighted concept, as the noble Duke would agree&#151;if ever that distant day came, we, as the UK Parliament, would have agreed on the principles of the Bill, which will govern those relationships.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para10"></a>I suppose that there is a more friendly tone, but the noble Duke will recognise and would be the first to advocate that, irrespective of their political stance, the Scots are well able to advance the cause of their interests. I assure him that the difficulties we have had with the Bill have been because Scottish Ministers of my party are as keen to establish the contours of their powers and those of their successors as Scottish Ministers under the Bill as they should be, in seeking to discharge their responsibilities to their electorate.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para11"></a>Those discussions have produced an agreed position, and we believe that the Bill's provisions properly reflect that agreement. We understand that Scottish Executive officials are now poring over the measures in order to satisfy themselves that we have captured the ministerial agreement that underpins the Bill's drafting.
<P>

<a name="40120-32_para12"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Gray, freely acknowledged, the amendments would certainly extend the powers of Scottish Ministers&#151;into areas that clearly fall into reserved powers. It is because the amendment would clearly cross the line maintained by the Bill that I ask the noble Lord to withdraw it, in the hope that his intention was to probe whether we had sufficiently addressed ourselves to the contours of the relationships between the UK and Scottish Parliaments. I can assure him that extensive work has been done on that, because we all recognise that the NDA faces difficult issues of discrimination between reserved matters and others. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40120-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We are of course eager that the process of reporting shall be as open as possible. The noble Duke made a useful point when he said that experience derived from UK operations would be valuable to Scottish operations and to the Scottish Executive, because they could learn from that experience. It would be ridiculous if there were a barrier that obstructed the exchange of that information; I certainly seek to allay fears on that score.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para0"></a>To the extent that the NDA will handle, store or dispose of radioactive waste at sites in Scotland, the Bill provides that the annual report should indeed be sent to the Scottish Minister, as the Committee would expect. In practice, therefore, Scottish Ministers will receive a copy of the report for decades to come&#151;for as far into the future as we can foresee. If and when the NDA no longer has any decommissioning or clean-up responsibilities in Scotland, there would then be no reason for Scottish Ministers to be involved in its activities.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para1"></a>The NDA's annual report will be presented to Parliament, published and available to anyone in the UK, but if the question behind the amendments was whether the NDA would report to and present a report to the Scottish Executive, the answer is "Yes", in so far as it has direct responsibilities in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I shall withdraw the amendment, but one point still bothers me. We can return to it later. I am still concerned about what happens if agreement is reached between the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the part-time Secretary of State for Scotland, but not necessarily with the First Minister. At the end of the day, whose will prevails?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Lord has suddenly dropped me into even deeper waters than those in which I was already splashing about in an ungainly manner a few moments ago. I sought within the framework to describe the relationship between the UK Minister for Trade and Industry and the Scottish responsibilities. The Secretary of State for Scotland negotiates with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on a range of matters. But in this area we are talking about Scottish Ministers, who would pursue the matter on the basis that we have agreement for the nature of the legislation involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-33_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The Minister did not reply to my question on how the divisions are made between where agreement must be reached between the two, where they act jointly and where they consult. He must do much more thinking on the matter, as there is confusion.

<a name="40120-33_para2"></a>The Minister said that he hoped that the day was far ahead when different parties would be in power in the Scots Parliament and at Westminster. That may be so; I can understand his sentiment, but I think that I am right in saying&#151;the Minister will know this&#151;that civil servants working for the Scottish executive and those at Westminster try very hard, when the Government legislate, to ensure that the arrangements are robust enough for the very circumstance when there are different parties. We cannot just hope that such a change will never happen; it will probably happen one day, and all our legislation must be robust enough to stand up to it. The point made by my noble friend Lord Gray is very important in that respect. I hope that, if my noble friend withdraws his amendment, the Minister will think a lot more about the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I apologise to the noble Baroness for my egregious political quip that it would be many decades before the political parties changed.

<a name="40120-33_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise for being unable to speak at Second Reading and, unfortunately, for missing the first Committee sitting last week. I have read the Committee's deliberations in Hansard. Had I been present, I would have supported those in favour of reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, particularly through more nuclear build in future.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 21 to 24 are tabled in my name and those of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and my noble friend Lord Lea. They relate to pension provisions for staff employed in nuclear decommissioning. The Bill refers to pension provision in several clauses and schedules. References in other parts of the Bill appear to give the NDA sufficient powers in respect of its own staff either to set up its own scheme or to keep them in the combined pension scheme. Clause 8 is important, because it provides the NDA with fairly wide powers to set up and/or maintain an industry-wide scheme. We strongly welcome that.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para12"></a>In our view, an industry-wide scheme would allow for the provision of equivalent benefits to new starters and to contractors who do not have pension arrangements comparable with those already in place for people currently employed in the industry. This <P>


<a name="column_GC263"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC263</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would also ensure future pensions continuity in the event that one of the current incumbent organisations on licensed sites failed to renew its contracts. The scheme should be open to all in the clean-up work force in order to provide an incentive to staff to remain in the industry for the long term.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para13"></a>The purpose of the amendments, therefore, is to ensure that aims can be fulfilled on a fully inclusive basis, thus avoiding the creation of a two-tier work force as regards pension arrangements. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-33_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My noble friend has already indicated that, under the terms of Clause 8(2), the provisions in relation to the ability of the NDA to run pension schemes are quite wide, enabling the position of existing public sector employees to be safeguarded and to provide for other workers who might be brought in. However, his amendment would have the effect of an open door on expanding the definition of "relevant employees" for whom the NDA could either establish or run a pension scheme, one without clear limits and which would effectively change the precise definitions set out in subsection (2). Employees could be added who are employed by private sector contractors and sub-contractors throughout the nuclear sector. That would mean that the NDA could establish or run a pension scheme for employees unrelated to its own principal function, which is the clean-up and decommissioning of designated sites.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para14"></a>The amendments could have an indirect effect whereby the NDA's focus would be diluted away from that main function, turning the body into a portmanteau pension fund administrator for people working on and off within nuclear premises. That is not the Government's intention for the new authority. We are seeking to give a certain degree of flexibility for both existing and new employees to be brought into the scheme, but not to make it an open door. That would not be in the interests of the core members of the scheme or of the existing employees due to join it.
<P>

<a name="40120-33_para15"></a>I turn to the amendments seeking consultation with employees' representatives. That is a desirable principle and one which we would expect the NDA to pursue regarding all aspects of its pensions provision. Reference is made to the NDA establishing appropriate stakeholder functions, which would include addressing the issue of relationships with its employees. However, because the proposal referring to consultation with representatives of employees relates to the amendments seeking to push wide the door to allow all kinds of different groups of employees to come in, it is not particularly obvious why the NDA should be required to consult the representatives of people whose activities do not form part of the core functions set out in this Bill. It is difficult to envisage why they should be members of the scheme. So while we would be under a clear obligation to consult the trade unions and representatives of the NDA's own employees and pensioners, the amendment would require that consultation to go much wider.

<A NAME="40120-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   The Minister's response is not entirely surprising, although it is a little disappointing. We did not have it in mind to seek to extend the pension provision over such a wide area that the NDA would end up with a portmanteau pension burden. We envisaged points beyond which the pension provisions would not extend. Perhaps I should take the proposal away and seek a clearer definition of the points beyond which the provisions would not go. A proposal defining the extent to which consultation would take place might be more acceptable to the Minister.

(e) the need to protect the social and economic life of local communities"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-34_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 26 deals with a key group of stakeholders. Although radioactive waste is a national and international problem, any solution found by the Government or the NDA will have an impact on several communities of people and not just on the host community. Those communities must be considered as part of the deliberation process and not as part of the implementation. Transportation through communities; the impact of construction; environmental and economic impacts; and communities' familiarity with nuclear establishments must be taken into account. It is essential that trust be developed between any new responsible organisation and all of those stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para1"></a>We hope that the amendment will not be contentious. Clearly particular local communities are likely to be directly affected&#151;for example, in Caithness and Cumbria. The amendment, therefore, would make the promotion of their economic and social well-being a matter of duty for the new NDA. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40120-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My noble friend Lady Miller and I were privileged to be invited to meet the staff at Harwell. We spent most of Friday there. Harwell has a remarkable record of replacing a large number of individual nuclear facilities. Many of the oldest "piles", as they were then called but which became research reactors, have been successfully decommissioned. A slide-show was presented to us where every alternate picture contained the same image as the one that preceded it with the word "Gone" written across it.
<P>


<a name="column_GC265"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para2"></a>That is the decommissioning aspect of Harwell's work. However, we were impressed particularly by the extent to which UKAEA has been able, in collaboration with developers&#151;and, no doubt, with local authorities and others&#151;to find good uses for the land that is thus freed up from its original research and development function.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para3"></a>We were impressed, first, by the fact that new buildings have been constructed on the site, as has happened at Winfrith, for which UKAEA is responsible as well as for Harwell. In some cases, housing can be built on the site. A science park is being developed at Harwell. That is perhaps rather easier there than it may be in other places as it is close to Oxford. I suspect that there will be considerable demand there.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para4"></a>We were impressed also by the way in which the authority that carried out all that work had remained closely in touch with the local community. In one case, the groundwater of an area of land had become seriously polluted. We saw that the plant was effectively drawing in the polluting liquid, passing it up through filters and returning it to the ground. I believe that a local authority school shares a boundary with that site and that the UKAEA has good relations with it. There is plenty of experience to show that that can be done. I do not know whether it needs to be written into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para5"></a>Cumbria may be a special case&#151;as, indeed, may Dounreay. It is some years since I have been up to Dounreay; it takes a long time to get there and a long time to come back. I do not intend to reopen our debates on Second Reading and last Thursday about new nuclear build, but most sites of decommissioned power stations would be highly suitable for new build, if it were to happen. That would have the support of local communities, provide continuity of employment and have many other beneficial effects. However, there may be individual sites where that is impossible or inappropriate, so there should be a duty on the NDA to take account of the consequences of decommissioning and its impact on local communities.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para6"></a>From my experience in the Department of the Environment, when I was dealing with inner-city problems, I know that if we approach them in the right way and seek what I call bottom-up solutions, successful regeneration can often be accomplished with the support of local authorities and other agencies. If we try to impose that on people top-down, it does not work. There is plenty of evidence for that.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para7"></a>If the NDA will be doing the actual decommissioning work on the ground, it will in the course of preparing a site for decommissioning have the opportunity to engage in consultation to recognise the needs of the local community. I should be surprised if it did not regard it as part of its duty to do that work. Given that the UKAEA has been successfully doing that work on several sites for 12 years or more, there need not be too much gloom and despondency, feeling that we are sterilising land for several generations and so on. It is not like that at all.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para8"></a>I was both surprised and impressed by the story that the UKAEA told us. I report to the Committee that there can be an atmosphere of optimism in those circumstances that ought to enter our debate. I hate the idea that all we are doing is running things down. It must not be like that; all sorts of new opportunities can be created if people approach the matter in the right way. Other Members of the Committee might find it worthwhile to see the same presentation that we were given and to meet the impressive people doing that work on the Harwell site. Then they would recognise that there is life after death. There is sometimes too much feeling that there will be nothing after.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para9"></a>I end by describing one further experience. I had to handle the closing of the Chatham dockyard. I went down to Maidstone on a winter's day, when we had great difficulty getting through the snow, and encountered a community and a county council in the absolute depths of despair. Chatham dockyard was to close; what on earth could conceivably take its place? I can only suggest that people go down to see what is happening to Chatham now. There has been a huge resurgence of activity in the whole of that area, helped by sensible government policy. We need to create hope. I hope that the NDA must recognise that that is an important part of how it can create the psychology in which its work will become fruitful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 32, which is grouped. My amendment would add to the powers of the NDA, where it is given,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"power to make grants or loans to persons undertaking activities benefiting the social or economic life of communities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-34_para10"></a>The Bill does not mention the environmental aspects of those communities. My amendment proposes that the environmental aspect should be grant-aided by the NDA in the same way as the social and economic life of the community.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para11"></a>When the Minister replies, perhaps he will tell me that under the general duties in Clause 9(1)(b),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the need to safeguard the environment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-34_para12"></a>satisfactorily covers the need to have regard to the environment when giving grants to communities. But I am not sure whether that is so. Some sites might need a great deal of environmental regeneration above and beyond the removal or containment of radioactive material. Therefore, the NDA should be able to grant aid in the form of environmental grants.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para13"></a>I turn briefly to Amendment No. 26. I agree that regard to the social and economic life of those communities is extremely important. Providing that it is not necessary to go down the new nuclear build road to fulfil the spirit of the amendment, I support it, while remaining neutral on the other question.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para14"></a>I agree that current nuclear power sites may be suitable sites for new nuclear build, should that be the policy decision. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, those sites may also be suitable for other activities. A wind farm is already proposed for the site next to the nuclear power station at Hinckley Point. <P>


<a name="column_GC267"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Minister will recall that last week we had an interesting debate in your Lordships' House about tidal power from the Severn estuary. Hinckley Point might be a place where tidal power could be developed. For example, it could become a centre through which some tidal power infrastructure could be delivered. To that end, I support the noble Lord's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-34_spnew2"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I am interested in the subject raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. My understanding is that she is mainly addressing the concerns that must have been addressed in Clause 9(1)(b) about what might be produced from a nuclear site. But if the element of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"persons undertaking activities",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-34_para15"></a>concerned with the environmental life of communities becomes part of the Bill, does the Minister see that extending to people wanting to plant a bank of trees to protect the environment not from the activities of the nuclear industry but more generally?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Christopher: </B>   Perhaps I may add a word in substantial measure of support for what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said. I shall not repeat it, but there is experience of what he said to be found in America. However, under the Bill, there is the additional aspect that contracts will be awarded. Experience has been that contracts have not always gone to local people, local firms or local work forces. If ever a history is written of what has taken place in the past 20 years under contracting out, we would find a remarkable amount of information to show that we have made savings, but that a comparable bill has been picked up by social services. There is no benefit in that whatever for communities. It is important that it is stated in the Bill that the local community must be considered with respect to contracts.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para16"></a>The other aspect is future job prospects, which certainly bears on what was said by my noble friend Lord Brooke and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. It is particularly the case in small areas. One could argue that in parts of Britain it is not a great problem because other opportunities are around in the community. That is not true in parts of Scotland or in Cumbria. I hope that the Minister can help, but the NDA or someone else needs to consider what will happen afterwards. Where are people who have had a decent education in Cumbria going to work if things have been run down over the decade?
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para17"></a>I hope that we can include a provision in the Bill to bring comfort and encouragement and answer those questions.

<A NAME="40120-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Some important speeches have been made on the amendments. I certainly support the spirit of Amendment No. 26, although the Minister may point out difficulties that would dissuade me. It seems important, not only for the immediate future, but for the long-term future. Communities that may be identified in future as places where new nuclear build might happen are far more <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>likely to be sympathetic to having it in their midst if they know that people have been treated really well in the past.
<P>

<a name="40120-34_para18"></a>As most nuclear power stations are in rather remote places, the community, such as it is, matters even more. As the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, said, the job prospects and quality of life that pertain in that place matter desperately. I am simply sorry that noble Lords who have represented areas with power stations in Scotland are not in Committee, as I am sure that they would reiterate the point. Amendment No. 26 is very important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I start by reassuring Members of the Committee that the role that the UKAEA and BNFL have played in the communities in which they operate will continue as an aspect of the NDA's activities when it takes over responsibility. I am familiar with what has gone on at Winfrith&#151;which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin&#151;and to a lesser extent in the Sellafield area. I am afraid that I have not revisited Harwell since I stopped working there 35 years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I suggest that the noble Lord takes a map next time he goes, because he will not recognise the place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I suspect that that is true. Clearly, where a big employer&#151;in particular, a big public sector employer&#151;changes the pattern of employment, and probably reduces it in this case in the short term, there are responsibilities. That is why we have ensured that the NDA will have sufficient funds to cover such activities.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para0"></a>Amendment No. 26 would put that duty on the same level as the duty to safeguard the environment, the duty to protect health and safety, the central duty to ensure that clean-up takes place, and the need to preserve nuclear security. That would unbalance the picture a little. I think it unlikely&#151;I am speaking slightly out of turn&#151;that the UKAEA under present statutes has an equivalent duty. However, it, BNFL as a limited company and the NDA will be able to use that power in future. Indeed, that is provided for to a significant extent in Clause 10(2)(c), which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, wishes to amend.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para1"></a>Nothing in the Bill as it stands prevents the NDA from acting in such a way. It is clearly the intention that it would, and it would be a corporate responsibility on the NDA to take account of the effect of its decisions and the manner of its decommissioning, for example, on the surrounding work force and community. To elevate that to a duty of the same order as its main functions, which would be far greater than one would expect of any large employer, would be going substantially further.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para2"></a>Moreover, if we get into an area to which my noble friend Lord Christopher, in particular, referred&#151;placing responsibility on the NDA for regeneration of those sites&#151;we move away from the focus of NDA activity. To a large extent, where a large employer, including a nuclear employer, cuts back on <P>


<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employment opportunities in an area, under our general regional policy we would expect the regional development agencies in England to take responsibility for regeneration, not a functional organisation such as the NDA. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to duplicate by giving the NDA a statutory responsibility for socio-economic regeneration. The NDA will have a function, under Clause 7(1)(e), and powers, under Clause 10(2)(c), to encourage and support economic regeneration. We would expect it to work with local authorities and others in delivering that regeneration, as has been the case with existing nuclear authorities.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para3"></a>The Government announced in December that we are setting up a strategic task force charged with developing a sustainable vision and plan for the economic and social regeneration of west Cumbria. That will be a collaboration between central Government, local authorities, the private sector and the social sector, involving BNFL and other large companies in the area, but it will be led by the North West Development Agency. That is the appropriate way forward for socio-economic regeneration. The NDA has a function and power, but it would be a step too far to impose what is suggested as an equivalent duty.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para4"></a>By Amendment No. 32, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, suggests that we extend Clause 10(2)(c) to include environmental projects. She suggested that there were inadequate powers, functions and duties regarding the environmental aspects of the site. The NDA's duties on site clean-up cover all necessary environmental remediation on those sites and any others on which it has an effect. Those duties are clear and therefore always apply. Slipping "environmental" into this clause would make the duty much wider, and would go beyond the direct and indirect consequences of the NDA's own activity and that of its predecessor organisations on the site.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para5"></a>Nevertheless, there is perhaps an argument for considering the amendment in the context of environmental schemes, such as the school referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Involvement in providing clean water away from the site would not necessarily fall under the clean-up and environmental duties related to the site. Nevertheless, the NDA may wish to make a grant or a contribution in kind to delivering such an outcome. The word "environmental" may need to be included, although obviously the example given would be covered by "social" and probably "economic" life. I am therefore unsure whether the exclusion is particularly evident.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. The water example is particularly interesting. So long as water suppliers operated under the local authority and were part of the public sector, nobody knew anything about the underground pollution that had apparently existed for many years. As soon as a private sector water undertaker took over and recognised that it would be responsible for delivering clean water supplies, it carried out a number <P>


<a name="column_GC270"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of test drills on the site and discovered the considerable pollution that had lain undisturbed for many years. It had been added to, as industrial processors had simply been dumping waste, which percolated through the chalk and entered the groundwater.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para6"></a>That is an interesting case, as exactly the same thing happened with the nuclear industry. Not until it faced the prospect of privatisation did the question of the liabilities for clean-up and so on come to the fore. That is why, originally, nuclear power stations were withdrawn from the electricity privatisation arrangements. It is when the private sector recognises that it is facing liabilities that the work is done; that is, the necessary numbers are discovered so that it is possible to embark on the clean-up. That is an interesting thought and I shall leave it with the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I shall treat it as an interesting thought. The NDA would be responsible for any historic or current pollution deriving from activity on the site for which it was responsible. That would apply in the public sector and would not necessarily require any change of ownership for the body to have to face up to the liability.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para7"></a>Amendment No. 32 asks whether, in addition to the environmental liabilities and consequences both on and deriving from the site, the NDA should be able to engage in environmental schemes more widely throughout the community, as well as whether they are covered by the term "social" in this context. I should like to take that point away for further consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who participated in this short and interesting debate and I am pleased that it will be put on the record. In particular I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, that we have some very good examples of what has been done, although problems have arisen and continue to arise in certain areas. It is important that responsibility is accepted for those problems and efforts made to resolve them.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para8"></a>I am not certain whether I could fully allay the fears expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, if we had the offer of a rebuild on an existing site. But I do not think that such a proposal is current and so I shall make no further comment on it.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para9"></a>I take the major points made by the Minister about the difficulty of seeming to impose a full duty on the NDA in the way provided for in the amendment. In the light of that, I shall consider carefully what has been said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-35_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: In a few moments I shall address Amendment No. 29. My noble friend Lord  Jenkin of Roding will cover the other amendments in the grouping. While we are still discussing the future course of this Bill, I want to raise with the Minister a very important issue. I shall do so now because this is my first opportunity to speak today. I hope that he will treat my remarks with the utmost seriousness, as I believe they could involve an issue of parliamentary privilege.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para14"></a>On a number of occasions when I and colleagues on this side of the Committee have been seeking information from operators within the industry, we have encountered what I can only describe as&#151;if not exactly a climate of fear&#151;certainly an atmosphere of anxiety. We have been told that if information is provided to us, then those organisations providing such information fear that they could face serious adverse consequences from a government department. I presume that they were referring to the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para15"></a>That is astonishing and I should say to members of the Committee that I have no intention of mentioning any names. However, it is correct that I should tell the Committee that three companies have spoken to us within the past few days. That is a serious matter.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para16"></a>I have dealt with many Bills and with many Ministers&#151;although I have never had the pleasure of dealing with this Minister&#151;and I have never encountered such problems. It certainly would be a breach of privilege if any signal had been given to any organisation by any civil servant, special adviser or Minister that a public body should not be open with a Member of the House on an issue that is not commercially sensitive. That we would understand.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para17"></a>Can the Minister make a clear statement on the record that neither he nor any department has discouraged or will discourage any public sector firm or body from assisting or briefing Members of the House on the Bill? Can he confirm on the record that neither he nor any member of his department has asked for any reports on private briefings given by the industry to Members of the House? Can he also give a clear statement on the record that he encourages the fullest co-operation with opposition parties? After all, the issue of the future of the nuclear industry will span many decades. It is certainly not the private possession of whichever government is in power.
<P>

<a name="40120-35_para18"></a>I have been extremely disturbed by suggestions that people have been leant on not to brief opposition spokesmen fully. If that were the case, it would most definitely be a breach of privilege. I hope that the Minister can provide an unequivocal assurance on that point.

<P>

<a name="40120-35_para19"></a>I have dealt with six if not seven Bills opposite the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and we have always experienced very good relationships in the past with whomever has briefed us&#151;often they have briefed the Government and ourselves. That is not a problem. I do not know why the issue has arisen on this Bill, but it needs sorting out before we consider the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Before the Minister responds to the question, I very much endorse what has been said by my noble friend Lady Byford. We should quickly clear up the matter because, after all, the amendments relate to confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para0"></a>I have certainly experienced it. There are one or two issues that we shall put forward in Grand Committee on the Bill&#151;the amendments are already on the Order Paper&#151;in respect of which I have felt it necessary to agree, with some reluctance, to a request that the source of the amendment should, in no circumstances, be disclosed. It was a public body. We were invited to visit Harwell by the senior manager of the decommissioning unit. At the "Energy Choices" conference, he asked whether it would help if he showed us some of the decommissioning work that the UKAEA had carried out. His head of communications wrote the next day to follow up that arrangement, and we went there last Friday.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para1"></a>In the midst of all the splendid information that we were given&#151;I hope that I gave the Committee a flavour of it a few minutes ago&#151;we detected more than a hint that perhaps people there were telling us things which their political masters would not be best pleased about. I find that horrifying. I believe that it stems from the culture of control that emanates right from the top. Like my noble friend Lady Miller, I have taken part as a Minister and as an opposition spokesman in a large number of Bills. I have never come across anything like that.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para2"></a>We have received briefs from some of the public sector companies. Is that frowned on? The Minister needs to give a firm reassurance to the Committee and to those outside who have expressed such apprehensions that this not a part of the Government's policy and that any attempt to lean on the directors and managers of such companies will be firmly resisted and will not be allowed to happen. Otherwise, I can see that we may get ourselves into considerable difficulties. Perhaps the Minister would like to respond to that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I find this somewhat difficult because, although a number of accusations have been made, they have necessarily been made in general terms. I understand why noble Lords feel the need to protect their sources. I am certainly not aware of any instruction from my department or the Department of Trade and Industry to prevent the normal courtesies <P>


<a name="column_GC273"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and information being provided to all Members of the House from whatever party. It is possible that, as with many other Bills, where we have known there has been briefing coming from organisations public and private we have asked to see such briefings. So, as regards that part of the noble Baroness's remarks, that kind of situation could have occurred and might have been misunderstood by those who provide such briefings.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para3"></a>It is difficult to know whether there is any substance in the fears that people have obviously expressed to noble Lords. A part of the nuclear industry has been subject to such fears in the past, and there is concern in elements of the nuclear industry about the way in which the Government are dealing with the role of nuclear power in the future. This has led to some people being prepared to believe anything of Ministers. But, as I say, I would be astounded if any instructions were to go from any of my colleagues&#151;or, indeed, from our senior civil servants&#151;to prevent the normal courtesies being afforded to Members of the House.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para4"></a>I shall obviously make inquiries on the basis of what noble Lords have said today. If any noble Lord wishes to speak to me privately, I shall be happy to do so to see whether we can throw any further light on the situation. That is probably all that I can say at this point. If necessary, I shall come back to the Committee at a later stage to report on what, if anything, I have found out about what lies behind the accusations. I hope that we can leave the matter there for the moment.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para5"></a>I recognise the seriousness of the concerns expressed by noble Lords and agree that they need to be looked into. Even in an industry where a great deal is confidential and secret, people need to be reassured that there will be openness with parliamentarians. My colleagues and I certainly accept that principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for that answer. I apologise to him that the issue arose only two or three minutes before I came into the Committee, otherwise I would most definitely have given him notice of it.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para6"></a>The Minister said that, if necessary, he would come back and report to the Committee. I believe that that will be necessary on the points I have made, which he can read in Hansard tomorrow. We want it on the record that such things should not be happening; that they will not happen again; and that, to the best of the Minister's knowledge, they have not happened in the past. That is important.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para7"></a>I should like to speak now to Amendment No. 29. The amendment would add two essential paragraphs to Clause 9, which relates to the general duties of the NDA when carrying out its statutory functions. Although the amendments to the NDA's duties are essential, they are not in any way onerous. Indeed, they cover the way in which we would expect the NDA and any responsible public body to act without being told. That, however, is not a reason why the issue should not be spelled out in unambiguous terms in the Bill, which is after all the constitutional charter of the NDA.
<P>


<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para8"></a>There are two short additional paragraphs which are, as I am sure that Members of the Committee will see, entirely self-explanatory. In the first, the NDA, which is being given very wide powers over nuclear sites, is forbidden to give directions which make the site operator fall between two stools. That is an important issue to which we will want to return in more detail. On the one hand, we are talking about disobeying a legitimate requirement of the NDA, and on the other about breaching the terms of the licence.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para9"></a>In that context, I would like to draw the Committee's attention to a provision similar to the amendment, which is to be found in Clause 18(7). It reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A direction under this section cannot authorise a contravention in relation to an installation, site or facility of any obligation to which the person with control of it is subject by or under an enactment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para10"></a>In other words, the NDA is forbidden to give a direction that contravenes a statute or a statutory order. My amendment deals with directions given by the NDA which do not contravene an actual statute, but which contravene a licence given by the Secretary of State. In the interests of consistency, the same regime should apply in both circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para11"></a>I propose my second new subsection to the clause because many companies&#151;BNFL is one&#151;are engaged in trading activities relating to the nuclear industry. They are all concerned about the commercially sensitive and confidential information that the NDA might legitimately demand of them. As my noble friend pointed out, the group of amendments is to do with confidentiality. Those trading companies are entitled to expect that commercially confidential information should be kept confidential. Having been forced to impart information that they would normally keep under the tightest of security, they do not want to find it published in some report or handout of the NDA, passed on to a competitor in response to some query, or even&#151;I agree that it is far less likely&#151;blurted out in a moment of indiscretion.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para12"></a>On more than one occasion, I have been refused a detailed answer to some legitimate question by Ministers, although not this Minister, on the grounds that the information that I sought was commercially confidential and sensitive. I do not complain about that, nor do I suggest that the Ministers concerned are in any way being evasive. However, it is required that the NDA understands right from the outset of its existence that the same high standard of confidentiality is required of it. It must understand that with its power to demand information to enable it to carry out its statutory duties comes the duty of respecting the property rights of those being interrogated and questioned. By that, I mean their rights to their own commercial secrets. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   We are discussing a large number of other amendments with Amendment No. 29, and they are all concerned with the issue of confidential information. We had what proved an interesting debate on the subject on Thursday in relation to certain matters that came up earlier in the <P>


<a name="column_GC275"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. As I said at the time, we found the Minister facing two ways. In one way, he sought, no doubt from perfectly honourable motives, to promote transparency in the matter. At the same time, however&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I am tempted to echo the Mayor of London in his first speech after being elected. He started by saying, "As I was so rudely interrupted", which I thought was a good start. I was not rudely interrupted; I was interrupted under the Standing Orders.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para14"></a>We return to the same issue that we debated last Thursday; namely, the apparent conflict between what is in the Bill, which provides protection only for matters of national security, and the Freedom of Information Act. It will come into force next year and, in addition to national security, it allows for commercial confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para15"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, will recognise that perhaps Thursday's debate was not his finest hour. He said a number of things from which I take some encouragement. He stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would be verging on the excessively optimistic, if I thought that this was the last that we would hear of the argument in the context of this Bill".&#151;[Official Report, 15/01/04; col. GC 177.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para16"></a>Perhaps he did not recognise that the argument would arise again the following Tuesday. Later, he stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The whole point of the Committee stage is for us to think seriously about such representations".&#151;[Official Report, 15/01/04; col. GC 179.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para17"></a>I shall say no more on that aspect. I hope that the Government are thinking seriously about the matter. It is not only Members on this side of the Committee, but others who have studied the debate, who felt that the Government's position was untenable. It is perfectly clear that the NDA and contractors must have the same action as will be open to them when the Freedom of Information Act comes into force. I do not intend to take that point further.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para18"></a>This group of amendments refers to a number of functions of the NDA that arise later in the Bill. It will not have escaped the Minister's attention that many of the amendments are in virtually identical form. They have been tabled because they refer to different aspects of the NDA's activities, but exactly the same considerations of confidentiality apply.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para19"></a>I shall refer in a few moments to Amendment No 36, which deals with Schedule 2. What I shall say on that amendment will apply equally to the others. Amendments Nos. 36 to 38 refer to the NDA's strategy reports and documents; Amendments Nos. 48 to 50 refer to the NDA's annual plan; Amendment No. 54 <P>


<a name="column_GC276"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>refers to the annual report; and Amendments Nos. 59 to 61 refer to directions given by the NDA to contractors. The same considerations apply to all.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para20"></a>I draw the Committee's attention to Amendment No. 36. I shall not read it all because noble Lords will have it in front of them. New paragraph 5A(1) forbids the disclosure of information,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"otherwise than under an enactment"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para21"></a>if there were a statutory authority, that would override it&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"[that] would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by any person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para22"></a>Then it requires that the NDA,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall consider whether the disclosure of the information is strictly necessary in order to fulfil such requirements and shall not disclose the information unless it is strictly necessary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para23"></a>Secondly, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the NDA shall not disclose the information unless or until the person to whom it is to be disclosed has agreed to be bound by confidentiality obligations in substantially the same terms as those which are binding on the NDA".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para24"></a>That is the requirement that there should be no disclosure unless it is strictly necessary and that the person to whom it is to be disclosed should be bound by the same obligations.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para25"></a>Amendment No. 37 refers to anything,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the publication of which would . . . constitute a breach of confidence actionable by any person and anything".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para26"></a>Amendment No. 38 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The NDA may exclude from what it publishes under this paragraph anything which constitutes a trade secret or the publication of which would be prejudicial to the commercial interests of any person".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-36_para27"></a>The requirements set out in Amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 38 are substantially the same as those in the other amendments in the group. I need not weary the Committee by going through them seriatim. I do not think that the Committee would approve of that.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para28"></a>The issue is the same: there are matters of commercial confidentiality which it would be highly undesirable to breach and for the information to become public. The amendments set out the conditions that the NDA must fulfil.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para29"></a>There are several aspects to this. On Thursday, we considered whether contractors would be willing to bid for contracts if they thought that their commercial information and trade secrets would become public knowledge. There was also the question of whether individuals would be damaged if information that did not need to be published was published.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para30"></a>There are two aspects that I would like to add to that. I start with an apology to the Committee. It has recently come to our attention that there will be considerable problems between the NDA and the various regulators that will operate in this field&#151;for instance, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive, and various other nuclear bodies with regulatory functions. It has been drawn to my attention that there should be some provision in the Bill to regularise that aspect and to <P>


<a name="column_GC277"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make it clear that the addition of a new body in the form of the NDA will not merely add yet another layer of control, regulation and interference.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para31"></a>As we have said repeatedly, we support the creation of the NDA and the thrust of Part 1 of the Bill, but there are problems. We will probably have to return to them on Report as it was only comparatively recently that they were drawn to our attention.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para32"></a>There is one other matter on which I invite Ministers to comment. It is widely recognised that Ministers have been taking advice from experts in commercial firms and consultancies around the world. Much wisdom is to be gained in the field of decommissioning, not least from the United States of America, along with other countries. I assume that the NDA, with a comparatively small staff of only 200, will also want to rely substantially on consultancy advice from a variety of experts.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para33"></a>It has been pointed out that there would be a considerable conflict of interest if a firm were to provide advice to the DTI or to the NDA&#151;and in doing so be privy to much of the information that flows into those bodies&#151;and then to challenge existing operators for a new contract. It would be difficult for it to sit on both sides of the table.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para34"></a>Is there a case for Chinese walls within those firms? They are firms with international reputations. The answer one hears is: "Well, we could have a Chinese wall, but nobody would trust it". One cannot expect a large firm with substantial interests around the world somehow to maintain a clear dividing line between those privy to the information from the Government or the NDA and those who are not, with only the latter entitled to go into contract. Nobody would trust such a system and it is clearly not the answer.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para35"></a>I do not know the answer; I know only that there is a problem&#151;one that the Government need to address. Perhaps safeguards cannot be written into the Bill. I have looked at how that might be done. It is difficult to see how one could do it without imposing unreasonable restrictions on the Government or the NDA in seeking outside advice. An arrangement has to be made for those who are privy to important, secret, commercial information about an operator which is known both by the NDA and the Government. It is right that such information should be made available to the advisers. Otherwise, how can they offer advice? However, there is a danger that those same advisers and the firms that employ them can then use the information to gain an unfair competitive advantage.
<P>

<a name="40120-36_para36"></a>I am sure that the Minister's department has been made aware of this anxiety and knows all about it. The amendments raise the whole question of commercial confidentiality. I have referred to two areas in which it may be necessary; namely, the interaction of the various regulatory bodies and the position of competing contractors, some of whom have an inside <P>


<a name="column_GC278"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>track. I hope the Minister will recognise that those are serious matters which should be addressed before the Bill reaches the statute book.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I shall start on a note of agreement. They certainly are serious matters. When I foretold last week that we would not progress far with the Bill before the issue of confidentiality re-emerged, I had not anticipated it being quite so soon. The noble Lord chided me then that it had not been my finest hour. We are granted only one hour that is our finest. Therefore, I am sure that he will not mind if I again descend into the mundane today. I assure the Committee that I may well speak for an hour because I want to respond to a substantial number of points. The issues under discussion are essential to the satisfactory work and operation of the NDA once the Bill becomes law.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para0"></a>Let me start by addressing the issue of regulatory compliance, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, raised. I want to reassure her that the regulatory requirements under a licence are statutory obligations that flow from the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. I do not think, therefore, that her anxiety in this respect is well founded. The statutory obligations already in place mean that the requirements will be the same as anything prescribed in statute. I hope that the noble Baroness will be assured that we are watertight on the clarity of the obligations being laid on those concerned with regulation.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para1"></a>The Bill does not change the regulatory regime applying to nuclear sites designated to the NDA. Site licensees or persons with control&#151;to use the parlance of the Bill&#151;remain bound by regulations that derive from existing legislation. That includes all the regulatory obligations set out in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and the Pollution, Prevention and Control Regulations 2000, as amended, or made under Section 2 of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999. All these are recognised statutes, and the obligations flow from them.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para2"></a>I can give the noble Baroness a further clear assurance: the NDA cannot require a person with control to contravene such obligations. A direction from the NDA that purported to authorise a contravention of a licence condition or other regulatory obligations would be unlawful. Persons with control of a site could not be obliged to comply with an unlawful direction. The essence of the arrangements set out in this Bill is that the regulatory framework, with all its obligations and enforcement mechanisms, remains quite unchanged. However, it is not good practice to include provisions for that in legislation, since we have all the relevant statutory duties in place.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para3"></a>We recognise the importance of this issue, and I appreciate the terms in which the noble Baroness sought to express her concerns. Effective working relationships between the regulators, the NDA and the site licensees and contractors&#151;the "golden triangle" of decommissioning and clean-up activities&#151;lie at the heart of the new arrangements provided in the Bill. We <P>


<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have devoted considerable efforts to ensuring that regulators are comfortable with what we propose. A draft memorandum of understanding between the regulators and the NDA has already been agreed. Regulators will need to finalise the details with the NDA once it has been established. Regulators will be key contributors to the development of the NDA's strategy and annual plans, and the site remediation plans to be produced by site licensees.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para4"></a>Regulators will work with the NDA to assist persons with control to produce work plans for the sites that are consistent both with the strategy of the NDA and the regulatory imperatives. Nothing will compromise the independence of the regulators to rule on appropriate safety, security or environmental standards.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para5"></a>We believe, therefore, in relation to concern that persons with control or contracts might be caught in the middle of the NDA and the regulator, as I think that the noble Baroness suggested, that it is quite clear that such anxieties are ill founded. The duties of a site licensee in respect of regulatory compliance in Clause 17(2) place a negative duty on persons with control to ensure that, in discharging their responsibilities to the NDA, there is no contravention of other statutory obligations, including regulatory ones.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para6"></a>That is as far as we can properly go to spell out what continues to apply as a matter of good regulatory practice. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that she does not need to press Amendment No. 29.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para7"></a>I shall turn to the other substantial issue, that of commercial confidentiality, which relates to the proposed new paragraph (f) in Amendment No. 29 and to some other amendments, including those to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, spoke at some length. We considered the protection of commercially sensitive information in outline at our previous sitting. I am pleased that I have the opportunity to advance the Government's case a little further. Although I made the position as clear as I could last week, I recognise that I did not obtain universal satisfaction throughout the Committee, and I accept the fact that the amendments reflect that anxiety. I shall therefore take them as probing amendments that give me the opportunity to give all the reassurances that Opposition Peers want on the matters today.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para8"></a>First, I shall set out the Government's broad approach to the question, which we discussed to an extent last week. The Government are of course committed to the NDA being a champion of openness and transparency. The White Paper, Managing the Nuclear Legacy, stated that the ability of the NDA to command public confidence was to be a measure of its success as much as its operational performance and cost-effectiveness. Public accountability through open and transparent operation will be absolutely fundamental to the NDA's success. We will set specific objectives for the NDA in that respect in, for example, the context of providing information to the public, and to local stakeholders in particular. We have been <P>


<a name="column_GC280"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developing a stakeholder engagement framework with that in mind, which we expect the NDA to take on and to develop once it is established.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para9"></a>That effort has been a central part of carrying all stakeholders&#151;employees, local communities, unions and environmental groups&#151;with us. Excessive secrecy is seen as one of the failings of the nuclear industry in the past. It is something that we must change if the NDA is to command public confidence.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para10"></a>Secondly, the NDA is the body responsible for securing safe, secure and cost-effective clean-up. It must have access to and be able to take decisions on the disclosure of information that it considers necessary to carry out its statutory functions effectively. In that regard, BNFL and the UKAEA as existing site licensees become vehicles for the NDA to achieve its objectives. They will operate their sites for the sole purpose of meeting the NDA's objectives.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para11"></a>Under Clause 17(2), the person with control of a designated installation, site or facility can use it and any interests or rights in it&#151;under subsection (8), that includes a process, information or document&#151;only in order to discharge the NDA's responsibilities. It is very important to keep the nature of the relationship between the NDA and its site licensees, and the fact that the only party with an interest in the information is the NDA, firmly in mind.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para12"></a>Thirdly, the NDA's relationship with its contractors will, of course, be governed by contract. Notwithstanding the powers of direction in the Bill, which provide the necessary framework for the NDA to exercise its powers in the absence of a contract, our intention is that the NDA will secure clean-up through contractual arrangements for the management of the site licensee companies. Many of the powers of direction fall away with the existence of a contract. It is for the NDA and the contractors to make provision for confidentiality in their contract. It is not the intention, nor is it desirable, that the Government should legislate on the content of contracts. Should there be such provisions, the NDA, as any party to such a contract, will be bound by them. With those factors in mind it becomes easier to see the limits of the legitimate commercial interests of the different players and the appropriate treatment of commercially sensitive information in a particular case. The NDA will have access to information on the contractors on the basis of the contract drawn up.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para13"></a>I shall respond to the areas covered by the amendments in turn. I apologise for the length of my speech, but it goes to the heart of some of the most substantial issues in the Bill, which have already caused considerable concern earlier today and during last week's sitting.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para14"></a>Proposed paragraph (f) in Amendment No. 29 provides for a general duty on the NDA to maintain the commercial confidentiality of BNFL, the UKAEA and contractors. As will have been clear from the general principles that I have just adumbrated, the NDA's approach to protecting commercially sensitive information in respect of its management and operations contractors will be governed by contract. <P>


<a name="column_GC281"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In respect of BNFL and the UKAEA as site licensees, the NDA has a principal interest in the operation of the designated sites and any related information. It is appropriate, therefore, that the NDA should be free to decide what information in that area it should disclose. As the beneficiary of commercial activity at its designated sites, the NDA will have a direct interest in ensuring appropriate protection of sensitive commercial information. But it must be free to decide what needs to be made available to potential contractors so that it can facilitate effective competition for contracts to manage site-licensee companies. That point was at the heart of discussions last week, and I hope that I have clarified it today.
<P>

<a name="40120-37_para15"></a>The site-licensee companies will not be market players in the sense that their role is not subject to competition. The Government's view is that the current work force and, in some shape or form, the companies for which they work will remain in place for the duration of the clean-up programme to ensure continuity and provide regulatory assurance. Consequently, and given what I have already said about open and transparent operation providing a basis for public confidence in the NDA, the Government do not consider general provisions on protecting commercial information either necessary or helpful.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   Before the Minister departs from that point, will he clarify what he means by saying that site licensees are not subject to competition? As I understand it, under the arrangements they are appointed for a time-limited period that appears to be quite short. The agencies that are so contracted must regard themselves as subject to subsequent competition for subsequent contracts. That could press down heavily on operators.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   For the time being, the site licensees will fit within the rubric that I identified&#151;in a separate category from other contractors. That is how they would fit into the pattern regarding the confidentiality of the information that they would possess. They will be in a special relationship with the NDA; therefore, the NDA is bound to be the arbiter of any information that is put into the public domain.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, discussed Amendments Nos. 36 to 38 on the NDA's strategy, and Amendments Nos. 48 to 50 on the NDA's annual plan. He also dealt with Amendment No. 54 on the NDA's annual report, which would require it to secure the agreement of third parties before disclosing information that would constitute an actionable breach of confidence, and to abjure from disclosing trade secrets and information whose disclosure would be prejudicial to the commercial interests of a third party. The only parties in those circumstances will be NDA contractors and site licensees. As I sought to describe, they are in a relationship with the NDA covered by the principle regarding the nature of the information that will necessarily be made available.
<P>


<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para1"></a>For the former, I reiterate that the protection of commercially confidential information will be governed by contract. The contractor, like any other person, will have recourse to the usual legal sanctions to enforce such a contract. The NDA will be bound by the contract with site licensees, because their sole purpose will be to operate their sites to facilitate the discharge of the NDA's functions. To reiterate the point to the noble Lord, there is no distinction between the site licensees' interests and those of the NDA. It is therefore surely right that the NDA should decide what it needs to disclose in its relationships with them in pursuit of its overall objective of public accountability.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para2"></a>On Amendments Nos. 59 and 60, which focus on NDA directions to the person with control to disclose information to the NDA, I have already explained the nature of the NDA's relationships with its site licensees. Their interests are identical. To the extent that a site licensee is exposed to claims for breach of confidence, the NDA, which stands behind the site licensees, will be exposed to the financial consequences of a breach of confidence that it has sanctioned.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para3"></a>In the normal operation of the NDA, it will be natural&#151;indeed, essential&#151;for the NDA and site licensees to work closely together. They can be expected to have a common interest in appropriate protection of commercially sensitive information. It bears repetition that the NDA has responsibility for ensuring effective clean-up and encouraging effective competition for site management contracts. It therefore must have power to make decisions about what information concerning the operation of facilities at sites needs to be made available to potential contractors.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para4"></a>I apologise for the length of my response, but all sides of the Committee regard the amendments as important. I bear in mind that this may not be our last discussion of these issues, but I am doing my best to guide the Committee, so that we focus on the points of real disagreement between us.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para5"></a>Amendment No. 61 refers to protecting commercially sensitive information in respect of designation directions for related sites. That was mentioned during our previous sitting. Directions for designated sites will set out what is being designated. They will be a factual description of for what the NDA is being given responsibility. It is important that the NDA and the person with control of the site are clear about the precise extent of the NDA's responsibilities, which must be made public. The only justifiable exclusion for identifying what is to be dealt with would be on grounds of national security. Anxiety has not been expressed in the Committee about the definitions that relate to information that is necessarily protected for reasons of national security. I therefore cannot understand what commercial interests could be involved, and ask that Amendment No. 61 is not pressed.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para6"></a>We take serious note of the Committee's concern about the question of commercial confidentiality. I hope that what I have said goes further than I managed <P>


<a name="column_GC283"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>last time in clarifying the issues and demonstrates why the Government have taken the stance that we have. There is no intention for the NDA to play fast and loose with commercially confidential information to which it has access. It has as much, if not more, at stake in the game than any of the other players&#151;especially site licensees. We are trying to allow the NDA to operate against the principles that we have adumbrated: as much openness and accountability as can be obtained while conducting itself with its contractors and site licensees in a way that guarantees that anxieties about commercial information are misplaced.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para7"></a>On that basis, and apologising once again for the length of my response, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before my noble friends respond, can the Minister first elaborate a little on his reply to Amendment No. 36? He made it clear that what is required in this Bill is the same as the statutory requirements set out in other Bills. I think that he quoted legislation from 1965, 1993, 1999 and the PP&C regulations issued in 2000. Can the Minister guide me on where to find such a reference, because I cannot find it?
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para8"></a>Secondly, if nothing is written down and it is simply to be accepted by assumption, would it not be sensible to accept Amendment No. 36? I say that because the Minister has not explained why he objects to it other than to say that he thinks that this appears somewhere else. He has not taken apart the wording proposed by my noble friends. Can the Minister direct me to the provisions in the present Bill which ensure that we do not need to worry about Amendment No. 36? If there are no such provisions, does he not agree that this would be an ideal opportunity to reinforce the point?
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para9"></a>As I have said many times when debating legislation with the Minister's colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to expect people in the outside world to refer back to legislation produced in 1965, 1993, 1999 and 2000 is perhaps rather silly. Would it not be more sensible to include an appropriate form of words? Even if he is not willing to accept the proposal of my noble friend&#151;whose words are rather good&#151;I hope that the Minister will accept that it would be more sensible to specify this point.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para10"></a>It should not be possible for the NDA to pass confidential information to any person and a form of words should make that clear. I would be grateful for further comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I shall address the second point put to me by the noble Baroness. We can certainly look at the question of clarification because we are always mindful of the concerns expressed about cross-referencing in legislation. However, the premise behind the Bill is that we do not have to include all the provisions set out in past Acts governing the regulatory operation of the NDA because they derive directly from such legislation. I recognise that the <P>


<a name="column_GC284"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness may consider that I cited a rather obsessive list&#151;it was quite a mouthful&#151;but she will see that we are not referring to Acts of Parliament which go back for aeons. The oldest Act referred to was passed in 1965 and I referred to only three Acts in total.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para11"></a>If the noble Baroness is not referring to an issue of principle here but rather addressing the effort of the amendment to make things clearer, then perhaps we shall be able to look at it. However, we seek to minimise cross-referencing in legislation and we have to balance the argument that including every reference to previous measures in new Bills means that the statutes grow too thick. If we were to include every cross reference in new legislation we would be padding out these documents even further.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para12"></a>The legislation relates to the sources of the regulatory obligations and puts them on a statutory basis. They go far wider than the responsibilities put on the NDA. I hope that the noble Baroness will recognise that we are seeking to define the regulatory obligations which relate to the NDA whereas the Acts of Parliament to which cross-references are made involve much wider provisions than those relating to that body. Therefore it would not be appropriate to include them in the framework of this Bill. I shall certainly consider whether it will be possible to meet the noble Baroness's point of clarification in other parts of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para13"></a>The noble Baroness will recognise the issue of principle that I am seeking to establish in this area. We are not creating anything afresh for the NDA with this legislation in terms of the nature of its obligations. That is why I was able to give an assurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in respect of Amendment No. 29.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Before my noble friend responds to the speech of the Minister on Amendment No. 29, perhaps I may offer one or two observations on what he said about the remaining amendments.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para14"></a>I was intrigued by his reference to the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. It was the first piece of legislation in which I played any part as a Member of Parliament&#151;then as now as an opposition Member. It was made perfectly clear that the Bill was on the stocks at the time of the election and the incoming government wisely decided to introduce it. That was quite a long time ago.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para15"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord but I get the impression that we are aiming at a moving target. On Thursday we were given a long description&#151;I shall not repeat it&#151;of the way in which the Freedom of Information Act would apply to publications by the NDA, and were told that people will have a commercial confidentiality defence available under the FIA.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para16"></a>The Minister has shifted his tack today. Over the weekend he has probably recognised that that was a rather difficult argument. If the FIA was going to give protection, why not say so in the Bill? He has now moved to the rather different view that this will all <P>


<a name="column_GC285"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>come under a contractual relationship between the NDA and the contractors, and that it will be for the parties to that agreement to decide how far commercial confidentiality should go in terms of the publication of the documents referred to&#151;the strategy document, the plan, the annual report and so on.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para17"></a>I shall study the Minister's words very carefully because it seems to me that he may be on stronger ground today than he was last Thursday. I find the idea that this matter could be properly dealt with within a contractual relationship rather more attractive than the suggestion that it could all be dealt with under the Freedom of Information Act. I shall consider the matter very carefully between now and Report.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para18"></a>I do not need any lessons on the value of transparency in this matter. I was, after all, a member of the Select Committee of the House which looked at the whole question of nuclear management and nuclear waste. One of our recommendations was very clear. In the summary of conclusions, at paragraph 8.8, we stated that openness and transparency in decision-making were necessary in order to gain public trust. We then went on to say that by themselves they are not enough, which of course I accept.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para19"></a>As I said at Second Reading, I totally welcome the commitment to transparency, but there clearly is a conflict as to how that will work in relation to what the Minister has recognised could be commercially sensitive information. He has suggested now that this could be dealt with by contract. I shall wish to consult on this with those advising us and to look carefully at what the Minister said. I was conscious of the fact that he was sticking closely to his brief on this issue, which obviously means that someone has given the matter a great deal of thought. I recognise the process. Clearly we cannot vote on the amendment now but I shall look very carefully at the issue.
<P>

<a name="40120-38_para20"></a>I had hoped that the Minister might say, "There are serious points here. Obviously the Opposition will wish to look at what I have said". It would have been jolly nice if he had clearly said that there were serious points at which we would want to look again before Report. If he had said that, we would have gone home happier, but he was very careful not to say it. Perhaps that was a mistake.

<A NAME="40120-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   The length of time that we have taken in explaining the amendments, and the large amount of time that the Minister took to reply, point to the very importance of what we were talking about. The Minister said that he was very glad that this was a question on which we had tabled probing amendments, so that he could probe when giving his answer. All amendments are probing amendments in Committee; we can do nothing other than probe and highlight issues, to ask Ministers what they think. When we get a long answer such as that given today&#151;it is a long time since I moved the amendment&#151;we need to look at it very carefully to ensure that we have understood exactly what has been said, as we think the matter important.

<a name="40120-39_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Minister, in summing up, said that he did not think that there were any concerns about the information that needed to be protected in the interests of national security. Perhaps the amendment is not so much about a concern as about probing&#151;I accept that probing is all that we can do. The point is minor, but I wanted something on record about what would happen in the event that the Secretary of State directed or notified the NDA that the information needed to be protected in the interests of national security. Therefore, it could not be in the public domain or discussed or seen by the public.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para4"></a>My amendment simply enables the Minister to tell us how the Secretary of State will be accountable. To what parliamentary body does he report, if any? I am thinking of the way in which the Intelligence and Security Committee keeps an eye on sensitive information coming out of the MoD. Where will any parliamentary input be made into such information? That is an important point. Although I can see the reason why some information will need to be protected in the interests of national security, I would not like to think that the decision about such information rests alone with the Secretary of State, without anyone else having input or oversight at all.

<A NAME="40120-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Baroness is better at asking questions than providing solutions to the problem. She will recognise that Parliament makes very particular arrangements for sensitive information relating to national security. Within the framework of the issues affecting the nuclear industry, I cannot see that we can be anything other than entirely secure and scrupulous.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para5"></a>Clause 9(7) sets out to protect national security by requiring the NDA to protect information which the Secretary of State considers to be sensitive and requiring protection in the interests of national security. Surely that is entirely appropriate and in keeping with government practice on how to handle sensitive information. Amendment No. 30, to which the noble Baroness has just spoken, proposes that under Clause 9(7) the Secretary of State should report to Parliament whenever the NDA is notified about sensitive, protected information.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para6"></a>Of course the Secretary of State will take advice before deciding to notify the NDA of information that should be protected in the interests of national security. We are addressing here the most fundamental interests of our society. While we want the NDA to <P>


<a name="column_GC287"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>operate with the utmost openness and transparency, we must have appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive nuclear information, which we all recognise could be used against us should it fall into the wrong hands.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para7"></a>Where national security considerations are involved, especially in the current climate, appropriate limits must be set on the disclosure of information. Clause 9(7) sets those limits to ensure that the NDA protects sensitive nuclear information,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-39_para8"></a>The Secretary of State has a fundamental obligation to fulfil that function in relation to the NDA. I do not see that the information could come within the framework of accountability, save through the arrangements established by Parliament for the supervision of national security.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Is the Minister saying that there would be an appropriate parliamentary committee for the Secretary of State to report to? The tone of his reply suggests that I am arguing against this information being protected. I do not argue the fact that some nuclear information needs to be protected. I believe that the Secretary of State for Defence reports to Parliament. Of course, I have no knowledge of exactly what he reports, not being a member of the committee, but I understand that sensitive information is overseen by a group of senior parliamentarians. I simply ask whether the same arrangements will apply here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Of course there are arrangements for dealing with extremely sensitive material in terms of parliamentary accountability, but they are very specific. If the noble Baroness has in mind a concept of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry carrying out that task, I am not sure that it would command wide assent either in this House or the other place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-39_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The Minister continues to misunderstand me. I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting a committee that meets in private along the lines of the one that keeps an eye on, for example, MI5 and MI6. That information is never put in the public domain, yet a parliamentary committee keeps an eye on it. That is what I am getting at.

<P>

<A NAME="40120-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Such a proposal is not within the purview of this legislation. When the Secretary of State decides that the NDA has obtained information which, should it become more widely available, could pose a threat to national security, then it could be considered in the parliamentary sense, but only through questions addressed by the very special body that is concerned with national security. At this point, however, we should not be proposing an additional framework to consider such important and sensitive information.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-39_para11"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMMERCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF NDA
<br>
(1) It shall be the duty of the NDA in carrying out its functions to have regard to each of the matters referred to in this section.
<br>
(2) The NDA shall use its best endeavours to maximise, or permit or encourage the maximisation of, the income of operating plants when within the NDA's responsibilities.
<br>
(3) The NDA shall provide advance justification to the Secretary of State for the closure of any operating plant (including the economic case for such closure).
<br>
(4) The NDA shall maintain decommissioned sites in a condition suitable for reuse, particularly for use for future nuclear purposes.
<br>
(5) The NDA shall provide reasonable encouragement and support for education, skills development and the maintenance of a national research and development capability in the field of generation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-39_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this amendment, as is obvious from the text, is to impose certain commercial obligations on the NDA. What has to be avoided in a hugely complex, very expensive and long-term operation is for the NDA to press on with its activities and policies without having regard to the financial implications for the nuclear generating industry and, no less important, for the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para13"></a>I suggest that the operative provisions of the new clause are almost self-explanatory and are mere matters of commercial common sense, as well as not being over-prescriptive or imposing unduly onerous obligations on the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para14"></a>Let me look at them one by one. Subsection (2) calls for the NDA to maximise the income of operating plants under its jurisdiction. I shall not enumerate the ways in which a plant might obtain extra income; suffice it to say that those which can currently do so. What has to be avoided is the NDA deciding, for one reason or another, that it no longer wants to be bothered.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para15"></a>Subsection (3) requires the NDA to be accountable to the Secretary of State in advance if for some reason it decides to close an operating plant, as indeed it surely will because that is what it is there for. The point is that, although there may be a good reason to close a particular plant within the terms of its remit, there may be factors outside its brief for not doing so or for not doing so at a particular time. Those factors include, for <P>


<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example, the lack of replacement sources of power, a matter which will cause the Government some problems in the not too distant future.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para16"></a>Subsection (4) calls on the NDA, as part of its duty in dealing with plants which it has successfully and completely decommissioned, to keep them in a condition for potential re-use, possibly for future nuclear purposes. What we do not want is derelict sites abandoned more or less for ever. That is not because the NDA will not leave them 100 per cent safe, of course; we are sure that it will do so.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin has already told members of the Committee that he and I visited Harwell last Friday. We saw a local site that has been cleaned up and now has a school right on its edge. UKAEA is justifiably proud of its achievement at Culcheth in Lancashire, the site of its former engineering metallurgy group. That site has been transformed into a much sought-after housing development. Noble Lords should bear in mind that it is now part of ordinary conveyancing procedure for solicitors to request an environmental report showing the use of sites and others in the vicinity. However, it is still the perception which counts, even when that perception is wholly misconceived.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para18"></a>Within the property company of which I am a director we thought long and hard before deciding to invest in a property that had been built on the site of a former petrol station. In those days, people looked askance at such developments and were not happy about them. Further, one only has to recall how long it was before something was found to do with contaminated land on the Isle of Dogs.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para19"></a>A particular and blindingly obvious possible use for old nuclear power station sites is to use them for building new nuclear power stations if, at some stage, that is what the Government want to do. At a stroke you avoid major planning problems, especially Nimbyism, and you can take advantage of the investment made in public relations by the previous operators. With the same stroke, you have a location which has clearly established itself for that particular purpose. Further, there may well be the residue of a skilled and trained workforce who were previously employed at the plant. Those workers may well have had problems finding new jobs. The local economy, which may have suffered as a result of the closure of the old plant, will be rejuvenated.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para20"></a>Having a ready made market for the site, which would remove the need to keep it secure and prevent it from becoming a derelict eyesore, is an example of how the NDA could maximise its income, as specified in proposed subsection (2).
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para21"></a>Proposed subsection (5) would require the NDA to provide encouragement and support for skills development in the field of generation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para22"></a>The achievements and proven track record of UKAEA, to which I have referred, are a case in point. British skills in all kinds of scientific and engineering endeavours have long been an invisible export. For example, British engineers built long stretches of <P>

Furthermore, it is bad enough that current government policies, or the lack of them, will make us entirely dependent on foreign suppliers for our fuel. Surely we do not wish also to be dependent on foreign countries for know-how on building, operating and closing down our nuclear power stations, if that is what the Government decide to do in the future.
<P>

<a name="40120-39_para23"></a>As I said, I do not believe that my amendment would impose an excessive burden on the NDA; nor, as a responsible public body, should it be unwilling to undertake that burden. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I welcome the opportunity provided by Amendment No. 31 to raise some important issues. It is important to gain clarity from the Government about their intentions for the sites currently managed by UKAEA in particular.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para0"></a>The UKAEA has a mandate to restore the Dounreay site to a greenfield condition. Admittedly, that will be some decades down the track, but concern has already been expressed&#151;not surprisingly&#151;that an operation that has sustained high levels of local employment since the mid-1950s and promises to continue to do so during the period of decommissioning should not be left to swing in the wind at the end of the process.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para1"></a>One is asking the Government, not to make detailed predictions about what kind of work might be appropriate in or near those sites, but to indicate the desirability of development either of the site, which will be owned and managed by the NDA after the Bill is enacted, or those proximate to it, which will work in close conjunction with the sites.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para2"></a>The amendment would impose a duty on the NDA to bear those issues in mind. That is a wholly sensible proposal. Proposed subsection (4) is particularly sensible. The position in a number of the authority's sites differs; for example, it is not the same at Harwell as it is at Dounreay. I hope that the narrowness of the definition of the NDA's responsibilities will never be used to impede an initiative by the NDA or one of its contractors to develop cognate work on or close to the site that could benefit the local economy.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para3"></a>A related issue is raised in proposed subsection (2) of Amendment No. 31. That would encourage the maximisation of the income of operating plants. It is clear that work is being done involving leading-edge technology, in which there is advantage in seeking to exploit Britain's position for commercial purposes, and perhaps even to offset some of the high costs involved in decommissioning by attracting new contractual work. I hope that that would fall squarely within the terms of the new agency, and that the Government would welcome such developments.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para4"></a>The proposal that the NDA should provide reasonable encouragement and support for education on decommissioning seems highly sensible, if its task is to be discharged without the hazard of having to rely on uncertain sources of such experience, drawn from outside our country. That seems prudent and might allow, for example, the development of suitable <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>industrial educational schemes and apprenticeships squarely within the remit of the NDA, in its interests and those of the country.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister will reply that none of those objectives is precluded and that all are possible within the Bill as drafted. It is certainly important that, if that is not the case, the Bill be strengthened in the ways proposed by the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   To some extent, we have come to the heart of the matter on the role of the NDA in the Bill. In some circumstances it may be highly beneficial to the NDA's core role for it to be able to carry out many of the activities touched on by Members of the Committee, including many of those referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. We want to give it such flexibility. However, it would be utterly wrong for us to give the NDA wide-ranging responsibilities for effectively ensuring the continuation of the nuclear option, and for engaging in matters that are not central to its core role of clean-up and decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para6"></a>At certain points, the Committee has broadly accepted that the Government's position is correct&#151;that the NDA is not the appropriate body to lead consideration for the future of nuclear power. Some Members of the Committee may believe that some other body should do that, but they do not really believe that the NDA's main role should be as the repository of nuclear strategy or the nuclear contribution to energy policy. Its central role is to become an effective expert in the decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear installations, sites and facilities, and to use that expertise in the most economic, efficient and safe way.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para7"></a>The amendment gives the NDA a range of new responsibilities of at least equal proportions. Proposed new subsection (5), for example, would impose on the NDA an obligation to support skills and research capability of nuclear power generation. I recognise that that is an important issue, and one to which a number of noble Lords referred both at Second Reading and in Committee. We will return to it this evening, I hope, and if not, certainly not far into our proceedings. The issue of nuclear R&D is important; however, it is not the NDA's responsibility to carry the burden of maintaining and enhancing nuclear research and skills over and above those necessary for its own purposes.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para8"></a>The Bill allows&#151;this touches on the noble Baroness's point&#151;the NDA to ensure that others could use the research facilities at its designated sites for whatever purpose, including the purpose of nuclear research. For example, Clause 10(2)(e) will enable researchers into the future of nuclear power to have access to the necessary facilities, and enable the NDA, in the course of decommissioning or clean-up, to ensure that that operates.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para9"></a>But, again, it is not an obligation on the NDA so to do. Proposed new subsection (4) in the amendment seeks to place another duty on the NDA to maintain <P>


<a name="column_GC292"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decommissioned sites with future nuclear purposes in mind. Clearly the NDA and government policy need to consider the possibility of there being future nuclear build at some point, but it should not be central to the role of the NDA to prejudge the end-point of every site it manages. Its job is to clean-up and decommission.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para10"></a>Clause 12(4) requires the NDA's strategy to set out its objectives in respect of the decommissioning and clean-up of different installations and sites, and the NDA itself will need to manage that in order that it meets what it considers to be its own appropriate end-point in the context of that decommissioning. That is then subject to ministerial endorsement through the Secretary of State's role in the approval process for the strategy. The Secretary of State can specifically require the NDA to modify its strategy in respect of the objectives it has set out for a particular site. But it is not part of the operation that the NDA shall be required to look at a specific future use of those sites.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para11"></a>The Government's policy on decommissioning is of course subject to a current process of consultation, which is due to end shortly. The Government's position on the policy for determining appropriate end-points will be clear in their response to that consultation and well before we establish the NDA and it is in full operation. It will provide a framework for the NDA's own consideration of end-points, but it will not provide a basis for the NDA itself to take those decisions.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para12"></a>Proposed new subsections (2) and (3) in the amendment would place a duty on the NDA to give commercial considerations relating to the operational facilities a great deal of significance&#151;too much significance in my view. The amendment implies that it should give as much significance to the commercial considerations in terms of maximising its income as it should to its decommissioning and clean-up responsibilities. That significance would be a misplaced focus. Clearly the NDA, in the course of running a site, will need to have an eye to commercial opportunities and making money out of a site and income derived from a site, but it is not appropriate that that should have the same level of significance as its role in relation to decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para13"></a>The implication of proposed new subsection (3), in particular, is that a decision by the NDA to close an operational facility should be subject to a different and higher test than decisions relating to other activities on the sites&#151;for example, whether or not a site could be kept open for future nuclear use.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para14"></a>The Bill already charges the NDA with ensuring that facilities at its sites are operated in a manner that it considers most beneficial to the public&#151;that is in Clause 9(3)&#151;and on this basis we would obviously expect the NDA to secure the operation of all facilities in such a way that maximises the net benefit of securing clean-up. As the NDA receives that financial benefit in any case&#151;which, through the operation of the Nuclear Decommissioning Funding Account, will contribute to future clean-up activity&#151;revenue generation clearly has to be one of its considerations. But it cannot be the determining factor in how it goes about decommissioning the sites.
<P>


<a name="column_GC293"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para15"></a>Continued operation of the facilities beyond what is beneficial to the NDA itself and beneficial to the clean-up and decommissioning programme could distort the issue and it should not be the NDA's responsibility to allow that degree of distortion. Clearly there are issues of minimising the cost to the taxpayer of the clean-up operation, and the Government will need to take on board the potential alternative use of a site, but that should not remove the focus from the NDA's core role.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para16"></a>We recognise that the NDA, in developing its expertise, will contribute to the Government's consideration of the future role of nuclear power generation. In that respect, it obviously has the beneficial side effect of developing this expertise in one place. As noble Lords have said, this will lead the NDA to take advice from world-wide experience on the issue. That will need to be taken into account and respected in terms of future decisions on the deployment or otherwise of nuclear power.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para17"></a>A central problem is that a number of noble Lords are trying to use the Bill and the NDA to provide a basis for the future development of nuclear power. We debated this at least once on the first day in Committee. There are two questions. There is the question of whether or not future energy policy will require nuclear power and, should the answer at some future point be yes, there is the question of how far the NDA should be the body responsible for delivering it.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para18"></a>Both those in favour of a bigger role for nuclear power and those against using the NDA as a vehicle for delivering nuclear power capacity and making some of the decisions on whether to facilitate the development of nuclear power are missing the point. Whatever the future role of nuclear power, we need to clear up the legacy of its past. That is the NDA's prime role. If the Government change their mind on new nuclear build, other institutions will come into play. The Government will deal with the strategy and ensure that it is taken into account so that the appropriate infrastructure is put in place, but that is not the same as the role of the NDA dealt with in this part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-40_para19"></a>The narrower point of alternative uses for a site will also be relevant to the NDA's activities but will not predispose a site for future nuclear use. The strategy, the annual work plan and so on will ensure that the NDA keeps under continued assessment the use of a site. We do not want the NDA to be seen as a body operating in a way that maximises the possibility of future nuclear build and which will itself become responsible for the provision of a base for that nuclear build. It is not a nuclear continuation authority; it is a decommissioning and clean-up authority. If we distort that distinction we will misinterpret this part of the Bill by using it to deal with somewhat wider issues on which there is clearly a difference of opinion. We will not resolve that difference by imposing extraneous and burdensome duties on the NDA in carrying out its central duty.

<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I feel somewhat challenged by the Minister's assertion that, in supporting the amendments, one might be seen as explicitly supporting the view that sites would be used <P>


<a name="column_GC294"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for a particular nuclear build project. It is well known that I am sceptical, at least, about the Government's view that it can meet the nation's energy needs by relying on the resources outlined in the energy White Paper. But that is no part of my argument in favour of these amendments, or at least what I understand lies behind them.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para0"></a>The nuclear decommissioning business is highly expensive and it is public money that is going into it. It is business which could be of immense value to the Government, the country and the taxpayer. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable to look for ways in which the return to the taxpayer can be maximised, a point which has not been sufficiently underlined in the language of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para1"></a>It is right for the Minister to focus on the prime obligation of the duty on the NDA&#151;decommissioning&#151;but it is possible to do that at the risk of overlooking the considerable ancillary benefits which could flow to the country from managing well this enormous, billion-pound business. I illustrate my concern that the Minister is downplaying this aspect by citing his treatment of new subsection (5). He referred to the encouragement of education, research and development capabilities in this field as an absolute responsibility to be placed on the NDA. However, that is not what is set out in the amendment; it talks about providing "reasonable encouragement", which is rather different from what the Minister sought to bat away.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para2"></a>If the Minister can say that such activities already lie within the powers of the authority, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to press the point. However, if he is saying that it is no business of the NDA to provide any resources or encouragement for skills development in the process, I must ask whose responsibility it is. Are we as a nation to be held to ransom as the result of a shortage of skills?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I certainly did not seek to imply that the NDA would have no responsibility for research and development. Clearly it will need to develop those resources to aid its own areas of activity. Further, I did not object to the first part of new subsection (5). "Reasonable encouragement" are rather unusual words to use in legislation, but one can hardly object to them.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para3"></a>However, the last part of the new subsection refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the maintenance of a national research and development capability in the field of generation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-41_para4"></a>That would place a requirement on the NDA to be responsible for creating a centre of excellence for everything concerned with both the decommissioning and generation roles of nuclear science. The implication here is that all that should be the responsibility of the NDA. Other bodies will continue to be involved in those activities&#151;most currently in the public sector. But if we opt for new nuclear build, we shall see substantial private sector responsibility for <P>


<a name="column_GC295"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those areas as well. The final words of new subsection (5) suggest that NDA should bear the burden of the total research effort. That is why I oppose it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention in so far it helps to clarify what is in the mind of the Government. I accept that a distinction must be made between the first and second parts of new subsection (5)&#151;the first covering the "reasonable encouragement" of skills, development and so forth and the maintenance of a national research capability. However, it is also arguable that the maintenance of a national research capability is a reasonable objective for this country if it is not to risk being held to ransom. If skills development activities are not undertaken, that must be regarded as a risk.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para5"></a>It may be that such skills shortages will not show up in the short term, but it is obvious that other companies, whose interests lie almost wholly overseas, where profits would be remitted, are circling around this lucrative business with a view to entry into the field&#151;if possible, in a monopolistic fashion. Those are not unreasonable concerns, although I am happy to accept that the drafting could be improved. Perhaps it would be desirable to return to the matter at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para6"></a>Although we must accept that the purpose of the agency is to deal with the issue of decommissioning, we should not be so short-termist in our espousal of that prime objective that we do not look down the road at the dangers that may arise for our national effort in this sphere if we do not maximise the opportunities for internationalising and selling our expertise elsewhere and providing for that kind of development.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para7"></a>That is the great advantage, in a sense, of being as far ahead of the game as we are. We are not unique, but we are quite far ahead of the game. I hope that something on the lines of the amendments, which I did not draft but with which I am in sympathy, will be thought suitable by the Government&#151;just as recognition of those ancillary responsibilities. They are not intended to cut down the prime duty or burden the authority; they are simply intended to allow the authority to embrace those subsidiary objectives as necessary and appropriate in doing its job properly in the longer term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   We all understand what the Government are trying to do and why they are limiting the application of the Bill, but we must not allow the opportunity to go by without taking advantage of the current situation, which will develop during the next few years, to build a bridge to the future. There is an opportunity to keep things going in the right direction&#151;to maintain people, thinking, research and everything else mentioned in the amendment. If the Government refuse to allow the NDA to do any of those things, they will miss a massive opportunity and we shall have to backtrack in future to do them.

<a name="40120-41_para8"></a>I am not being very clear, but we must be careful that the political strategy and practical matters on the ground do not conflict.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I have only two quick points to make, because other Members of the Committee have said what I wanted to, especially on skills. I recognise that the NDA's first priority is decommissioning and clearing up: on that the whole Committee is agreed.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para9"></a>I shall have to read Hansard carefully, but I think that the Minister said that proposals are out to consultation at present. If he could tell me exactly what they are consulting on, that would be immensely helpful. Can he tell me when that consultation will finish? He said that it would be shortly and before the NDA came into force. Will it be before the Motion that the Bill do now pass from our House, let alone anywhere else? I record this on every Bill, but it is unacceptable to have matters that will affect the Bill with which we are dealing now out to consultation, so that we do not know the outcome.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para10"></a>The Minister has realised that subsection (5) of my noble friend's new clause may need to be split off later, because national research and development may well need to go elsewhere. I should be grateful if he would answer my queries and pick up on our concern around the Committee&#151;although no one has spoken from the Labour Benches&#151;that we may well lose skills that are important to retain, if there is nowhere for them to be practised. Once decommissioning has happened, if there is no immediate nuclear build&#151;we are not saying that there should be&#151;skills may well be lost, as was well set out by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. I should certainly be grateful for an answer about the consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness is correct: she always complains about that. Policy issues are always subject to some degree of consultation; this consultation relates to decommissioning. It will be concluded by the end of March&#151;no, February. I should therefore expect the results of the consultation to be available before the Bill completes its course. However, the response to that consultation will form part of future directions to the NDA.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para11"></a>To repeat, the Committee is missing the point about research and, to some extent, skills. The NDA can under the Bill maintain skills, engage in research and pay other people to perform research into decommissioning, clean-up and related matters. But that is not the totality of the Government's commitment to research in the nuclear industry. Under the auspices of BNFL, we have the NSTS. At the end of 2002, we completed a review of the nuclear and technological skills needed. We have extended the sector skills council that covers chemicals and gas to include nuclear technology, so a new push will be delivered to skills. Some research will continue to be carried out in what is currently UKAEA, and there is still a substantial budget for nuclear research in universities.
<P>

<a name="40120-41_para12"></a>So it is not as if there is a huge gap in provision that must be loaded on to the NDA. The NDA's responsibility for research will lie in its particular area, <P>

<A NAME="40120-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   To pick up on some points raised earlier about the relationship between Ministers here and in Scotland, I should be surprised if the Scottish Parliament's attitude&#151;I obviously have no knowledge of its inner thinking&#151;towards the new development agency was not similar to that outlined in the amendment, especially on the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. I should imagine that Scottish Ministers will look to the new organisation to support just the sort of things advocated in Committee today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   First, I thank all Members of the Committee who supported the amendment. Each one made a valuable contribution, mostly making different points. My noble friend Lord Gray repeated that the amendment was reasonable.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para0"></a>I have some sympathy with the Minister, because he has to keep saying, "That is not the role of the NDA". At the end of our first sitting, I replied that it might well be that I had placed the responsibilities in the wrong place, but this is an Energy Bill. Most Members of the Committee fear that we will face an enormous loss of energy, one way or another, so we keep trying to find ways to make certain points. As I have told the Minister, I always try to help the Government if at all possible. The Government say clearly: "We are keeping the nuclear option open". Actually, we know not what that means, other than that they continue to say it. If that is a fact, when decommissioning takes place it would make sense to leave sites in a suitable condition to help the Government should they decide to keep open the nuclear option. Perhaps they never will, but the sites being decommissioned would be available if the Government ever wanted to activate that option.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para1"></a>In that context, I found interesting one of the sentences in the Minister's response to the amendment. What did he mean when he said, "Of course, if the Government change their mind on new nuclear build"? Did he mean, for example, changing their mind on keeping the option open? I found that sentence very convoluted and confusing. I shall read carefully what the Minister said and decide in due course what we might do in the future. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-42_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40120-42_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment, to which the noble Lords, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe and Lord Lea of Crondall, have attached their names, is an attempt to probe the Government's thinking on strategic planning and how the oversight of the decommissioning programme is to be handled in practice.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para9"></a>The schema set out in the Bill seems to vary from that in the Government's White Paper Managing the Nuclear Legacy&#151;A Strategy for Action. According to that paper, the Liabilities Management Agency (LMA) was to have operational freedom. But I find it difficult to understand how that was held to be manageable given the degree of oversight that the White Paper described in subsequent paragraphs. It stated that strategic control would be exercised through an annual meeting at which Ministers would review the LMA's strategies and annual work programmes, take stock of its performance and set new performance measurements for the year ahead. I do not know what is left for operational management if managers must be subject to such detailed hands-on control.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para10"></a>The new language of the Bill does not specify that degree of intervention. Clause 11(1)(b) states that it will be the duty of the NBA,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from time to time to revise that strategy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-42_para11"></a>
One must ask why that should be mandatory if the strategy in place is seen to be working. Clearly, that is not what the Government have in mind. Schedule 2 sets out the detailed review process to precede or accompany the drawing-up of strategies.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para12"></a>This is an invitation to the Minister to indicate the extent to which he envisages the Government being involved in this process. According to the Bill, the strategy must be drawn up at least once every five years, although, if circumstances change in certain ways, it is open to the agency to go about it again. It would be helpful at this early stage if we could have a clearer view of what the Government envisage.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para13"></a>On the whole, it seems desirable for non-departmental bodies not to be constantly pulling themselves up by the roots and looking at their objectives with a view to changing direction&#151;that is extraordinarily unsettling. Five years may be a perfectly reasonable period, but there seems to be an assumption, at least in Clause 11, that the strategy will not last and will have to be changed. What do the Government think? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   The amendment is very simple; it does not ask the Government much. Clause 11 is quite interesting. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It shall be the duty of the NDA".

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
If it is a duty, one must do it. Subsection (1)(b) states that, from time to time, the NDA must revise its strategy. Let us assume that the NDA, having drawn up a strategy, would like to contemplate whether it is necessary to revise it before doing so. I can see no harm in adding the simple phrase that it is the duty to "review and, if necessary" revise. It seems peculiar to place on the NDA a duty to revise, come what may.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I wish to point out in all friendliness to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, that Clause 11 is one of the clauses that later in the Bill the Government reserve the power to change by order. I therefore have a horrid feeling that it does not matter what we put in those clauses, because, subject to affirmative procedure, the Government can change them later. The words proposed by my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon are inoffensive and simply clarify.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Clearly, it is envisaged that the NDA strategy will cover the whole clean-up process. That will include what is happening on each site, the NDA's forward planning, research efforts, training and all the aspects that we have discussed on previous amendments. From time to time there must be an opportunity for the strategy to be reviewed, not only by Ministers, but by the NDA's stakeholders. We wish, therefore, to provide for a minimum five-year period for Ministers and stakeholders to be engaged in that process.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para15"></a>The amendment may involve a degree of semantics. Members with a classical education will know that "revise" simply means to look at again. We will look again with Ministers and stakeholders at whether changes are needed. In five years, given the rapidly moving energy climate and changing economic and environmental scenarios, it is extremely unlikely that the whole of any strategy will be absolutely right. It is therefore likely that some changes would be made. That does not imply a wholesale revision; it gives Ministers and others the opportunity to engage with the NDA in validating the strategy after five years. As is always the case, in a reasonably long-term strategy there will be more detail on the first five years than on latter years; for example, seven to 10 years ahead. As one moves through the process, one will probably want more detail. It is a racing bet that some changes would be required in the strategy, albeit that the broad brush is still considered correct. It does not seem unreasonable to build in a review and revision every five years.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para16"></a>In this area of energy policy, technological change, particular problems at particular sites that might lead on to more general conclusions would need to be reviewed. We should not limit this. We should have a review and a revision every five years, which is what the clause as printed would require.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. There is a semantic point here and I am sure that he is right, but it is none the less strong for that. It is noticeable that this <P>


<a name="column_GC300"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provides for a five-year review. although paragraph 4.22 of the White Paper spoke of strategic control being exercised through an annual meeting at which Ministers would review the strategies and annual work programmes of the LMA.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para17"></a>Does the Bill constitute a change of thinking? Is it really being suggested that the authority should be kept at a greater arm's length in its strategic oversight of the mission than was suggested in the White Paper? The White Paper clearly suggests that Ministers would be constantly involved in review and oversight, and in setting performance measures for the year ahead.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para18"></a>There is an issue here which is more than semantic. It is about the extent to which the Government want either to leave the authority to do its own thing&#151;subject to the requirement that within five years they will review and revise&#151;or whether they really want to review more frequently. Is that how they expect to operate? This is a probing amendment to divine whether the Government seek to take a hands-on or arm's-length approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Lord probably exaggerated the degree to which the White Paper and the LMA sought total hands-on ministerial activity. We envisaged annual discussions on the way things are going rather than hands-on control. I anticipate that there would be quite frequent discussions between the NDA and Ministers, but we would not want to build that into statute. The minimum statutory requirement is a five-year review. But Ministers will have to engage with the NDA more frequently than once every five years. Budgets are not set that far in advance. Hence, fairly close consultation will be required, probably at least on an annual basis.
<P>

<a name="40120-42_para19"></a>The statutory requirement on the strategy itself would be five years. It is not a huge change, but it is a change which means that statute bites only every five years. However, the NDA management will need to talk to Ministers more frequently than that.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-43_para9"></a>Generally speaking on consultation, particularly in relation to plans and strategies, what concerns people is not what goes on at the site, but the changes that will go on in future.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para10"></a>I am confident that I shall be told that my amendment is unnecessary. However, I wanted it to be quite explicit that the consultation was not confined to activities on the site, and that it had been specifically designed so that the public and all the people who needed to know what changes were to take place did so. Therefore, I thought that I would table the amendment to enable the Government to make explicit what I thought was the intention of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Lord anticipates my remarks. I was not entirely clear on the intention of the amendment but, if it is simply to make it clear that the consultative bodies set up by the NDA and the licensees would have to discuss a change in activities as well as activities ongoing, our view is that "activities" subsumes changes in activities, their delivery, the amount of money provided for them, who is employed in them, and so on. It is a fairly substantial requirement to consult about those activities, which clearly includes any change in them. Therefore, I would have thought the amendment unnecessary, but the noble Lord has my clarification on record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that brief reply, which makes the point that I wanted made. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40120-43_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: Our amendments in the group are in two sections. The first section is Amendments Nos. 39 to 41, which relate to the contractual regime under which the NDA will operate. Although the White Paper, Managing the Nuclear Legacy&#151;A Strategy for Action, envisaged benefits from competition, in practice achievement of other White Paper requirements on openness, transparency and high safety and environmental standards called for <P>


<a name="column_GC302"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>collaboration. Although we accept that competition is an objective, we are strongly of the view that it must not undermine the other key objectives in any way.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para17"></a>Furthermore, it is clear that setting site management agencies in competition with each other may not be conducive to the pre-exchange of information required in order to achieve synergy and sharing of lessons learned. Such collaboration needs to take place on the basis of equal access to knowledge. Long-term relationships will need to be created, with measures identified to foster innovation. Supporting that framework, it will be vital to fund generic research to underpin nuclear clean-up.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para18"></a>Lessons from previous experience&#151;clearly illustrated by the contrasting regimes at Dounreay and the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment&#151;show that key criteria include, first, minimising the number of organisational interfaces, in particular with regard to safety implications but also in regard to other regulatory dimensions such as planning; secondly, value for money considerations taking account of the benefits of wide-ranging expertise, allowing lessons learned in one area to be applied in subsequent projects with no additional costs; thirdly, requiring all contractors to have sufficient funds to deal with contingent liabilities arising from their work; fourthly, the principal contractor being able to demonstrate effective control over site operation at all times; and, fifthly, requiring all contractors to provide independent evidence of high technical and managerial quality.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para19"></a>All these requirements imply a more open, longer-term, iterative approach to contractorisation than is normally the case. The overall aim must be to facilitate a process that avoids fragmentation, supports bids of a high quality and encourages continued innovative participation. This is what we have in mind with Amendment No. 40, which calls for appropriate competition, although we accept that further work is needed to define the competitive framework more precisely. That is why Amendment No. 41 calls on the Secretary of State to provide guidelines to support this process. An appropriate next step would be to issue draft guidelines for consultation, as is currently being done in respect of the draft framework for stakeholder engagement.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para20"></a>We strongly support this approach although, as our second section of amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 42 and 43&#151;indicates, we think the current provisions need strengthening. There is, for example, nothing to stop the NDA ignoring completely any of the points that emerge as a result of the stakeholder dialogue. It is in no one's interests&#151;least of all in terms of building public confidence in the NDA&#151;to present a shop window with nothing at all behind it.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para21"></a>To deal with this we would like to see a mechanism whereby the outcomes of stakeholder meetings are put to the NDA board, which should then come up with a clear decision for or against taking action on particular proposals. This is not intended in any way to impede NDA decision-making and we fully recognise that decisions will need to be taken that do not always <P>


<a name="column_GC303"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>command universal support. However, if the Government are serious about stakeholder engagement, it is necessary to ensure that the loop is fully closed and that there is both transparency in decision-making and a clear channel for bringing decisions to the public arena. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I shall deal with the two sections of amendments separately. As regards the first three amendments dealing with competition, clearly we would expect the NDA to describe how it intends to promote competition. This will include details of priorities, time scales and so on. The five points raised by my noble friend in this regard would undoubtedly be party in one way or another to its approach to competition.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para22"></a>But it is difficult to write into statute or the strategy an exact prescription of how competition in all contexts will be carried out. More particularly, the amendments would have the unhelpful effect of requiring the Secretary of State to define the nature of "appropriate competition". This is precisely what we are asking the NDA itself to do.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para23"></a>Of course the Secretary of State will have a close interest&#151;indeed he will have final approval of the overall approach in the strategy&#151;in respect of competition, but it will be the NDA's expertise that will tend to determine what particular points are pursued as appropriate. It is not entirely clear what the distinction between "appropriate" and "effective" would be.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para24"></a>My noble friend is right that the level of expertise required to be an effective competitor for most of the large-scale NDA contracts as envisaged would be fairly rare and would require companies to have built up a significant amount of expertise in the area. There will be other contracts, of course, for which that range of expertise will not necessarily be required. With the main site contracts, clearly that is what we are talking about.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para25"></a>The NDA will need a fair amount of information to ensure the spread of best practice, to be able to identify synergies between what it is doing and requires and what the company is offering and to judge the basis for site management contracts. That is why some of the information will undoubtedly be commercially confidential and there will be issues that we touched on in the debate earlier.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para26"></a>I do not see the benefit of changing the wording of what the NDA has to put in its strategy. In particular, it would not be appropriate to place the duty on the Secretary of State in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-43_para27"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 42 and 43, we want to see openness, transparency and engagement with stakeholders by the NDA. We support that general thrust, but the implication that the rather rigid process of dialogue between the formal stakeholders' meetings and the NDA board would improve that situation and that engagement seems a little fanciful. If, in effect, the stakeholders' meetings were not entirely consensual, particular propositions would come down to majority <P>


<a name="column_GC304"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>votes being presented to the board, and the board would formally have to say whether it accepted the proposition, accepted a part of it or rejected it. That is a mechanistic relationship which is not in the best interests of positive and creative stakeholder dialogue. I therefore would not accept the wording of that part of the amendment. There may be aspects of the amendments that we are prepared to consider in terms of improving the stakeholder dialogue, but I would not be happy with the one to which I have referred. No doubt the noble Lord may wish to return to the issue in a more general sense at the next stage, but not in the form of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   I support the amendments, particularly the first group. I agree with what the noble Lord said in support of them.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para0"></a>It is important to realise that once a contract has been allocated, if the main consideration in the mind of the contractor is how to sustain his position against other possible contractors who may be invited in at a later stage, that will alter the priorities in an undesirable fashion. Therefore it is right that the contractor should have in mind how the job is to be done as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible in general terms at each stage of the development of the work within the allotted period.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para1"></a>If it becomes necessary constantly to demonstrate at each site at which a contract has been allocated that that is so, it is bound to impose additional and perhaps unnecessary responsibilities that will add to the costs of the operation without necessarily improving it. Competition will be periodic in its term, but if it is continuous in its effect it could be more disruptive of the work than helpful. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his reluctance to have ministerial guidelines on what is meant by "competition" inserted into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para2"></a>There is a peculiar kind of competition in the industry and the decommissioning business. There are few players, and the work is extraordinarily specialised and leading edge. A great deal of emphasis was placed earlier on the whole question of commercial confidentiality. How that impinges on competition is difficult to work out.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para3"></a>It is not entirely clear what is meant by competition here. We would like greater clarity about that. That is against a background of it being widely perceived in the nuclear industry&#151;particularly by the UKAEA&#151;that excessive contractorisation at an early stage was disadvantageous to the objectives. Those who have observed that hope that we can learn from those mistakes and that the Government are willing to spell out&#151;perhaps not today, but later&#151;exactly how they see that competition operating. There is a large question mark over the duration of the contracts and the relative priority that the Government give to the matter in Clause 12(2)(c) over other matters that must be borne in mind by the NDA.

<a name="40120-44_para4"></a>I am pleased that the Minister at least said that a definition will need to be produced. He said that the NDA will be required to produce a definition for the contracts. I did not know whether that was an invitation to me to move an amendment to delete "Secretary of State" and insert "NDA". But the more I listen, the more I suspect that that invitation was not being extended. None the less, I endeavoured to define what we meant by appropriate, as distinct from straightforward, effectiveness in a contract to try to demonstrate that that will be different to contractorisation that we normally encounter. I would be grateful if the Minister would read in Hansard what I said, in the same way that I shall read in more detail what he said to me.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para5"></a>As for Amendments Nos. 42 and 43, we would not want a mechanistic process to be introduced. If the Minister feels that what we are proposing is too mechanistic, we will take the provision away and see whether we can find something that might be more flexible. From personal experience as a non-executive director of National Air Traffic Services, where we have stakeholder council meetings taking place twice a year, in the main, most stakeholders reach a consensual approach on issues that then find their way to the board. But, beyond that, there is no requirement for anyone to do anything when it finds its way up to the board.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para6"></a>There is possibly a case to be made for a little clearer direction for the purposes of openness and raising respect for the stakeholder council and its relationship with the NDA board in future. From my experience in NATS, we may need more than we have at present. Therefore, we will consider the matter and may return at Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-44_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Baroness Fookes): </B>  I take it from what the noble Lord said that he will not be moving Amendments Nos. 40 to 43 inclusive.

<A NAME="40120-44_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 44:

<br>

"( ) for the carrying out, during that year, of research and development;"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40120-44_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: I have been watching the clock for the past few moments. That is not because I was not grabbed by the interesting debates that we have been having, all of which were fantastic, but because I must apologise to members of the Committee on behalf of my noble friend Lady O'Cathain, who was unable to stay. It is a pity that only now are we about to discuss <P>


<a name="column_GC306"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>research and development, to which these amendments refer, because it is a subject that must be given consideration. In any event, whatever we say is probing. Therefore, I shall speak about what Amendments Nos. 44, 53 and 62 are intended to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para13"></a>Of course, research and development should be of primary importance to the NDA, a point we discussed when considering other amendments earlier today. Good, targeted research and development has the potential to reduce the costs and time-scales of nuclear decommissioning programmes. The Minister pointed out that the Government have made much of this subject in their reports.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para14"></a>We believe that the Bill neither gives adequate weight to the importance of research and development activities, nor puts sufficient onus or responsibility on the NDA to ensure that research and development programmes are maintained under the authority. These amendments seek to underline the importance of the need for the NDA to focus on research and development.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para15"></a>We believe that the attitude of the Minister to these amendments will demonstrate the Government's commitment to keeping the nuclear option open. I shall say no more than that. It is a question of how much importance the Government attach to it. The amendments would provide concrete measures to ensure that the important activities of research and development are given appropriate weight under the NDA regime.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para16"></a>Amendment No. 44 would require the NDA to add research and development activities to its annual plan, while Amendment No. 53 requires a report on R&D to be included in the annual report. To an extent, therefore, Amendment No. 53 is consequential on Amendment No. 44. Amendment No. 62 simply seeks to make the clean-up responsibilities include an element of R&D, thus emphasising its importance.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para17"></a>I have set out our views on R&D for the Minister and I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   This is an important amendment and I rather regret that we are starting it at twenty past seven in the evening. I have been keeping an eye on the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, to see whether he is girding his loins to rise and bring our proceedings to a close, but he is not. Either we shall need to interrupt the debate half way through, or we shall need to work beyond half past seven.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para18"></a>Two quite separate elements are sought in this small group of amendments. The White Paper, Managing the Nuclear Legacy, contains a substantial section beginning at paragraph 3.36 dealing with what was then envisaged as being the research obligations of what was then called the LMA and is now known as the NDA. I shall quote the beginning of the paragraph:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"BNFL and UKAEA commission research where necessary to improve safety and operational performance and develop solutions to specific clean up problems".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-44_para19"></a>It is perfectly clear that the NDA will have to undertake research on clean-up problems and it is equally clear that there is a good deal of wisdom and experience residing in both of those organisations.
<P>


<a name="column_GC307"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para20"></a>However, in paragraph 3.37 the White Paper goes on to state that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"More generally, the LMA will have a direct interest in the improvement of the technology available for clean up and of the underpinning science".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-44_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40120-44_para22"></a>That clearly implies that the NDA will carry out a good deal of research as its work proceeds. The Minister is nodding vigorously, so I do not need to dwell on that point; I must be right.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para23"></a>However, as my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon indicated, there is another aspect relating to keeping the nuclear option open. I am sure that many noble Lords will have received the December issue of Postnote - The Nuclear Energy Option in the UK. It was an extremely helpful and balanced note on the position. When one looks at the provisions envisaged by the Government for keeping the nuclear option open, one feels some alarm. Page 3 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The research programme 'Towards a Sustainable Energy Economy', operated jointly by three research councils, will spend approximately £5m on general nuclear technology research over the next four years".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-44_para24"></a><P>

<a name="40120-44_para25"></a>I have attended a number of conferences recently, notably the "Energy Choices" conference, to which reference has already been made. I can inform Ministers that that figure of £5 million is greeted with derision by the scientists involved in the programme. They see it as not measuring up at all to what is required.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para26"></a>When the Government gave evidence to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry into what is now called RD&D&#151;Research, Development and Demonstration&#151;they stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nuclear fission R&D has been declining steadily over the last 10-20 years. Publicly funded research into fission reactors began to decline with the privatisation of the electricity sector in 1990/91. DTI (previously Department of Energy) funded nuclear research has decreased from £164m in 1989/90 to just £17m in 2000/01 &#150; a reduction of 90%. All of this current expenditure is on fusion related work and there is currently no expenditure on fission R&D".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40120-44_para27"></a>That was a source of some dismay to the Select Committee, whose remarks I shall not read; it was then answered in the Government's response to the committee's report.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para28"></a>If "the nuclear option" is to have any meaning&#151;here I touch on the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart&#151;and if this country is not to become wholly dependent on technology and work overseas, we must undertake more research in this country. There are options for new reactors. I refer to the admirable Postnote, which identifies three designs as the likeliest contenders in the short term. The first is the ACR 700&#151;the advanced Canadian Deuterium-Uranium (CANDU) reactor 700Mwe, designed by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. Those reactors are now being sold around the world. It is building them within their cost estimate and within the time-scale quoted for completion. That technology exists, but it is not British; it is Canadian. The second design is the BNFL-Westinghouse AP1000, which is an advanced-passive 1000MWe reactor. The third is the European <P>


<a name="column_GC308"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Pressurized Water Reactor 1600MWe&#151;EPR&#151;designed by Framatome ANP. All those are substantially foreign.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para29"></a>That is not all. I do not know what work is being done now&#151;I shall come to my questions in a moment&#151;but there are, in addition, what are called Generation IV projects. The Generation IV nuclear research programme is currently being examined by an international consortium. A contribution is being made indirectly to the Generation IV work through the EU, I understand, but one is left with the astonishing figure of £5 million to be spent over the next four years on nuclear fission research.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para30"></a>I attended the "Energy Choices" conference, which was addressed by the Minister of State for Energy, e-Commerce and Postal Services, Stephen Timms. He announced that the position was under review and might change. There was a glimmer of hope that the Government were beginning to recognise that, if we are to be able to take advantage of any of the new technology and have power stations that have substantially longer lives, are substantially cheaper to construct and operate and are, in many cases, even safer than those that we have, we must do the research in this country. That is what this is directed at, not just  the question of research on the whole decommissioning process. I am sure that the NDA will do that, but it will be for the Government to make sure that research is done in a way that enables the British energy generating industry, if it becomes necessary&#151;I have made it clear that I think that it will, but others may take a different view&#151;to take advantage of it and not go cap-in-hand to foreign suppliers and, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, find ourselves held to ransom.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para31"></a>The situation that we are in is probably as worrying as almost anything else. There are clauses coming up about skilled nuclear manpower&#151;nuclear engineers and scientists&#151;and there is a new clause at the end of this part of the Bill. That is equally important, but here we are dealing with research. Unless the Government are prepared to recognise that they must do more, the credibility of the nuclear option becomes almost meaningless. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. I suspect that many Ministers recognise that there will come a time when we will have to replace nuclear with nuclear, otherwise we will not keep the lights on and meet our Kyoto objectives.
<P>

<a name="40120-44_para32"></a>Research is at the heart of the matter and I hope that the Minister will be able to add something to what was said by his colleague from the DTI, Mr Timms, at the conference that I attended in December.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Of course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I do not want to weary the Committee, but one of the amendments that we might have come to but was not in the grouping is government Amendment No. 72. It will extend the Henry VIII clause to give the Government the power to modify Clause 12 by order. That has not been put before the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. Having drawn their attention to the matter, will Ministers do anything about it? It will be difficult to debate the clause if it has not yet been examined by the Committee, unless it has decided that it does not need to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for raising the issue and bringing it to our attention. It was mistakenly not drawn to the Select Committee's attention earlier. In fact the amendment to Clause 32 is a minor, consequential amendment to correct an oversight from the division during the course of the drafting of what was originally Clause 11 into what are now Clauses 11 and 12.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para0"></a>Contrary to the noble Lord's implication, there is no change in policy. A memorandum to the Select Committee sets out clearly the powers in Clause 32 to <P>


<a name="column_GC310"></a>

<B>20 Jan 2004 : Column GC310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>modify the provisions in Chapter 1. We have contacted the Committee to explain the effect of that and why it has arisen. The chairman agreed that there is no need to call a meeting of the Committee to consider the amendment, so that need not delay us.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para1"></a>It is unfortunate and I apologise to the Committee, but in the light of the explanation that I have passed to the Select Committee, it is unlikely that it will want to comment substantively on the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am a member of that Committee. Do I understand the Minister to say that the amendment has not been before it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No, we contacted the chairman and he has accepted our explanation. The Committee can return to it, but he says that in his judgment there is no need for us to delay consideration until the Committee meets. That is his judgment, on which the Committee will be able to take a view, but because the amendment is consequent on how the Bill has been drafted rather than a new matter, his view is that we do not need to delay its consideration.

<A NAME="40120-45_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has today published <i>The Planning Service: Costs and Fees</i>. This is a report prepared by Arup Economics and Planning into the way in which the powers in Clause 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill might be used. Using the report, we are considering the nature and scope of any fees and charges that might be prescribed by the Secretary of State under that clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120-45_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is today laying before Parliament a draft order to continue the powers of detention in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCS) for a further 12 months. It will be debated, by this House and in another place, by early March.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para3"></a>The public emergency which necessitated the introduction of these powers&#151;and which arises principally as a result of the threat of international terrorism posed by foreign nationals&#151;still exists. Where terrorism is concerned, our paramount responsibility is to ensure public safety and national security. Where a foreign national is suspected of terrorism of the sort which led to September 11 2001 and is considered to be a threat to national security but <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>cannot currently be removed&#151;and for whom a criminal prosecution is not an option&#151;we believe that it is necessary and proportionate to provide for extended detention, pending removal. The person would be free to leave the United Kingdom if he wished to do so.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para4"></a>The draft Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 (Continuance in Force of Sections 21&#150;23) Order 2003 provides for the continuation of the immigration powers under Part 4 of the 2001 Act to certify, and to detain pending removal, suspected international terrorists, subject to safeguards. The continuation is from 14 March 2004 until 13 March 2005.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para5"></a>To date, 16 people have been certified and detained under the powers contained in Part 4 of the ATCS Act. Two of these have chosen to leave the United Kingdom as the detainees are free to do at any time. One further individual has been certified but is currently detained under other powers.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para6"></a>The Home Secretary's decisions to certify and detain these individuals were made on the basis of detailed and compelling evidence. All those certified have appealed to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) including the two who left the United Kingdom. SIAC has rejected the appeals against certification made by the first 10 ATCS detainees, which were heard between May and July last year. The determinations for a further two cases that have been heard have not yet been handed down.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para7"></a>The Special Immigration Appeals Commission is a superior court of record. It has the power to overturn the certificates which the Home Secretary has issued in respect of those detained.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para8"></a>The detention powers in Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act are a cornerstone of the UK's anti-terrorism measures. It is essential that we are able to take firm, swift action against those who threaten the safety of this country.
<P>

<a name="40120-45_para9"></a>We will be looking carefully at the conclusions and recommendations of the report of Lord Newton and his committee, which was laid before the House on 18 December 2003, together with the reports of Lord Carlile, the second of which will be laid before the House shortly. We will be reporting to the House when we come to debate Lord Newton's report and the renewal powers, and I look forward to a full and vigorous debate. None the less, we continue to believe that the Part 4 powers are a necessary and proportionate response to the current threat.

<a name="40120w01_para1"></a>As my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has made clear, our preference is always to prosecute where sufficient admissible evidence exists. This is a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and such decisions are independent of Ministers.

<a name="40120w01_para2"></a>Individual cases are kept under review and if further evidence comes to light prosecuting will be reconsidered by the CPS.

<UL>What objective tests they expect to be applied following the enactment of the Gender Recognition Bill in the determination of the sex of persons who are litigants in civil actions or the accused in criminal actions where that is a relevant matter under the law.[HL673]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40120w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  The general principle of the Gender Recognition Bill is that a transsexual person's acquired gender will be recognised in UK law for all purposes from the date of issue of a certificate of gender recognition by the Gender Recognition Panel. Clause 9 of the Bill clearly states that, if the acquired gender is male, the person's sex becomes that of a man and if the acquired gender is female, the perons's sex becomes that of a woman. Therefore, the sex of persons who are litigants in civil actions or the accused in criminal actions will be taken to be the gender in which he or she is recognised by law.

<P>
<A NAME="40120w01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Michelle Verokken's contract of employment with UK Sport has not at this stage been terminated and it would be inappropriate for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to make any further comments at present.

<A NAME="40120w01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   John Scott, UK Sport's Director of International Relations and Major Events, is undertaking the role of acting head of Drug Free Sport. He has considerable experience of anti-doping having been actively involved in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of the European Anti-Doping Convention; the creation and negotiation of the International Anti-Doping Agreement, and is one of UK Sport's advisers on international doping matters.
<P>

<a name="40120w01_para5"></a>In addition, Mr Scott, during his five years in Canada, was closely involved in the federal government's response to the high profile Ben Johnson case, and the subsequent Dubin inquiry where he was a member of the team that established Canada's national anti-doping agency.
