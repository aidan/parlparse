Entitlement depends on a number of factors such as the current place of work, if in work; the last place of work, if retired; and where their centre of interest lies. These rules do not discriminate between EEA citizens on the grounds of nationality.</p>

The Minister will be aware of the number of migrants who are legally resident in the UK whose jobs collapse, especially in the present economic circumstances, and who are then homeless and without any income whatever. Would the Government be prepared to explore with our European partners arrangements whereby people who had paid their contributions, say in Poland or in Lithuania, would be able to draw on their country&#146;s resources if they were in need because they had had a hard time in the country where they were living at the time?</p>

There are cross-border issues around benefits. There are existing co-ordination arrangements under which posted employees&#151;people who are posted for just 12 months to another state&#151;can access and contribute to their benefit system back home. EEA nationals, including those from the accession countries, can access income-related benefits in the UK under certain circumstances, including if they have been working and registered for at least 12 months and are seeking work. There are more restrictive arrangements for A8 and A2 nationals but there is still an opportunity, with that proviso, to access income-related benefits.</p>

In other words, to how many foreign residents are we paying social security benefits and what is the global amount of the benefits they are receiving?</p>

I am not sure whether we record them fully in respect of foreign nationals because, for the most part, under these co-ordinated arrangements, nationality is not a key determinant of benefit payments. I can give him a number for the total payments made to UK nationals and EU citizens living in the EU in the year to September 2008: it was about &#163;1 billion, most of which was pension entitlements.</p>

The co-ordination arrangements, which are not about harmonising benefit systems across the 31 countries involved, seek to allocate, particularly for workers, to which country&#146;s scheme you pay contributions to and therefore which state is responsible for the benefits. It is therefore unlikely that there would be overlap, but we are dealing with 31 systems here and they are not totally aligned.</p>

I do not think that it is easy to harmonise all the arrangements but I give the simple example of the problems presented by a Polish person needing emergency housing in London, when there is housing available, but no work, in their home town in Poland. There is a case for looking at voluntary schemes that would allow for transfer between countries and provide additional help to enable people in those circumstances to go home instead of remaining homeless on our streets or on the streets of other countries.</p>

The point I was seeking to make is that access to a range of benefits&#151;we are dealing with income-related benefits, contributory and non-contributory benefits, with different rules for each&#151;does not necessarily rest on nationality. Therefore, nationality is not necessarily recorded when a benefit is claimed or, indeed, awarded.</p>

Under the co-ordination arrangements, when people from abroad are in work in the UK, they pay their contributions into the UK state system and not into their home systems. However, I take the noble Lord&#146;s point. This area is worthy of further examination.</p>

This is a very disturbing fact, but it has marked the Prison Service&#146;s attitude to inquiries for far too long. It has been noted in coroners&#146; reports and in the report on the Mubarek inquiry. Only last week a High Court judge refused to accept the Prison Service&#146;s nomination of a retired senior manager to replace the ombudsman in this inquiry. This attitude amounts to little short of contempt of the public. Recently, this House voted that the Prison Service management should be subject to the conditions of the corporate manslaughter Act.

From a particular case he generalises to an absurd extent. The fact is that the Prison Service and all those who work in the prisons part of the Ministry of Justice have a hard job to do. There are some extremely difficult cases. I do not think that it aids prisoners in any way if someone with as much experience and who is as widely respected as the noble Lord is on this subject generalises to the extent that he has done in the House today. It does them a huge disservice. If I may say so, he should choose his words rather more carefully.</p>

This case has been going on since 2003 to 2005, when the individual SP suffered her injuries. There was then a prolonged inquiry, which collapsed. Then the Government, in their wisdom, appointed a Prison Service manager to chair the inquiry. Rightly, that was struck out by the courts. I do not think that the Minister can dismiss that as being the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, generalising. Will he now answer the points put by the noble Lord?</p>

However, he made some very general attacks on the way in which this particular part of the Ministry of Justice reacted to prison problems. I thought that that was unfair. On this case, of course it is right to say that there have been difficulties. The court decided that there had not been undue delay by the Ministry of Justice. We had considered that the investigator whom we had commissioned to undertake the investigation would be suitably independent and have the relevant skills to conduct the investigation in a transparent and robust manner. The court disagreed. That is the position that we are in and we want to move forward.</p>

Can I tempt the noble Lord to look positively to the future? I invite him to confirm that shortly a new chairman will be appointed who will be independent and preferably of judicial rank; that there will be new terms of reference, so that the full history of SP can be looked into and all relevant matters investigated by the inquiry; and that there will be funding, so that a full and proper inquiry can take place in a suitably rigorous manner.</p>

We hope to announce the appointment of the new investigator shortly. That person will be independent. As far as funding is concerned, in the recent case, which the noble Lord knows about so well, the judge concluded that the funding arrangements put in place by the department &#147;plainly are&#148;, to use his words, sufficient to safeguard SP&#146;s interests as required by Article 2. I can answer his questions in the affirmative.</p>

It is a question of why he decided that he could not carry on with it, so the question is perhaps best asked of him. It is his decision and the letter gives, over four or five pages, a number of reasons why he came to the view that he did. That letter is in the public domain and I will put a copy in the Library. The noble Lord can see what that letter says. To try to summarise it would be doing an injustice to the ombudsman.</p>

I am sure that the House will be disappointed, as that is contrary to good legislative practice. Does the Minister accept that it could be counterproductive not to submit the Bill to proper legislative scrutiny? If the extended period of detention, which might be incorporated in the Bill, is applied to a single suspect who then goes to trial, the defence could argue that the circumstances of the investigation undermine a fair trial, as the jury, being aware that Parliament had approved such a drastic measure in a particular crisis, may be tempted to assume the suspect&#146;s greater guilt.

There are a number of differences between the two Bills, such as the requirement in legislation for there to be a grave, exceptional terrorist threat. Effectively, in that situation, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will decide that it should be brought into play because, for the security of the country, she will have decided that the investigation of terrorist suspects needs a longer period than 28 days. I could go through a whole number of other things which are different, but the safeguards are exactly the same as for the current 28-day period.</p>

As I said, we have a good record on pre-legislative scrutiny. We also have a good record on counterterrorist work. We have a new counterterrorist strategy, which will be put to Cabinet and will come out in the next couple of months. Over the past 18 months, we have done a huge amount to make this country safer, of which I am very proud. It does not mean that we are safe, I am afraid, because there are still severe threats out there. However, some very good work has been done and I am proud of that.</p>

I share my noble friend&#146;s view&#151;along, I am sure, with anyone else who watched it&#151;that it was a compelling story, well told. As well as evoking strong feelings, I am sure that it encouraged many noble Lords to contribute. It is not a matter for the Government or the Broadcasting Minister to comment on broadcasting judgments made by the director-general of the BBC. That is clearly a matter for the BBC Trust.</p>

Can the Minister ask the director-general how one can be impartial on the suffering and destruction that has taken place in Gaza? Surely this appeal is to meet humanitarian need and not to make any kind of political statement.</p>

I am sure that the director-general of the BBC will listen carefully to what he has to say, as I am sure he will to the debate in this House and the debate that has followed the decision. However, I repeat that questions of impartiality are very fine judgments. Questions of impartiality for the BBC are, in many senses, finer judgments. It is for that very reason that responsibility for the BBC&#146;s impartiality was put in a separate place from that for other broadcasters. I make no comment on the rights or wrongs of the decision, but I strongly support the position of the BBC director-general to be able to make that decision without government Ministers attempting to second-guess him or question him after the event.</p>

Does the Minister agree that a consequence of the&#151;in our opinion misguided&#151;decision by the BBC has been much to the detriment of its position internationally, particularly in its effect on the position of the World Service, which plays such an important role in so many places as the voice and source of impartial and unbiased information?

As to whether or not any individual decision can have the level of detrimental effect that the noble Baroness described, I might contend it. I think that the BBC is very aware that these are fine judgments and it is, often more than most broadcasters, put in a position where it has to exercise those fine judgments. Impartiality is defined at some length, as she will know, in the BBC Charter and, indeed, in Ofcom codes for other broadcasters. Part of the reason why it takes some fine length is because it is difficult to

I think that the Government find themselves in difficulty in these situations; there are members of the Government&#151;Ministers and Secretaries of State&#151;who have expressed their views very clearly, but in this situation it is the job of the director-general and the management of the BBC to make judgments on partiality and impartiality. If individual members of the Government wish to be partial&#151;I, for one, can understand why&#151;that is a matter for them.</p>

Furthermore, would he join me in applauding the long-standing corporation policy of broadcasting details of helplines that will give support and advice to those affected by potentially disturbing story-lines and topical events that the BBC broadcasts? If he will indulge me on those points, I invite him to agree that it is ironic to the point of perversity that viewers who were profoundly affected by the BBC&#146;s graphic and moving coverage of the humanitarian disaster in Gaza were deprived by the same BBC of the opportunity to access information that would have helped them to respond appropriately&#151;that is, by supporting DEC&#146;s humanitarian appeal?</p>

As the Bill stands, the MMO can undertake research itself when that research is concerned with any of its functions or general objectives, or it can choose to commission research in these areas. Some research is carried out by almost every organisation to facilitate achieving its objectives. We fully support Amendment 70A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, because to perform its remit effectively the MMO will and should have to

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09012856000057"></a>Will the Minister say what specific sorts of research he expects the MMO to carry out? Subsection (1)(b) specifies that research can be commissioned or supported,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000211"></a>&#147;by financial means or otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000177"></a>What is likely to be the &#147;otherwise&#148;? Will he explain that? Will he also tell us whether there are any estimates of how much of the MMO&#146;s budget might be taken up by this research? Who will be in charge of deciding which research gets greater priority if, for example, time or cost factors come into play?</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09012856000058"></a>Amendment 70A flags up the question of who the main funder and promoter of research will be. Will it be Defra, the MMO or the NERC? How much will commercial interests be encouraged to participate in co-funding research? Will Defra&#146;s research budget be increased to cope with this demand? In addition, the NERC does not have a history of prioritising funding for the directly applied research that this would entail.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09012856000059"></a>There is also the question of security of information. The Freedom of Information Act means that a lot of the research carried out may end up in the public domain. While that is a positive development in many ways, it could pose problems for sensitive information such as that on licensing. It could also make partnership funding with commercial interests more difficult. How do the Government intend to sort out that situation?</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09012856000060"></a>There is a risk of duplicating the research by other bodies. There are many different bodies in charge of various aspects of the marine area. For example, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities may all have a vested interest in commissioning similar research. Finally, then, what plan will be put in place to avoid wasteful and expensive duplication of research? Would the MMO be considered the primary research body? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="09012856000061"></a><b><a name="90128-0002.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09012856000291"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> In speaking to the two amendments that I have in this group, I first thank the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, for supporting them. Earlier in this Committee stage, the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, eloquently referred to the need for this sort of research. He laid out, for Members of the Committee, why that would be so important. The MMO, as the Minister has said, will have to perform a balancing act as the holder of the ring, given all the tensions between the various interest groups. As the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, said, we can be certain that the commercial interests will have commissioned plenty of scientific research to support their case. That is one reason, among many others, for the MMO needing to be really capable when it comes to research.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09012856000062"></a>The Joint Committee on the draft marine Bill dwelt at some length on this matter and the amendments that I have tabled result from its deliberations. It quite unequivocally recommended:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09012856000194"></a>&#147;The MMO should have a duty under the Bill to promote the publicly-funded production of marine data, to collect such data and to make them publicly available&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_254"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09012856000178"></a>Further evidence heard by the Joint Committee led me to table Amendment 70B. The committee suggested that there was no power for the MMO to collect data on a cost-free basis from any public body. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, asked which body will be primarily responsible and whether it will be Natural England or the MMO, for example. Those questions are vital because, depending on the Minister&#146;s answers, Amendment 70B will be more or less important.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09012856000063"></a>What we really aim to do with these amendments is, first, to make sure that the research is absolutely required to happen&#151;the designation of MCZs alone depends enormously on the quality of research&#151;and, secondly, to ensure that, if the Bill starts to require a reasonable level of research, that research is not prevented simply on grounds of cost.</p>

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="09012856000064"></a><b><a name="90128-0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09012856000292"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> I, too, support the amendments in this group. They pick up, in a more practical manner, on a theme that has run through the debates on the Bill. Your Lordships are, I think, broadly agreed that the MMO must take its decisions on the basis of the best available scientific evidence. The question is: how does the MMO obtain such evidence?</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09012856000065"></a>As both the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and my noble friend Lord Taylor have said, that evidence will already to some degree be within the knowledge of the MMO staff, because the Minister has accepted that many of them will have to be a of high scientific calibre. However, there will obviously be occasions when there is the need for research and the MMO, because it will not possess that particular expertise, will have to consider what sources it will need to tap&#151;both national and, indeed, international, because the information on biodiversity that it seeks may not be available in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09012856000066"></a>I remind the Minister&#151;in case he needs reminding&#151;that the marine White Paper published in 2007 had some important things to say about what it described as an evidence-based policy approach for the MMO. It stated that appropriate scientific data and information were needed to provide,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000212"></a>&#147;an evidence based approach to policy-making both at a strategic level (planning) and for local marine management decisions (licensing, enforcement and nature conservation)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000179"></a>It also stated, in what I thought was a powerful commitment in a White Paper:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09012856000195"></a>&#147;We intend to maintain the provision of high quality sound, impartial, scientific advice to underpin decision-making by the MMO and are considering how best to satisfy this need&#148;.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09012856000067"></a>It is in the light of the Government&#146;s approach in the White Paper and the contributions made in previous Committee days and today by the Minister that he needs to construe Clause 23. For example, in what circumstances would he foresee the MMO acting alone, and in what circumstances would he see it drawing in other bodies or persons? If it needs to draw in other bodies or persons, what criteria will it apply? I imagine that the Minister&#146;s response will be that that is a matter that ought to be provided for in guidance, not in the Bill. Depending a little on the detail of his answer, I do not think that I will quarrel with him, but the Committee needs to know a little about what the approach in such guidance is likely to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09012856000068"></a>Then there is the other matter, which was extremely well covered by both my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. A great deal of high-quality research is taking place in this country in marine science&#151;some of it what scientists term &#147;blue skies&#148; research and some of it other commissioned research. At some stage, we will need&#151;again probably in guidance&#151;some scheme or methodology for when the MMO needs to go outside, setting out what procedures it should follow to ensure that it not only identifies the right institution with which to enter a research relationship but also gets the best value for money.</p>

I am in no doubt whatever of the view of the Committee of the need for high-quality science and research to be a critical part of the work of the MMO and for its decisions to be evidence-based and embracing what research and scientific evidence are available. The comprehensive nature of existing marine research and monitoring, along with the possibility of new specific and focused research that the MMO can commission, will furnish it with a strong base for planning and making assessments of particular marine activities.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09012856000071"></a>I recognise that noble Lords would like me to give as much detail as possible on how we think that might happen and I will do so. However, when it is established, the MMO will also have to think carefully about this. I would caution against trying to build in too much inflexibility at the moment as, in the end, the MMO will be in a good position to make judgments itself about the range and amount of research that it should commission and the degree to which it should use Defra&#146;s existing research capacity and other matters.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09012856000072"></a>Although we debated this only last week, I remind noble Lords that my department&#146;s research budget is a not insignificant amount of money. We also have access to wider marine research carried out by other government departments and the various agencies that come under them. I am thinking of the nature conservation bodies, the devolved Administrations and the Natural Environment Research Council, as well as, of course, universities and marine research centres. There is also collaboration&#151;I very much take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;with partners in European and other international projects. Therefore, there is a fine base already. Seeing the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in his place, I should pay tribute to the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership as well.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09012856000073"></a>We should not underestimate the fact that the sea is a vast, highly complex and expensive environment within which to carry out research and monitoring activities. Therefore, it is not possible for a single

Science, in relation to the sea, can mean the ocean processes&#151;the physics and chemistry of the sea&#151;and it can mean biology and biodiversity. The ecosystem approach embodies all these aspects, but there are also separate elements, which need to be brought together.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09012856000074"></a>We also have to consider the impacts on the marine environment of manmade pressures such as pollution&#151;possibly leading to damage&#151;and, as part of our role in sustainability, the socio-economic impact. There are centres of expertise in all these fields and these pieces of evidence need to be blended together. The work of the Marine and Fisheries Agency shows that this can be done very effectively, as it is able to call on the best available evidence on which to base its decisions.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09012856000075"></a>In 2008-09, my department commissioned approximately &#163;2.8 million of research into human activities and related issues. Under the current arrangements, the Marine and Fisheries Agency is a key customer of this research. We anticipate this successful arrangement continuing with the Marine Management Organisation. My department and the MFA have excellent, dedicated advice and research undertaken by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. However, our experience is that wider collaboration is the most effective way of best understanding the marine environment. Such collaboration means that there is an excellent track record in the UK.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09012856000076"></a>In 2010, the United Kingdom will produce the most comprehensive assessment of the state of its marine environment in the <I>Charting Progress 2</I> report. This will be achieved through the combined effort of many partners to the marine monitoring and assessment strategy, including many of the organisations that I have already mentioned. However, we want to do more than this. We have recently created the cross-government high-level marine science co-ordinating committee, which will produce a strategy this year to improve further the UK&#146;s marine science and monitoring across the board. The strategy will aim to improve efficiency and address the gaps and long-term needs in the UK&#146;s marine science. It will very much inform some of the decisions that will need to be taken in the future about the research effort in the marine area, so it will be significant in teasing out the areas on which we will have to put more emphasis in the future.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09012856000077"></a>What is the role of the MMO? We see it very much as a partner in that work. The point has already been made that we need to avoid duplication, but we need to fill gaps and to ensure that there is a collaborative approach. On one hand, we want to invest as many of our precious resources as can be made available. On the other hand&#151;many noble Lords will know of some of the challenges of research funding&#151;we need to ensure that there is no duplication of effort either.</p>

<a name="90128-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09012856000078"></a>As I said in our earlier debates, the MMO will comprise around 250 staff posts in total. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, the people who are currently working in the Marine and Fisheries Agency are of a very high calibre and have substantial skills in marine and fisheries science. They will move into the new organisation, and I assure noble Lords that new staff with skills and expertise in marine science and data

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90128-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90128-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09012856000079"></a>Some interesting issues have been raised in this debate. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for example, invited me to construe Clause 23. To an extent, he always anticipates my answer, because, to return to my original point, the clause clearly enables the MMO to carry out and commission research and to work in partnership with other organisations. I strongly suggest to noble Lords that that balance is right; in the end, it is for the MMO to decide. Noble Lords have already emphasised in earlier debates the need for the MMO to act independently, and judgments about research must be one of the elements of that.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09012856000080"></a>Equally, however, we can give a steer in guidance. My understanding is that a science blueprint is being developed for the MMO. It is currently envisaged that the MMO will also have a strategy and evidence unit that will comprise staff with the skills and expertise to support and assist the MMO in performing its functions, skills in the statistical interpretation of data in relation to a range of its functions, and specialist skills related to fisheries data, economics and social sciences to support the MMO in its sustainable development objectives.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09012856000081"></a>Clause 23 in essence enables the MMO to undertake research if it wants to do so, and gives it the freedom to decide to access a wider body of information and evidence to inform its decisions. In many instances, the MMO&#146;s needs will be met by the dedicated service provided by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science, but there is no restriction on the MMO in carrying out its marine science functions. Equally I stress that if the MMO decides to undertake and commission research itself, it is important that it does not duplicate scientific research in other parts of government, universities or other sectors.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09012856000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about resources. I mentioned the &#163;37 million that my department already spends per annum on research and monitoring. The MMO will have access to that and if there are gaps&#151;I have already referred to the work that is being undertaken to look at gaps&#151;the MMO will have ready access to the decisions that need to be taken about the Defra commissioned research alongside the research that is there to underpin decisions. These matters will be subject to constant discussion and review in the years ahead. It is not as if the MMO will simply be a recipient of research undertaken by Defra. It will have a key role to play in informing what research should be undertaken.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09012856000083"></a>I turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She made some general points about the importance of science and research which I tried to address in my opening remarks. Her amendment is designed to ensure that the MMO is empowered to collect data free from other bodies. The Joint Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, looked into this matter and representations were made to the committee about the cost of marine data. The committee was concerned that the MMO should be adequately funded to secure the data if needed. Of course the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_258"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>MMO will need to use data and it will need to be adequately funded to enable it to access data. That is certainly our intention.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09012856000084"></a>The problem we have with the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is that it would cut across existing arrangements for trading funds. For instance, the cost of data supplied under licence by the UK Hydrographic Office is one of the concerns of many involved in marine science. The UKHO is a trading fund and, as such, is required to be self-financing, so it retains the information for its products and services to cover running costs and to fund investment. Revenue is clearly important to the UKHO in being able to develop its own programme. So I understand the point the noble Baroness makes but that would be the problem. In essence, it would take resources away from other bodies doing critical work in the area of research.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09012856000085"></a>The noble Baroness raised a general point about the need for information to flow as effectively as possible. I agree with her and it is something that we wish to do. The current principle under the Treasury rules is to allow Government to recover a reasonable cost for providing data on request. It is normal practice for the reasonable cost to cover the administrative costs of providing data to a third party. Additional costs are charged for data once they have had value added to them; that is, by combining other data sets through interpretation of raw data or producing products such as the geographic information system data layers. In those circumstances a charge may be levied by whoever owns the value-added product. These value-added products are often associated with licence charges. I accept the spirit of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment but it is unreasonable to expect these products to be supplied free of charge because it is often the production of these third-party products which helps to maintain the commercial value of data collection activities.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09012856000086"></a>However, it is not all gloom and doom. As I have said, it clearly is in the Government&#146;s interest to ensure that relevant data collected by one government department are made available to another department which may need them to conduct its business. We are looking at arrangements in government in order to meet that challenge most effectively.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09012856000087"></a>We have taken significant steps over the past few years in preparation for the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, and the setting up of the MMO, to ensure that data collected are discoverable, collected to agreed protocols and held by data archive centres operating to similar protocols. All that is designed to ensure marine data are more readily shared across the community. We are finalising formal arrangements to allow for the exchange of survey data between a number of government departments and agencies at no extra cost. This will increase the efficiency gains for each organisation while avoiding the duplication of data. Clearly, I accept the point that the noble Baroness has raised.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09012856000088"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked me about the confidentiality of data. Intellectual property remains the right of the producer of research. But the aim would be to make as much publicly available as possible.

The University of St Andrews is the UK centre for research on sea mammals, including seals, which, as we know, have an effect on fisheries&#151;so this is important. How will the funding work? I am not certain, but I imagine that that department at St Andrews is partly funded by the Scots Parliament, partly by one or more research councils and probably other bodies. If the MMO wants research to be carried out on the behaviour of seals and all the existing data, it would be ridiculous for it to embark on research of its own. In fact, I cannot see the MMO embarking on much research with the staffing that it will have. It will be farming research out, although the Government are rightly giving it the right, if it wants, to do that research. If the Government ask St Andrews to do some research or to supply data, will the MMO fund that or will it be the department&#146;s responsibility to supply existing data? How will that work? That is basic to our understanding of the operation of this body.</p>

It will depend on the research being considered, and the surrounding circumstances. For instance, research will become publicly available that the MMO, along with anyone else, will be entitled to use. Equally, there may be gaps in the research that the MMO requires, and it could commission the department that the noble Baroness refers to, or any other research organisation. Alternatively, Defra&#146;s research and development commissions might identify a research project that is needed. It might be Defra that commissions the department to which she refers, and pays the cost. We have flexibility here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09012856000093"></a>I agree that, although scientific expertise will be important among the staff of the MMO, the extent to which those staff will do research themselves will probably be limited.

In my department, our chief scientific adviser, Mr Bob Watson, is a man of the highest calibre. Other departments have people of similar calibre. Clearly, we want to ensure that the MMO has a similar capacity. We also need MMO staff who understand the commissioning of research, so that the specifications are correct and the research is properly monitored. Equally, the MMO will have access to research undertaken by my own department, and it can enter into collaborative agreements as well. The point is that the MMO has a great deal of flexibility. The reassurance that I seek to give noble Lords is that it will have the ability to commission research where it needs to. It all lends to the original point of this debate, which is that decisions by the MMO are informed by high-quality science and other evidence.</p>

I applaud the importance and status that has been given to the MMO. However, am I right in believing that the status of the MMO will be sufficient to enable it to counter anything that the IPC does in terms of the environment, and that, in the unlikely event of a difference between the two, the MMO will have the upper hand in, for example, vetoing other views on environmental grounds?</p>

The thought of the IPC commissioning scientists to come to one view and the MMO commissioning scientists to come to another is not what I envisage, and I would be horrified if that were the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09012856000096"></a>I will make two points. First, as I have said, we expect the marine planning statement and the MPS to be consistent. Secondly, the science and research will be available to both the MMO and the IPC to enable them to make the judgments that they are called upon to make. If an offshore renewable infrastructure planning decision, because it is above the threshold, is not made by the IPC but by the MMO, I would expect that, in making the decision, the MMO would make available to the IPC all the relevant expertise and scientific and research evidence.

I should like to pick on a point arising from the concerns of the Joint Committee about funding. Has the noble Lord any idea of how much of the research undertaken at the moment is being commissioned and funded by government departments compared with what is being undertaken privately, if you like, by other research areas? It would be interesting and helpful to have some idea about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09012856000100"></a>There are two issues here, the first of which is whether there will be enough money to obtain the sort of information that the management organisation will want. Secondly, on a point that my noble friend wanted to come back to, under Clause 23(2) does the MMO have to provide information for anyone who requests it? Does it have to make it available on demand? That could become a very expensive exercise. The Minister has indicated that he will probably come back to this point and I hope that he will, because at the moment the wording is very open-ended and could result in great demands being put on the finite resources of the MMO.</p>

On the one hand there is an implication in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about the free flow of research information, and clearly that is well understood. On the other hand, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, is right that we do not want to encumber the MMO with extravagant requests that are hard to meet.</p>

When looking at it, perhaps the Minister will bear in mind three possible angles. The first is the broad question of national interest. We may find that an interest from abroad, for reasons which might not be wholly bona fide, may make a demand that would  be strongly supported by the clause as it stands. The second point is the one so well made by my noble friend Lady Byford, that the resource cost related to a large, if not infinite, number of demands could be massive, not only in absolute terms, but in being highly distracting from other work of a higher priority which the MMO will also be undertaking. The third point is that if you have, for example, a conflict between one organisation and another that may or may not have reached the stage of litigation, we

I suspect that if we had had a clause that was highly restrictive of access to MMO research, amendments would have been tabled to free it up. My sense is that there is a broad consensus in your Lordships&#146; House that we want information made available wherever appropriate. We should remember that the information that the MMO produces, commissions or has made available to it will be of enormous benefit in a proper way to all those stakeholders who are interested in the marine environment. In the best sense, the more that high-quality research is commissioned and made available, the more it will add to people&#146;s learning. Getting the balance right is a challenge, but this point has been well made in the debate. I am happy to go away and see if we can come back either with amendments or with further explanation of how this ought to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="09012856000110"></a><b><a name="90128-0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09012856000310"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> On the money front, I shall probe a little more into the Government&#146;s intentions for funding the MMO. The impact assessment for the Bill puts the cost to the Government at somewhere between &#163;751 million and &#163;1.6 billion over 20 years. There is quite a spread between those two figures. The predicted benefits are even more startling: somewhere between &#163;8.7 billion and &#163;19.6 billion.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09012856000111"></a>However, I am particularly interested in the efficiency savings to the Government. We on these Benches are not generally over-enthusiastic about the creation of another quango. We support the Bill, however, because we have great hopes that the MMO will not merely duplicate existing bodies' responsibilities but go beyond them, incorporating them into the new MMO and extending good environmental practice. Also, the creation of the MMO should make it possible for some of the existing bodies to be better co-ordinated and managed, and to achieve savings on existing budgets.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09012856000112"></a>Streamlining the licensing system will reduce the administrative burden on regulators and advisory bodies. Can we assume that government funding for these bodies will therefore be reduced? What budgetary adjustments does Defra intend to make to account for these existing bodies&#146; reduced workloads?</p>

Clearly, the resource made available to the Marine Management Organisation by the Secretary of State has been given consideration in the course of the development of this legislation. The impact assessment that was laid before this House includes costings of the Bill&#146;s measures, set out as costs to government and industry. The costs to government are related to the new functions that the MMO will be carrying out. The marine planning function is estimated to cost government &#163;8.1 million per annum. Enforcement

The new GS and data systems needed to underpin the new planning and other functions will cost around &#163;3.3 million. There are of course additional one-off costs in setting up a new organisation, and some increase in funding costs for a large organisation in the form of the existing Marine and Fisheries Agency.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09012856000114"></a>Of course, I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, would wish that the resources were necessary to deliver the Bill. Indeed, in our previous two days, a number of Members of the Committee have emphasised to the Government the need to expend extra resources in a number of areas&#151;not least research, which we have just debated. Equally, I understand the point of the noble Lord about ensuring that efficiency also goes to the heart of the matter, and that we should ensure that where there is a reduction of function in, say, my own department, there should be a consequent reduction in headquarter costs.</p>

<a name="90128-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09012856000115"></a>That will be our intention. I do not want to go into the pain of the efficiency targets that my department is currently under, but they are considerably challenging. Clearly, we want to ensure that the transition happens as efficiently as possible. Inevitably, as I have indicated, there will be transition costs that must be met. The transition from the current Marine and Fisheries Agency to the MMO has been and will be gradual. The aim is to spread the cost and build up expertise within what was purely a fisheries organisation. For example, the environmental licensing and dredging responsibilities of the Department for Communities and Local Government have already been transferred to the agency, with full resource transfers. I understand that responsibility for harbours orders will transfer across, with expertise and resource, from the Department for Transport to the Marine Management Organisation. The current running costs for the Marine and Fisheries Agency will be maintained and enhanced from the core departments&#146; budgets. Running costs are currently around &#163;25 million a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09012856000116"></a>Budgetary provision of around &#163;4 million has been made for one-off costs of setting up the MMO. About &#163;3 million has been allocated for the capital expenditure related to the new GIS and data systems needed. We have taken account of the planned need to upgrade the existing systems with a new function stemming from the MMO. The Marine and Fisheries Agency operates a full-cost recovery for its licensing of marine developments, and the Marine Management Organisation will do likewise. We will ensure that industry does not incur unnecessary costs by exempting activities which, by their nature, do not damage the marine environment, or which operate at a de minimis level. The licensing regime will deliver a more joined-up system than currently operates with an estimated saving of some 20 per cent of licences currently issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09012856000117"></a>On the research budget, I should have mentioned that&#151;although this does not take anything away from Clause 23(2), which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09012856000196"></a>&#147;The MMO is to make the results of any such research available to any person on request&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09012856000181"></a>under Clause 26 there is power to charge for services. I think that meets one of the concerns about the cost falling back on the MMO.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09012856000118"></a>Clearly, one cannot take on new functions. One has to recognise that this new marine planning system is one of the huge advantages of what we are doing. However, that cannot be instigated without incurring costs.</p>

I may have missed a point during earlier discussion but can he indicate the figure for the initial setting-up costs&#151;we all accept those costs are inevitable as regards the MMO&#151;and in which financial years they will be incurred? What is the final financial year in which he anticipates that the MMO set-up costs will still be a cost to the Exchequer? The &#163;4 million to which he referred will presumably be incurred over a relatively short time. It is a one-off payment, not a recurring figure that goes on for ever. There is always a tendency to think that the setting-up costs of new organisations can be built into their budgets for ever and a day. It is very important that that should not happen.</p>

I assure him that we will ensure that does not happen. I am not sure that I can give him the specifics as regards the financial years in which this will all occur. That depends on achieving the required timing, how that will be managed and various elements relating to staff transfers. However, as I said, we have indicative one-off set costs of &#163;7.2 million; &#163;2.9 million to set up the MMO; &#163;2.1 million for staff costs; and &#163;4.3 million to set up a new geographic information system over three years. The &#163;2.9 MMO set-up costs is an indicative figure informed by those incurred in the setting up of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, the Marine and Fisheries Agency and Natural England, and differs slightly from the &#163;3.7 million that appeared in the impact assessment which accompanied the draft Bill. This is because that figure included Defra staff costs incurred in setting up a new NDPB which we have since been advised should not be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09012856000121"></a>I think the point is made that we all want the MMO to be resourced to do the job. We want it to work as efficiently and effectively as possible.

I can give the appropriate affirmation in that regard, but clearly there will also be these initial set-up costs.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09012856000129"></a>I am not trying to say that there is no place for a government loan; I imagine that there might be many situations where the MMO takes on the financial burden of setting up a scheme that is eventually self-financing. It might be more appropriate in that case for it to apply for a government loan, rather than to deplete resources that are better preserved for less remunerative duties. However, the Bill is not drafted to allow government loans only in areas where there is a financial benefit in so doing. Instead, we have an enormously vague clause that allows the provision of any amount of money under any terms. There is not even a requirement that such loans should be repaid.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09012856000130"></a>Given the enormous power in Clause 30, it might seem a little otiose to seek to limit Clause 33, but the Government&#146;s approach to accounting for government spending and taxpayer commitments has shown us just what can be conveniently left off certain balance sheets when it is unclear what is a payment, what is a loan and what is something else altogether. By ensuring that loans are put on a commercial basis, we can ensure that they are only made when it is financially appropriate for the duty to be funded by such a mechanism, rather than out of the MMO&#146;s general budget. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response, and I would appreciate a fuller explanation of why he envisages making the non-commercial loans to the MMO over and above its annual funding.</p>

<p><a name="09012856000182"></a>Although we might debate the principle, there are sufficient safeguards for the Secretary of State in lending money to the MMO.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09012856000132"></a>I do not think that there is anything exceptional in the clause. It is a facility that is on the books and that could be made available. I accept that it is unusual for departments to make loans to NDPBs from their own budgets or indeed from the National Loans Fund, as funding is usually provided through grant in aid.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09012856000133"></a>I have just inquired into my department&#146;s experience in this area and I have not found any example of such loans being made. I understand that loans to Defra-sponsored public corporations, such as British Waterways and the Covent Garden Market Authority, which have a slightly different status, have been agreed at Treasury standard interest rates, primarily to fund profit-generating capital expenditure projects. That is very different from the circumstances in which the MMO finds itself and is likely to find itself in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09012856000134"></a>On the rates, I can assure the noble Lord that colleagues in the Treasury determine the rates at which any loans may be made to bodies such as NDPBs and indeed any loan is subject to Treasury approval. I should have thought that was a pretty strong guarantee against the Secretary of State making a loan in circumstances which might cause the noble Lord concern.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09012856000135"></a>The clause gives flexibility for arrangements to reflect an economic situation that might arise at the time and the exact requirement for which the loan is required. We do not want to put the body at a disadvantage compared with other bodies in having access to loans on that basis, although I accept that it is difficult at the moment to foresee those circumstances. It is simply a standard provision in the terms and conditions for setting up a non-departmental public body.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09012856000203"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may also give the MMO such general or specific directions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for the implementation of any obligations of the United Kingdom under&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09012856000184"></a>and in paragraphs (a) and (b) EU treaties and international agreements are mentioned. The shipping industry is worried that the phrase &#147;implementation of any obligations&#148; could be restrictively interpreted to refer to only new or future obligations. However, directions given should also respect the UK's pre-existing treaty law obligations under, for example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which deals with such things as innocent rights of passage and freedom of navigation, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and its 1978 MARPOL protocol. My amendment, which adds the words &#147;or compliance with&#148; after &#147;the implementation of&#148;, would remove any shadow of doubt by ensuring that directions to be given to the MMO must cover prior, current and future treaty obligations. I beg to move.</p>

It is one line which says, &#147;This all seems fairly sensible and uncontroversial. Stand up and support&#148;, so here I am. Before I support the amendment, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, on chairing the Joint Committee and producing that excellent report. It has certainly made my life&#151;and, I am sure, all your Lordships&#146; lives&#151;much easier by highlighting so many of the important issues.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09012856000141"></a>I am only too happy to obey my instruction to support the amendment, so ably moved by the noble Lord. Not only does it seem sensible, but I hope the Minister will confirm that the Secretary of State will ensure that all EU treaties and international agreements are complied with.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09012856000142"></a>Since receiving my speaking note, I have been racking my brain for something to add and two points spring to mind. First, Clauses 35 and 36 are about directions and guidance by the Secretary of State. When, last week, I moved Amendment 52 on the need to review guidance from time to time, the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09012856000204"></a>&#147;I can reassure noble Lords that we will review and if necessary amend the guidance at appropriate points&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/09; col. 1705.]</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09012856000143"></a>The Minister went on to list examples of when this might be necessary. With this amendment in mind, perhaps the Minister would add &#147;compliance with EU treaties and international agreements&#148; to his list.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_269"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09012856000144"></a>I have no idea where it came from but I have received a draft Defra booklet, dated December 2008. The photograph of the Minister is to follow, as is his text, so I do not know what the final version says, but on European directives the draft says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09012856000205"></a>&#147;The MMO will play a key role in the implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, but at this stage it has not been decided exactly what form this role will take, or whether the MMO will act as competent authority for the Directive. This will be considered in more detail as part of the ongoing transposition process.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09012856000206"></a>Similarly, the MMO may take on a competent authority role in the marine area in relation to the Environmental Liability Directive but the nature of this role has not yet been decided&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012856000145"></a>Have the Government decided yet whether the MMO will take on the competent authority role and, if not, who will? Indeed, if not, I can add this to my list of areas where the MMO&#146;s authority is being undermined. This goes back to the debate on Amendment 59, when I cited four examples. Oil and gas are covered by DECC; large renewable installations are covered by the IPC; shipping is covered by the Marine and Coastguard Agency; and the marine conservation zones are probably covered by Natural England. If the MMO will not be responsible as the competent authority here, that is yet another thing that I can add to my list.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09012856000146"></a>Secondly, this amendment is all about reacting positively to EU and international agreements, but should the Government not be proactive when dealing with the EU and the international marine community? I have two examples of when this should happen. First, have the Government started negotiations on extending the 12-mile derogation beyond 2012? Secondly, have the Government started talks with EU member states and non-EU countries to ensure that they will respect and abide by our rules with regard to marine conservation zones? The Joint Committee states on page 19 of its report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09012856000207"></a>&#147;The Seafish Industry Authority said that &#145;we are approaching the major problem area of legislating in a way that will control activities of UK nationals but not necessarily non-UK nationals&#146; and that French, Belgian and Spanish fishermen were unlikely to respect the management provisions in an area where they have no requirement to comply&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012856000185"></a>Those are two examples of where the Government should be proactive. I ask the Minister whether they are being proactive in those two areas.</p>

The intention behind the amendment is to clarify that the directions could apply to existing EU and international obligations as well as future commitments as there has been concern that the concept of implementation could be construed as applying only to future obligations. I understand that the concerns relate to obligations under, for example, the MARPOL Convention and the London Convention on dumping at sea.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09012856000150"></a>I have taken advice on this because the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, is valid and is supported by other noble Lords. There is a wealth of existing international commitments, especially in the world of shipping and navigation. Should directions need to be given, it is important that they can relate as much to existing as to new obligations. However, I am assured that the drafting and interpretation of implementation, in our view and those of Department for Transport colleagues who are owners of such matters on shipping, clearly cover existing and new obligations. I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord on that point.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09012856000151"></a>I was enjoying the noble Earl&#146;s speech until he asked me lots of questions. That was when it began to get rather more difficult. I shall try to provide as clear a position as possible. I suspect that we shall come on to marine conservation and to his question about the approach of our neighbours and to the issue of ensuring that not only is due regard paid by nationals of those countries, but that there is a consistent European approach. Essentially, the Marine Management Organisation will not handle policy negotiations in Europe because that will formally rest with the UK Government. In addition, the practicalities of intergovernmental meetings usually cover a wide range of detailed policy issues and are too disparate for a single-policy structure organisation to cover. My understanding is that the competent authority is the UK Government&#151;in other words Ministers&#151;but it is delivered by the MMO for the Government in relation to any functions that remain with the UK Government and the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09012856000152"></a>I take the point about the importance of the MMO&#146;s work internationally, and we want it to develop a reputation for efficient and sustainable use and the protection of UK marine resources. We would expect representatives of the MMO to participate in UK delegations to international meetings. The MMO will provide technical expertise to inform international marine policy negotiations and will keep up to date with developing techniques. As the MMO evolves, we expect it to play a key role in implementing the marine strategy framework directive. We are in discussion with our fellow member states in Europe and I firmly believe that the UK will wish to take a leading role in these matters. The construct of the Bill and the establishment of the MMO are valuable resources in enabling us to do that. On the specific point of the amendment, I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.</p>

I am sure that my noble friend Lord Livsey of Talgarth will wish to speak to the odd-numbered amendments&#151;Amendments 75, 77 and 79&#151;which are the Welsh equivalents.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09012856000155"></a>We have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that a devolution thread weaves its way through the Bill, but it is not always easy to pick it out. The purpose of the amendments is to get more clarity on the MMO and devolution. The amendments would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult Scottish Ministers along with the MMO before giving directions under subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 35. Amendment 74 would add the provision about Scottish Ministers to the end of subsection (3), so, although such consultation would not be required if some emergency arose, good practice might require that they still be consulted. Amendment 76 would apply a statutory requirement to consult Scottish Ministers before the Secretary of State issued guidance to the MMO. I shall deal with Amendment 78 separately.</p>

<a name="90128-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09012856000156"></a>It is not just any consultee that we are discussing or any body that the Secretary of State thinks appropriate. The amendment would oblige the Secretary of State to consult Scottish Ministers, who have an elected mandate and who, from what has already been said about this Bill and parallel legislation to be published shortly in the Scottish Parliament, expect to act in partnership to try to achieve similar goals.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09012856000157"></a>I tried to anticipate the Minister&#146;s response on past form, not least his response to the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Livsey on my behalf on our first day in Committee. The Minister then indicated that he was not willing to agree to the MMO report being laid before the Scottish Parliament, on the basis that the MMO would be delivering functions on behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and would in the main be involved with marine functions in waters around England, as many of these functions are already devolved to the respective Administrations in Scotland and Wales. The amendment would not require blanket consultation but would come into effect only if there was a direction or guidance in relation to Scottish inshore or offshore regions. It is clear from Clause 313(4)(a) that Part 1 of the Bill, dealing with the MMO, will extend to Scotland, so it would be useful if the Minister could give some clarity on the specific functions that the MMO will exercise in relation to Scottish waters.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09012856000158"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, moved the previous amendment, he mentioned international law and the right of innocent passage; if my memory serves me correctly, the transit through the Pentland Firth is such a right recognised in international law. There are, of course, important renewable energy developments planned for the Pentland Firth and, potentially, some conflict&#151;or, at least, the need to liaise&#151;between a requirement or function that the MMO might, on behalf of the UK Government, exercise on general shipping matters under international law and functions related to renewable energy that were being exercised by Scottish Ministers. Therefore, getting proper co-ordination would seem very important.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09012856000159"></a>We are told that Marine Scotland, which is intended to be the parallel organisation to the MMO, will deliver marine functions in Scottish territorial matters and, in respect of devolved matters, in the offshore area. Can the Minister give greater clarification on what the MMO will be delivering in terms of non-devolved functions in that area? What are these functions? Do they, for example, include nature conservation, the exploitation of hydrocarbons or the marine transport to which I referred? It would be useful to get a better understanding of that.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09012856000160"></a>Also, if the MMO will be exercising quite important functions in the Scottish offshore area&#151;and, possibly, the Scottish inshore area&#151;that underlines the importance of ensuring that there is co-ordination and that, when the Secretary of State intends to issue directions or guidance, there has been prior consultation with Scottish Ministers to ensure co-operation. A good fit between what both Administrations are doing would be in the interests of comity, as would Amendment 78.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09012856000161"></a>As things stand&#151;and here we move forward to Clause 38&#151;on an interim basis the Secretary of State can, as I understand it, requisition the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish Executive to provide the MMO with,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000214"></a>&#147;temporary ... staff, premises or other facilities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000186"></a>Given that the Scotland Act 1998 established the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive, I assume that they fall within the definition of a statutory body. It would not really be in the interests of comity for the Secretary of State to do that. Could the Minister clarify that that is not the intention? I beg to move.</p>

That is not least because of the legislation involved but also because so many different constituent bodies have to be taken into account. They include the EU, the UK Government, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland parliament. They are all part of the Bill, which means that the terms of the legislation have to be predicated around the different legislative bodies.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09012856000163"></a>We certainly found it of great assistance that the Government kindly issued both a brief on devolution and a set of maps. While helping a good deal, those also served to illustrate just how difficult this issue is. Within the material, the Government themselves state that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000215"></a>&#147;the marine environment is a complex mix of devolved, non-devolved and retained matters&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09012856000187"></a>It is interesting that in their brief they say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09012856000209"></a>&#147;The UK Government will legislate for England, the waters around England&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09012856000188"></a>for waters,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000216"></a>&#147;around the UK, and for certain functions within the territorial waters of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000189"></a>That is precisely the area where we need the Minister to make things absolutely plain.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09012856000164"></a>In this set of amendments, we are dealing not with the powers of legislation but with areas where the Secretary of State is likely to give directions or guidance. My impression, for Scotland, is that this can only be in the Scottish offshore area, as the zero to 12 nautical miles limit has already been devolved, as I understand. It is practically a part of Scotland. The Marine Management Organisation presumably is not intended to have any powers whatever in that area.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09012856000165"></a>I support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, because it is important that we clarify this issue. They sensibly point out that for the purposes of consultation and guidance, if there is any overlap, the Secretary of State cannot simply confer with the MMO but must also consult the appropriate devolved powers.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09012856000166"></a>On the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, the issue must surely be considerably different for Wales, where there is not the same degree of devolution as there is in Scotland. I am not aware of the inshore area being devolved at all at the moment. It would surely be sensible that, before giving guidance to the MMO, the Secretary of State must consult Welsh Ministers in so far as the guidance relates to them.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09012856000167"></a>I make the same request as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, that the Minister give us some detail about the type of guidance that may affect non-English areas. Does he have any real evidence that that will be needed and can he give his assurance that the devolved Administrations will be consulted? If that is necessary, why not include it in the Bill?</p>

What I have to say largely mirrors what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, said and, to some extent, what the noble Duke just said. Amendment 75 refers to directions by the Secretary of State for Wales. It mirrors Amendment 74, in that the aim is to ensure that, before giving directions, the Secretary of State must also consult Welsh Ministers where such directions apply to the Welsh inshore region or, indeed, the Welsh offshore region. I am sure that the Minister will regard the amendment as making a perfectly reasonable request. There will be an impact on the Welsh inshore region, as featured on the department&#146;s maps, which he kindly gave us recently. Given that the Welsh offshore region is now defined, consultation by the Secretary of State would clearly be necessary, not least for the fishery interests involved, before the MMO could fully consider the overall situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09012856000169"></a>What really concerns us is that later in the Bill&#151;I shall not pre-empt that too much&#151;there are references to inshore fisheries conservation authorities. There is concern in Wales that there is insufficient reference to the sustainability of fisheries. If the MMO has powers regarding IFCAs, it appears that they are not sufficient in Wales. That reflects what has just been said: devolution in Wales does not go anything like as far as it does in Scotland. Those matters need to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09012856000170"></a>In Amendment 77, the same principle about guidance applies in Clause 36. Where matters directly impact on a Welsh region, Welsh Ministers must be consulted. Clause 36(2) is inadequate, with its reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000217"></a>&#147;such other bodies or persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000190"></a>Our amendment would ensure that the guidance was subject to the Secretary of State consulting Welsh Ministers. I am sure that the Minister will not find that a difficult principle to absorb.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09012856000171"></a>Amendment 79 would ensure that, under Clause 38, the Secretary of State&#146;s notice with the interim arrangements did not apply to the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Assembly Government, as the amendment would exclude those Acts of Parliament&#151;the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 2006&#151;that established the Welsh Government and increased the powers of the National Assembly. Some of these matters are found in the 1998 Act, which deals with, for example, legal proceedings and the public interest, where the public interest is defined as being of the Welsh public in terms of devolution. These matters are of concern and, as far as IFCAs and MCZs are concerned, will come up later in the Bill.</p>

However, I will just say to the Minister that, before he replies to my noble friend&#146;s question about where any guidance given by the Secretary of State to the MMO might impact on Scotland, he might think about the fact that it is not particularly courteous to refer to the elected Scots Parliament as one of &#147;such other bodies&#148;.</p>

It therefore seems appropriate to include that area within the areas to which directions may apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09012856000175"></a>Another matter to which I draw the Committee&#146;s attention is that the Scottish Parliament is bound to recognise, for instance, the effect of EU treaties, just as much as it recognises those international agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party for the time being. There again, it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State, in looking to both the Scottish offshore region and the Scottish inshore region, over which the Scottish Parliament has responsibility, to consult Scottish Ministers to be sure that they are at one on the proper interpretation. That might be important in relation to whether under subsection (4) there truly is an emergency, in the sense that the emergency may evolve from the Scottish inshore region and affect the Scottish offshore region, for which of course the MMO would have immediate responsibility.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09012856000176"></a>For those reasons, I generally support these  two amendments. I take no particular issue with Amendment 78, which seems to be perfectly sensible, but I have a small comment on the drafting of Amendment 74. Clause 35(3) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012856000218"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State must consult&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012856000191"></a>It would be unfortunate if, as in the amendment, &#147;shall&#148; was used instead of &#147;must&#148;. In this regard, we use words of direction slightly differently in various parts of the Bill. We have &#147;may&#148; and &#147;must&#148;, and we have introduced &#147;is to&#148;. I have asked before whether &#147;is to&#148; is a &#147;must&#148; or a &#147;may&#148;. That was exemplified in the debate that we have just had on Clause 23. Subsection (1) of that clause says &#147;may&#148; and subsection (2) says &#147;is to&#148;. I would have thought that &#147;must&#148; was more appropriate. I simply suggest that we look carefully at how we use words of direction and that we use the well known parliamentary language of either &#147;may&#148; or &#147;must&#148;, unless, in the particular area in which the words are being used, neither &#147;may&#148; nor &#147;must&#148; is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09012873000002"></a>The Bill in essence recognises that the marine environment involves a complex mix of devolved and non-devolved, or reserved, matters and its intention is to respect the provisions of the current devolution settlement. The strategic framework for marine planning, which it introduces, has now been agreed by all four Administrations&#151;a development since the publication of the draft marine Bill in April 2008. The provision in the draft Bill that restricted the marine policy statement in form and impact in Scotland drew criticism from several witnesses to the Joint Committee. The committee believed that it was essential that the marine policy statement and plans had the active support and approval of all the devolved Administrations; indeed, it regarded as imperative the production of an agreed marine policy statement that has consensus across the devolved Administrations, including Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09012873000003"></a>Subsequent to the Joint Committee&#146;s report and the work of the joint ministerial committee, I believe that we have achieved a satisfactory outcome. There is no doubt that the Scottish Executive will look for the further legislative devolution of new powers in areas such as marine planning and nature conservation where they feel that governance could be as appropriate from Scotland as from this House. The UK Government have not agreed to that, but we have agreed to the devolution of new functions in the Bill in a form of executive devolution. That allows for a more coherent delivery of the common objectives in the Bill that we all share and ensures the real engagement of those who are closest to the waters in question and the protection of key reserved interests, such as oil, gas and shipping.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09012873000004"></a>The UK Government will legislate in the Bill for England, for the waters around England, for the offshore waters around the UK and for certain functions within the territorial waters of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where we have agreed between us to do so. That means that not all the original proposals in the draft Bill will apply to the whole of the UK. Where proposals do not apply&#151;for example, in the territorial waters of Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;there are proposals for legislation to be brought forward by the relevant Administrations to deliver similar reforms and systems as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09012873000005"></a>Most of the provisions of the Bill extend to Wales with the agreement of the Welsh Assembly Government, but in some instances the Bill reflects their wishes for different delivery mechanisms&#151;for example, on inshore fisheries management, where they do not intend to create inshore fisheries and conservation authorities but intend to deliver the same measure in another way. The Bill also delivers framework powers for the creation of a coastal path in Wales. This will allow the Assembly Government to bring forward measures which are tailored to meet the specific circumstances of Wales and which take account of work that is under way under their coastal access improvement programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09012873000006"></a>Under the Bill, devolved Administrations become the planning authority for the relevant offshore region under a form of executive devolution. That means that their marine plans will be subject to agreement by the Secretary of State before they can impact on decisions across the breadth of marine interests. Scottish Ministers also become the designating authority for marine conservation zones in the offshore region. Again, proposed designations are subject to agreement by the Secretary of State. For Wales, the Bill takes the opportunity to create a Welsh fisheries zone out to the median line. This delivers parity with Scotland and Northern Ireland, which already have fishery zones for the coherent delivery of fisheries management across the inshore and offshore regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09012873000007"></a>I know from talking to a number of noble Lords, both in the Chamber and outside, that there is a perception that we have here a rather fragmented and complex system, which perhaps does not deliver the benefits that the Bill was intended to provide. I disagree with that. Essentially, the Bill recognises the reality of  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_277"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the devolution settlement but it contains provisions to make sure that, as far as possible, there is a consistent approach. I emphasise to the Committee the importance of the joint ministerial statement in the autumn, because it sets out a good framework for making sure that this works from a UK point of view.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09012873000008"></a>Amendments 74 to 77 propose changes to Clauses 35 and 36 to require the Secretary of State to consult Scottish Ministers before issuing directions or guidance to the MMO that might apply to the Scottish inshore or offshore regions and to consult Welsh Ministers before issuing directions or guidance to the MMO that might apply to the Welsh inshore or offshore regions. I understand the purpose behind these amendments, which is to keep the devolved Administrations fully involved in delivering the Bill through the MMO. We would normally expect the MMO to operate without direction. This clause allows directions to be given where appropriate, but it would not be normal practice for directions or guidance to be given to the MMO in relation to Scottish inshore areas where Marine Scotland, the Scottish equivalent of the MMO, will operate&#151;the noble Duke made that point&#151;or the Welsh inshore areas, which will be governed not by an agency but by Welsh Ministers and officials acting for them.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09012873000009"></a>Directions or guidance in the offshore region could relate to reserved matters, but we would not expect that to be normal practice. Shipping and oil and gas exploration, for example, are reserved matters, as is defence. Nature conservation enforcement in the Welsh offshore region will be enforced by the MMO, as will licensing of dredging. If matters relating to implementation of EU or international obligations required the MMO to take a co-ordinating role on behalf of the UK Government&#151;it is the UK Government who have to accept that responsibility&#151;we would expect the MMO to undertake consultation with whomever would be affected in the devolved Administrations throughout the UK area. It will be made clear in the objectives set for the MMO that normal good practice behaviour on consultation will apply.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09012873000010"></a>I can assure Members of the Committee that this is already the practice of existing marine and fisheries agencies whose functions the MMO will subsume. We continue to expect consultation to take place with colleagues from whichever Administration might be affected by the guidance issued. For example, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has regular meetings with ministerial colleagues from the other Administrations on fisheries and marine matters. We work closely to agree UK objectives for EU and international negotiations and we have worked closely with the other Administrations on this Bill to secure support for the measures that we are introducing.</p>

<a name="90128-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09012873000011"></a>I am well aware that the Scottish marine Bill has just been subject to consultation in Scotland. My understanding is that it has received widespread support, which is very welcome. Its provisions mirror in large part the provisions of the UK Bill, confirming the support that the Scottish Executive have for the objectives of the Bill. Clearly, where devolved Administrations legislate for themselves, the Government will need to be closely involved to press for coherence across the

Our position is that we will continue to pursue with the devolved Administrations an integrated approach for the benefit of the marine environment and/or marine users.</p>

Their amendments are designed to exclude any body set up under the Scotland Act or the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 2006 from the bodies on which the Secretary of State may call to provide staff facilities or premises to the MMO on a temporary basis to aid transition to the new organisation. The existing functions being transferred into the MMO comprise functions carried out by UK government departments, such as my department, the Department for Transport and the Department of Energy and Climate Change. It is not proposed to transfer into the MMO any functions carried out by Scottish or Welsh statutory bodies&#151;indeed, any functions carried out by the devolved Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09012873000013"></a>In conclusion, I very much understand the complexities of this matter and the need to ensure that the UK Government and the devolved Administrations work together.

As I understand it, the Scottish Parliament will not legislate for the Scottish offshore area. It will not have powers of legislation; it will just have executive devolution. Do I understand from that and from what the Minister said earlier that, when Marine Scotland comes up with plans for conservation in the offshore area, those plans will have to be checked with the Secretary of State? From what the Minister said, it seems that anything occurring in that area will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State. Under the MMO and, presumably, under the Scottish Parliament in the Scottish offshore area, there will be powers to license developments. The plans that we were offered say that the Scottish Ministers will have to issue a FEPA licence and a marine licence when proposals are made. Does that give them a power of veto on proposals for oil platforms, pipelines and such things?</p>

The noble Duke is right to say that marine plans will be subject to agreement by the Secretary of State before they can impact on decisions across the breadth of marine interests. The Scottish Administration will also become the designating authority for marine conservation zones in the offshore region. Again, those proposed designations are subject to agreement by the Secretary of State.  The noble Duke put that point fairly and I have  answered it as clearly as I can. As for licensing,

I share the disappointment of my noble friend Lord Livsey of Talgarth, because, although a lot of good will has been expressed, it has not been taken that extra bit further and translated into putting the proposals into the Bill. As everyone recognises, the amendments would not get in the way of anything. Indeed, if there was a conflict or problem, they would ensure that there was a requirement for co-operation. You do not need that if there is no difficulty, but the amendments would take care of those circumstances where there was a difficulty and where co-operation and consultation were necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09012873000018"></a>I thank the Minister for explaining in more detail the set-up for ensuring that we cover the whole of the United Kingdom&#146;s waters through the various Administrations. It is no small achievement that the four Administrations have reached this agreement. I am sure that, in all Parliaments and Assemblies, we will want to ensure that we put in place the right statutory mechanisms to take that forward.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09012873000019"></a>I will not dwell on this point, because I have raised it with the Minister outwith the Chamber, and there may be other opportunities. However, I still have a concern. The Minister confirmed to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, that marine planning in the offshore region will be done by way of executive devolution. My concern is for the marine Bill that comes before the Scottish Parliament. I will take a simple example, which there will be an opportunity to debate later. There will be a duty on public bodies in Scotland to promote biodiversity in inshore waters. However, the Scottish Parliament cannot make that requirement; Scottish Ministers cannot put that into a plan for the offshore region, because the Scottish Parliament does not have the legislative capacity to do that. This House and the other place may have to pass the legislation. There is a potential gap here, which we should examine, perhaps in a later amendment.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09012873000020"></a>There is another point that I would like the Minister to respond to if he can. When drafting the amendment, I deliberated on whether to make any reference to the Scottish inshore area. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, gave cogent reasons why it is necessary to do so. I am influenced by the fact that the MMO area defined in Clause 2(2) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012873000074"></a>&#147;those parts of the UK marine area, or of the United Kingdom, where MMO functions are exercisable&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09012873000071"></a>So far as I can see, the &#147;UK marine area&#148; as defined in Clause 40 does not appear to exclude the Scottish inshore area, although many other clauses expressly do so. That takes us back to the argument that it could be excluded by way of MMO functions in that those functions are not exercisable in the inshore area, but the fact that there is no express exclusion in the clause has made me wonder whether there are any functions for the MMO here.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09012873000021"></a>I shall give one example. For the past two or three years, and certainly in the last year during which I was in the Scottish Parliament, a recurring controversy arose over ship-to-ship oil transhipments in the Firth of Forth. The activity generated a considerable amount of debate. I recall that one of the explanations that Scottish Ministers had to give to the Scottish Parliament was that, as I recall, the licensing of such activities lies with UK Government Ministers at Westminster. The Firth of Forth is clearly in Scottish inshore waters. My question is this: are there functions exercised by UK Ministers related to Scottish inshore waters that may be transferred to the MMO which we have not yet picked up? It would be unfortunate if we discovered that some functions that are reserved to UK Ministers nevertheless relate to Scottish inshore waters. If the Minister cannot answer now, perhaps he will write to me and to other noble Lords.</p>

They are civil servants and under the Bill will move to the new Marine Management Organisation. As I understand it, they will not retain their status as civil servants because the MMO will be a non-departmental public body. I know of no overriding reason why the staff concerned, some 200 to 250 of them, cannot continue to be civil servants, retaining the same rights, responsibilities and conditions of service as they have now. I do not know whether the Minister will be surprised to hear me say this, but the staff concerned are proud to be civil servants. They have chosen careers in public service and neither welcome nor want the loss of Civil Service status and conditions and the ability to continue to access Civil Service jobs.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09012873000026"></a>If my understanding of the Bill is right, it is unfortunate when Governments, in order to achieve their policy objectives, find it necessary to adversely affect the position of the staff most directly affected. Why does that have to be done? Are we really being told that the policy objectives could not otherwise be achieved? As I understand it, there are no plans to remove Civil Service status from staff in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, where similar functions to those in England are carried out.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09012873000027"></a>There is also an issue that is addressed in another amendment: if the creation of the MMO results in the removal of Crown immunity, staff may become personally liable for actions taken in the course of their duties&#151;for example, changes in fishing quotas to conserve stocks, or the opening and closing of areas for fishing for the same reason. If the Government are still determined to set up the MMO as a non-departmental public body, I point out that other NDPBs such as ACAS, the Health and Safety Executive and the new Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission have all retained Civil Service status for staff. I believe that the Government&#146;s original intention was to establish CMEC as an NDPB with no civil servants, but subsequently they stated that it was to be given Crown status and that its staff would retain Civil Service status for at least three years.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09012873000028"></a>On top of the change of status of the staff and the implications of that for the future regarding terms and conditions, there is the prospect of at least some staff finding that the post they hold now has been transferred if the headquarters of the MMO is outside London. What is the position on that? If the headquarters is moved outside London it is likely that a majority of staff will not be prepared to relocate, and expertise and experience will be lost. I have been told that staff were given to understand that they would be advised of the intentions regarding the future location or locations just before Christmas, but nothing was said. I am also advised that an announcement on MFA relocation was expected on 22 January, but that again  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_282"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the staff were informed that the decision had been delayed. On 23 January the Plymouth-based <I>Western Morning News</I> announced that the headquarters would be in Newcastle. Do the Government think that the issue of relocation is being well handled? What is the present position?</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09012873000029"></a>The best way of dealing with the unwanted change in status of the staff would be for the Government to say that the MMO would be an executive agency, an agent of the Crown, and that its staff would be regarded as servants or agents of the Crown and enjoy the status, immunity and privilege of the Crown. I hope my noble friend will agree to give consideration to this point, which would make my amendment unnecessary, with a view to his bringing back amendments to the Bill at a later stage to achieve that objective.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09012873000030"></a>The MFA was set up in October 2005 and has proved successful. It would be entirely capable, with or without a change of name, of carrying out the new functions and remit outlined in the Bill. The main significant difference between the current MFA and the proposed MMO appears to be marine planning responsibilities, on which I am told less than 10 per cent of the staff will be engaged.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09012873000031"></a>My amendment to Schedule 3 would address the situation in the Bill. The schedule provides that if an employee at the Marine and Fisheries Agency objects to being transferred to the new organisation, the employee&#146;s contract of employment is terminated immediately before the transfer date. Presumably, the employee is then faced with the threat of being classified as having resigned voluntarily on refusal to accept change of status. At a time when departments are under instructions to reduce head counts, that threat could become a reality in some instances where an individual has no wish to accept redundancy. There has been no commitment from Defra that staff who do not want to lose their Civil Service status will be found another Civil Service post within the department. There are also a small number of MFA staff based in each of a number of different coastal offices. What will happen to them if they do not wish to accept the change in status? Will they be offered another Civil Service post and, if so, where?</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09012873000032"></a>Many of the MFA are specialist staff. This proposed change in status and possibly location risks the loss of specialist skills and expertise. Even those who remain may well find themselves in a post that is of little interest to them and which does not use their skills to maximum advantage. Is this really the Government&#146;s intention? Is it the way to treat staff?</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09012873000033"></a>My amendment&#146;s purpose is to at least ensure that an employee working at the Marine and Fisheries Agency who expresses objection to the transfer of the contract of employment, on the grounds of losing the status of Crown servant, continues to have that contract of employment after the transfer date and is to be regarded as an employee of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, with the status of Crown servant. I hope that my noble friend&#146;s reply will show that the Government share my view that there is no reason why the staff affected by the policy changes in the Bill will suffer adverse consequences to the extent that would occur under the Bill.</p>

I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply with interest. It would be well if the Committee were informed of the details of what is anticipated in staffing the MMO. It would be useful to know, for example, the estimates of the number of Crown servants who are being brought in from various departments and government agencies to staff up the MMO. I well understand the Government&#146;s concern about having two classes of employees within a single body; that could create enormous difficulties. However, it would be useful to understand the Government&#146;s reasoning on the core of the matter.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09012873000035"></a>As for the location being suggested to be Newcastle, the footballers of Grimsby are known as &#147;the Mariners&#148;. Without doubt, as Grimsby has the distinctions of being not only in Lincolnshire but also the pre-eminent fishing port of the United Kingdom, it would make an ideal location for the MMO.</p>

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="09012873000036"></a><b><a name="90128-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09012873000090"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> We on these Benches also look forward with interest to clarification from the Minister. On the issue of staffing generally, I hope that the Minister will agree that anything that causes unnecessary disruption, with the effect of reducing the expertise and commitment of existing staff, is to be avoided if it possibly can be. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, is therefore making a serious point about the body of information and skill in the existing institutions and the need to avoid any unnecessary disruption.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09012873000037"></a>There are two issues with location. We are obviously looking forward to hearing whether the Minister can confirm the rumour&#151;or was it a leak?&#151;that Newcastle has been chosen. That shows a disrespect for the skills and experience of the existing staff, who may find this a disturbing and unsettling period for then. If the announcement that appeared in my regional paper, the <I>Western Morning News</I>, was in any way authenticated, that is to be deprecated.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09012873000038"></a>However, I cannot agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said about Lincolnshire for obvious reasons. The availability of these skills in the south-west, where expert information is available in a number of institutions and given its proximity not just to the Western Approaches but to the Irish Sea, makes it a far more appropriate location than the far north-east. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is no longer present, as I think he would argue the case for Plymouth as against the location proposed by other Members of the Conservative Front Bench. The problem with the far north-east is that it is almost in Scotland, for goodness&#146; sake, where, as my noble friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness would agree, a quite different regime applies. Having the MMO on its doorstep is obviously much less advantageous than locating it in the south-west.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09012873000039"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a specific double assurance that, first and foremost, that decision has not been leaked and, secondly, that discussions are still taking place to find a more appropriate location than Newcastle.</p>

I was delighted to hear my noble friend say that the current staff are proud to be civil servants. When one hears rather ridiculous remarks about civil servants being made by people who should know better, I am glad to stand here and say how much I have enjoyed working with civil servants over the years and what a huge contribution they make.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09012873000042"></a>The designation of the Marine Management Organisation as a non-departmental public body is a visible sign of the status of that organisation. I respect the decision of the Welsh Assembly Government to carry out directly the functions that are akin to those of the MMO. However, in the English context, to retain the MMO functions in my department, or to place them with an executive agency, would not accord the right status to this important body. I return to the discussion we had during the first two Committee days when emphasis was laid time and again on the critical importance of the MMO and the importance of it being able to make its own decisions within the guidance and general objectives that have been laid down. I think that non-departmental body status is the right status for the organisation.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09012873000043"></a>I say to my noble friend that, as a non-departmental public body, its staff will be public servants, not Crown servants, which is very much the usual position. He referred to a number of organisations staffed by Crown servants. However, my understanding is that of the 1,000 or so non-departmental public bodies, only three are staffed by Crown servants on a permanent basis. Their designation as public servants rather than Crown servants reflects the independent nature of non-departmental public bodies. It allows those staff a measure of independence and gives them the ability to speak more freely than would otherwise be the case. It also gives them the flexibility that noble Lords have required of the MMO in our previous debates. As public servants, MMO staff will in practice be treated very much the same as existing MFA staff. They will be transferred to the MMO on the same contractual terms and conditions of employment and any subsequent changes to their terms and conditions will require the approval of the Secretary of State. They will be entitled to trade union membership. I am glad to report to the noble Baroness that their pensions will be retained in the Civil Service pension scheme. They will be able to apply for Civil Service vacancies in the same way as other civil servants. In short, there is no reason for MMO staff to feel disadvantaged by virtue of becoming public servants.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09012873000044"></a>My noble friend, fairly, asked a number of questions. He asked what would happen to MFA staff who simply did not wish to transfer to the Marine Management Organisation. As staff will transfer to the MMO with their contractual terms and conditions of employment preserved, there should be no reason to object to the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_285"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transfer, and it is expected that all staff will transfer. Should any member of staff choose not to do so, their contract of employment with the MFA will be terminated. They would have been deemed to have resigned their post. I understand that this is the usual form in which transfers to NDPBs are effected.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09012873000045"></a>I very much understand the question of relocation. I always regret leaks, and I can well understand the concern of staff when they read stories in a local newspaper about the location. I am not in a position to give any more information at this stage. I have checked, and the answer is that we will announce this when all the information and evidence have been carefully considered. It will be announced in Parliament in due course. Frankly, the shortlisted locations all would have made a very good home for the MMO, and this has been a very difficult decision. I understand that this is a very important decision for the staff involved, and I can only regret that some kind of allegation has appeared in a local newspaper. I understand people&#146;s concern on this.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09012873000046"></a>Those staff who are unable or unwilling to relocate raise a different issue from the first point asked by my noble friend about staff who object to transferring to the MMO. Relocation is a separate issue. Those staff who are unable or unwilling to relocate will be placed on my department&#146;s redeployment register. This will give those staff first refusal on any vacancies in the Defra network. In addition, those staff will have preferential access to other jobs across Whitehall. The MFA has appointed a resettlement officer, who will help staff to prepare for redeployment. Staff will receive training and help with CV writing, for example. After a period of six months, any staff who have not found an alternative job will be reassigned to Defra. There is no question of compulsory redundancies as a direct result of the relocation.</p>

<a name="90128-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09012873000047"></a>My noble friend asked about staff losing immunity on becoming staff of the MMO. My understanding is that, as a general principle, civil servants enjoy immunity only under a specific circumstance for which Crown immunity applies. There is no general immunity for civil servants, so we do not think that there is a need to provide protection for individual employees working for the MMO generally. Such decisions would be taken on behalf of the MMO, so any potential claim would lie against the MMO and not an individual officer. Specific immunity is given in the Bill to marine enforcement officers and other enforcement officers, who need to be protected when they carry out inspections and investigations at sea and on land, so long as they are acting lawfully within their powers. Otherwise, their freedom to perform their duties would be hampered by fear of legal action being taken against them. Even if sued, if MMO employees are acting in the course of their duties, the MMO would be vicariously liable for their actions.</p>

I accept the point that he made earlier about efficiencies. It will take on additional senior management and corporate centre staff. If additional functions are moved to the MMO, over time that may lead to an increase in staff numbers. My understanding is that, in total, the MMO will have about 240 posts set up, but the exact number of staff transferring from other departments has not been resolved because functions will go from the same teams in the Department for Transport and the Department of Energy and Climate Change to the IPC, with some relevant policy roles being retained within those departments. Some matters still have to be resolved. That is as much information as I can give.</p>

As his final answer indicated, the great bulk of the staff in the new organisation will be existing civil servants, which, once again, begs the question why this change in status is considered to be so crucial. My noble friend referred to significant numbers of NDPBs where the staff were not civil servants and he said that that enhanced their independent status. Does that mean that he is on record as saying that he does not think ACAS is independent; does that mean he is on record as saying that he does not think the Health and Safety Executive is independent; does that mean he is on record as saying that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is not independent?</p>

This is a probing amendment to clarify exactly what the Government achieve with the establishment of the exclusive economic zone. Can the Minister first reassure the House that we have received Her Majesty&#146;s full permission to allocate her rights, as envisaged under this clause? As I understand it, and I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, our rights under this zone are identical to those that the UK was able to exercise under the existing renewable energy zone and, even more, under the 200-mile fishery limit. If this is the case, many of the provisions that we will come to later need to be viewed through the very dark glass of

I hope that this debate might clear some of the darkness and allow us to assess more realistically just what we can and cannot expect of the organisations that we are empowering in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09012873000060"></a>As allowed under the current EU arrangements, and as my noble friend Lord Cathcart began to point out, these arrangements fall and are due to be renewed in 2012. The UK has complete control over its fishing waters only up to the six-nautical-mile limit. These arrangements have already caused much delay and obstruction to the effective conservation of our fish stocks and other species. For example, an attempt to ban pair trawling for bass in 2004 has had an extremely limited effect, as it was not supported by the EU Commission, and so cannot apply to non-UK ships beyond six nautical miles. For a conservation zone beyond the six-nautical-mile limit to be applied to all EU fishing boats, and so have a chance of achieving its objectives, it is clear that it must not only be approved by the EU Commission but avoid being overturned by the European Council. The difficulty of pushing a meaningful network of conservation zones through this bureaucracy is presumably one of the reasons why the Government have decided to take upon themselves the unilateral powers described in Part 5.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09012873000061"></a>Do the Government have any reason for believing that marine conservation zones imposed within the exclusive economic zone, but beyond the six-nautical-mile limit, will be any more successful than their attempt in 2004 to stop pair trawling? Or do they intend conservation zones to be established within the six-mile limit, making the new economic zone relevant only to planning, energy installations and licensed dredging? What is worse, the current situation&#151;far from perfect&#151;will quite possibly get much worse in a few years. As I mentioned earlier, in 2012 the derogation limit of fishing within 12 nautical miles to historic rights will come to an end, and our unilateral ability to protect the marine environment will be further reduced. However, the Government appear to be doing nothing to protect what limited rights we still have, let alone seeking to extend our powers in this area. Can the Minister give the House any reassurance that they are seeking to protect the existing restrictions within the 12-mile boundary? Even better, have they made any progress in establishing how they feel about common fisheries policy reform?</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09012873000062"></a>The EU promises to bring forward a package of marine protection proposals, which might go some way to improving the current arrangements for fish conservation in our waters. However, if we are to rely on the EU to do all the work in this area for us, there is little purpose in discussing what we want to achieve with this Bill. The Government must either take steps to ensure that the appropriate authorities have the power to impose and enforce effective protections, or admit that much of the Bill will be ineffective unless the EU takes the necessary steps to do it for us. I beg to move.</p>

The reason is that the noble Duke has hung a significant discussion about the common fisheries policy on this amendment. I do not doubt for a moment that we will discuss the common fisheries policy in the context of this part of the Bill and, indeed, this clause, but I had not anticipated that it would occur on this particular amendment. I am therefore grateful that he preceded his remarks by saying that this was a probing amendment. I can indicate that he will probe quite successfully over a narrow area, but I rather hope that the debate on the common fisheries policy might be raised more appropriately a little later. If he does not accept that position, I will be more extensive on the common fisheries policy, but this amendment does not really have much to do with the common fisheries policy because we are not changing boundaries as far as it is concerned.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09012873000064"></a>Clauses 39, 40 and 41 establish an exclusive economic zone, define the UK marine area and allow for the establishment of the Welsh zone. They are the base on which the remainder of the Bill rests. On this base is the whole concept of what we are discussing in planning for the future. The establishment of an unambiguous, clearly defined set of boundaries provides a clear basis for various maritime activities. I do not for one moment deny the significance of fishing, but the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, will be well aware that a range of maritime activities concern us in this Bill and are conducted around the coast of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09012873000065"></a>We are explicitly setting out the seaward and landward limits of the UK marine area and establishing an exclusive economic zone which will ensure conformity with international best practice on law-of-the-sea matters. If, as the amendment indicates, subsection (2) is left out of Clause 39, the clause&#146;s position would be, effectively, destroyed. Subsections (1) and (3) make no sense at all without subsection (2), which defines the rights to which the other two subsections apply. The definition in subsection (2) refers back to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and makes clear that the rights which the UK is claiming are only those for which Part 5 of the convention provides. The clause is needed to enable the UK to declare an exclusive economic zone, which is at the very heart of the Bill, in accordance with the UK&#146;s obligations under these provisions, and the reference is therefore absolutely essential.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09012873000066"></a>I could follow the noble Duke down the issue of one of the particular economic activities and discuss fisheries policy; I recognise that that debate is important and I shall not shy away from it. However, in terms of clarity I seek to establish that I cannot accept, nor should the House accept, the proposal in the amendment, because that would render absolutely nugatory the fundamental concept of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, will accept that the common fisheries policy will be fruitfully discussed within the framework of these clauses&#151;there is no way in which it would not. I hope that he will understand that if I engage in that specific debate about an exceedingly important economic activity within

The main thing that I was focusing on, although I did raise the problems of the common fisheries policy, was the question of the authority that we expect to have on the establishment of marine conservation zones. No doubt we will have a debate on that issue in due course. I have heard in the past few months, although I cannot remember which piece of legislation it related to, that Her Majesty was waiving her rights. I wanted to confirm that that was not attached to this legislation.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09012873000069"></a>Perhaps I may help the noble Duke with regard to the fisheries policy. We are not changing the concept of the territorial sea and the 12-nautical-mile limit. On these changes, we are concerned with the issues 200 miles out. The law of the sea defines our position with regard to our waters 200 miles from our coast. Of course, it is not possible to go 200 miles in some directions, due to the limits of the ocean, but in certain directions it is possible. That 200-mile limit is not entirely adequate for us, because we seek to extend the UK&#146;s rights in relation to the continental shelf. Geology does not follow the 200-mile boundary with quite the exactitude we would like. In the Bill, we are seeking, therefore, to extend our position in relation to the continental shelf, but to do that we need to be able to negotiate the issues under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That is why we have to have this clause in the form in which it appears, and in a form which defends it against the noble Duke&#146;s amendment.</p>

It is rather useful to know how the clause will be applied. We are still worried that we do not have the powers that we need out to 200 miles, but perhaps we can look at that again. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_291"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between low water and MMO&#146;s influence all the way up rivers as far as the high tide reaches. There is quite a discrepancy between what is in the Bill and what is in <I>A Strategy for Promoting an Integrated Approach to the Management of Coastal Areas in England</I>, in which the Government state that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000116"></a>&#147;marine plan authorities must have regard to other plans prepared by a public or local authority in that marine plan area. This will facilitate integration and include Local Development Plans within the Local Development Framework; Shoreline Management Plans; and River Basin Management Plans. The marine plan authority will be required to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, compatibility with adjacent terrestrial plans&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012880000105"></a>That is what my amendments go to the heart of. I am very concerned that there is no real mechanism in the Bill for ensuring compatibility.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09012880000002"></a>Perhaps noble Lords should think for a moment about the area between high and low water and all the activities that take place there. Those include lifeguarding; games on the beach such as volleyball, which may form part of a local authority&#146;s leisure plans; boating, canoeing and that sort of activity; and perhaps flood defences, in which the Environment Agency and the local authority are very much involved. The area between high and low water is extremely biodiverse; it is where one finds a lot of birds, shellfish and rock pools full of prawns, sea anemones, mussels, seaweeds, and so on. An awful lot goes on between high and low water.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09012880000003"></a>My concern is about making this area simply one for which the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s plan is responsible, given that local authorities are not part of the list of eligible bodies that we discussed in relation to Clause 16. I could have chosen to address this issue by including them in that list. However, I thought about all the activities that take place between high and low water and all the activities that local authorities are primarily responsible for in that area, including one that was very recently given to them by the Government&#151;cleaning the beaches&#151;as well as access to beaches, car parking and highway issues on access roads to the beach, some of which are covered by high water. All of these matters have not been adequately thought about, given the way in which the Bill is phrased.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09012880000004"></a>The Joint Committee was similarly concerned that there was no mention of integrated coastal management in the Bill. The committee&#146;s report states in paragraph 105:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09012880000113"></a>&#147;The planning and decision-making process at the land/sea interface is particularly important for certain industries, such as ports and offshore developments&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012880000106"></a>Again, the planning authorities need to think about that. These things all come down to local authorities.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09012880000005"></a>Primarily, I am talking not about development control but about the planning in its widest sense that local authorities undertake. That is why I have tabled the first of these amendments. The Marine Management Organisation is concerned with everything that happens at sea, which is not the area between high and low water where a lot of human activity takes place. That should be the rightful domain of the coastal authorities, which have to plan for social and economic issues. Of course environmental issues are already covered by the designations where appropriate by Natural England. If the marine conservation zones happen to fall within  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_292"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that area, as some will, that will be taken into account, but primarily they are areas where a lot of other things happen.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09012880000006"></a>The Bill also does not take account of all the issues that I address in my second amendment, as it gives the MMO power up to high water all the way up the rivers. In some cases that is miles inland. I cannot see the reason for that. We know, because the Minister told us on our previous Committee day, that the EA will stay as the competent authority for the water framework directive. I believe that the practical way of deciding where the MMO&#146;s responsibility should stop is,</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000117"></a>&#147;the first non-navigable land crossing&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90128-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09012880000007"></a>That could be argued in all sorts of ways. However, in the rivers that I know, there are usually, where the estuaries are still wide and there is still a big tidal effect, navigable bridges and crossings, and it is arguable that the MMO should continue its responsibility underneath those and that its responsibility should end on the non-navigable bridges. As the Minister has pointed out in previous discussions, the MMO will have agreements with other bodies and will be able to delegate functions for those upstream parts of rivers beyond those bridges. That would be the appropriate thing to do, as most of the functions on and around those rivers will have nothing to do with the MMO. It has the junior part to play in those upstream rivers. As we go 10, 15 or 20 miles inland, people would find it extraordinary that the MMO had any part to play.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09012880000008"></a>The other well expressed Defra strategy on the management of coastal areas is the participatory planning approach from an early stage, as laid down in the statement of public participation. We are talking about marine areas; as we move on to marine plans, I am sure that we will come back to this point, but I should like the Bill to recognise that public participation is very important. I mention that at this stage because planning issues in the area between high and low water will need the greatest public participation. That is the area that the public use and enjoy and the one over which they have an absolute right through their democratic bodies to have a say. I beg to move.</p>

When I first read the Bill, I put great big lines down against this clause as I thought that we could argue about it all night. I am not proposing to do that, as I am sure that the Committee would not welcome it, but this is a very important area.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09012880000010"></a>I disagree with some of what the noble Baroness is suggesting, as she wants to restrict the extent of the area defined as the UK marine area to low water, thereby restricting not only the remit of the MMO but the area in which consideration should be paid to the marine environment specifically under this legislation. I would have had more sympathy for an amendment that extended rather than restricted the remit.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09012880000011"></a>In the previous debate, the Minister said how important it was to have clearly defined physical boundaries, but there needs to be a clear definition of where one organisation&#146;s remit starts and another&#146;s ends. As these  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debates are showing, this is&#151;even if we debated it all night&#151;an extraordinarily complicated issue. Influences on the marine environment do not end neatly at one point on the map. Indeed, events just above the high tide mark impact much more on the marine environment than vice versa. Rivers flow into the sea and, although fish indeed swim up rivers, provision has already been made for the Environment Agency to retain control of the licensing of freshwater fish. I would much prefer to leave this part of the Bill as it is with the MMO dealing with marine issues and involving itself in areas that might not always be covered in salt water but which common sense would identify as being part of the marine area and which certainly impact on the wider marine environment.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09012880000012"></a>My amendment in this group is a simple, probing one to clarify subsection (4)(a), which, with its accompanying Explanatory Notes, suggests that the UK marine area incorporates areas that would be under the sea were it not for the tide being deliberately kept out of that area. That would seem to include many areas where no precise delineation is possible. More important&#151;I speak from a purely selfish interest&#151;large tracts of reclaimed land are arguably not under the sea because of a great deal of drainage work and so on.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09012880000013"></a>Many noble Lords will know of my farming interests. My farm and my home&#151;indeed, all the Fenland region&#151;would be described as being marine under this provision. Sluices, dykes, seabanks, riverbanks and the artificial exclusion of the tide are the only ways in which the area can be kept dry. I hope that the Minister will accept that that definition needs a bit of fine-tuning if it is not to extend the marine area to those parts of the country that, although they may have the word &#147;beach&#148; in their name, are not particularly adjacent to the sea now.</p>

<a name="90128-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09012880000014"></a>Presumably it is not the intention to reclassify land as marine that has been reclaimed from the sea for many years&#151;centuries in some cases. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (4) also appear to extend the UK marine area limit a little further than subsection (3) would suggest. The mean high water spring tide is not the highest mark that spring tides get to, but these paragraphs imply that we should be talking about the furthest that seawater gets to &#147;from time to time&#148;&#151;or does the wording imply, as in paragraph (a), that it is only where the seawater is allowed to get to? It would benefit the Bill if we could define some of these things more accurately. I return to the point that I made in the beginning, which is that the marine area should include the land and the sea between the low and high water marks.</p>

However, if I read the Bill right, there is at present no thought given to what will happen to seascapes, particularly where a national park, of special conservation, looks down from right above the sea. We feel that the two could be embraced together, with law and planning to combine both. This would be a strong step forward, which I hope can be considered in the context of this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09012880000018"></a>Let me add that if I was in any way discourteous to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, I did not intend it. On the next amendment to be moved&#151;Amendment 83, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;we will be discussing the economic zone as it applies to Wales. That has a great deal to do with common fisheries policy, and it seemed to me that it fitted more into that economic debate. I did not want to be discourteous to the noble Duke who, no doubt, is absolutely right to take the first opportunity that he can. However, I am reeling with quite difficult problems of definition, and taking on the common fisheries policy at that stage was probably rather more than I could accomplish.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09012880000019"></a>Regarding what I said on that first definition, I want to make one point absolutely clear, as I may not have expressed myself as clearly as I ought to the Committee. The economic zone will only stretch to 200 miles; the law of the sea defines that for us. Yet, as I indicated, we have interests in the continental shelf beyond that, because of particular geological features. We seek to exploit them under the Continental Shelf Act 1964, and that is included in Clause 40(1)(c) of the Bill. As I indicated in responding to the first amendment, all three clauses are part of the definition issue; we are talking about the heart of the Bill, as it concerns marine development and planning. I seek to make that point as clearly as I can, and confess to any inadequacy in my earlier remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09012880000020"></a>I am now in difficulty, not least because the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, entices me with the roles that local authorities can play within planning development and concerns in areas immediately by the coast&#151;and not only that, for salt water can go a little further inland, as she indicated. Meanwhile, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has upbraided me lest I stray too far along that line and include most of Lincolnshire within the framework of the Bill, which I certainly do not

The Committee will recognise, then, that I seek to tread a rather difficult line between the two positions with some care.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09012880000021"></a>In the Bill, the UK marine area is used as the basis for defining that part of the sea that will be subject to marine planning and licensing. For these purposes, we believe it important for the UK marine area to include all places containing seawater that is exchanged with the open sea. This enables us to regulate effectively all activities&#151;and I accept the representations from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, on how extensive activities can be in coastal areas&#151;that may significantly impact the marine area.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09012880000022"></a>The licensing of these activities is currently regulated under Part II of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, which applies from mean high water spring tide outwards. Since the licensing provisions in that Act are to be replaced by this Bill, any change to the definition of the UK marine area, as the noble Baroness was so persuasively suggesting, would mean changing a well established and understood definition that we have applied without difficulty for the past 20 years. Therefore, rather than having clear difficulty in defining boundaries, where we have strong arguments about where boundaries should be and one perspective clashes with another, the noble Baroness will appreciate why we seek&#151;if I may mix my metaphors&#151;to build on reasonably secure foundations. That is because of how the Food and Environment Protection Act licensing system has operated over the past 20 years.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09012880000023"></a>A large number of developments taking place landward of mean low tide can have significant detrimental effects on the marine environment. It would be anomalous for these activities to fall outside the very regime that has been designed in the Bill specifically to help protect the marine environment. For this reason, it is also important that we are able to create marine plans for the full extent of the area within which licences are required. That will ensure that all licensing decisions are taken within the planning framework; to look at it another way, decisions on issuing licences will be one of the key means by which the policies set out in plans would give effect in the real world.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09012880000024"></a>I am conscious that by using,</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000118"></a>&#147;mean high water spring tide&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012880000107"></a>as the Bill defines it, an overlap arises between the marine regimes that we are discussing and existing terrestrial planning and development consent regimes, which extend down to the low water mark. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, gave a clear articulation of those interests. Yet we are not involved in a mistake here; a deliberate and conscious act of policy underpins the Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09012880000025"></a>We believe that an overlap between the planning regimes will help to encourage and support integration between the two systems. We have made specific provision in Schedule 6 to require marine planning authorities to notify terrestrial ones when they begin a marine plan, and to require the marine plan authority to have regard to the provisions of any related terrestrial plan. The overlap between the two systems will help here by providing an added incentive to create a seamless join between them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09012880000026"></a>I know that that does not go as far as the noble Baroness wants in her definition of where the boundary should be, but I hope that she will appreciate that the Government are not being arbitrary here&#151;although we must take a decision on where the boundary should be&#151;and are conscious of her point about the necessity of co-operation when authorities, marine and terrestrial, both have an interest in crucial activities. The overlap is also important when it comes to development consents and licences. Coastal activities by their nature have both marine and terrestrial elements. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, in a different context, pointed that out. I will come to his point when I can think of a satisfactory answer in due course. He spoke about the concept of a national park, which raises real difficulties about the boundary. I am not sure that I will be totally adequate in my response to him, but I will do my best.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09012880000027"></a>It is important that all the impacts of coastal development are considered by the appropriate land and marine expertise. The overlap allows us to do that. We are conscious that the limits we have chosen will vary over time and are not regulated by lines on the map. That is a conscious choice. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is as aware as anyone else in the House that tides are a natural phenomenon. They do not necessarily recognise our human attempts to define and contain them. Consequently, boundaries change, not through the will of man but through the force of nature.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09012880000028"></a>Our choice of mean high water springs and the tidal limit in estuaries will ensure that we can plan for and regulate activities in the areas that regularly interact with and can have a substantial impact on the sea and the marine environment more generally. Defining the marine area by reference to directly human considerations, such as landing, crossing and navigation&#151;the point raised by the noble Baroness when she moved her amendment&#151;would not be appropriate when designing a regime to manage and protect what is in fact a dynamic natural environment. That is why we have drawn the boundary where we have. I appeal to her to recognise that that has been done with care, but that under the Bill the marine authority will have to have the closest relationship to terrestrial authorities&#151;she mentioned local authorities&#151;where issues concern them both.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09012880000029"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, because he identified why he could not agree with the noble Baroness's amendment. I hope that I can be helpful on the concerns that he voiced. The scope of the licensing and planning regimes in areas such as harbour bases and sea locks that contain seawater exchanged with the open sea is an issue. Having heard a series of constituency points two amendments ago about the location, I for a brief moment recollected days in the other place when any proposal for the location of government offices led to a free-for-all from Members rightly advocating why their town or city should be the place where they should be located. I noticed the echoes here today of that position.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09012880000030"></a>I am going to choose the example of Bristol, largely because I cannot see anyone who will attack me in detail on Bristol in the Chamber at present. Bristol fits all the categories: it is a very significant port and a seaport with a big estuary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09012880000033"></a>We want to ensure that licensable activities taking place inside areas such as the port of Bristol do not adversely affect the wider sea, which our regime is designed to protect. Subsection (3) on its own will not in some cases include such places, because lock gates prevent the tide flowing in and out of them. Subsection (4) is therefore intended to capture those places where locks affect the flows of water.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09012880000034"></a>If we did not include harbour basins and the like, we could not regulate effectively all the activities that may have a significant impact on the marine area. Moreover, we would be faced with having those harbours without lock gates and open to the tide within the scope of the marine planning system, and others&#151;those with lock gates to control the flow of water&#151;beyond its scope. We seek consistency in the Bill, as our stakeholders have repeatedly requested. Subsection (4) is intended to bring that consistency.</p>

This is an important area, because a lock is for one purpose; to allow water to be retained. However, sluices are very similar structures and the water contained within them would never be considered sea, but it would include all the drainage of the fenland basin. I understand exactly what the Minister means; he knows that, generally speaking, I agree with the Government's definition of where the sea, or the marine area, starts; but I am concerned by the wording of Clause 4. It needs to be quite clear that sea banks, sluices and areas protected from the sea by artificial means are not included within the meaning of the Bill.</p>

I am not equipped to debate the issue of sluices with him now&#151;it may well be not at any stage, but certainly not now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09012880000037"></a>Concerns were raised in an earlier debate in Committee about the different extents of the Bill. The noble Baroness was prominent at our last meeting in what she said in that respect. I assure the Committee that each extent has been carefully chosen best to reflect the activity in question. For the reasons I have just outlined, licensing and planning, for example, are very important issues. Clause 10 restricts the MMO's functions to seaward of low water mark clearly to delineate functions between the MMO and Natural England. Licensing and planning overlaps with terrestrial regimes are beneficial. They will ensure that we have the necessity for co-operation in which the boundary, if it were just  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set for one authority, would be excessively arbitrary. For licences, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they are not. Natural England, as a nature conservation body, is the appropriate authority to manage wildlife on land, whether or not it is sometimes covered by the sea. Only once its jurisdiction ends should the MMO take over and that is at the low watermark. We have already had that debate, and, no doubt, we will return to it on Report.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09012880000038"></a>I recognise that we have the problem of different delineations with different authorities. These issues are not easily resolvable. However what I am seeking to maintain in response to the amendments&#151;and I know they have been put forward constructively&#151;is that one size does not fit all functions equally. The Bill has to dovetail with a myriad other legislation and the boundaries set in each and every case are designed to do this to the best effect. I hope that noble Lords will feel that I have helped to clarify some of the issues sufficiently to withdraw their amendments and I ask the noble Baroness to do so.</p>

This is a complicated area which needs good thought. I know marshland environments very well. They are quite difficult to describe because much of the marsh area is dry above a mean, high-water spring tide. Only occasionally are much of the green areas of the marsh actually under the water. Yet, within the Minister&#146;s definition, we would obviously consider them to be a marine area. So, the wording used needs careful thought because we do not want delineation disputes at a later stage. I hope the Minister will commit himself to having a good look at that before we come back on Report.</p>

I am picturing the Montrose basin, near where I live, which is tidal and where there is a great deal of natural activity. I am sure that will be included the Scots marine Bill. There is a bridge that is so low that no boat can come in, but it is tidal. Presumably, everything is all right for the Montrose basin. However, we have to think all the time of the whole of the United Kingdom when thinking of the marine area. If there are going to be disputes, they may well be between the devolved Administrations and Westminster, so it is important that we get this right.</p>

He did really groundbreaking work, laying the way open for the Government to adopt that in the subsequent Act that gave AONBs much better status.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09012880000043"></a>It does not surprise me that the Minister wants to take powers away from local authorities&#151;which plan between medium low water and medium high water&#151;and give them to a quango. It does not matter whether the quango is Natural England or the Marine Management Organisation. The fact is that it is a quango.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09012880000044"></a>It could be that local authorities under this Bill would be required to take additional steps to pay attention to the MMO&#146;s plans. Nevertheless, it would be right that the local authority would be left with the primacy of planning in this area, where so much human activity takes place. However, it does not surprise me because the Government have not been terrific at giving powers to local authorities. If anything, they have been busy taking them away, as they are doing here. I am surprised at the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, is going along with this attitude. I hope that between now and Report, he will talk to his Local Government Association colleagues and all the local authorities that are controlled by Conservatives, and see whether they are happy about losing their power and being subservient to a quango.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09012880000045"></a>I was talking recently at a meeting of CoastNet in Barnstable. Someone came up to me afterwards and asked what the Conservatives&#146; attitude would be to a quango. I said that I did not know but would find out during the course of the Bill. His question was whether it would be okay for quangos to have much more power. He was a member the estuary forum, I think, and concerned that it would be losing a say as it would not have elected representatives. The MMO will be a remote body. I worry that we are taking a step that will fundamentally undermine an enormous amount of what coastal authorities do. They will now be in the position of playing second fiddle to the MMO, which is a quango. In fact, it should be a much more equal relationship. We could, during later stages of the Bill, or on Report, remedy this by strengthening the hand of local authorities through other amendments, but, at the moment, they are not recognised at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09012880000046"></a>I am sorry that the LGA has not made better representations to us on this Bill. It has been remarkably silent. I do not think that we have had a briefing from it&#151;if any noble Lord has, perhaps they would let me know. However, it has a special interest group which I expect to make representations to us and if it feels differently from me, I would accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09012880000047"></a>I share the fondness of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, for salt marshes. I am fond of everything about them, from curlews to salt marsh lamb&#151;I do not eat the curlews; I just like listening to them&#151;and I think they are wonderful places. But, again, they are so rarely under water. Of course, they are important. However, they are essentially land-based places, full of farmers, such as the noble Lord. Therefore, why should the MMO be primarily the planning body for them? That again, should rest with local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09012880000050"></a>This is a short, probing amendment to enable your Lordships to delve a little more deeply into the new Welsh zone. As I understand it&#151;I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;the Bill establishes through Clause 41 and Part 2 of Schedule 4 that fisheries will be devolved to the Welsh Ministers in this zone. This is obviously a significant devolution. The control of fisheries will have a huge impact not only on those directly involved in the industry but on the development of marine conservation zones, as the rather tortuously expressed consultation requirements in Clause 116 make clear.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09012880000051"></a>Clause 284 also makes it clear that this devolution carries with it significant powers to impose executive penalties. It is therefore surprising that the actual limits of the zone are still not specified. The Minister and his officials were kind enough to give us a very useful and enlightening meeting with maps last week on the various devolved powers, but their notes and maps contained the very concerning detail that the boundary between the Republic of Ireland and the Welsh economic zone is still undefined and a matter of negotiation.</p>

<a name="90128-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09012880000052"></a>This negotiation, I suspect, will not be all that easy. If the Republic of Ireland does not recognise this new zone, as distinct from its waters, the devolved powers that we are discussing cannot be implemented properly. Getting final agreement is therefore of the utmost importance, and the agreed limits should be clearly stated in the Bill to provide certainty for those involved. Let us not forget how wide that strip of water is. At its widest&#151;I have not taken this from a chart&#151;it is probably 100 miles at the very most and, in many places, considerably less.</p>

Presumably, if this is so, we can anticipate final agreement before the Bill receives Royal Assent, which is still several months away. Can the Minister promise the Committee

I would also be grateful if he could confirm that no such uncertainty remains about the other boundaries of this zone, in particular that with the Isle of Man.

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09012880000056"></a>I note that the last few words of subsection (3) are:</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000119"></a>&#147;British fishery limits adjacent to Wales, and those which are not&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012880000108"></a>I assume that that refers to the offshore area. Will the Minister confirm that I have interpreted that correctly? I would prefer subsection (2) to be left in, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, says, perhaps the definition of where the limits are needs to be much more exact&#151;I can see the point in that argument&#151;so that no doubt is left about where they are. It would be better for the definition of the Welsh zone to remain in the Bill as it is in subsection (2); there is quite a lot of scope for defining more clearly in subsection (3) the words &#147;those which are not&#148;. I will be very interested in the Minister&#146;s response to the amendment and his views, on behalf of the Government, of the proposed exclusion of subsection (2).</p>

Let me make it absolutely clear that the Welsh zone has absolutely nothing to do with changes to UK international boundaries. No doubt many anxieties will be articulated about the Welsh zone and what goes on in it. It gives rise to the obvious issue of a devolved authority, so I have no doubt that Scottish&#151;and doubtless Northern Irish&#151;eyes are keenly focused on the matter, too. This is not a boundary issue, however. The Welsh zone brings responsibilities for fishing and fisheries management in Wales into line with those of Scotland and Northern Ireland, where similar zones have existed since devolution in 1998. The clause provides that the precise co-ordinates of that zone will be subsequently determined either by an Order in Council by order of the Secretary of State. At that stage, the Welsh zone

Such an order will be the subject of further consultation with all interested parties, and the Committee will appreciate the nature of that order; it is part of the existing devolved arrangements with the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09012880000058"></a>The Welsh zone will allow the existing powers under fisheries legislation to be extended to that area. A single Welsh zone will provide a far less complex patchwork of fisheries legislation off the Welsh coast, will make enforcement far easier and will provide fishermen with a simpler legislative context. The Welsh Assembly Government undertook extensive consultation on the proposal in May 2007 and almost 100 interested bodies across the UK were invited to comment on the document. From this consultation only one outright objection was received and the majority showed support for the proposal. The amendment would prevent the creation of the Welsh zone. If it is a probing amendment, I hope I have given reassurance about the boundaries issue which we do not regard as significant. I give way to the noble Baroness.</p>

I realise it is a very specific question, but if we are making changes to the Welsh fishing zone, they are likely to be most affected. Indeed, the whole Bristol Channel area is brought into question.</p>

We have had endless debates about the common fisheries policy and we all know that it is coming to some kind of climax with the arrangements for 2012. However, Scotland and Northern Ireland have these zones and Wales is getting the opportunity to have a zone. There is certainly no issue with regard to international boundaries. I am not sure I can give an answer to the noble Baroness about the boundary arrangements between Wales and north Devon. I will write to her on that point because in all my voluminous notes I am afraid that particular dimension does not occur.</p>

But these are not acute issues of boundary definition; they are about how effective co-operation occurs and about policing and sustaining the control regime with regard to the fisheries policy. The negotiations are not boundary issues in terms of the actual territory limits. I am talking about land, of course; territory is hardly the right word.

I hope the noble Lord can give us an assurance that any further Committee days on this Bill will not coincide with that Bill because we are all going to miss their expertise.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_304"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09012880000068"></a>We now turn to the important part of the Bill concerned with the new marine planning regime, and specifically, in this chapter, the marine policy statements. The amendments that I am addressing, starting with Amendment 85ZA, are concerned to make sure that these statements are sufficiently compatible with other important policy developments that we have all been considering in this House and in the other place over recent years. It is also extremely important, as has been made clear since Second Reading and through all the preparation work for this Bill, that there is complete effective compatibility with the requirements of European Directive 2001/42/EC and all the various UK enabling regulations needed to fulfil that.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09012880000069"></a>We have tabled a number of amendments to try to give practical effect to those requirements. This is the context in which these important marine policy statements must be developed. If they are not developed within this context, there will be widespread agreement across the Committee that we are failing in our duty in scrutinising this Bill. There is general consensus among all the so-called stakeholders&#151;I hate the word; I think we can do better but we have to live with it, I suppose&#151;that the marine policy statements and the marine plans must be subjected to effective strategic environmental assessment, or SEA, under the directive. There are obviously several advantages to the directive. It has not just been imposed on us and we can make good use of it. It ensures that there is a robust assessment of the policies and proposals, with all their environmental impacts taken into account and with the promotion of sustainable development fully and properly considered. There is also the considerable advantage that the directive gives guidance on proper consultation. We are all very much aware that in this and in many other areas consultation is essential if the outcome is to be owned by those who are most concerned with these policies. There is also the ability for recourse in extremis to the European courts should there be a breach of the directive&#146;s requirements.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09012880000070"></a>In order to be sure that the SEA process is triggered, the marine policy statement and the marine plans must meet certain criteria. The MPS and marine plans must fall within the definition of plans and programmes for the directive to apply, and to allow for further consideration as to whether an SEA is required. The most relevant element of the definition is that the plan or programme must be,</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000120"></a>&#147;required by legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012880000109"></a>In other words, it must appear in the Bill. If it is not there, it may not trigger the SEA. There must be a mandatory obligation on the relevant authority to produce that plan or programme.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09012880000071"></a>As things stand, the Bill makes the adoption of the MPS and marine plans only discretionary. We may think it is more than that but, under the Bill, it is discretionary. This means that the MPS and the marine plans could not be defined as plans and programmes under the directive. Therefore, the requirement for an SEA would not be triggered. A number of environmental organisations that have been so supportive of the Bill and so keen to see this legislation on the statute book are very concerned that we may not be effective in triggering this process, which is obviously crucial for

We must make sure that the MPS and marine plans will be subjected to full and proper SEA processes, even if they are subject to an appraisal which includes components of SEA. It is extremely important that we pursue this issue. For that reason, we have tabled the amendments.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09012880000072"></a>Various options are included in the amendments. I have followed a procedure here, which I have often found useful in public life, whereby if you ask anyone whether they want to say yes or no, they invariably say no. But if you give them two options&#151;either A or B&#151;there is a much better chance of success. For example, Amendments 85JA and 85J are alternatives. I hope that the Minister will find having a choice more conducive to a forthcoming and responsive answer, rather than if I had chosen to present just one option to the Committee, to which he could just say no. I am sure that he has had the same experience.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09012880000073"></a>For the benefit of speed, I will not read out the sustainability appraisal, which is included here and very substantial but nevertheless well based. It comes from sources for which other legislation has given us guidance. I accept that the alternatives are not that different, but I hope that the Minister will find them helpful.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09012880000074"></a>The other amendments in this large group are all derivative and consequential. I do not propose to go through them in detail because I suspect that the Committee would like to deal with this group expeditiously in view of the hour. I hope that I have given sufficient indication of how crucial they are in trying to make sure that we are including in the Bill marine policy statements which carry all the opportunities and advantages to which I have referred under the directive. I beg to move.</p>

All the following groups of amendments, including this one, are necessary because, as the Bill stands, there is a huge lack of clarity. We broadly support the probing nature of the amendments put by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, but, in particular, the requirement for a strategic environment assessment, SEA, that should be conducted for the MPS. Apparently, there has been legal advice supporting the view that the SEA directive does and should apply to the MPS. However, to date, the Government have stated that they,</p>
<ul><a name="09012880000121"></a>&#147;would not be required to carry out a strategic environmental assessment of the MPS under the terms of the Directive concerning SEA&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012880000110"></a>That was the Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee&#146;s report on the draft Marine Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09012880000076"></a>In addition, I understand that concerns have been expressed regarding the practicalities of carrying out an SEA to such a high-level or overarching document as an MPS. The principle of whether a SEA should be carried out goes back to the same argument posed by my noble friend Lord Kingsland when moving Amendment 12. He argued that until the MMO has established the best scientific evidence, it cannot make an assessment about the damage or otherwise that particular human activities would do. In the same vein, a marine policy statement would be incomplete without first having done an environmental assessment.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_306"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09012880000077"></a>It is said that the SEAs of high-level plans or programmes, such as the proposed marine policy statement, pose particular practical challenges to undertake. Such plans or programmes often lack detail, thus making them difficult to assess. To our knowledge there have been few high-level SEAs in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. However, I understand that Scotland has had success and experience of SEAs at a high level. The Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005 covers strategies as well as plans and programmes. I do not believe that England, Wales or Northern Ireland have this experience. I further understand that Scotland has a number of high-level strategy plans which have undergone or are undergoing SEA. Therefore, it would be perfectly possible to conduct a SEA for the MPS. I hope that the Minister will look at this issue, especially after the assurances that he gave the Committee when responding to Amendment 73 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.</p>

The marine planning system we are developing will adopt a straightforward two-stage approach; that is, a UK marine policy statement, and a series of marine plans, which will apply the policies in the policy statement to particular geographical areas. Decisions on licensing and consents in the marine area will have to be taken in accordance with the marine policy statement and the plans.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09012880000079"></a>The intent of the marine policy statement is to be agreed by the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, which are called &#147;policy authorities&#148;. The Bill does not change the devolution settlement, but provides, as we know, for a form of executive devolution, which will allow the devolved Administrations to produce comprehensive plans with the agreement of the Secretary of State. We know that ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the UK SEAs is very important. The marine policy statement will cover the whole of the UK marine area. If all four Administrations agree the MPS, as we intend, there is no question that we will deliver consistency throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09012880000080"></a>Significant incentives are built into the system to encourage co-operation. However, it is a fact of devolution that we cannot require other Administrations to agree with us. We have had to provide for devolved Administrations to opt out of the MPS, and for the Secretary of State to work alone if necessary. Clearly, the impact of what countries, including ourselves, can achieve alone is significantly diminished. None the less, the discussions that took place between the four Administrations last year give me a great deal of confidence that we can achieve a marine policy statement to which all four Administrations have signed up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09012880000082"></a>We want to make sure that the MPS is a useful document for decision-makers, providing a unified context and framework for their decisions. Following the recommendation made by the Joint Committee scrutinising the draft Bill, we have introduced a new requirement for a draft marine policy statement to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and the devolved legislatures of all the Administrations that have participated in preparing it. If Parliament or any legislature makes recommendations about the draft MPS, each Administration will have a duty to respond. All public authorities will be obliged to have regard to the MPS and marine plans, and, in most cases, to take licensing or enforcement decisions in accordance with the policies set out in the MPS.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09012880000083"></a>As a first step to developing an integrated policy statement, we consulted all interested parties last summer on a set of high-level objectives. We are considering carefully what they told us, and will take forward further close working with those parties as we develop the MPS. I apologise for taking the time of the Committee, but it is important, at the start of such a crucial part of the Bill, to set out the general principles that govern it.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09012880000084"></a>The amendments are focused on the core purpose of marine policy statements and marine planning. They seek to ensure that the MPS and marine plans are subject to an appraisal of sustainability, including compliance with the European directive on the strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes, known as the SEA directive. I will deal first with Amendments 85ZA, 85ZB, 89ZA and 89ZB, relating to Clauses 42 and 49. These clauses set out the definitions of a marine policy statement and a marine plan. The amendments add to those definitions wording that will ensure that the SEA directive applies to them.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09012880000085"></a>Whether a legal obligation, such as a directive and the regulations transposing it, apply to an MPS or marine plan should be determined by the directive and the regulations. If it applies, then we and the other UK Administrations will comply: we have to. It is not necessary to restate an existing legal obligation in legislation. That might backfire if the European directive were revoked or replaced. The references might become redundant and would do nothing to ensure compliance with any directive or regulations that came along later.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09012880000086"></a>Many other directives may apply to the marine policy statement and plans, including the birds directive and the habitats directive&#151;not that I wish to inspire further amendments on Report. They will also require assessments to be carried out when proposals might affect a designated site. We do not list them in the Bill because there is no need: we will comply with them if they apply. We do not think that a strategic environmental assessment is any different. Although there is no reference in the Bill to carrying out an appraisal of the sustainability

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09012880000087"></a>As set out in Clause 42(1)(a), the MPS will be a statement of our policies on contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area. The policies that it contains will add up to a positive contribution to sustainable development, otherwise it will not meet the criteria required of it in the Bill and will not then be an MPS. Appraisal of sustainability is inherent in the process of preparing an MPS, rather than a separate consideration or process, which is why there is no separate requirement in the Bill. This goes to the heart of the matter.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09012880000088"></a>We shall debate the statement of public participation later.

The MPS will also be subject to extensive public consultation and scrutiny, not only by this House and the other place, but also by the devolved legislatures. We will be happy to receive representations as part of the consultation. If there are concerns that we are not meeting our European obligations on assessing the sustainability and environmental effects of the MPS, there will be ample opportunity for parliamentarians to call the UK Government and the devolved Administrations to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09012880000089"></a>We began this process last summer by consulting on a set of high-level marine objectives that will form the basis of the MPS. These objectives start from the principle of enabling an integrated approach to delivering economic, social and environmental benefits, underpinned by sound science and good governance.</p>

<a name="90128-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09012880000090"></a>I stated in our response to the Joint Committee that scrutinised the draft Bill that we do not think that the requirements of the European directive on the strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes will apply to the marine policy statement. I understand the desire to ensure that we assess the sustainability of our policies. However, as I have said, Clause 42(1)(a) makes clear that the statement has to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK. If the Government are wrong and the requirements of the European directive on the strategic environmental assessment do apply to marine policy statements, they will be applied; nothing in this legislation would prevent that. We accept that whether the SEA directive applies to the MPS will depend to some extent on the eventual content of the MPS. I reassure noble Lords that, if it appears that the requirements of the directive apply, then we will comply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09012880000091"></a>As far as concerns Amendments 85J and 85JA, we must ensure that the policies in the MPS are sustainable, otherwise the MPS will not be an MPS. We have also committed to publishing a partial impact assessment alongside the draft consultation which sets out the options considered for inclusion in the draft MPS. What is more, and as I have said already, we need to ensure that the policies in the MPS are sustainable.</p>

In our response we have made a commitment to conducting pre-legislative scrutiny in order to produce guidance for the MMO on how to carry out these appraisals. This guidance will make it clear that the process of sustainability appraisal is intended to be carried out alongside the development of options for inclusion in the draft plan, and that it should inform the choices made about which of the possible alternative proposals to take forward. Furthermore, we are happy to publish the guidance for public consultation before it is finished.</p>

Essentially, the marine policy statement will always apply to the whole UK marine area and can have regional content within it. If the devolved Administrations are not signed up, it will be limited in its scope and impact. I suppose that in theory a UK Government-only marine policy statement could cover devolved matters, but I am not sure that that would be wise. In any case, the devolved Administrations would not have to follow it. A UK Government-only marine policy statement would cover reserve matters, and for England it would cover the whole area of marine licensing and consents.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09012880000096"></a>It would be a huge disappointment to get to that position. We hope&#151;the incentives to do so are in the Bill&#151;for agreement to be reached. Again, I go back to the statement of intent by the four Administrations following the meeting last autumn setting out their determination to make this work. The Bill is constructed to make it possible, with incentives moving in the direction towards an agreed marine policy statement for the United Kingdom to which all the devolved Administrations are signed up, but in a sense there is a reserve position in order to deal with the matter if it is not possible.</p>

It may also be prepared by the Secretary of State and by one or another of the other devolved Administrations or, in the end, it could be prepared just by the Secretary of State. There is flexibility in the legislation, but I am confident that there is sufficient understanding between all the Administrations that the benefits of working together far outweigh not doing so. It is necessary to have this kind of measure in the Bill to deal with circumstances where working together is not possible, but I am confident that it will not have to be used.</p>

I understand that there is another option known as the sustainability appraisal, but to be frank that is a rather tame weapon to use in this context. There is widespread concern that by apparently turning down the possibility of the SEA process, we may be adopting a rather limp approach. Incidentally, I am sure that I recall reasonably well the Minister saying in

That does not quite accord with the Government&#146;s response in taking forward the draft marine Bill in response to the Joint Committee report from the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. The Government stated that while they believed that they would not be required to undertake an SEA for the MPS, they said that they were,</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09012890000002"></a>The first order is intended to help to address the severe economic downturn in the bingo industry by increasing from four to eight the number of category B3 gaming machines that bingo halls can offer customers. Category B3 machines have a maximum stake of &#163;1 and a maximum prize of &#163;500. In June last year it was announced that the Government intended to make such an increase in response to a campaign by the Bingo Association, a campaign that also attracted the support of Parliament. Such widespread cross-party support was influential with the Government in making our decision.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09012890000003"></a>The order is intended to help the bingo industry, which is facing difficult trading conditions. While the current economic climate is an issue for the gambling industry as a whole, there remains strong evidence that the situation in the bingo industry is particularly acute.  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>A number of special circumstances apply to bingo halls. These include the fact that the industry&#146;s business model means that there is very high demand for these machines during relatively short periods of the day&#151;that is, between the sessions of bingo play. Also, while gaming machine entitlements in casinos, betting shops and adult gaming centres were increased through the 2005 Act in return for the taking on of enhanced social responsibilities, bingo halls retained the same gaming machine entitlements as they had under the Gaming Act 1968.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09012890000004"></a>Most important, however, is the role of bingo halls in local communities. They fulfil an important social function and provide a softer gambling environment, where the gaming machines offered remain ancillary to bingo. Of course there are risks attached to an increase in the number of these machines, not least with regard to their being seen to promote harder forms of gambling and problem gambling in general. That is not the case. These machines are already on bingo premises, while under the 2005 Act a comprehensive new system of regulation for gaming machines was established with consumer protection at its heart. The number one priority remains the protection of the public. That is why the Government rejected the Bingo Association&#146;s view that the number of B3 machines should be increased to 16; we felt that that went too far. We have agreed on eight, which is consistent with the precautionary approach that we take to gambling regulation.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09012890000005"></a>It should also be borne in mind that all categories of gaming machines must comply with strict regulations and technical standards to ensure that vulnerable and problem gamblers are protected. Stringent controls on entry by under-18s to areas in bingo halls offering gaming machines are already in operation via the mandatory conditions attached to the premises licences. We can with confidence see this increase in machines without creating significant social problems.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09012890000006"></a>On the question of lotteries, the House will be aware that society lotteries are lottery draws run by charities, sports and leisure clubs to raise money for good causes. Few societies currently reach the present limits relating to the maximum proceeds and prizes for individual draws; at the moment the proceed limit is set at &#163;2 million and the prize limit at &#163;200,000. However, the Lotteries Council and the Hospice Lotteries Association argued that these limits were holding them back from raising significantly higher sums for good causes, particularly by preventing a number of societies from coming together to promote a larger one-off annual draw&#151;for example, a Christmas bumper draw&#151;and these arguments were reflected in both Houses.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09012890000007"></a>The Government have always been willing to consider representations made on behalf of charities and other bodies that benefit from society lotteries and, in response to those arguments, we announced last July that we intended to raise to &#163;4 million the maximum proceeds for individual society lottery draws and that the top prize had also doubled to &#163;400,000 for each draw. It should be made clear that the Government do not intend to raise the limit on maximum annual proceeds for society lotteries, which will remain at &#163;10 million. The maximum &#163;25,000 prize for society lotteries whose  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_313"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proceeds are below &#163;250,000 will also remain unaltered. This level of increase, from &#163;2 million to &#163;4 million, is wholly consistent with the licensing objectives of the Act and achieves a satisfactory balance between providing a valuable boost to hospices and other bodies that raise funds from lottery draws and retaining the character of society lotteries. That view is supported by the Gambling Commission, which has advised that there is no evidence that an increase such as this would give rise to gambling concerns.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09012890000008"></a>The Government also recognise the unique position of the National Lottery and its enormous contribution to the public good. I therefore assure the House that we have considered the impact that the proposed increase in proceeds may have on the National Lottery and believe that such an increase would not threaten income for the good causes. Society lotteries operate on a quite different scale from the National Lottery. Moreover, they target different markets. People generally play society lotteries to support a cause rather than to win a prize, whereas playing the National Lottery is about the possibility of winning a life-changing amount, with the good causes a secondary consideration. The Government remain of the view that the suggested increase to society lottery limits will not affect that difference. However, to ensure this, we will ask the National Lottery Commission to monitor the impact of the revised limit on the National Lottery and ask for a report to be made three years after implementation. I commend the orders to the House.</p>

I declare an interest: the lottery for my local church, which I have to tell the House will not be approaching any limit at all, goes forward in my name.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09012890000010"></a>According to the Henley report, bingo provides a social service and acts as a lightning conductor for gamblers, who without bingo might well drift into hard gambling, with its far greater percentage of problem gamblers. With over 100 bingo halls closing over the past two years, there is clearly a strong argument for assisting the industry by changing the restriction on the number of machines allowed. However scientific one pretends to be, it is anyone&#146;s guess what the right number of machines is. The Minister might consider keeping the number under review to ensure that the restrictions thought necessary to prevent problem gambling still allow the industry to function properly.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09012890000011"></a>The other order before the House increases the ceiling from &#163;2 million to &#163;4 million for a society lottery&#151;that is, a lottery run for the benefit of charities, sporting bodies and non-commercial activities. My first question is: why is there a limit? The Budd review called for the removal of a limit, and that was supported by the joint scrutiny committee in its report on the draft Gambling Bill. There is also a limit of &#163;10 million on the amount that can be sold by any one society in a year.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09012890000012"></a>The restrictions on the activities of those working for the good of others do not make a great deal of sense. The argument has been made that, if there were not these limits, there might be an adverse effect on the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_314"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>National Lottery. I have two points on this. First, as societies give 58p or 59p of every pound raised to charity, as against the National Lottery&#146;s 28p, the prize money that they offer could not compete with that offered by the National Lottery. If there was concern that, as the lotteries grew in size, societies would reduce the proportion of money received that they donated, the minimum amount that must be given under Section 99(2) of the Gambling Act 2005 could be amended from 20 per cent to a higher figure&#151;say, 40 per cent. This would ensure that lotteries run by societies would retain their character, which is distinctive because, as the Minister said, the prime motivation is to benefit the cause rather than to win large sums of money.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09012890000013"></a>Secondly, if societies continue to give so large a portion of what they receive to good causes, they should get the maximum help and encouragement. Good causes would be better off and there would be more opportunity for people spending money on lotteries to ensure that the money went directly to the beneficiary of their choice. If there is to be a limit, it is disappointing that it is not to be increased to the &#163;5 million requested by the Lotteries Council. Perhaps, rather than complain, one should be grateful for the increase that the order gives.</p>

Let me take the orders as they are presented to us. As bingo is currently suffering, one wonders whether having machines in the bingo halls is a straw for them to cling to or a lifeboat. As bingo halls are in structural trouble, I hope that when the Government consider any future increases they will also consider the fact that this is supposed to be a &#147;soft&#148; environment. However, I have no fundamental objection. As to the raising of the limit, the only thing that occurs to me is that the limit will presumably have to be increased over time, provided that there is no adverse effect on other bodies. Will we have an order every time, or would it not be sensible to have some system to look at this automatically? It might save a few rushed dinners in both Houses of Parliament if there were some way forward. I hope that the Government can provide us with some of the thinking behind these matters.</p>

I am not a great expert on bingo. However, I noticed that the Minister referred to the economic downturn. I do not think that that has any real consequence for the bingo industry.

In fact, I moved the amendment to the then National Lottery Bill which allowed external

I also then moved the first ever increase of monetary limits to lotteries, bearing in mind that lotteries have existed in this country since the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976. So lotteries had their first increase in 1993-94, the second in 1998-99 and this is the third. That is three increases in 32 years; not a good record for Governments of either hue.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09012890000017"></a>This increase was first lobbied for in 2000. It has taken eight years. It was lobbied for a great deal harder during the passage of the then Gambling Bill through this House. Your Lordships will remember that the Bill passed through Parliament in the wash-up period in April 2005, when after one day in Committee it went through its remaining stages within 25 minutes in your Lordships&#146; House, following a statement made by the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. He gave an undertaking to your Lordships that the monetary limits for society lotteries would be reviewed as soon as possible. That was in April 2005. This is how quickly the Government carry out their undertakings. In fact, the consultation process for this increase was completed by Christmas 2005, but I understand that, owing to the pressure of work at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, there was no time to send it back.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09012890000018"></a>My goodness, the noble Lord, Lord Addington, puts his finger on it sometimes, does he not? Why will we have to go through this every three years? We talked, debated and lobbied about the idea that there should be triennial reviews of stakes&#146; and prizes&#146; monetary limits in the Bill. The Government said that it was not necessary. The lottery people said, &#147;You don&#146;t care about us; we will always be at the bottom of the heap&#148;. &#147;Oh no you won&#146;t,&#148; said the Government, &#147;We will look after you&#148;. Here we are, all these years later. We were right and the Government were wrong. This is a story of poor quality and shabby government.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09012890000019"></a>The Government said in their document supporting this that they have virtually unanimous support. They have seven out of 10. Two of the three that did not support them are the National Lottery and its own private regulator, the National Lottery Commission; you would hardly expect it to support them. I do not know who the third was, but the reality is that this increase this evening has not got unanimous support. Everybody was told that either they took the &#163;400,000 or they would not get anything. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, and my noble friend on the Front Bench are absolutely right. Sir Alan Budd&#146;s review of the gambling industry before we had the Gambling Act asked what was the purpose of limits&#151;any limits at all&#151;for society lotteries, and said that they should be removed.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09012890000020"></a>The joint scrutiny committee on the draft Gambling Bill, on which I had the honour to serve in your Lordships&#146; House along with Members of another place and other noble Lords, also recommended to the Government that all these limits should be removed. The Government finally agreed to remove the limit on stakes in the Bill, but have kept the monetary limits on pools and prizes. Like my noble friend on the Front Bench, I still do not know why it is.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09012890000021"></a>When he winds up, it would be awfully helpful if the Minister could tell us what the policy objective of this order is. The policy objective of the Gambling Act is to prevent crime, ensure that all gambling is fair and to protect the young and vulnerable. The order has absolutely nothing to do with that at all. In fact, we can see, despite the fact that Ministers and officials have denied it for years, that this is about protecting the National Lottery. But protecting the National Lottery is not a policy objective of the Gambling Act. It has nothing to do with it all.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09012890000022"></a>The Minister said in another place, when the order was passed through the Second Delegated Legislation Committee on 19 January, that the protection of the National Lottery must not threaten income for good causes. My noble friend on the Front Bench had it absolutely right. The reality is that, pound for pound, society lotteries give a great deal more to charity than the National Lottery. The biggest beneficiary of the National Lottery is not good causes but the Treasury. Let us be absolutely straight about this. No exchequer anywhere else in the world takes more money out of its state or national lottery than ours. It can do that if it likes, but not, I suggest, at the expense of charities. The charities that run society lotteries do so for the most vulnerable in our society. Those I have been involved in have raised many millions of pounds for many charities. Last year we had &#147;Brainwave&#148; for brain-injured children. That is more important than the Treasury&#146;s coffers in my view, and I think that of your Lordships&#146; as well.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09012890000023"></a>The Minister said that prizes had not been breached, as though that were a reason for not increasing them. Does that mean that if we all drove at 81 mph the Government would increase the speed limit? Not breaching them is not a reason for increasing them. That is a ludicrous idea.</p>

<a name="90128-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09012890000024"></a>I would therefore like the Minister to tell us why the limit is &#163;400,000. Why not &#163;600,000? Why not &#163;550,000? What is the logic in that? It is completely illogical. Why, too, should it be 10 per cent of the pool? Why not 5 per cent? Why not 15 per cent? In fact, what has it to do with the Government at all? Why do the Government care what percentage it is? The answer is, they do not really know.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09012890000025"></a>My final question on the subject of limits which I should like the Minister to answer is the following. Why does this order not abolish annual limits? The Minister in the other place and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, when speaking earlier, made a good thing of the fact that the order does not abolish annual limits on the number of tickets to be sold. But what does the annual limit achieve? It makes no difference to the National Lottery how many tickets are sold. It makes no difference to anybody. It has nothing to do with gambling or protecting the vulnerable. It is merely the amount that the charities can raise. Why would any self-respecting Government in the world want to restrict the amount that a charity can raise? But that is what this does. It is an unnecessary regulation.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09012890000026"></a>Before the noble Lord, Lord Davies, approaches his officials for an answer, I should tell noble Lords that since 1993 I have asked this question of every Minister and every official in the department. I have asked it of all the chairmen of the Gaming Board and of the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_317"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Gambling Commission. None of them has the answer. The most constructive answer I received was from the present deputy chief executive of the Gambling Commission, who used to be the secretary of the Gaming Board, who said, &#147;We&#146;re not really sure what it does. It got put in the 1976 Act by mistake, and there it sits&#148;. They know that. The annual limit should therefore be removed and the noble Lord, Lord Davies, should tell us what steps the Government will take to remove it. It simply is not good enough to have this shambles again and again.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09012890000027"></a>Of course, this order will go through. I would not dream of praying against it because I have an interest, nor would I vote against it if any other noble Lord were to pray against it. However, it is a pretty shambolic order. It is not the fault of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, because it is not his department, and I do not blame him for a single second. Nor is this the fault of the officials because they have only been in the department for five minutes. The officials who wrote this document are long gone. But it is a shambles. It is an example of really poor government. The Government should apologise to the House for bringing such a shoddy piece of work before us at this late dinner hour.</p>

Therefore, I have considerable knowledge of the gambling industry. Bingo really is not gambling. I wish to declare that I hold no consultancies and never have.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09012890000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies, will be aware of the Henley Centre&#146;s report of August 2007, which has been mentioned. The executive summary of that report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09012890000136"></a>&#147;The closure of Bingo clubs, especially those in the small, rural venues and deprived urban locations, has meant not only the loss of a pastime and form of entertainment but the disappearance of a unique social support network, relied upon especially by retired women. The demise of this pastime and network can have a detrimental impact upon the physical and mental wellbeing of patrons, particularly as there are often few other opportunities for this group to socialise. Bingo closures also appear to be both a manifestation and catalyst for a wider breakdown of local communities that could have a negative impact upon society&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012890000125"></a>What really concerns me is that the bingo business is declining rather more than many other industries because of taxation, the smoking ban, the reduced number of machines and now the bad economic situation. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, will be aware of the previous occasion that a cull of machines took place.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09012890000030"></a>My noble friend Lord Mancroft was extremely critical of what the Government have said and done. I do not disassociate myself completely from those comments but I am dealing purely with bingo whereas he dealt principally with the change to the lottery.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09012890000031"></a>As I say, all these things have happened and we now have a bad economic situation. The main plank of my argument concerns the Government&#146;s desire to permit only eight machines. I know that this is an order but I also know that the industry asked for 16 machines. Machines account for a large part of the income of all bingo clubs. They are played mainly during intervals  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_318"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when bingo is not being played. While machine play is ancillary to the main social pursuit of bingo, it is important. There is no real evidence of problem gambling in bingo. I should point out clearly that people say that bingo is the softest area of gambling. It is even less than that; it is a social experience for elderly and lonely people. Arguments that bingo is soft gaming are generally wide of the mark. I have never been personally involved in the bingo industry as such but I know that those who play bingo&#151;this is mentioned in the Henley report&#151;are generally older people of about my age. People enjoy a game of bingo not from a gambling aspect but for social reasons. My plea is as follows. I know that the order stipulates eight machines, but I ask the Government to reconsider it and change the figure to 16. I also ask them, please, to take into account the large number of clubs which have closed&#151;I believe that more than 100 have done so&#151;throwing several thousand workers out of their jobs, which is very bad at present, and depriving people, particularly those in small communities, of a place to meet.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09012890000032"></a>The Henley Centre places great emphasis on the social aspect. In the present climate, that aspect is of maximum importance. I therefore urge the noble Lord to change the figure to 16 machines&#151;if that cannot be done now, can it be done shortly?&#151;as the industry has requested. That would help the industry at this very troubled time when job losses are occurring every day, as we read in the newspapers. All gambling activities are similarly affected, so will the noble Lord please soften the Government&#146;s approach, thereby saving jobs and keeping the bingo industry alive?</p>

Like them, I shall comment separately on the two orders. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, asked that we should at the very least keep under review the numbers that have been settled upon; that is, eight as regards bingo halls. His comments are supported strongly by the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, with his great knowledge of the industry. I hear what the noble Lord says and agree with a great deal of what he says about the social role of bingo halls. As we all recognise, bingo is at the softest end of gambling. People play bingo as a social pursuit rather than with the specific intent of gambling, although that is obviously part of it. The industry has made the strongest representations that we should increase the relevant figure to 16. But the Government have wider considerations at stake. They have to be reassured that we are not unduly increasing levels of gambling. We have an obligation to the wider society. We have responded to pressure from the industry, and we have doubled the number. Putting it up to 16 would have been a stage too far, but I undertake that we will keep the figure under review.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09012890000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, berated the fact that these issues have to be done by order. That is so because that is the basis of the primary legislation that set up the position. I give the undertaking that the Government will keep the position under review. One or two extravagant claims have been made that the bingo industry is being destroyed. With 614 bingo halls in regular existence, that point can be exaggerated. I hear what noble Lords have said. The Government&#146;s  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_319"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>judgment is that doubling the number of machines in each bingo hall that wishes to do so is about right. I listened to the representations.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09012890000035"></a>On the wider representations with regard to the limits, it will be recognised that the Government have doubled the limits as far as the lotteries are concerned. The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, berated the Government and their position. He is an in an excellent position to identify that the Gambling Act 2005 was scarcely the Gambling Act that the Government set out to produce. He will know all too well, as he said, that we got the legislation through in the wash-up, and it betrays some of the weaknesses of having been rushed, with the Government having to settle for what the Opposition put as priorities in those very limited days. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, like I, has been in those negotiations when the Government have to get all their legislation through in the week before a general election, and he will know that the boot is on the other foot. Therefore, if the gambling legislation has weaknesses, he might look at the part played by his party&#151;</p>

If the noble Lord had been in this House longer, he would know that I have given Ministers on both sides an equally hard time on this, and when we get back into power, very shortly, I shall give my noble friend Lord Howard, when he is sitting on that side of the House, just as much of a hard ride as I have given the noble Lord this evening.</p>

If I am meant to respond to the widespread public position and the great concern about this; in this House are a very large number of noble Lords who have great associations with charities. Is this House packed with people saying, &#147;This is the change we want for the benefit of charities, because the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, with his special insight into the issue and through his special interest speaks on behalf of all of us&#148;? I can only say that the noble Lord is a lonely voice. Therefore, he should not exaggerate his case too far. He should recognise that the Government work within limits.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09012890000038"></a>I say to all noble Lords present that, of course, the Government could always be bid up with regard to these figures. Of course, the industry and the societies are going to make their case for more. It would be amazing if the Government ever produced a result that was beyond the demands that were placed on them. When did that ever happen? What always happens in these circumstances is that bids are made by interests, as they should be, because people genuinely believe in the work that they do&#151;I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, and his contribution in those terms, but of course he is going to make a bid&#151;and the Government have to balance those bids against wider considerations and the wider public interest. That is why we arrive at the figures that we do, and that is why I am moving the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09012890000044"></a>Marine policy statements, which are established in Clause 42, are apparently intended to contain the answer to several questions that we have already asked the Minister about how the relevant bodies will balance the competing interests of those involved in the marine environment. Much as our Amendment 33 highlighted the working of the Marine Management Organisation, the policy authorities that we are considering now are, of course, subject to similar conflicting advice and lobbying from various stakeholders. As with the MMO, the priorities that policy authorities will give to the various interests are of the utmost importance to those who have an interest in this area. The Government have laid out some of their intentions in the glossy publications that are littering my desk&#151;it is not  difficult to litter my desk as it is littered most of the time&#151;but priorities can be changed and pamphlets can be reprinted. Ministers and Governments come and go, as we know. Government press releases in no way replicate the certainty and security that clearer legislation would provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09012890000045"></a>The two concerns highlighted by the amendment&#151;reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring the security of our energy supply&#151;have both been very much in the forefront of people&#146;s minds recently. With the recent difficulties over gas supplies from the Ukraine, our warnings about the vulnerabilities of our energy network are finally finding a more sympathetic audience on the Benches opposite. Energy security has risen up the Government&#146;s agenda. Similarly, the Government have recently come round to a more accurate appreciation of the importance of addressing climate change. But this may not last. Once people start turning off their central heating for a few months, or once the taxes that this Government will impose to pay for their solutions to the credit crunch start to bite, those priorities will be replaced by others. If the Government allow their commitment to addressing climate change to be weakened, it will be disastrous. The Government are relying on private investment into the energy market to supply the secure, low-carbon energy we need. Without legislative certainty, how can the Minister expect businesses to stump up the cash that is needed? Investors will be looking for commitment that is enshrined in law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09012890000046"></a>The list of areas which the policy authorities should rightly be forced to have regard to is much longer than the two I have laid down. Indeed, if we go back to Amendment 33, we see a list of some 10 factors. I do not seek to write the detail of marine policy statements in these amendments, but the two that I have indicated are key factors which the MPS should be obliged to address. It is an opportunity to enshrine these two factors into the legislative process that we have today. Notably, the Government have commitments in the area of marine conservation as well, but the two I have highlighted link up with two of the Government&#146;s recent Acts&#151;the Climate Change Act and the Energy Act&#151;and because of commercial uncertainty, they particularly need legislative safeguards. These amendments link these two important Acts, which we supported. The lack of any detail in the Bill on current and future government policy will be counterproductive and will make any government commitment to a meaningful marine policy weak and susceptible to change. I beg to move.</p>

While I accept the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on lists, it is important that this Bill has regard to some things that are crucial at the moment. One of these is climate change and the other is security of supply. When the Joint Committee took evidence, I questioned the then Minister for Energy and the Defra Minister about the way the Government&#146;s thinking was going. We had talked about being able to get energy from different sources, including wind, wave, tide and all the others that go with them. I questioned the Minister at that stage on the role that nuclear power could play. This is hugely important.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09012890000054"></a>Clearly, if nuclear energy came in more quickly, we would not be faced with some of the very difficult choices that the Government currently face. In other words, would a Severn barrage be necessary if there were enough nuclear supply? Would more wind farms be really necessary? As the Minister knows, I raised in this House about a month ago the question of production from wind farms. During the winter, over Christmas when it was so cold and there was very little wind, the person from the association acknowledged that wind power needed back-up. It could not produce the energy that we needed at that time. Although the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is not minded to support this amendment&#151;perhaps because of the list&#151;it is enormously important that we consider it in the overall context of climate change and energy security.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09012890000055"></a>I may be misjudging the noble Baroness, but perhaps she is trying to reconcile the balance between that and the protection of wildlife and the environment. She and I&#151;and, I am sure, my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach&#151;are very conscious of the needs of wildlife. All of us on the Joint Committee particularly tried to strike a balance on that.</p>

<a name="90128-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09012890000056"></a>I am perhaps slightly promoting nuclear because that in itself does not raise the difficulties that, for example, the Severn barrage would for wildlife and

I am not wedded to one particular way, but my noble friend&#146;s amendment has given us a chance to think a little wider, and would be a welcome addition to the Bill by making us think again about our responsibilities to our communities. I still think that the Government&#146;s main responsibility is to defend them and to feed them and, having done that, to make sure that communities have enough energy to be able to have a daily living. That is the reason for these amendments at this stage of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09012890000057"></a>The Minister may not be able to take them on, but I hope that he takes the drift and the thrust behind them, because we clearly have responsibilities to ourselves as humankind and, as I would put it, to God&#146;s creation, the natural life. There is a balance to be struck somewhere and I commend my noble friend on his amendments.</p>

She has prompted me to get to my feet to question a couple of things. First, she said that marine wind farms would damage wildlife; actually, the evidence so far from the Thames array and the initial assessments of other wind farms suggests that the pillars on which they sit are likely to create extra habitats. Even the RSPB does not argue that they damage birds, so I wonder just where the damage to wildlife that she foresees will come from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09012890000059"></a>Secondly, the case has not been proven for nuclear, although I do not want to get into that debate now. The noble Baroness mentioned the Severn barrage and big offshore wind farms, such as the one likely to be built north of Lundy. If a project went ahead&#151;I am not a solid barrage supporter, but we must harness the power of the Severn by some tidal method, whether by tidal lagoons or the softer tidal reef that was referred to&#151;and if the large wind farm is built, the grid will not support a developed Hinckley or any other nuclear power station in the south-west. That will be automatically ruled out. I simply ask the noble Baroness: is it not better to have a free source of energy from the waves, the tides and the wind than one that will cost us for ever, because we will have to dispose of nuclear waste?</p>

You might have expected that I would feel like that because of the statements I made when we were talking about the objectives of the MMO and the need for the marine Bill to focus on what it started off being about&#151;the conservation of the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09012890000062"></a>Indeed, I was delighted to see from the Minister&#146;s explanatory note on marine policy statements that it will set out the UK&#146;s vision for the marine area as a clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse sea within the framework of sustainable development. The marine policy statements should focus on that. They will have to say important things about a whole variety of policies, but if the Bill gives special consideration to climate change and energy security, that will downgrade some of these other very important objectives that the marine Bill was originally intended to promote. Much as I believe in the importance of tackling energy security and climate change, I would hesitate to elevate them above other objectives.</p>

I wondered how the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, would get food security in, but she managed it just at the end of her contribution. On the one hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, suggested, perhaps many of the offshore renewable developments might not fall within the remit of the MMO but will go over the threshold and be considered by the Infrastructure Planning Commission. None the less, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has done us a great service by introducing some of the considerations that inevitably lie within the marine planning environment, albeit that they are not the only considerations, which is the essential point of the argument.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09012890000064"></a>In terms of commercial certainty, I agree that we require a huge amount of investment in energy over the next 10 or 20 years. We are talking about tens of billions of pounds. As much stability and certainty as possible is conducive to that investment. The Government have provided a good framework and certainty for companies to invest, through recent planning legislation and the Energy Act. It is also clear that we need a lot of renewable energy. The provisional European target for this country is 15 per cent of energy by 2020, which equates to about 30 or 33 per cent of electricity generation. The figure at the moment is that about 5 per cent of electricity is generated through renewables, so we must see a huge expansion, in which offshore has a major contribution to make, as I hope will marine energy, if we can take advantage of the technological lead that the UK has at present. Many lessons can be learnt from previous situations in which the UK has had a technological lead but has not translated it into major development with a positive impact on jobs, skills and future investment.</p>

I see a balance, too, but I believe that nuclear could play a bigger part and help us in conserving our wildlife. That was why I raised the matter in the committee when we had the opportunity to talk to Ministers about it. It seemed to me then, as a mere Back-Bencher, that we have one department doing one thing and another doing another thing, and then this Bill comes through. Clearly, if we can have a concerted effort, we can have better solutions. Personally, I do not rule out a barrage, but I think that it brings problems with it. On the construction side, there is clearly a climate change/emissions balance; whatever construction goes ahead, one is clearly looking for such a balance. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, that I was not suggesting that the nuclear station should be down at Hinkley, when other sites not in sensitive areas would not fall within the remit of these discussions. We recognise the serious future demands for us to produce enough energy, particularly from renewables. However, when I was listening to what was going on in the committee, it seemed that nuclear was not included, when I felt that it could, perhaps, contribute quite well.</p>

There are also indications that other companies are interested in investing in new nuclear. On the other hand, we know that all but one nuclear power station is due for decommissioning by 2025, so the new developments taking place will tend to replace existing nuclear development. That is why it is important to do everything that we can to encourage renewables, too. There has to be a balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09012890000070"></a>On the Severn tidal power issues, noble Lords may have seen the announcement on Monday, when the Department of Energy and Climate Change produced a shortlist&#151;essentially, a mixture of barrages and innovative lagoon schemes. Importantly, we also announced &#163;500,000 of new funding to further develop embryonic technologies such as reefs and fences. The progress of those technologies will be considered before decisions are taken on whether to go ahead with a Severn tidal power scheme.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09012890000071"></a>It is interesting to reflect on what my right honourable friend Ed Miliband said in making that announcement. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="09012890000139"></a>&#147;We have tough choices to make. Failing to act on climate change could see catastrophic effects on the environment and its wildlife, but the estuary itself is a protected environment, home to vulnerable species including birds and fish. We need to think about how to balance the value of this unique natural environment against the long-term threat of global climate change. It is vital we seek public views and collect all information we need to make sure our climate change actions are ambitious yet fair&#148;.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09012890000072"></a>I also reflect on the message from the Welsh Assembly Government Minister for the Environment, Sustainability and Housing, Jane Davidson, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="09012890000140"></a>&#147;Harnessing the power of the Severn Estuary tides could make a significant contribution towards achieving the UK targets for renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, but we must ensure that environmental issues are taken fully into account&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012890000126"></a>That fairly reflects the balance here. In view of our previous debate about devolution and the concern that this will not all hang together, it is good that we have had the same response from the Welsh Assembly Government in respect of the Severn. That encourages me for the future.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09012890000073"></a>Perhaps I should now turn to the amendment. In preparing a marine policy statement, we must consider an extremely wide range of issues and policies. The intention is to bring together all policies capable of having an impact on the marine area. This is the first time that that has occurred and, at the end of it, we want a coherent and integrated statement of policy that will make a real contribution to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09012890000074"></a>Clause 42(1)(a) explains that the marine policy statement will state general policies that contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the marine area. To do that, the policy authorities will need to consider a wide range of factors when drawing up the statement, such as the legislative commitments, national policies and targets relating to the marine area covering sectors ranging from fisheries, oil and gas, offshore energy and ports. They will need to consider information and trends on different uses, the resulting pressures and likely changes. They will need to consider how to deal with interactions in uses and what guidance to provide to decision-makers to help them to resolve priorities. They will also need to consider the interface between the land and sea and the policy on regional and international interfaces.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09012890000075"></a>Naturally, some policies feature higher in our consciousness than others at any given time. Mitigation of climate change and security of energy supply are

As the noble Lord knows, the Climate Change Act imposes a duty to lay before this House and the other place a programme of policies and proposals that contribute to the achievement of sustainable development and set out how we will respond to the risks facing the UK as a result of climate change. Clearly, those policies and programmes will need to be reflected in our marine policy statement. The same applies to our policies on energy and security of supply. We are already engaged in producing national policy statements under the Planning Act that will set out policies on national energy infrastructure.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09012890000076"></a>We do not dispute the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions or of ensuring a secure energy supply for the UK. As a Minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change, I know that that goes to the heart of what the department is about and why it was established. Our concern, which the noble Baronesses, Lady Miller, Lady Hamwee and Lady Young, identified, is that we fear that the amendment would change the overall context and focus of the marine policy statement by setting the contribution to the achievement of sustainable development within the specific context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and securing energy supply.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09012890000077"></a>As I said, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the security of energy supply, alongside all the other important issues, such as conservation, marine industries, marine heritage and coastal communities, ought to be considered in the round. The duty contained in the marine policy statement and the fact that it must contribute to sustainable development set the right context and balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09012890000078"></a>Although we have spent some time on particular debate, it is an important one, as it goes to the heart of what marine planning statements and marine plans are about. On that basis, it has been an extremely useful debate.</p>

<p><a name="09012890000127"></a>is the very wording that we condemned in Clause 2. We said that it was not strong enough and not what the Bill should be about. This is not what the marine planning statement should be about, either. It should be a bit more beefy. The idea behind the amendment derived from a concept that the Committee has accepted before, which is that this Bill is part of a daisy chain of legislation: the Climate Change Act, the Energy Act, the Planning Act and now the marine Bill all coming together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09012890000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, was concerned that the marine planning statement could not consider marine development over 100 megawatts because a national planning statement would deal with that. I would like the Minister to say, if he is able to, that the marine policy statement would have to incorporate even those things on which it did not make the final determining factor. Marine policy statements should have a policy on all activity. Indeed, Clause 42(1)(a) talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="09012890000149"></a>&#147;the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012890000128"></a>I have read this carefully and I do not think that the fact that these matters are not within the competence of the MMO excludes the marine policy statement from considering them.</p>

I thought that he meant the power to give consent in relation to offshore renewables that went above the threshold which fell to the IPC. The marine policy statement will, I suspect, be a rather more general statement. As I have said already, I expect and confirm that it will be consistent with any national policy statement on renewable energy. The IPC will also be informed by advice that it is given by the Marine Management Organisation.</p>

It reinforces the argument&#151;a very good thing&#151;that the MMO has a key role in the policy decisions that affect even the elements that currently under legislation fall to the IPC. It is very important that we emphasise this.</p>

The marine policy statement will be very wide and will embrace many factors. Our slight contretemps is that, within this and alongside it, there are the provisions of the Energy Act and the thresholds under which certain nationally significant infrastructure projects&#151;I hope that I have the terminology right&#151;fall to be decided by the IPC. One achieves consistency through both the marine policy statement and the national policy statement. As I said in debates on the Planning Bill, we must ensure consistency between  the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09012890000092"></a>This is an almost seamless continuation of the previous debate. I tabled these amendments to understand how the consistency between the various marine policy statements and the national policy statements will be achieved.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09012890000093"></a>The Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred to Clause 2, which is about the Marine Management Organisation. One question here is about how the MMO will be involved in the creation of the marine policy statements. But that is not the focus of these amendments. I appreciate that there will be marine policy statements for discrete areas, although I noted that the Minister was referring to &#147;the&#148; statement.  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_330"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am not sure whether he anticipates that there will be several or one, but I am particularly concerned about conflict. The MPSs must contribute,</p>
<ul><a name="09012890000151"></a>&#147;to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012890000130"></a>I was in the Moses Room so I missed the debate on Clause 40 and my noble friend Lady Miller&#146;s amendments exploring where the boundaries are. I will read that with interest. I wondered after I had tabled the amendment, and too late to do anything about it, whether I should have included as an issue here that we are talking about sustainable development in the UK, period, or of the UK, including the marine area.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09012890000094"></a>There seem to be a number of examples of possible conflict. In the best of all worlds, there will be no conflict. The policy statements under this legislation and under the Planning Act will emerge with no inconsistencies between them. But how do we get from here to there? Energy is an obvious area where there could well be conflict. A development, such as a wind farm or barrage, in one geographical area may affect another geographical area. A development which will contribute to the reduction in emissions may be good for everybody on the land but may raise issues about the effect on the immediate marine environment. Access to the grid was also referred to in the previous debate.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09012890000095"></a>I am pretty sure my amendments to Clause 42 are not the answer but at least they enable me to raise the question and to probe the Minister&#146;s optimism. Amendment 89AA is essentially the same point as applied to marine plans rather than marine policy statements. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="09012890000096"></a><b><a name="90128-0012.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09012890000208"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> The noble Baroness raises a number of important points. I am sure there is no intention on the Government&#146;s part to produce inconsistent policies, but with so many departments involved and different marine policy statements and national policy statements being produced, it would be extremely surprising if Ministers did not occasionally feel that their desired outcomes did not mesh as well as they had hoped with statements already produced.</p>

<a name="90128-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09012890000097"></a>I am in a slight muddle and I need clarification. The Defra document, <I>A Strategy for promoting an integrated approach to the management of coastal areas in England</I>, says on page 12:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="09012890000142"></a>&#147;The UK Marine Policy Statement,&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="09012890000152"></a>&#147;to be agreed by Government departments and the Devolved Administrations, will articulate our joint vision and objectives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012890000132"></a>It seems to say there is going to be just one marine policy statement, one document, for all the devolved powers. The dilemma is that Clause 42 refers to marine policy statements, which confuses me. The Minister also talked about marine policy statements on the last amendment, which makes you think, &#147;Hang on, there is going to be more than one&#148;. Then you wonder whether they will be like national policy statements, where there will be 12 or 15&#151;one for renewable energy and one for airwaves, et cetera. So I am afraid that I am slightly confused. It is probably my fault and it probably is crystal clear to other Members of the Committee, but I am afraid not to me. I should like clarification on that.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09012890000098"></a>Will the Minister please give the Committee a little more detail on how he envisages the statement or statements being produced? Will they be drafted in the separate departments and circulated to others for approval? How will the different departmental responsibilities be resolved where the statements overlap, bearing in mind that at least six government departments are involved in the marine area? Any contradiction between marine policy statement or statements will, I hope, be spotted by the MMO before any real confusion is caused. Where marine policy statements interlink with national policy statements, the results could be more damaging. I hope that the Government will consider carefully the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="09012890000099"></a><b><a name="90128-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012890000209"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> Again, this continues our discussion of marine policy statements. Perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that in the debate just before the break I outlined some of the points she raised. I understand the problems that she and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, have had, so I will just briefly set out for them that, essentially, the marine planning system is a two-stage approach: first a UK marine policy statement and then a series of marine plans to apply the policies in the policy statement to particular geographical areas. Decisions on licensing and consents in the marine area will then have to be taken in accordance with the marine policy statement and the plans.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09012890000100"></a>The marine policy statement is to be agreed by the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, to which the noble Earl referred. I will come to the question of one policy statement in a moment. The UK Government and the devolved Administrations are called the policy authorities in the Bill. They comprise the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland. The Bill does not change the devolution settlement, but it provides for a form of executive devolution, which will allow the devolved Administrations to produce comprehensive plans with the agreement of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09012890000101"></a>I reiterate that the marine policy statement will cover the whole of the UK marine area. If, as we intend, all four Administrations agree the marine policy statement, there is no question that we will deliver consistency throughout the United Kingdom. Significant incentives are built into the system to encourage co-operation between us, but it is a fact of devolution that we cannot require other Administrations to agree with us. Therefore, we have to provide for devolved Administrations to opt out of the marine policy statement and for the Secretary of State to work alone if that is necessary. Clearly, that would be a matter of great regret and would diminish very much what we hope to achieve through the legislation.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09012890000102"></a>The purpose of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments is to ensure that, should there be a conflict between the policies laid down in the MPS and another MPS or with any national policy statement, the policy in the MPS always takes precedence. Partly, the noble Baroness is debating the MPS, but she is also taking us back to a significant debate we had last week about the relationship between the MMO and the IPC. However, that is to misunderstand the purpose of the subsection, which is  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_332"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to promote internal consistency within the marine policy statement and to specify what should take precedence if there is an apparent conflict within the statement, rather than dealing with conflicts between the MPS and external documents.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09012890000103"></a>Turning to Amendment 85AA, and in response to the noble Earl, it is important to emphasise that there will only ever be one marine policy statement at any one time, anywhere in the UK marine area. Clause 43(3) makes clear that a later MPS will always replace an earlier one, so that it is not possible to have two at the same time. This is to ensure clarity for decision makers. An MPS either exists and guides decision making in the region that has adopted it, or it does not.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09012890000104"></a>Amendments 85AB and 89AA take us into familiar territory, and concern the need for consistency, and the relative importance of the MPS, marine plans and national policy statements in the marine area. This falls outside the scope of the two subsections that are the target of these amendments. Clauses 42(3) and 49(6) are about internal consistency within the MPS or plan, not about consistency and conflict resolution with other expressions of policy. I have said a number of times that we are fully committed to ensuring consistency between the marine policy statement and the national policy statement. I hope that I have clarified the position for the noble Baroness and that she might consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

The determination of the Government to ensure consistency is not in doubt from what the Minister says. However, I am still a little unclear about how the legislation will support that.

It did seem that that was the likely explanation. Amendments 85BB, 85DZA, 85DA, 85DB, 86GZA, 86GZB, 86GZC, 86GZD, 86GZE and 86GZF are grouped with Amendment 85B. Amendment 85BA has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09012890000108"></a>The first of the amendments comes from a coalition of organisations called the Wildlife and Countryside Link. It is appropriate for me to list at this point the members of that coalition: Buglife, the Herpetological Conservation Trust, the Marine Conservation Society, the RSPB, the Wildlife Trust, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the WWF. Amendment 85B would impose a requirement to produce the marine policy statement, not just a power to do so. There is a concern that despite the enormous amount of work that has gone into the Bill to get it to this stage, without an obligation the MPS and the associated marine plans may not be produced.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09012890000109"></a>In the previous exchange, we referred to obtaining agreement from all the Administrations. The Government&#146;s response to the report of the Joint Committee indicated that it was their clear intention to create an MPS within two years of Royal Assent, as the Minister has just stated. We have been asked by the coalition to obtain an assurance from the Dispatch Box regarding the timetable rather than seek to put a specific date in the Bill. It may well reflect how misguided I am in the other amendments in the group when I read the comments on the last group, but Amendment 85DZA to Clause 44 would require every policy authority to review the MPS, not just the authority or authorities that prepared and adopted it, and that an authority which did not prepare it would have the power to delegate the function, so these two amendments should be read together.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09012890000110"></a>I could not follow whether Clause 46 covered every permutation of policy authorities which could prepare the MPS, and, because I became so confused over that, I was not entirely satisfied about whether the Secretary of State might have&#151;I shall put it this way&#151;undue power as between himself and the devolved Administrations. The Minister will be familiar with our concern, which he may think stretches to paranoia, that the Secretary of State should not have more power than we think is proper. It occurred to me to ask whether the Minister has a flowchart to show the combinations of authorities which can prepare, amend and withdraw the MPS, and whether one policy authority can commit or overrule another.</p>

Amendment 85B would insert a duty on the Secretary of State and the policy authorities to produce the marine policy statement, rather than leaving it open as an option&#151;although I am sure that that is not the Government&#146;s intention. There is a strong possibility that disagreements and confusions will arise between the policy authorities when agreeing the UK marine policy statement, and any delay will presumably knock on to other critical parts of the Bill. So much cannot be done without the policy statement: plans cannot be produced, development cannot be authorised and conservation zones cannot be designated.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09012890000114"></a>Later amendments will give us the opportunity to explore the detail of the MPS procedure, particularly the possibility of disagreement or derogation from the plans. At the moment, though, I shall focus on the possibility of early failure. It is clear that an MPS involving all the policy authorities acting jointly, as Clause 43(1)(a) makes possible, would be by far the best option, but the possibility of one or more authority taking their own route must be considered. My amendment in this group seeks to probe just what attempts the Secretary of State must make to ensure agreement. The term &#147;invited&#148; in subsection (2) is very vague. At what point is the decision made that a joint MPS is not possible?</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09012890000115"></a>I look forward to hearing from the Minister what stage the Government are at in the MPS&#146;s development. Are they developing it together with the other authorities, or are they on their own at the moment, hoping that the others will sign up to it later on? I see no reason why this process cannot be started now, as it involves the Secretary of State, the Scottish and Welsh Ministers and the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland. How much time will the Government take to overcome disagreements between authorities? The Government have expressed their hope that the marine policy statement will be complete within two years of Royal Assent. Will that be postponed if agreement is hard to come by, or will they carry on regardless on their own?</p>

It gets down to the nitty-gritty of how this is going to work in practice. I reiterate that we have every expectation that it will be possible to produce a marine policy statement embracing the whole of the United Kingdom with the support of the UK Government and all the devolved Administrations. If that is not possible, we have provision in the Bill to deal with that eventuality, but we are confident that it will be possible. Ministers always stand here and resist the use of the word &#147;must&#148;, but the noble Earl should be in no doubt that we are committed to preparing a marine policy statement; we want it to be jointly agreed and published by all the UK Administrations.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09012890000117"></a>The noble Earl has reiterated the point that he made regarding the group that we were debating before when he asked about some of the practicalities of how  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_335"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column 335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this will be done. There has already been close contact with officials from all four Administrations and I assure him that that will continue. All the Administrations will have points that they wish to bring to the table and within the UK Government there are different departments. The aim, however, is to involve everyone as early as possible in order to get the kind of ownership, expertise and experience that will come from different parts of the country.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09012890000118"></a>Our problem with the amendment is that it would go against the whole principle of how we should take this forward, by removing the requirement for the Secretary of State to invite the devolved Administrations to participate in preparing a marine policy statement. It would also be difficult and unusual to impose a statutory duty on all four policy authorities to jointly agree an MPS. It is possible that, despite our best efforts, agreement on an MPS may not be reached. It is difficult to place a requirement in law that all the policy authorities hold the same policies for marine matters. We have to have a construct in the Bill that encourages that agreement. The Bill has a fall-back position if it is not possible to reach agreement, but we must do everything we can to ensure that agreement  is reached.</p>

<a name="90128-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09012890000119"></a>I understand why Members of the Committee are concerned. Bringing together the devolution settlement and our collective intention of making this marine Bill work and have consistency is clearly a formidable challenge. Only so much can be achieved by legislation. It also depends on the different parties working well together. All four Administrations have lots of incentives to make it work together. All the signs that we have seen in the past few months are positive in that direction. While I cannot stand here and guarantee that a marine policy statement will be produced that commands the support of all parties concerned, I assure Members of the Committee that we will work as hard as we  can to achieve that. In so doing, we will want to  work very closely and invite early participation of the devolved Administrations in the work that needs to  be undertaken.</p>

The problem with irony is that it does not look very good in <I>Hansard</I>, because nobody can understand it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000004"></a>Amendment 89 relates to petitions which are not valid or active under the Government&#146;s scheme. The amendment states the position clearly. We had some discussion about this on Monday, and I think that the Government will say that nothing will prevent the local authority from doing as the amendment suggests. We have spoken about whether councils will nevertheless regard the Bill as the maximum rather than the minimum provision. We will continue with these discussions as we wrestle with this part of the Bill over the next few weeks.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000005"></a>I have had a specific request to raise the matter on behalf of the City of London Corporation. It is not a body I normally have a great deal to do with, but Mr Double, the Remembrancer of the corporation, has written to me. He says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012874000119"></a>&#147;It is part of the custom of London (what is now the City of London) that local communities, gathered in wardmotes, should be able to petition the Court of Common Council (the City&#146;s administrative arm) to ensure that issues of local concern are addressed. By this method, individual voters can secure direct involvement with the decision making body. The Court of Common Council is required to respond to such petitions and usually does so by referring to the issues raised to a committee for detailed consideration and a report.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012874000120"></a>It cannot be the intention of the Bill that such examples of effective local democracy should be displaced by the new provisions. Amendment 89 provides an opportunity for the Minister to confirm that existing arrangements&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09012874000103"></a>that is, in the City of London&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09012874000104"></a>I am very happy to ask that question on the corporation&#146;s behalf.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000006"></a>Amendment 96 amends Clause 12(1)(e), which excepts a petition,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000127"></a>&#147;made under and in accordance with any other enactment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000105"></a>The amendment is tabled partly to probe what that means. Taken together with Amendment 98B, which would insert a new subsection, my amendment is intended to clarify the position. It sets out a number of instances where it seems to us that the council will find difficulty in applying the Government&#146;s scheme to specific circumstances that apply. Yet if a petition appears to be valid, it will have to be dealt with according to the statutory scheme. In order to probe this issue, I shall set out examples of some of the difficulties that a prescriptive, top-down, nationally imposed scheme may have.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000007"></a>One difficulty relates to petitions made under and in accordance with any other enactment. An obvious example is a petition for a mayor, but there may well be others.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000008"></a>The second is a petition in connection with a planning application that is under consideration by the authority. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, pointed out on Monday that petitions about a planning application will have to be dealt with there and then as part of the planning process and regarded as a representation in relation to that application. It would be ridiculous to deal with such a petition in any other way; therefore, it would have to be outside the scheme as laid down. Yet that does not appear to be the case in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000009"></a>The third is a petition made in connection with a licensing application. Exactly the same situation applies as to planning applications. If someone is applying for a licence to run a taxi or to amend the opening hours of a local pub, for example, the council makes a decision in a quasi-judicial capacity under the legislation applying to that kind of licensing. Yet the petition itself could hardly be said to be made under, and in accordance with, an enactment. The enactments allow people to make representations but not necessarily a petition.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000010"></a>The fourth is a petition made in connection with the annual budget-making process of the authority. This is the most important example each year of an instance where the council is making decisions according to a set timetable&#151;it has to. There is no point in a petition going through a convoluted system under the Government&#146;s requirements if it comes in the day before the council&#146;s budget-making meeting; it clearly has to be reported to that meeting and considered at it as part of the budget-making process. That is so obvious, and it is what a normal council will do as a matter of course in a common-sense, pragmatic way, which is our argument throughout.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000011"></a>There may be matters generally in connection with an item due to be discussed at an early meeting of the council, a committee, a sub-committee, the executive, any other body or at a public meeting of a cabinet member who has delegated power to make decisions&#151;sometimes those decisions are made in public by a cabinet member sitting as a chairman but making decisions as a one-man committee, which is a strange way to make decisions but an open and public way for  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one person to do so. Whatever decisions are made, if they are made quickly, the petition clearly has to circumvent all the other processes and simply be put to the meeting of whatever body is making the decision. It is so obvious, and it is what a sensible council will do. Yet the Government are trying to tie councils up in red tape, and people might well be able to come back and say, &#147;My petition wasn&#146;t dealt with correctly under the scheme, as you just considered it the day after the meeting and rejected it, without giving it the full consideration the scheme says it must have&#148;.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000012"></a>Councils carry out all kinds of public consultation. More consultation takes place nowadays than ever before, by a factor of probably 10 or 20, perhaps more. A lot of people complain that there is too much consultation; they do not want to be consulted again and just want councils to get on with it. Nevertheless, consultation is built into all kinds of things the council does. The council sets out a consultation process. Sometimes it is a statutory or semi-statutory process, as under the local development framework. On this particular issue, the council just decided to carry out consultation and then set up the scheme. It is ludicrous for a petition on a matter regarding that consultation process to be considered in any way other than as part of that consultation process and for the council to have a petition scheme preventing that happening.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000013"></a>I am sure that noble Lords with experience in these matters can probably think of lots of other circumstances where the Government&#146;s tightly organised scheme will not fit. Amendments 96 and 98B seek to set out some of the problems that the government scheme is likely to cause, to show the complexity of the issue and the need for flexibility.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000014"></a>Amendment 127 simply removes the Government&#146;s rather feeble attempt to deal with this problem, compared with the much more positive and rigorous way of dealing with it as set out in these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000015"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012874000148"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for having given me the opportunity of speaking to Amendment 89, as it enables me to apologise to the Minister for the contumacious manner with which I treated her on Monday, and to say that I am delighted to be able to speak on an amendment that is without controversy.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000016"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will know, the letter from the Remembrancer, the Parliamentary Agent to the City, was copied to me by virtue of my previous membership of the House of Commons on behalf of the City. I do not propose to rehearse what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said because I think he admirably made the case the City asked him to. I join him in hoping that the Minister can meet his and the City&#146;s request.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000017"></a>Perhaps I may reinforce the reference to the City&#146;s ancient practices, which were involved in the passage the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, communicated. They go back a long way. The Remembrancer is the only local government officer in the land who is allowed to go anywhere within the Palace of Westminster without let or hindrance. I have known the last four Remembrancers; they have all been men of the highest

In 1571, when the office was created, the initial appointment was of a drunken poet.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000018"></a>Since I am citing the City of London as one of the cradles of our democracy, I shall reinforce it with a case in the Westminster part of the constituency. Charles James Fox, whom I greatly respect, was the Member of Parliament for the City for 26 years, while I was the Member for only 24, so he gets the bronze medal for being the third longest serving Member for the City since 1283. He had the experience of fighting Midhurst, where there were only seven voters, and Malmesbury, where there were only 13, until he arrived in Westminster, where there were 6,000 electors, which was what I will describe as a serious election. So liberal was the franchise in Westminster, and thus nurturing and fostering democracy in this land, that when the Great Reform Bill came in, the franchise was tighter than the Westminster one and therefore, as a result of the Bill&#146;s passage, the electorate at Westminster fell.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000019"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012874000149"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I support my noble friend&#146;s comments. I apologise for the absence of my noble friend Lady Warsi this afternoon. She is not at all well. Whereas I was planning to participate much more in the later stages of the Bill, I am now going to have to cope with doing so for most of this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000020"></a>I support the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, particularly in what he said about flexibility. It is all very well there being government guidance, but, as he said, there are many different types of consultation and some petitions are different from others. For example, if the closure of a school is proposed, thousands of people with children in that school at that time will submit a petition. You obviously have to consider that but it is rather different from getting a petition about some issue that the public are suddenly very concerned about. I would like the Minister to acknowledge that the provision is fully flexible.</p>

We want to ensure that everybody in a community&#151;not just those who are active in it and are well used to organising and signing petitions&#151;has a clear notion of how they might bring something to the attention of the council. I think that that response deals with Amendments 89 and 127. Amendment 127 would remove a helpful pointer on what a council might want to include in its scheme; for example, it may help people to understand something related to the functions of a different and connected authority.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000024"></a>Amendments 96 and 98B relate in broad terms to the Government&#146;s commitment, set out in the community empowerment White Paper, that petitions on a few issues such as planning and licensing will be dealt with differently in order to reflect, as the noble Lord said, existing statutory processes. Our stated intention is to use the order-making power in Clause 14(4), which will exclude those matters from the scope of the duty to respond to petitions, as it is simply common sense to do so. We want to avoid setting up parallel routes for considering local people&#146;s concerns in those areas; the processes that exist are extensive and well known. Petitions on those subjects do not need to go through that separate system.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, spoke about the need for flexibility, which raised some interesting questions, particularly around consultation. We should reflect on that in the context of using secondary legislation, which would allow us to seek the views of the sector before putting legislation before Parliament. The amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, capture the broad intention, although I suspect that the drafting would be more complex. I hope that he can withdraw them so that we can reflect on the issues in more detail. I would be happy to discuss them with him before Report.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000026"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012874000151"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Amendment 127 relates to Clause 18, and we will come to that in a later group. There are very serious flaws in Clause 18 at the moment, and I think we will want to discuss them in detail later but not now.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000027"></a>The Minister said that a few issues will be excluded by the powers in subsection (4), which I shall come to in a moment. However, I do not think that a few issues will be excluded if the provision is sensibly worded. I think that a large number of issues will have to be excluded, partly because very often petitions appear not in a vacuum but in relation to something that the council is already doing. I mentioned, for example, the budget-making process. If what the council does in its budget-making process is controversial, a lot of petitions will come in directly in relation to that and indeed to lots of other decisions that are on the agenda or are about to get on to the agenda of a meeting. Therefore, the issues that are already going through the council system are very important, and I do not think that there will be only a few.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000028"></a>I have already said that, unless the wording in Clause 14(4) is changed quite substantially, when people look at this legislation, they will think it is crackers. Subsection (4)(a) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000128"></a>&#147;the appropriate national authority&#151;</ul>

<ul><a name="09012874000129"></a>&#147;may by order specify matters falling within subsection (2)(a) which are not to be regarded as relating to a function of the authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000107"></a>Subsection (2)(b) refers to &#147;relevant matters&#148;. However, for the Secretary of State to issue a document that says that planning applications are not to be regarded as relating to a function of the authority is madness. This is not real-world wording; it is crazy. It may mean that to lawyers, who will understand it, as perhaps will some of the rest of us, but you cannot tell a council to exclude planning applications because they do not relate to its function when they are one of the most important things that a council does.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000029"></a>I get the impression that this legislation has been written by people who are on a different planet but I think that the Minister will already have gathered that from what I have said. In the mean time, although there are important issues here that still have to be discussed and resolved, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This group concerns a smallish number of miscellaneous issues which, nevertheless, need to be put on the record and probed.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000031"></a>Amendment 91A brings us back to our old friend, the definition of a valid petition. Clause 12(1)(a) says that, for a petition to be valid, it must be &#147;addressed to the authority&#148;. I simply want to add the words &#147;or presented&#148; so that it reads that a valid petition has to be &#147;addressed or presented to the authority&#148;. I am not sure what the Government will say &#147;addressed&#148; means but, in my view, it means an address written down; in other words, at the minimum, it should say &#147;to East Sussex County Council&#148; or &#147;to Cornwall County Council&#148;, or whichever authority the petition is being presented to, yet a large number of informal petitions that come in and have to be treated properly are not. I read out two yesterday and shall repeat them:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012874000122"></a>&#147;We as residents of Mansfield Crescent want a one-way system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000108"></a>That is not addressed to anyone. The second reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012874000123"></a>&#147;We the undersigned want to stop the speeding traffic on Chapel House Road&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000109"></a>That is not addressed to anyone. I think that they were presented separately to different committees of Pendle Borough Council. They might have been presented to the town councils in Brierfield or Nelson, or they might have been presented directly to the authority which has powers to do these things&#151;that is, the county council. However, they were not addressed to  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anybody, so they would not have been valid for that reason, according to the Government&#146;s scheme, if the word &#147;addressed&#148; means what I think it means.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000032"></a>Amendment 126 relates to Clause 18. Some of the supplementary provisions in that clause are worthy of discussion. Under Clause 18(2)(a), the principal local authority&#146;s petition scheme may include,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000130"></a>&#147;provision relating to petitions which are not valid petitions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000110"></a>I do not understand the purpose of these eight pages if they can be ignored so that the petition scheme can apply to invalid petitions. If there is to be a detailed prescription of a valid petition, rather than telling local authorities that they may include petitions that do not fit the precise criteria laid down&#151;for example, because every signature is not dated, which is one of the more ludicrous ideas&#151;they ought to have a duty to consider them. Otherwise, there is a great risk that a lot of valid petitions&#151;for example, for a one-way system in Mansfield Crescent or for traffic calming on Chapel House Road and hundreds of thousands of others all over the country&#151;would be excluded because they do not fit. Therefore, I propose the insertion of &#147;shall&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148; in line 31.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000033"></a>Amendment 128 provides that a petition that clearly relates to a number of different authorities can be photocopied, either by the petitioners or by the council that first receives it, and that those photocopies should then be regarded as a true copy of the petition. The Newcastle scheme makes that provision so that people can hand in true copies of petitions rather than the original. On a matter such as winter gritting&#151;to pick an issue at random&#151;people might well want to present a petition to the town council, the district council and the county council, perhaps to the police and possibly even to the Lord Lieutenant, although I am not sure what he would do with it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000034"></a>I shall speak to Clause 18 stand part. Clause 18(2)(c) relates to whether a petition handed to one authority can be dealt with and passed to another authority. This paragraph seems to allow it, but other clauses, which we will discuss later, appear not to. We need some clarity to avoid confusion.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000035"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012874000154"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I shall speak to Clause 18 stand part, but I support what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said on the other amendments in this group. Clause 18 adds confusion. It allows local authorities to have variations, and being a localist I agree with that, but it contradicts some of what we have been talking about. I hope that the Government will think again on this. The system needs to be fairly flexible. If the Government want to give guidance and include all these matters in the Bill, the system must be flexible.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000036"></a>As we have said, there are many different types of petitions. For example, some may be generated by people wanting to change the position of a level crossing, which may not necessarily coincide with the local authority&#146;s point of view, but it is something on which it could take advice and operate. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves said, some may be generated by what the council is doing at that moment. The whole issue needs rethinking, and that is why we have tabled the Question whether Clause 18 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

I said that allowing for non-statutory provisions but spelling out in primary legislation what they &#147;may in particular include&#148; was certainly confusing to me. I do not understand where in the hierarchy of legislative requirement&#151;going down from primary legislation, through secondary legislation, statutory guidance, non-statutory guidance and so on&#151;this might lie.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000038"></a>I understand the response that what is dealt with here is in addition to the statutory provisions and requirements that are in the earlier clauses&#151;that is implicit, but you have to think about that. It must be the case but, as my noble friend said, a fairly technical approach is required to reach that conclusion.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000039"></a>I was concerned, too, about the words &#147;may in particular&#148;. It is terminology to which we have become accustomed in legislation&#151;it normally means &#147;shall&#148;, but perhaps that is another spectrum. The answer to this was that they are practical points which might come to light when a scheme gets under way&#151;indeed they are&#151;and which are worth highlighting to local authorities for possible inclusion. Perhaps they are but, if so, their place is in guidance and not on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000041"></a>Clause 12 provides that valid petitions must be addressed to the authority that the petitioner requests to take action. Amendment 91A would change this so that valid petitions must be addressed or presented to the authority. I am reliably informed that the term &#147;addressed&#148; should not be taken literally as an address written on an envelope, as the noble Lord said, but rather in the sense of &#147;aimed at&#148;. As such, the act of presenting a petition to an authority clearly comes under the expression &#147;addressed&#148;; therefore the aim of the amendment is achieved.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000042"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09012874000157"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> This is a new doctrine. In the eight years I have been a Member of the House I have never heard that the words in legislation should not be taken literally. I am concerned that if the legislation appears before a court at some stage that is exactly what the court will do. Courts look at the words and take them to mean what they usually mean in the English language. If the noble Lord is saying &#147;addressed&#148; can mean someone shouting through a loud hailer outside the town hall, that is one use of the word; but for a written document, &#147;addressed&#148; means that the name of the addressee appears on it. I do not understand why the Government are resisting the amendment when it is a simple device for clearing up any possible confusion.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000043"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09012874000158"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I agree with the noble Lord that the word is somewhat ambiguous. My speaking notes attempted to make that clear. However, a statement  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Parliament by a Minister on the Bill would be taken into account by a court in seeking to work out what the word means. We have a precedent for that in the Pepper v Hart case. That means that it is important that the paragraph that I have just read out is clearly stated in <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000044"></a>Amendments 126 and 128 relate to Clause 18 and address the issue of the provisions which local authorities may make in their petition schemes in addition to those set out in this chapter&#151;such as the process of dealing with petitions that are not valid, which are made to more than one authority and those made to one local authority but which clearly relate to the functions of another. Noble Lords have said clearly what their feelings are on this. Amendment 126 would change the status of these issues from suggestions to requirements for inclusion in petitions schemes.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000045"></a>The issues we have listed in Clause 18(2) are practical points which may well come to light when a scheme gets under way. They are therefore particularly worth highlighting to local authorities for possible inclusion in their petition scheme. I do not believe, however, that a scheme would grind to a halt if they were not included. Local authorities can take sensible decisions for themselves on how they approach these points and the range of others that will be important to them in their local context.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000046"></a>Inclusion of a list has a specific legal effect of identifying the nature of the discretion being exercised by the principal authorities. A similar effect might be obtained by placing the list within guidance but, as has already been said, that would be less certain, as guidance is simply suggestions on what can be taken up. Noble Lords clearly feel very strongly about this issue, and it would probably be worth discussing it further. I should be happy to meet before Report to look through this in a bit more detail.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000047"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012874000159"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> The Government are arguing that local authorities should have flexibility and then say that having a list sets out the sorts of things that might be included. If they wish to achieve flexibility, they should not have the list at all because, by including one, they prescribe, limit and restrict what might be added. I am happy to talk about this outside Committee and take the issues further.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000048"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012874000160"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> We have highlighted the issues that we think are particularly relevant as a guide, almost. However, there is a point worth discussing further before Report.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000049"></a>Amendment 128 provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000131"></a>&#147;a valid petition that is presented to one principal authority may be photocopied for the purpose of presenting the same petition concurrently to another principal authority&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000050"></a>Clause 18(2)(c) already suggests that local authorities may wish to make provision in their petition scheme setting out how they will handle a petition which relates to the functions of another local authority. Whether they will wish to set out photocopying arrangements, I do not know, but it is certainly open to them to do so. In case there is any doubt about the matter, I reassure the noble Lord that there is nothing in this Bill that would make a petition invalid if it were

The Minister was perfectly correct in saying that, if there is ambiguity in legislation nowadays, the House of Lords in its judicial capacity in Pepper and Hart said that a ministerial statement in the course of the debate, which can be read in <I>Hansard</I>, can be used to clarify that ambiguity. Surely, however, if there is an opportunity in the course of the debate to clear up the ambiguity by presenting in the Bill a better, clearer form of words, it would be better to do that than to leave it open to doubt so that, in years to come, somebody, somewhere, in some local authority&#151;some solicitor at some expense&#151;has to check <I>Hansard</I> for 28 January 2009. I do not know whether he would even find it in the index very easily. It is usually better to clarify an ambiguity, if there is one, before going any further with the legislation.</p>

I cannot believe that the <I>Hansard</I> of this Grand Committee will not become a bestseller and be read by everyone in the land. I read most of Monday&#146;s proceedings in bed last night. It was a great help in getting to sleep, so I am afraid that I missed the last two pages. When I woke in the morning, I thought, &#147;What&#146;s this in the bed?&#148;.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000054"></a>On the previous group, I was remiss in not thanking the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, who has temporarily left his place. I apologise to him for not having noticed that he was sitting behind me. He is a far greater expert than I am on the City of London. One of my noble friends has reminded me that one of his predecessors as a Member of Parliament for Westminster was John Stuart Mill, who I think in a recent poll of Liberal Democrats was voted as the greatest ever Liberal, so the noble Lord follows in a fine tradition.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000055"></a>I have also been remiss in not adding my commiserations to the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, for not being able to be here today. We have been impressed by her interest and performance as the Conservative spokesman in this Grand Committee on the first Bill for which she has been responsible. I hope that someone can pass that on to her. We look forward very much to her being back next time&#151;not that we do not want to see the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, as well.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000056"></a>In looking at this legislation, I have three principles regarding what we should try to persuade the Government to change. The first is to question whether the legislation is a good thing. We sometimes win on that but usually we do not because we are told that the House of Commons makes these decisions and it is not for us to say whether as a whole it is a good thing. Secondly, and importantly, is the practical question of whether it will work or whether it will cause problems. I hope  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Government will agree that much of our probing on this business of petitions is done on that practical basis. We do not want a scheme that will not work but will cause problems and make matters worse. Finally, even if we cannot get any changes at all to the meaning of the legislation, lawyers such as my noble friend Lady Hamwee and pedants like me think that it is important to at least establish what the words mean. Therefore, I am grateful that the Minister has agreed to look again at the ambiguity.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000057"></a>There is a difficulty with what the Minister said about local authorities being able to exclude certain things from the scheme because it would not work locally. He said that local authorities can take sensible decisions to exclude some issues. However, under this legislation, they cannot do that. Clause 14(4) says that the Secretary of State, not the local authority, will make that decision. Local authorities will be able to act only under decisions made by the Secretary of State. If the clause simply said that local authorities could exclude things that it was sensible to exclude in their area for good reasons&#151;in other words, if it left it up to them and trusted them to do it&#151;we would be very happy.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000058"></a>We are willing to meet the Ministers on all these matters at any time before Report to see whether we can improve the legislation. We clearly have a difference of view on the quality of the legislation as it stands, but if we can improve it we will be a little less unhappy than we would otherwise have been. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We are still on the question of valid petitions and the hoops that a petition has to jump through in order to be declared valid. Clause 12(1)(b) states that a valid petition,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000132"></a>&#147;requests the authority to take or cease to take action described in the petition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000111"></a>That seems to fly in the face of the view expressed in the previous debate, that authorities can receive petitions that do not refer to their functions and on which they cannot take any sensible action, other than to pass them to another authority and express a view about them.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000060"></a>I have already referred to the petitioners of Mansfield Crescent, who want a one-way system, and those of Chapel House Road, who want traffic-calming measures. The only sensible way that Pendle councillors could deal with those petitions was to pass them to the county council, probably to the Lancashire local committee of the county council, in order for it to deal

If they wished to do so, they could add recommendations, but I am not sure what they would be because it is not my area. That is the sensible thing to do, and Clause 12(1)(b) seems to prevent it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000061"></a>Therefore, Amendment 92 inserts,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000133"></a>&#147;or to make representations to any other body in support of the matters referred to in the petition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000112"></a>That may include taking other measures to back that up. It may be that the district council wants to mount some kind of information campaign in favour of the matter petitioned about. Perhaps the town council wants the matter to go up to the district council. It seems sensible to put this provision into the Bill to make it clear that not only can councillors receive petitions about things that they are not directly involved with, but they can take a limited amount of action on them and refer them.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000062"></a>Amendment 111 inserts three paragraphs. The first states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000134"></a>&#147;a principal local authority that receives a petition on a matter that does not relate to the function of the authority but relates to a matter which is the responsibility of one or more of its partner authorities may fulfil the requirements of this Chapter by referring the petition to that authority or those authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000113"></a>The second states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000135"></a>&#147;where such a reference takes place, the partner authority or authorities shall deal with the petition according to the provisions of this Chapter as if they were the principal local authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000063"></a>This is important because otherwise the body that receives a petition referred, for example, from a district council to the county council or from a district council to a primary care trust, may just shrug its shoulders and do nothing about it because it has not been addressed to it and therefore does not fall within the provisions of the Bill. The third paragraph defines &#147;partner authority&#148;.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000064"></a>These are important provisions in order for petitions to be taken seriously in an environment in which we have a lot of different authorities with different but interlocking and overlapping functions. Otherwise petitions will fall at the first hurdle by being given to the wrong authority.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000065"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09012874000166"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I support the amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has highlighted the problems in two-tier authorities and, as the leader of a county council, obviously I recognise them. One tries to work with one&#146;s district colleagues to resolve them.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000066"></a>I am more concerne, however, with what could be called necessarily partner authorities, such as PCTs and so on. But there are also bodies over which local government should have some control; for example, Network Rail. We talked about anecdotal evidence; I have a problem in Frinton, a nice little town on the Essex coast. The town&#146;s gates close it off from the rest of the world&#151;Frinton used not to have a pub. The residents love the gates; however, for safety reasons, Network Rail wants to change them; therefore there has been a big petition. The county council is, of course, the highway authority; but Network Rail has a statutory power to change things and, as leader of the county council, I am getting the blame for it. I have received many e-mails and so on.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000067"></a>There needs to be clarity because, although we received the petition, it was Network Rail&#146;s decision in the end. I am sorry to add to the complications but we need to think through how one can deal with these matters effectively.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000068"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09012874000167"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is a useful debate because the way in which the principal authority relates to its partners, the connected authorities defined in the Bill, and to bodies which are not strictly speaking its partners is complicated. The example of the petition given by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, demonstrated exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said about the complication of a two-tier authority. People do not know who is responsible for what, or to whom to direct their petition, and part of the purpose of the Bill is to make that clear and to publicise it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000069"></a>On some of the broader issues about our approach, Clause 12(1)(b) certainly does not stop councils passing on petitions to partner authorities or to anyone else. That is part of their responsibility. I shall come back to that issue in a moment.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000070"></a>Clause 14 requires principal local authorities in England and Wales to take steps in regard to petitions relating to their functions. It also requires unitary and top-tier principal authorities in England to take steps in response to petitions relating to an improvement in the economic, social or environmental well-being to which any of the partner authorities can contribute. That is there for a purpose. It means that unitary and top-tier councils which co-ordinate the local area agreements&#151;and therefore have the identified partners represented in this Bill, but in a slightly different form from the 2007 Act, which we discussed at some length&#151;bring everyone involved appropriately into the net.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000071"></a>There are also performance indicators around the local area agreements which are shared and promoted by partners. This means that if, for example, a local person were to raise an issue such as GP opening hours or crime and present it to the local authority, they would then&#151;because of the local area agreement and the way in which the connected authorities work in partnership&#151;have the right to ensure that the local authority acted and that it presented and stated their case to partner authorities. That is basically what we are trying to achieve in this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000072"></a>It is possible that people will contact directly the organisations responsible&#151;they might go directly to the PCT in the case of GP opening hours&#151;because that clearly will be quicker and easier. However, if they are not happy with the response they receive or they do not know about the PCT&#146;s own arrangements, they can go to the local authority; they have that further option. It will then be up to the authority to decide how to respond, and it can do so in a wide number of ways.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000073"></a>I do not want overstate what the authority could do. It might hold a meeting with the public body concerned to enable its constituents to put across their views. It might simply ask a PCT for a response to the petition and send it on. It might respond to the petition organiser and say that it does not think that the action called for is necessary and that it does not intend to take the matter forward. It has an enormous amount of options, which we would not in any way wish to  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prescribe. I do not want to overstate the extent of the burden which might be placed on the councils by the new duty to take steps after receiving a petition relating to functions of partner authorities, because the obligation is to do what is appropriate. I stress that we are not trying to put councils under any duty to deal with matters over which they have no effective control, but it is important to make sure that they can act more than as a post box, that they can act as advocates and make that connection with a partner authority.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000074"></a>Amendment 92 would provide that valid petitions, those that trigger an acknowledgement, would include those requesting authorities to make representations to any other bodies in support of the matters referred to. It would require them to act as advocates. It is right that that is provided for, but the aim is better achieved by Clause 14 because it places a requirement on the unitary and top-tier authorities to respond to petitions on issues of economic, social or environmental well-being as well as those in relation to functions. Those types of principal authority are well placed to respond to that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made a telling point about Network Rail. If a private-sector company&#151;or a public-sector company such as Network Rail&#151;acted in a way that damaged a local community&#146;s economic, social or environmental well-being, the appropriate authorities should be required to respond to petitions on those issues. Under Clause 14(2)(b), they are. They can take them up on behalf of their constituents even though we are not there talking about connected authorities. The problem with Amendment 92, however, is that it would extend that requirement to any body irrespective of whether it discharged functions over which the principal local authorities had any influence, or where they were. We might find, for example, a pressure group urging a local authority to act as an advocate to improve conditions in a sweatshop&#151;there is no end to the possibilities that might come under the term &#147;any other body&#148;. It does nothing for the efficacy of petitions or for a local authority&#146;s reputation to bring the local authority into effective engagement such as that, as I expect they would agree. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000076"></a>Amendment 111 proposes almost the opposite approach. It provides that, instead of putting the case for their communities&#146; wider concerns, principal local authorities would simply forward petitions on wider issues to the relevant bodies&#151;in fact, they would wash their hands of them. That is not in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve. A single point of contact is beneficial, particularly with two-tier authorities, but it does not achieve the wider objective of increasing the community&#146;s involvement in the interaction between principal and partner authorities. It would also lead to some practical problems.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000077"></a>The Bill achieves a similar outcome but more effectively. Clause 20 gives the Secretary of State the power to make provision for the handling of petitions by any type of local authority on the list. The Secretary of State could therefore place a duty on those bodies to respond to petitions, but she would do so only if there seemed to be a real need for it or the need had been driven by the bodies. Moreover, she would do so only

I believe that the Bill will ensure that people can petition on a wide range of local issues. It also ensures that provision for the handling of petitions by other local authorities can be made, if needed, in a way that takes into account the nature of those organisations.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000078"></a>I am advised by the invisible people behind me that there is a slight inaccuracy in what I said a little while ago. A principal authority is only required to respond to a petition relating to economic, social or environmental well-being as defined in the Bill if any of its partner authorities could contribute. Under the flexibility allowed in Clause 19, they could of course respond in any way in any event, but they are only required to do so under the conditions I have described.</p>

Including a provision about a &#147;relevant matter&#148; consolidates the confusion to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred. Economic, social and environmental well-being issues to which a partner authority could contribute suggests that there is more responsibility on the local authority, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid. We are not trying to avoid dialogue with local people but to get straight who carries the can and has the legal powers to do certain things. I am sure that there is a lot that the local authority can carry only a few inches forward. It will not be able to solve the problem.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000085"></a>The Minister suggested that Amendment 92 was too wide ranging. She will be pleased to learn that I agree with her; I put it down to probe and provoke, and to get a discussion going. However, I am clear that the Bill is too narrow and that we should find a form of wording somewhere in between. Perhaps we might discuss that further with her, but it may well also refer to Amendment 117.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000086"></a>I think that what the Minister said about Clause 20 was wrong in this context. The clause is about the handling of petitions by other bodies and provides that the Secretary of State in England and the appropriate national authority in Wales&#151;the Welsh Assembly&#151;may by order,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000136"></a>&#147;make provision for the handling of petitions by any body to which this section applies&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09012874000114"></a>I hear what the Minister says. When I was reading this, I understood it to mean that petitions would be presented to those bodies, but if it also encompasses petitions that are presented to the principal local authority and passed on to those bodies, that is an interesting and wider interpretation than I had previously thought. I think it is wider than how most people just coming to it will understand it. Again, perhaps we might discuss the exact wording to make absolutely clear what it includes. Although I feel that there is further discussion to be had on the basic issue, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000088"></a>This all applies to restrictions on the question of validity as it applies to petitions. Amendments 93, 99 and 129 refer to the concept of a valid petition having to have at least a specified number on the petition before it can be regarded as valid. Amendment 100 refers to the provision that the petition must include a date on which each person has signed the petition, presumably next to their signature. Amendment 100 would remove that provision. Amendment 97 would remove the provision that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000137"></a>&#147;if the petition is in electronic form&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000115"></a>it must be,</p>
<ul><a name="09012874000138"></a>&#147;made using the authority&#146;s e-petition facility&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012874000116"></a>which has been set up in Clause 10.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000089"></a>Those are three specific restrictions that we would not like to see in the Bill. On the first of them, the question of a number, the problem is that circumstances differ according to different petitions. In a large unitary county such as Northumberland or Cornwall or a large shire county such as Lancashire or North Yorkshire where people are petitioning about a general policy&#151;for no increase in the council tax precept from those authorities in the coming year, perhaps, or for an increase of a certain amount to do a certain thing, although that is fairly rare nowadays&#151;it is reasonable for the authority to take account of the number of people signing the petition. If, in the whole of Northumberland, only five people consisting of my noble friend Lady Maddock and her neighbours sign it, the authority is perfectly entitled to regard it with that degree of seriousness. If, on the other hand, 100,000 people sign it, the authority will regard it with a different degree of seriousness. But that is all down to common sense being applied by the authority, and the Government do not seem to be prepared to accept that authorities are capable of that.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000090"></a>In different circumstances, a petition signed by six people might be perfectly sensible. If the residents of the street in which I live, where there are about a dozen adults, send a petition to the local council with six signatures, and I have refused to sign it because I am a member of the local council and therefore it is coming to me, that is a majority&#151;six out of 11. That petition therefore deserves to be treated with every possible seriousness by whichever body of the council is discussing it. The residents might want the street lighting to be improved, or something like that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000091"></a>These are matters that must be left to local circumstances and local flexibility. When talking about numbers, the Minister said that it was okay and that all that the regulations would say was that the council must set minimum numbers for petitions and can set different minimum numbers for different purposes. We are back to the council employing people to work out those schemes and systems and having reams of detailed requirements. Then the barrack-room lawyers in the council, who may be council solicitors or councillors, will say that it does not fit and is not valid. That sort of silly argument goes on&#151;and the more detailed prescription there is, the more that silly argument goes on. It is a fact of life. Whereas if people are left to take decisions in a sensible, common-sense, flexible way, without being tied down and hidebound by these Gulliver rules, they will get on a lot better. So we want to take out the numbers.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000092"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, said that in his view a petition signed by two people from different households was a letter, not a petition. That is fair enough. Letters have to be taken seriously as well, which is where the flexibility comes in. If some councils do not respond seriously to what residents say, that is fair enough. In informal conversation with the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, the number &#147;two&#148; came up. I asked her, &#147;What happens if there is a petition from a little settlement with only three or four houses?&#148;. She said that two people might count as a petition, and I agree with her. That sort of flexibility needs to be in the provisions. Therefore, we do not need national rules, regulations, guidance and everything else; we just need to be allowed to get on it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000093"></a>The requirement that people should put on the document the date they sign it is ludicrous. Most informal petitions will be declared invalid because they will not have dates on them. It is as simple as that. Official petitions or petitions organised by political parties or pressure groups will have the date on because officials will know about the rules and regulations. However, such requirements will exclude the very people the Government say they want to bring into local democracy&#151;people who are perhaps more excluded from the system and do not feel at home with bureaucracies, official systems, councils and so on. Such a requirement will exclude people and large numbers of petitions. People wanting to draw up a petition about something happening in their area do not run off to the council or anywhere else to find out what the rules are. They do not even look on the internet. They go out and collect signatures and then they hand it in. You cannot turn around afterwards

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000094"></a>Electronic petitioning is a very important matter. The Bill requires local authorities to set up an e-petition facility. We support that; we think it is a very good idea for them to have that on their websites. What we do not say is that that automatically excludes any other petitions gathered by any other people or any other organisations on their own websites. That seems to be totally restrictive. If the local Women&#146;s Institute wants to gather a petition by electronic means, why should it not be allowed to do so? It can then present that petition to the council, either by printing it off and handing it in, which will get a press story, or by sending it by e-mail, which might get a press story, but it will not get a nice picture so they will probably print it off.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000095"></a>What are the Government going to do? What do they think that councils should do if people organise petitions in this way? Are they going to reject them just because they have been gathered by electronic means? It is a ridiculous bit of the Bill, and should be removed.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000096"></a>Amendment 103 is probing. It simply suggests that petitions should not be declared invalid because some of the people who have contributed to the petition and signed it have not obeyed the rules, or are not valid persons to sign it. Therefore, if a council receives a petition signed by 200 people and it turns out that 25 of them do not live, work or study in the council&#146;s area, and if the council has wasted a lot of staff time and money working this out, it cannot reject the petition because there are still 175 who do. Equally, if the petition includes more information than is required, such as e-mail addresses, which nowadays it might well do, or telephone numbers, that does not make it invalid. I think I will get a sensible answer on that, but it is something that has to be probed.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000097"></a>Amendment 121 refers to the six-month rule the Government wish to introduce. It refers to Clause 14, a part of the Bill we have not yet reached, on how a valid petition can become an active petition. This is another piece of extraordinary voodoo or local bureaucracy, where a petition first has to become a valid petition and then has to become an active petition. Only civil servants can dream up this kind of thing. The amendment refers to that part of the Bill. Nevertheless, it is a restriction and states that if a petition of the same or similar nature has been submitted within the previous six months, it will not be an active petition.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000098"></a>It may well be that a council wants to act sensibly. If a council receives a petition, goes through its decision-making processes and makes a decision and then an identical petition is received three weeks later, the council will simply write back saying that it has just made that decision. On the other hand, there may well be circumstances in which a council wishes to reconsider a decision within six months when it receives a petition disagreeing with the decision. For example, a highways authority comes up with a programme of new puffin  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crossings, and a particular puffin crossing is not in the programme, so people petition and ask why the crossing that local councillors had promised is not in the scheme. That petition goes through the system and is rejected because there are no more resources for the crossing. Then, miraculously, three or four months later, for whatever reason, the council discovers that it has more resources to put into puffin crossings. It makes an announcement that it has the money for three more crossings and asks where they should be, and the same people then put in a similar petition asking for one of the extra three crossings. Are the Government saying that the council should reject that petition and say that it is not an active petition because it has already been discussed in the previous six months? That is nonsense.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012874000099"></a>The Government are proposing to lay down detailed, rigid rules when what is required is sensible local flexibility. This argument is made all the time by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and by the Liberal Democrats. The rule is unnecessary. If the Government want rules, it may be that the council should have the power to reject a petition, but for legislation to lay down that a petition is not an active petition in those circumstances is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000101"></a>This is getting a bit ridiculous. I do not like doing this anecdotal stuff, but I received a petition yesterday from about eight people on Canvey Island about a roundabout between two roads, and I will try to deal with it. I would not like to find any reason to rule it out of order. As a leader of a council, I would not like to find any reason to rule any petition out of order. I would want to try to help and deal with the problem, whether the petition was signed by four, 10 or 5,000 people. To a certain extent, some of the regulation here is contrary to the first part of the Bill, which tries to promote local democracy, its popularity and the way it works. If we were to rule all these petitions out for various reasons, it would be harmful. Any good authority would try to deal with problems that come in.</p>

<p><a name="09012874000102"></a>I was grateful that the Minister said she will have discussions, but they need to be not simply with the LGA but with practitioners in the field&#151;officials, not necessarily elected people&#151;who, in large authorities, have petitions about something or other coming in every day. Some of this could harm dealing with the public on a day-to-day basis because there is more regulation than necessary.</p>

It is now 40 years since I was a councillor in the London Borough of Camden, and I am not going to produce examples drawn from that local government experience long ago. However, by analogy, I shall make reference to the decisions I used to have to make as the Member of Parliament for the Cities of London and Westminster, where 14 times as many people work than in the average consistency. Therefore, every time  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a business constituent wrote to one of my average constituency colleagues in the House of Commons, 14 people wrote to me, thus causing something of an imbalance in the ordinary correspondence. But no taxation without representation: they were writing about matters which their companies were perfectly entitled to follow up.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000002"></a>On the common sense issue, because the two Cities are where they are, there were also people who wrote to me after getting into difficulties with parking, having come from a long way away. It was perfectly clear, given that the two Cities cover quite a large area, that the individuals who wrote to me would not have the faintest prayer of knowing which local councillor was responsible for the parking attendants working for Westminster City Council or the Corporation of London. Because they were not an excessive number, I would take up matters on their behalf, and thereby hangs a moral tale.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000003"></a>One of the people who wrote to me in just that way was a photographer from Norwich who had contracts all over the country. Out of good sense, because he was used to being fined by the parking attendant ostensibly because his wheels were outside the white lines, he took a photograph of every parking space in which he parked his car so that he would have evidence to support a complaint about the fine which had been levied on him. As a consequence, the Corporation of London decided that all its parking attendants would carry cameras so that when they accused somebody of an offence they would have documentary evidence which would be conclusive if the man complained. So I wholly agree with my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that common sense is a very valuable instrument to enable one to make these decisions.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000004"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09012887000096"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I, too, completely agree. The example given by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, proves why we need a definition of who should be eligible to submit petitions that includes the phrase &#147;live, work or study&#148; and why we need a clear and accessible petition scheme. He is right that we are talking about common sense. That is what I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in relation to his last point, and I shall say it again. There is nothing to prevent a principal authority responding to a petition which either duplicates a recently received petition or raises a matter which is outside the terms of reference of a petition scheme or does not fulfil it. Councils can do that in addition to their formal petition scheme, and I am sure that they will go on doing that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has been rather rude about the Bill. I accept that he does not like the principle of it, but I have to take issue with his remark that this is something that civil servants have dreamt up. That is not fair to officials, who work hard and conscientiously; it is not fair to our parliamentary draftsmen, who work very hard to put matters into proper legal language and ensure that they are as clear as possible. Ministers are responsible for these policies; we do our best to improve the well-being of our communities, and that is what the Bill is about. It is about improving the accessibility of influence and enabling our communities&#151;those who do not normally  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>think of themselves as being influential or having any voice or power in the community&#151;to exert more influence.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000006"></a>When the noble Lord talks about the rules and regulations we have constructed, particularly regarding thresholds, I think that we are living on a different planet. My argument on thresholds is that, with one exception, we have made no rules. The threshold limits will be set by local authorities according to their circumstances. They may well have a threshold for a policy issue which covers the whole community, such as council tax. But they may well specify that a small issue such as allotments which affects fewer people can have a different threshold. It is entirely up to local authorities. All we are providing for is that, if the council feels it has to call a full council meeting, it has to have a maximum ceiling of 5 per cent. If authorities choose to set a nominal threshold of one or two signatures, as Birmingham Council already does, it is up to them; they can do that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000007"></a>In this legislation we are trying to protect councils from being legally required to spend time that they judge to be excessive in responding to petitions. We are trying to make sure that they do not feel that they have to respond to so many petitions that petitioners will end up with a superficial response. That would not serve any purpose. That is why we are leaving it up to authorities. It is not our aim to increase paperwork for councils.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000008"></a>There is a contradiction in the noble Lord&#146;s argument: he wants more prescription but, at the same time, he accuses us of being too prescriptive. In this very important area, we are not. Overall, permitting local authorities to set appropriate thresholds would best deliver our principles of allowing local people to have their say and to receive a response, while building on best practice and protecting councils from unreasonable burdens.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000009"></a>Amendment 129 raises related issues. It seeks to remove the power for the appropriate national authority to make orders or issue guidance on the thresholds for valid petitions which trigger an acknowledgement, a full council debate and a hearing of a senior officer. This power is useful because it helps to minimise requirements on councils. We will abide by this principle in issuing any guidance, but I do not think that there should not be any guidance at all on these issues. Guidance is intended to clarify and assist. It can give local authorities a clear idea of what is expected, and we will work with local authorities to make sure that it is fit for purpose. As I have said, we intend to issue a model scheme and suggest thresholds in guidance, which councils can choose to adopt if they wish. This model scheme is a guidance, a starting point, and we will work closely with the sector.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000010"></a>As with other examples of guidance, councils will not be required by legal obligation to slavishly follow what is contained in it. I cannot for a moment think that councils such as Essex or Sutton would believe that they would be. From the drafting of the chapter it is clear that councils have considerable discretion to create and operate their own schemes within the framework set down. The principal authority will simply set out in its petition scheme how many signatures  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are needed to trigger a full council debate. We want that number not to be inappropriately high. We have suggested that we will set a maximum threshold in the White Paper <I>Communities in c</I><I>ontrol</I><I>: real people, real power</I> because we do not want to exclude appropriate and legitimate requests for such a debate. Apart from that, there are no plans to intervene unless there is evidence that councils are setting thresholds so high as to make their petition schemes nugatory. I hope the noble Lord is reassured that we do not intend to use guidance or orders to place additional requirements on councils.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000011"></a>I have more sympathy with what the noble Lord said about the date. It would be open to councils to respond to petitions which are not dated, and I am sure that many of them would choose to do so. The point about the date is that it is useful for authorities to have a sense of how quickly signatures are collected. A petition which has generated a huge number of signatures in a fortnight is likely to suggest greater urgency than petitions which have accumulated signatures over a long period. The noble Lord referred the Committee to several petitions which did not contain dates and spoke about the lack of confidence of many people about how to make a petition. Again, I will add this to our discussion when we meet to talk about his concerns.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000012"></a>Clause 12 provides that a petition is validly signed if someone signs it and states their name, address and the date. Amendment 103 seeks to provide that valid petitions are not invalidated by some signatures not meeting these requirements or by their not being signed electronically. I do not think that there needs to be an express provision in the Bill for this. Certainly, principal authorities will have no lawful basis to refuse to respond to petitions signed by 5,000 people just because one or two signatures were not dated, and so on. I do not think that there is ambiguity in how the legislation is framed at this point but, to the extent that the noble Lord is afraid that there is, I hope that my clear statement on the issue will reassure him.</p>
<h5><a name="09012887000089"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000013"></a>Clause 14(1)(c) provides that principal authorities do not need to take substantive steps in response to petitions which duplicate those dealt with in the previous six months. Amendment 121 would remove the exclusion of petitions on the same topic as one received within the last six months. This would mean that local authorities were required to respond to repetitive petitions. All we are trying to do here is to protect councils from unnecessary work; it also identifies for local campaigners that there are time limits, which will focus what they are trying to achieve. I can see that six months is an arbitrary figure and that different periods might be appropriate. A year would be too long to wait. I take the point that that would be unfair, if new information came to light. I think that six months is a happy medium. I am inclined not to accept that amendment.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000014"></a>Amendment 97 removes the requirement on authorities to respond to a petition in electronic form only, when made using the authority&#146;s e-petition facility. Certainly, a petition signed by a number of people, scanned and e-mailed to the authority but not made using the e-petition facility is not a petition in electronic form  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for our purposes. That would count as a paper petition and would be considered in the same way, because it would not have gone through the other formulation.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000015"></a>I can see that, on the face of it, removing the requirement that, to be valid, petitions in electronic form can be made only through the authority&#146;s e-petition facility would have some merit. The noble Lord spoke powerfully about that. It would require a response to electronic petitions created on sites such as Facebook and the WI, but there are some serious practical problems here. It would be quite difficult to work out whether a petition was validly signed. For the e-petition facility, the authority can establish what counts as a signature. Clause 12(4) provides for that, and I said the other day that there is a requirement for the e-petition scheme to include a UK postcode. With e-petitions outside a local authority&#146;s control, there would be no way to know what conditions applied. Also, it would undermine part of what we are trying to do, which is to bring everything together in one place. It also renders prompt feedback difficult.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000016"></a>The amendment would also make it much more difficult to integrate petitions into other parts of the local authority&#146;s website and its decision-making procedures. Lambeth recently announced an e-petition facility which allows a petition organiser to link a petition with an up-coming council, forging effective links between decisions and petitions in their areas. Integration is possible only when an e-petition facility is provided by the principal local authority and the petition is made through that facility. In any case, in response to questions raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Greaves, local authorities do not have to reject these petitions; they can answer them as they choose to, as they do now. They have the discretion to accept them and respond to them. They will not be legally required to do so, but they will be able to respond to them as they wish.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000017"></a>In the spirit of the debate, we seek to encourage people to take advantage of new technologies if they have local concerns. I shall consider further whether current drafting would mean that petitions were rejected on technical grounds. I shall go on thinking about that.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000018"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012887000097"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I thought that I was going to seriously fall out with the Minister just then, but her last sentence was fairly emollient. So long as she continues to think&#151;because she is a sensible, thinking Minister&#151;we will consider that there is a possibility of light at the end of the tunnel and we will go on discussing the matter with her.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000019"></a>Everything that the Minister said in answer to these amendments was based on the notion that there will be a two-tier petition system in local authorities after this legislation is brought in. There will be valid petitions, some of which will become active petitions, and then there will be the rest, and inevitably that will cause problems. We discussed this briefly on Monday. It will result in a two-tier system and huge confusion. People will go around saying, &#147;That&#146;s a valid petition&#148;, and inevitably people will then think that the others are not valid. We must put in place a system whereby each local authority can cope with petitions in a sensible, locally based and flexible way.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000020"></a>I think that I accept the Minister&#146;s assurances on Amendment 103, which concerns extra information on the form. It was tabled for probing purposes to get those assurances, and I shall read what the Minister said in <I>Hansard</I>. That seems to be a fairly sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000021"></a>The only argument that the Minister seemed to come up with in favour of including a date was that it would help local authorities to know how quickly the petition had been collected. I do not know of a single petition that has ever come to an authority of which I have been a member where that information has been in doubt. There is an assumption that the people, particularly councillors, who deal with these matters have no idea what is going on in their area, and that when they get a petition from someone, they have no idea who the person is, where they are from, what their background is, what their agenda is or what activity has produced it&#151;whether it is a group of local residents, an organised pressure group in the area or a political party. We know all these things. We do not need dates to know whether a petition has been signed during the past fortnight or whether it has taken six months. We know what is on local websites and in the local press stories covering these issues. We know that if a petition is in response to an event that occurred a week ago, it has been signed in the past week. When I say &#147;we&#148; in this context, I believe, and hope, that I am referring to local councillors throughout the land. They are not stupid, although the Government think that they are. The Minister indicates that she does not think that they are stupid but, in that case, why does she insist on treating them as though they were? This two-tier system is to be found throughout this issue, and that is what we are trying to get away from.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000022"></a>The Minister reprimanded me for being rude about the Bill and about civil servants. I accept the second reprimand but not the first. This part of the Bill is absolutely dreadful and I shall go on being as rude as I possibly can about it. I do so, as I think I said on Monday, partly because I want to rescue the Government from their own folly. When the Bill is enacted, they will be seen to be ridiculous, although the two Ministers here are certainly not ridiculous. I respect them both greatly and I do not want them to be seen as that, but the legislation that they are promoting is ridiculous.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000023"></a>I have a caveat relating to civil servants: I do not say that a huge amount of diligence has not gone into all this; in my view, there has been far too much. Those people could have been doing a useful job. However, this part of the legislation is clearly the result of a great deal of time and energy. I say that to local government officials all the time when they are doing the Government&#146;s bidding. Civil servants do not just have a responsibility to do Ministers&#146; bidding; they also have a responsibility to give Ministers sensible advice. If I criticise civil servants in respect of this, it is because they are not going back to Ministers and saying, &#147;What you&#146;re asking us to do is a load of balderdash&#148;, and I believe it is. I could say that it is baloney, but I had better not pursue that or I might get into trouble.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000024"></a>I accept that the Minister is responsible, which is why we are arguing with the Government. She said  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Government will not use the guidance to add further requirements. Speaking personally, I do not believe her&#151;guidance always provides additional requirements. If it does not, what is its purpose? She said that she did not want councillors to respond to so many petitions that it would be a huge burden with which they could not cope, and that it was not the aim to increase the number of petitions. I thought that that was the whole purpose of the clause; it is certainly what we would like. We would like to see much more activity and agitation, with people taking an interest in what is going on and submitting petitions, among lots of other things that they can do to take part in local democracy. So I am sure that the Minister did not really mean that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000025"></a>As for the numbers and thresholds, you can have big issues covering a whole area but with a small proportion of people on the petition, and then you have small local issues with only a few signing a petition but who make up a higher proportion of the people. How is the council going to set these thresholds? I accept that they will be set by local authorities, but just working out the thresholds and the regulations will be a burden on them.</p>

On the face of it, this seems reasonable enough and I am sure that the Minister will reassure the Committee that this provision is solely intended to make things as easy as possible and minimise paperwork or confusion, but I am afraid that we see flaws in this plan.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000029"></a>With regard to having a designated organiser in order for a petition to be valid, it seems odd, to begin with, that the Government, having gone to such great and detailed lengths to set out every stage of a petition&#146;s life and what the local authority must do at every stage, then effectively wash their hands of what happens to it. The local authority will dutifully go through all the steps required, then communicate back to the single petition organiser who might lose the letter, miss the phone call, delete the e-mail, mix up the

The local authority will have followed all the steps the Government have set out but through some failure or error on the part of the single petition organiser, no one else who signed the petition will be any the wiser.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000030"></a>The Minister said&#151;and I hope that I am summarising her comments correctly&#151;that the provisions on petitions are not here just for the sake of it but will improve the interaction between people and their local authority and get them to feel engaged and enfranchised. Yet I have suggested a scenario where the opposite could happen.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000031"></a>What I have suggested is a worst-case scenario. However, I have been trying to work out what benefits might accrue from the provision. I have reached the conclusion, I am afraid, that benefits will indeed accrue, but to the so-called &#147;petition organiser&#148; who all of a sudden now has an important role that is laid down in statute, no less. Someone more cynical might start to wonder if the kind of person who would dominate petitions&#151;an activist, one might call such a person&#151;might spy in this provision an opportunity to seek influence and power for himself or herself.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000032"></a>A &#147;petition organiser&#148; approved by statute would wield influence and sway over other signatories. Indeed, a very cynical person might suggest that the sort of activist who would most appreciate the creation of the role of petition organiser would be one who has failed to get elected, or who has failed to get re-elected in the past few local council elections.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000033"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree with me that petitions should be about helping to solve genuine grievances. We drafted Amendment 107 in that spirit. It would allow local authorities to respond to all the petitioners in the best way they see fit, be it by notice in the local paper, a library window, a group e-mail, or whatever. The important thing is that people who sign a petition may be sure that they are being taken seriously, and not manipulated in some way. We have included &#147;valid signatories&#148; in the amendment. That does not negate any criticisms we have made of the Government&#146;s plans to distinguish valid petitions from non-valid ones. We are simply trying to show accommodation so that we can achieve a better piece of legislation. I hope that the Minister will take these provisions away and consider them carefully. I beg to move.</p>

I should like to speak to Amendments 95, 102, 108, 115 and 136. With one exception, they are about petition organisers. Once again, the Government are saying that unless there is a clearly defined petition organiser on the petition, it is not valid. This again is an undue restriction to put on primary legislation or, indeed in guidance. It can be left to councils&#146; common sense and ways of working. Some councils will want to codify that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000036"></a>I referred on Monday to councils that had provided me with advice on what they do. City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council has a sensible two-page protocol for petitions handed in at the council office. It states quite clearly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012887000085"></a>&#147;When a member of the public hands in a petition at any Council office, the Receiving Department will issue an initial written receipt&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000080"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul><a name="09012887000088"></a>&#147;The contact details of the lead petitioner must be obtained at this stage&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012887000081"></a>That is an entirely sensible thing for the council to make a rule about because the name and address of the petition organiser can be obtained when somebody is handing it in at a council office. That may not always be the case. For example, the East Sussex council constitution states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012887000086"></a>&#147;Where appropriate, the Chairman shall refer the petition to the Cabinet or relevant Cabinet member or, if appropriate, the relevant Scrutiny Committee, and, where he or she does this, the person signing the covering letter accompanying the petition or, if there is no such letter, the first signatory or another person nominated by them, shall be invited to address the Cabinet, the relevant Cabinet member&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09012887000082"></a>and so on. Then it will go on to the person whom the council tells what it is doing about it. That is sensible practice. It means that petitions are dealt with sensibly and a common-sense decision is made about whom to communicate with. The Government say that the petition organiser has to be named, which is too prescriptive. It should be left to councils and they will be all right.</p>
<h5><a name="09012887000092"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000037"></a>Amendment 115 is rather different, proposing that the details of a particular petition should be placed on a council website. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012887000087"></a>&#147;When an authority has accepted a petition as being valid, it shall publish on its website the text of the petition, the name of the petition organiser, the number of valid signatures, and information about the way that the petition will be considered by the authority and, where appropriate, the democratic arrangements that will apply in its consideration&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000083"></a>The clear implication is that the decisions will then be put there as well.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000038"></a>That is an extremely sensible use of a website. Whether it should be set out in that detail in national legislation is a question on which the Minister might chide me, but it is a sensible thing for councils to do. As with the previous matters relating to websites that we have discussed, councils need jollying along to make much better use of their websites for public involvement and participation in their decision-making side.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000039"></a>The Minister chided me on Monday by saying that her officials had spent some time visiting Pendle council&#146;s website to try to find out what it said about petitions and could not find anything. I have been a little more successful and have found what it says. It does not set down a general scheme, but the agendas of each meeting and the reports that go to them are put on it. The front page of the calling notice of the meeting states clearly that members of the public can turn up, speak to the committee and, if they wish, present petitions. The information is there, but, as I have said,   


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Pendle, along with many other authorities, is not up to speed with the use of its website in these matters, and the Government should encourage them to be more so. However, they should not produce lots of detail on how to do it in national legislation.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000040"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012887000102"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, who is standing in for her two noble friends. The amendments address principally the issue of the petition organiser. Amendment 115 looks at publishing information on a website.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000041"></a>Clause 12 requires one of the valid signatories to a petition to be designated the &#147;petition organiser&#148; in order for a petition to be valid. As noble Lords have said, Amendment 95 would remove the requirement for someone to declare themselves the petition organiser for the petition to be valid. Amendment 102 is consequential, removing the definition of &#147;petition organiser&#148; from the clause.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000042"></a>Amendment 108 seeks to take a pragmatic approach to situations where a petition organiser has not been identified. It requires that, where no petition organiser has been identified on the petition, or made themselves known to the local authority, the authority consider the first valid name on the list to be the petition organiser. I accept that this is a clear and simple approach and would solve the problem of the local authority having a point of contact. I fear, however, that it could be considerably less attractive to someone who had been deemed petition organiser rather than having volunteered for the job. It could come as quite a shock to someone to discover that, having put their name to a petition, they had been thrust into the position of primary contact with the authority, with their name having been published on its website and having to take decisions on whether to request a review of its response. It might put someone off signing a petition in the future. That is not to say, of course, that petitions should be dismissed out of hand because a petition organiser has not been identified&#151;I need to make that really clear. We would expect an authority presented with something that is manifestly a petition but which fails to identify an organiser to do the sensible thing and contact one of the signatories. In the two examples that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, gave, we would expect Bradford and Sutton would do the sensible thing and pick up the phone and say, &#147;We could do with an organiser on this one&#148;, and seek one out. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will not press Amendment 108.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000043"></a>Amendments 107 and 125 take a different approach to communication in situations where a petition organiser has not been identified. Amendment 107 would require the local authority to send written acknowledgements to every valid signatory of the petition. Amendment 125 would require the same approach in relation to notification and the reasoning behind the authority&#146;s response to the petition. Both amendments would allow the authority to take these steps in whatever way it considered appropriate. Nevertheless, a requirement to contact every valid signatory to a petition inevitably conflicts with the principle that we make this as easy as possible for local authorities. There would be nothing, of course, to prevent an authority deciding to communicate directly with every signatory of a petition if it considered that  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC103"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that was appropriate in the circumstances. However, it should not be required absolutely of them in every case.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000044"></a>I also make it absolutely clear that the Government&#146;s intention is that &#147;written acknowledgement&#148; should include electronic communication whenever that is appropriate. For example, if there is an e-mail address, that is easily done; correspondence could be sent in that form. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords, and that they will agree not to press the amendments.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000045"></a>A petition is inherently about the power of individuals&#151;I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, made that point. It is about organising as a group to call for action. Putting in place measures to ensure that they are taken seriously means that the role of a petition organiser is an important one. It is not unreasonable to ask that people consider this as part of the way they organise themselves in submitting a petition, and identify someone to take on that role. We hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said about people abusing that situation; that is something for us to think about. However, as with the clause promoting democracy, it is the council&#146;s responsibility to talk to people about their responsibilities as well and say how they can organise petitions properly and capacity-build people who might be anxious about that situation.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000046"></a>There is one further amendment that touches on the issue of petition organisers. Amendment 115 would place a new requirement on local authorities to publish on their website details of valid petitions, including the name of the organiser and the way in which they will consider them. Clause 14 already requires that local authorities must notify petition organisers of their response to petitions, and that they must publish this notification on their website. The amendment would require local authorities to publish details of petitions at an earlier stage, and to do so for all valid petitions received, whether or not they related to matters about which the authority had any control, were vexatious or abusive, or were the same as other petitions received in the previous six months.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000047"></a>I see merit in the noble Lord&#146;s suggestions, but I wonder whether this is an issue, as he also suggested, that might be best addressed in guidance rather than in the Bill. It is right that we leave that discretion to authorities. One can imagine circumstances, for example, in which publishing details of abusive petitions, including the name of the organiser, could inflame community tensions, especially at a local level. However, the noble Lord makes a very important point. I welcome his views and would be happy to discuss this with him further before Report. In the mean time, I ask him not to press his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000048"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012887000103"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I wonder whether I could pick up on phrase that the noble Lord has just used and suggest that the Government might try to find a way not to use it. I refer to &#147;organising a petition properly&#148;. If the Government want people to be involved in what their local authorities are doing or not doing, which is what we all want, is not the best way to leave it to local authorities to treat what comes to them in a normal, human, straightforward, practical fashion? If I were to go to a local authority with a petition and be told that it was not organised properly, my faith in the local authority would be reduced, not increased.</p>

We have been saying, &#147;This is how it works in the real world. This is what happens. Don&#146;t do things that upset it&#148;. In response to amendments tabled with this intention, we get the response that the Government do not agree for this or that technical reason. The only silver lining to the cloud is that we are promised lots of discussions, so we will have those discussions.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000051"></a>I am perfectly capable of being politically awkward to this Government or anyone else, as noble Lords know, and I shall be politically awkward about this petition scheme if my worst fears come about at the end of it because it is complete nonsense and will be a good thing to bash the Government with. However, that is not what we, across the parties, are trying to do now. We are trying to get the Government to do sensible things about it. We all believe passionately in grassroots involvement and grassroots democracy, whether it is comfortable for us or not. I hope the Government accept that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000052"></a>I have one or two specific points. The Minister said that people will be in dreadful shock if they are singled out because they are the first name on the petition. The first name on the petition is usually the person who has collected the names. In Newcastle, it is in the council&#146;s constitution that that person is regarded as the organiser. I do not know how many petitions a year Newcastle City Council gets, but it must be well into three figures, and I am not aware that there are lots of people in Newcastle hospitals suffering from dreadful shock because the council has arbitrarily appointed them as the organiser of a petition. Let us have sensible arguments but not people thinking up arguments just to defend the original wording. A lot of councils, if they do not know who the organiser is, already contact, and deal with, the first person on the petition. That is what my council and lots of councils do; it is common sense.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000053"></a>It should not be put in the legislation that such a petition is not valid. I accept that it might not be dismissed out of hand, but we are back to validity again. It is a question of stopping petitions being valid. Either &#147;valid petitions&#148; means something and creates an important distinction in the Bill&#151;and it must, because there are lots of barriers a petition must go through to become valid&#151;or it does not. If it does not, do away with it, but if it is important to the Government, do not put up artificial barriers.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000054"></a>We would rather have no guidance. We like minimal legislation without guidance and prefer to rely on the local government community to spread best practice. That is our bottom line.</p>

A council has to deal with that sensitively. However, the idea that, in general, the name of a petition organiser can inflame community tensions&#151;presumably because their name has connotations for a particular community; for example, the Muslim community&#151;is complete nonsense. I do not accept that argument one little bit.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000061"></a>I would like a couple of things to be put on the record. The Minister mentioned last week the ability of young people to sign petitions. She said in passing that young people could do it, but it would be nice to have it on the record, because I have been approached by the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance about it. Will the Minister assure us that the regulations allow young people to organise and sign petitions, and that, if it must be done in the prescriptive way set out in the Bill, they, too, will be dealt with properly?</p>

<p><a name="09012887000062"></a>The other issue raised by the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance has been touched on in our discussion; that is, what happens if, for example, social services decide to take away your child, and you do not like it and raise a petition about it. Such issues would bring information about children into the public domain, so I trust that it would not be a valid petition in the normal sense. Will that be written down? It may be in

The Government need to think about it if they have not already done so, because people are concerned. I am sure that the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance has written to the Government on this issue as much as it has to us.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000063"></a>The third thing I wish to mention&#151;and I was not quite sure where to bring it up in this whole issue of petitions&#151;was the situation that we have in Northumberland. We have no district councils any more. Berwick-upon-Tweed&#146;s district council has another two months to go; that means that if someone wants to take a petition physically to the full council, they have to go 50 miles. Of course, we will have area committees; we have had them for years. I just hope that nothing prescribed in the Bill will prevent local people presenting their petitions to any devolved committees that the council may have. I am not very clever at legal things, and I have not been able to discover whether provisions in the Bill might rule things out. Will the Government reassure me that, if local people have a petition and go to their local area committee, that is quite acceptable? Common sense tells me that it is but, because the Bill is so prescriptive, I should like to make sure that a problem with that has not somehow crept in. Not that my friends on Northumberland council, as it is at the moment, would dare to refuse a petition.</p>

<p><a name="09012887000066"></a>The debate that we have had on the many amendments has made it crystal clear why both at Second Reading and at the start of the debate on this chapter, people with experience of petitions in local government from all three parties, joined by the Local Government Association, urged the Government as strongly as we could not to go down this path. If they must make it a duty, that is fine, but they should not try to be prescriptive. I have been wondering why the Government want to go down this path, since, once you start down it, it becomes a bit like that snowball going down the hill&#151;you have to add more and more to it. Many of our amendments have done just that to illustrate the point.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000067"></a>A lot of what was thought about in drafting this Bill has, inevitably, been based on national rather than local experience, for understandable reasons. It tends to be the case that what I will call national petitions are to some extent organised, usually by some body with experience&#151;often an organisation but it may be an individual. They are a lot more structured. Petitions at local level, however, are exactly the opposite; most of them are spontaneous; they are created by a resident feeling concern about a relatively small issue, who wants to go out and do something about it. That is exactly what all of us here, the Government included, want to encourage. The more we try to be prescriptive about it, the more we try to explain that even if it is not valid it is not actually invalid and we can do what we want with it, the more complex it becomes, the more of a barrier we create and the more uncertain petitioners become in dealing with it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000068"></a>I think that all local authorities, or certainly the vast majority, are very experienced in dealing with petitions. We have been debating who is the petition organiser. Many of these spontaneous petitions do not come with someone designated as petition organiser. If it is not clear who the petition is from or who the organiser is, it is normal practice to write to the first signatory of the petition. What else can you do, if you do not know to whom else to apply? Those people do not automatically feel thrust into the limelight, in the Minister&#146;s words; if they do not want to be thought of as the organiser, believe me they say so very quickly&#151;and they may well point you to the person who is actually initiating the collection of signatures. Many local authorities&#151;I should like to think, most&#151;give petitioners the right to address the committee or full council when considering the petition. I would hope that all authorities that do that, such as my own, leave it to the petitioners to decide for themselves who is going to address the committee or council. The person who goes from door to door collecting the signatures may well not feel articulate or confident enough to speak to a committee in public, which can be quite intimidating, and would prefer to have one of the other signatories do it on their behalf. That is perfectly normal, and indeed usual, practice. Ninety-nine times out of 100, this all works very well. The more we try to prescribe it, whether in legislation or even in guidance, the more difficult it becomes and the more barriers are put in the way of those who, probably for the first time and possibly for the last time in their lives, are getting together a small local petition about a local matter on which they have some concern. Therefore, we will continue to pursue this issue.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000069"></a>Like my colleagues, I look forward to discussing with the Minister how we go forward, but I do not think that we will move from our position that by far the best way is to accept that the Government wish to make it a duty but we should leave it to the local authorities to do it in the best way that they can. Most of them will have provision for doing just that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000072"></a>I have thought, and will continue to think, about our debate on Clause 12. I think that we all want the same things. We all want to ensure that it is not simply the usual suspects and the usual activists who harass or challenge the local authority, chase after things that should happen when they do not, or put forward good ideas. We want this to be something that the community as a whole, in much greater numbers and with greater diversity, feels that it can and should do. Therefore, we

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000073"></a>Because some areas are much better at dealing with this issue than others and because we want to ensure that there is no local disadvantage, we believe that the matter is serious enough to invite a duty. We have followed the logic of that by creating in the Bill what I genuinely believe to be reasonable and minimal requirements. If there is a duty, how does it work; that is, who organises it, how do the local authorities respond and so on? The logic of the clauses follows from that.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000074"></a>We are genuinely trying to achieve a balance between a framework which is enabling and one which denies the possibility of local authorities either maintaining excellent practice or taking on undue burdens&#151;impossible and unreasonable burdens. We have tried very hard to do that. I have said that we will look at the definitions. We will look at the things that we are requiring of people and we will do that in conjunction with the other parties as far as is appropriate before Report. I have not made any promises, because we think that we have tried hard and that we have the balance right. However, we are certainly in the business of listening and talking, and I want that to be done in as frank and reasonable a manner as possible, as is always the case.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012887000075"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, raised three questions. She asked whether young people can sign petitions. The answer is yes: the more the merrier. We want young people to be fully involved in the life of the community and to have as much influence as possible in shaping the places where they live. She asked whether petitions would involve, say, children in care or children who are, in any sense, under the supervision of the children&#146;s services. I think it is up to the local authority to decide what is appropriate, and certainly what is appropriate will be governed by confidentiality on a whole range of issues. So, yes, we would leave local authorities to decide, under Clause 14(1)(b), whether a petition is inappropriate to be dealt with. It is entirely for the petition scheme and those who frame the petition to decide whether people can go to their area committee to present it. We would certainly not make any prescription about that. We just want the process to be as simple and as accessible as possible.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000002"></a>This is an important group of amendments because it seeks to do what I am not sure I should do, and that is to put into the Bill what the Government want in it but in a more sensible way than they have set out here. I have described it as the &#147;more sensible scheme part 1&#148;. I might have described it as the &#147;less silly scheme&#148; as, ideally, we do not want any of this in the Bill. However, if the Government are adamant that they want a great deal of prescription and many of these detailed rules for local authorities in the Bill, then more sensible provisions should be set out in a way which is easier for people to understand and carry out.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000003"></a>Clauses 13 and 14 are in a dreadful muddle and this group of amendments seeks to sort it out, together with Amendment 123, which is the second part of sorting out this part of the Bill. I had it in mind to put Amendment 123 into this group but I forgot. However, it is important that the provisions in the eight amendments to which I am speaking are taken together. Individually, some of them would not make sense but taken together they seek to substantially rewrite this part of the Bill. It is important that they are understood with Amendment 123, which we will discuss in a later group, as being the second part of what I consider to be a more sensible scheme.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000004"></a>If I understand it correctly, the Bill sets out a four-stage process for dealing with a petition. First, once the petition is presented or sent in, the authority has to decide whether it is valid. If it is valid, it goes into the scheme; if it is not valid the authority does something else with it, whatever that may be; it may ignore it or deal with it in some other way. Secondly, there is a requirement to acknowledge a valid petition. The heading to Clause 13 is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012891000078"></a>&#147;Requirement to acknowledge valid petitions&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09012891000067"></a>although the clause is about more than simple acknowledgement.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000005"></a>Thirdly, once a petition is acknowledged as valid, the authority has to decide whether it should become an active petition, and there are further tests to apply to it. They are set out in the first part of Clause 14, which is entitled &#147;Requirement to take steps&#148;, which is, again, not a terribly useful clause heading. I tried to amend these clause headings, but I discovered from the Public Bill Office that that is not allowed. For reasons I do not understand, it is not possible to amend clause headings. What you do if you substantially amend the clauses so that the headings are meaningless, I do not know. I suppose there is a sensible way of dealing with that. However, we are dealing with the clause as it is. Fourthly, the authority has to decide what action to take on the petition.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000006"></a>Clause 14 is a muddle because it includes two things. It mixes the procedure within the authority that a petition has to go through and the decision on what to do with that petition. Clause 13(1)(b) is the beginning of the muddle. It reads,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000084"></a>&#147;the acknowledgement must give such information about what the authority has done or proposes to do in response to the petition as the authority considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000068"></a>That is all-encompassing. What the authority proposes to do about the petition may mean which committee it will go to to be discussed, by what other means it will be decided within the authority or what action the authority is going to take on it. If there is a petition to complain that all the gritting bins were not filled up during the recent bad weather, the authority can sort that out by filling them up, making sure that they are on the schedule for filling up in future and writing back to say that it has done it. There are two different things here that are mixed up and ought to be separate.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000007"></a>My amendments set out a procedure that divides up the sensible ways in which the petition will be dealt with. Amendment 104 and subsequent amendments are the first part of trying to sort this out. They deal with stage one and what to do when you get a petition, how to acknowledge it and how to deal with it. They do not deal with the decision made about it, unless there is an instant decision. I have tabled eight amendments that take this part of the Bill apart in detail and put it back together again, which is probably not the most understandable way to deal with this. I have come to the view that I would have done far better to have deleted it all and written down exactly what I want. However, I believe that what I am putting forward is more sensible and logical than what is provided in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000008"></a>Amendment 104 removes &#147;secure the following results&#148; in Clause 13 and replaces it with &#147;include the following provisions&#148; because Clause 13 does not deal with the results of the petition, but with the procedure for dealing with it. Amendment 109 is about the first stage response to the petition as it is set out in Clause 13(1). It includes the possibility that action can be taken immediately to deal with what the petition is asking for. If the petition asks for a simple thing where the council is not doing what it should be doing and what its council policy says it does do, the petition can be dealt with there and then, and it does not have to proceed any further to become an active petition. Amendment 109 states that action can be taken and that is enough to end the process.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000009"></a>Amendment 110 deals with what happens if action is not taken. It suggests that the acknowledgement should provide that information and must give information about the way that the petition will be considered by the authority and, where appropriate, the democratic arrangements in which the petitioners may participate. That is not terribly different from what the Government are setting out in the Bill, but, in my view, it is a much simpler and more straightforward way of doing so.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000010"></a>Amendment 112 is consequential. Amendment 113 concerns whether an e-petition should be acknowledged, which is a separate issue. It is a probing amendment to ask the Government why an e-petition should not be acknowledged. Amendment 114 seeks to establish that acknowledgements may be made by electronic means.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000011"></a>Amendment 118 seeks to add a new paragraph to Clause 14(1) if action has not already been taken under Clause 13(1)(b). It simply says that the transition from a valid petition to an active petition&#151;a slightly extraordinary and bureaucratic concept&#151;does not have to take place if action has already been taken at the first stage. If it has, you have to move on.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000012"></a>Amendment 124 would leave out paragraph (a) of Clause 14(6) as a consequence of Amendment 109. Stage 2 of what happens with a petition is set out in Amendment 123, which we shall deal with later.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000013"></a>I hope that I have managed to explain what I am trying to do, as it is quite complicated. Clauses 13 and 14, to as far as about the top of page 9 of the Bill, set out what happens when a petition is sent in, how it will be dealt with by the authority and what the authority will do prior to deciding what to do about the petition. It is extremely complex and muddled. In these amendments, I have tried to set out a simpler, clearer scheme which would remove some of the muddle and allow the action on a petition to stop if the requirements of the petition could be satisfied straight away. If not, it would provide a means by which the petition could be passed to the authority in a sensible way. The scheme that I am proposing is considerably shorter than the one that the Government have put forward in the legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000014"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09012891000097"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> We have one amendment in this group&#151;Amendment 106&#151;and it is very simple. I think that we have already raised the issue of a petition organiser monopolising a petition. Rather than revolving around one person, a petition should involve a group of people who want a grievance or problem to be resolved. Rather than a letter of acknowledgement, we would prefer to see a simpler form of communication acknowledging the petition. Therefore, we are opposed to the possibility of one person promoting something rather than it being a genuine petition.</p>

I am afraid that he will get a disappointing reply but I shall explain as briefly as I can why the language of the clause is as it is.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000016"></a>Amendments 113, 114 and 106 address the issue of sending an electronic acknowledgement to both paper and electronic petitions. I want to be absolutely clear that the Government&#146;s intention is that written acknowledgement under Clause 13(1)(a) should include electronic communication wherever that is appropriate&#151;for example, when there is an e-mail. I take the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on the amendment but I do not have an immediate answer. I shall read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow in the context of what he said in the previous debate.</p>
<h5><a name="09012891000017"></a><I>6.30 pm</I></h5>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000018"></a>Amendment 113 seeks to remove the provision that electronic petitions do not need to be acknowledged. This means that they would have to be acknowledged and that, of course, would be an extra and unnecessary requirement. Petitioners will know whether their petition has been received because it will either be rejected or  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placed on the facility. That is why we do not include a requirement to acknowledge an e-petition. A further problem is that at the point it is placed on the facility, the local authority will not know how many signatures it will attract and how strongly the community feels about the issue, and, therefore, it will be unable to say what it proposes to do.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000019"></a>On Amendments 109 and 110, I understand the noble Lord&#146;s frustration with the legislation in front of him. We often face this problem when we are considering legislation. I have not served on a Bill where we have not had to wrestle with the internal logic of language, which is as it is because it has to convey precise legal meaning. That is the problem with parliamentary draftsmanship. In many respects, this Bill is clearly written, but sometimes one has to pin the corners down.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000020"></a>Amendments 109 and 110 together seek to replace the requirements to provide information which the authority considers relevant about how a petition will be treated with a more detailed description of what information must be given. Amendments 104, 112 and 124 are consequential. Many of the suggestions the noble Lord has put forward in regard to the kind of information that he thinks the authorities should provide and the way that they should do so seem sensible. However, I would argue that Clause 14(9) is as it is for a reason. It already makes provision for the acknowledgement to include confirmation that the authority will give effect to the request in the petition. The language of the Bill is rightly somewhat more legalistic&#151;necessarily so&#151;but it leads to the same result. If the council decides that it is prepared to accede to the request contained in a petition, it can do just that and send a single letter confirming the fact.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000021"></a>The need for the language in the Bill, which may seem complicated, is that we have to cater for a situation where an authority does not immediately concede that what is called for in a petition should be granted; that may be done only after one or more other steps are taken. For example, more information may need to be collected or more views sought before the authority will agree to go along with the request. In that case, we have to cater for a two-stage process&#151;acknowledgement of the petition followed by giving effect. In such a case we need to cater for how the petition organiser should be notified of the outcome and how the outcome should be published. That is catered for in Clause 14(7).</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000022"></a>One further small difference between the provision in Clause 13(1)(a) and Amendment 109 relates to the requirement for an authority to specify in its scheme when a petitioner can expect to receive the acknowledgement. The amendment would remove that requirement. It is not a heavy burden for an authority to have to give some indication of when it will aim to let people know that it has received and is considering, or has decided to comply with, a request in a petition. It would be regrettable if that element were removed.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000023"></a>I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s hard work in trying to untangle what he sees as an over-complex, legalistic provision, but it is like that because it is legally necessary to be like that in order to do what we want it to do.</p>

I showed all this lot to two local government officers, one a lawyer and one a person who deals with petition schemes, but their replies were not parliamentary so I cannot repeat exactly what they said. The lawyer, in particular, said that it was some of the worst drafting he has ever seen. I pass that on. Certainly, when reading it, it took me a very long time to understand exactly how it would work. I say again, I do not expect to agree with everything the Government do, but I do expect this Chamber to attempt to ensure that legislation is clear and understandable, even if we do not agree with it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000025"></a>I do not think that this legislation is either understandable or clear. In particular, I do not think that Clause 13(1)(b) states what the Government intend it to&#151;if I understand their scheme correctly. The noble Baroness has not at any stage explained why there is this process, distinction and classification whereby a petition becomes valid after it has passed certain hurdles and then becomes an active petition after it has passed further hurdles. This is a recipe to put burdens on local authorities in dealing with the scheme locally, if they want to deal with it in that way. I should be happy to see the words &#147;valid&#148; and &#147;active&#148; disappear and for the legislation simply to say what happens to petitions at various stages along the process.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000026"></a>I do not think that I am putting more detail and more prescription in the Bill; I am taking some out. I am really keeping the same amount that the Government want to see, but putting it in a more understandable and a clearer form. It might become clear if I do what I should have done originally and put all my proposals together as one and show how my version of the legislation would sit as a whole rather than as individual amendments. I understand the need for legalistic language and for legally tight language, which is why we were arguing previously that stuff in the Bill should not be ambiguous. I do not accept the need for incomprehensible language. There is a difference.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000027"></a>The problem of excluding petitions from this provision, unless I have missed something, is that the acknowledgement is not simply to say, &#147;Yes, we have got it, thanks&#148;, but to tell people how it is going to be dealt with. Clearly, if an e-petition is accepted on the council&#146;s e-petition facility, the petition exists. At some stage, it will close and be dealt with. Therefore, it does not need an acknowledgement to say, &#147;Yes, we have got it&#148; because it has been there for some time. The question is at what stage the council decides to do something about it&#151;put it through the processes and the system&#151;and at what stage it tells the petition&#146;s organiser or signatories what it is doing. That is the question and the purpose of tabling the amendment. Perhaps the noble Baroness would think further about that matter.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000028"></a>Moreover, who decides when an e-petition closes? Presumably it is the petitioners who say, for example, &#147;Right, we have 200 signatures, and we now want the council to deal with this&#148;. Presumably, that process takes place once the petition stops being an active e-petition on the council&#146;s e-petition facility. I am not sure how that works on the Downing Street website, but for a council there needs to be a clear decision at

This group that refers to relevant matters in relation to partner authorities that we began to half debate earlier. It is about the process that I mentioned in the last group by which a valid petition, which has been handed in, has gone through the hoops, been determined as valid and has been acknowledged, becomes an active petition. The definitions of a valid petition and an active petition can be found in Clause 22, but an active petition simply has the meaning given by Clause 14(1) and the valid petition has the meaning given by Clause 12(1), so those definitions do not take us much further. The petition has to go through a series of tests to establish that it is valid and another series to establish that it is active. So &#147;active&#148; simply means another layer of assessment and sifting, with more chances for a council to reject or restrict a petition.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000032"></a>It is not at all clear to me why there is a two-stage process between deciding that a petition is valid and deciding that it is active. To make it simple for councils to undertake this and, more importantly, to make it simpler for petitioners to understand the process, surely it should be a one-stage process. Surely, all the reasons why petitions might be rejected as invalid and all the things you have to do to ensure that a petition is valid should be set out in the same section and in the same rules locally.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000033"></a>To determine whether the petition is active, you have to refer to Clause 14(1)(a), which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012891000080"></a>&#147;For the purposes of this Chapter, an &#147;active petition&#148;, in relation to a principal local authority, is a valid petition made to the authority where ... the petition relates to a relevant matter&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000069"></a>That will have them dancing in the streets. Amendment 117 deletes that paragraph. Meanwhile, Amendment 122 deletes subsections (2) to (4) of Clause 14, which determine what is a relevant matter. Those three subsections do nothing but restrict and confuse the issue of what a petition should deal with, or not.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000034"></a>What is relevant? The first test is,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000085"></a>&#147;a matter which relates to a function of the authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000070"></a>I have no problem with that; if a petition is something to do with what the council does, presumably the council deals with it. But the second qualification for what is relevant is more difficult. Clause 14(2)(b) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000086"></a>&#147;a matter which ... does not relate to a function of the authority, but ... relates to an improvement in the economic, social or environmental well-being of the authority&#146;s area to which any of its partner authorities could contribute.&#148;</ul><h5><a name="09012891000093"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000035"></a>When an authority assesses whether a petition is active and should continue to be dealt with under the petition scheme, it has to think about whether it relates to an improvement. It might relate not to an improvement but to opposition to things that people think make matters worse. It may relate to something that some people think is an improvement, such as a new road, and others think is a disaster and want to oppose in a petition. The question of what is an improvement will be wide open to argument.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000036"></a>The requirement to take steps will be in relation to petitions which relate to the functions of partner or connected authorities. It is in relation also to the,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000087"></a>&#147;economic, social or environmental well-being of the authority&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000071"></a>We can argue for hours about what is economic, social and environmental well-being. Why does the Bill have to include these words? Why does it not just say, &#147;anything that the other authorities are responsible for&#148;?</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000037"></a>If a petition relates, for example, to a primary care trust, why do you have to start working out whether it relates to an improvement in the economic, social or environmental well-being of an authority&#146;s area? It may be that the local hospital trust has just closed an accident and emergency facility and there is a substantial reduction in the economic and social well-being of people in the area as a result&#151;or there is thought to be. When the authority closed the A&amp;E at Burnley, it argued that the facilities at Blackburn were better and that it would therefore be better for everybody to go 10 or 15 miles to Blackburn, forgetting that they might find an hour-long ambulance queue at Blackburn because the local hospital was not coping. These are arguable matters. Putting in the Bill that the relevant matter has to relate to an improvement to which any of an authority&#146;s partner authorities could contribute is gibberish. If the Bill wants to refer to the functions of partner authorities, it should simply state that the relevant matter is not a function of the principal local authority but relates to a function of a partner authority. It should be absolutely neutral.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000038"></a>The wording is not clear. The Bill, so far as I can understand it, appears to try to tie it in with the local area agreement, because it relates to the things that the  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local area agreement is about. However, trying to tie in the wording in this way is restrictive, confusing and will lead to a huge muddle, because some councils with very legalistic staff will have a monitoring officer who rules that it does not apply, and there will be a big row about it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000039"></a>The final insult is that the provision does not refer at all to petitions to district councils. It is clear that, as the local area agreement is put together by the county council in a two-tier area&#151;we argued about this at great length during the passage of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act&#151;the provision applies in this way. If the county council receives a petition about a district council function relating to the economic, social or environmental well-being of the authority&#146;s area, it can refer it to the district council, but if it goes to the district council and refers to a county council function, the county council cannot do anything about it under the Bill because it is not a &#147;valid&#148;, &#147;active&#148; petition. If it goes to the district council and refers to the PCT or any other partner authority as defined, the district council would not be able to do anything about it under the legislation. The Government might say, &#147;Well, they&#146;ll send it anyway&#148;, but that is not the point. The point is that the Bill defines &#147;valid&#148; and &#147;active&#148; petitions in great detail, giving them a very special status, but then states, &#147;Well, if petitions go to a county council, it can refer them to partners; if they go to a district council, it cannot&#148;. That surely is wrong. I know that I am a bit sensitive about district councils and the respect and authority given to them in legislation, but this provision is wrong and has to be changed. I beg to move.</p>

Clause 14(1) provides that authorities must take steps in relation to petitions on relevant matters. These are matters that relate to the authority&#146;s functions. I see that the noble Lord has no problem with that aspect of the clause. In England, for unitary and top-tier principal authorities, relevant matters also relate to any of the range of issues set out in local area agreements. The wording relating to environmental and social well-being is taken directly from Section 105 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act with respect to local area agreements. This could include issues as varied as smoking cessation, knife crime rates or the percentage of people on jobseeker&#146;s allowance. As mentioned in previous debates, district councils in two-tier areas and councils in Wales do not enter into local area agreements, and these provisions are therefore not relevant to them, as they have limited ability to influence wider issues.</p>

There are some arguments around the edges of what counts as relevant, but I should make it clear that people can petition on issues that are not relevant, and principal authorities can, of course, respond to those petitions if they wish&#151;we have said that many times&#151;but according to this chapter, they would not have a legal obligation to do so.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000045"></a>Amendment 117 deletes the requirement in Clause 14 that petitions to which principal local authorities must respond should be relevant matters. The definition of relevant matters is removed by Amendment 122. The experience of parish polls being held on the Lisbon treaty has shown that if legislation is not drafted carefully, there can be legal obligations on bodies to carry out engagement exercises about issues over which they have no influence. We certainly expect councils to treat misdirected but legitimate petitions sensibly, but we want to ensure that principal authorities can dispense with petitions on issues they cannot influence without any burden on the authority concerned. Does the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, wish to increase the burden on district councils? They can do what they want with petitions; the question is whether we should impose a duty to do so.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000046"></a>Principal authorities can influence their own functions. Upper-tier and unitary authorities in England are also in a position to influence improvements in local economic, social or environmental well-being to which their partners can contribute. The limitation on the types of petition that require a substantive response by principal authorities is hardly unreasonable. Nothing that relates to anything over which a principal authority has any influence is excluded. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000047"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012891000107"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> That was one of the weakest replies I have heard for a long time. I do not blame the Minister, for whom I have a great deal of respect, but I do not think he tackled the basic issue. The Government are setting out a formal scheme, the petition scheme, which each authority will have, based on this legislation, that will deal with petitions that will become valid petitions and then active petitions.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000048"></a>When they become active petitions, the authority will have to do something about them. However, as the Minister said, doing something about them might well be as little as taking a view on them and passing them on to the appropriate partner authority. That would be perfect reasonable. It might be that the authority would look at the petition and reject it. It would have to go to a committee, but that is fine.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000049"></a>I do not know whether Ministers and the people who write this legislation have spent much time investigating what district councils do. I speak from my experience in Lancashire and across Lancashire. District councils within Lancashire County Council spend a lot of time discussing things for which they are not primarily responsible and which are not their basic functions. However, they do it because they are the local councils. It is the council that covers the Rossendale Valley, the towns of Pendle, Burnley and its satellite towns, the great rural area of the Ribble Valley or Hyndburn. The same applies in west Lancashire.  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In trying to get things done, these people do not restrict themselves specifically to the things for which they have functions, although clearly those things have to take priority, because if a council does not carry out its functions properly, it is in trouble.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000050"></a>It is absolute nonsense to say that a town such as Burnley&#151;a town with a proud history that used to be a county borough and an area with strong districts&#151;does not interest itself in the environmental, economic or social improvement of the area. The noble Lord knows Burnley quite well from his contacts there, and he knows perfectly well that Burnley Borough Council gets involved in a number of projects&#151;some of which he is involved in&#151;over and beyond its direct legal responsibilities of providing services such as planning, refuse collection, environmental health and so on. Therefore, excluding district councils is not how things are done in the real world.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000051"></a>When the noble Lord says that districts cannot influence this kind of thing but that the county can, that is absolute nonsense. There are partnerships. What are partnerships about? What is the Lancashire partnership, which includes district representation, about? What are the local strategic partnerships about? There is one in Pendle, one in Burnley, one in Hyndburn and one in Rossendale. The people involved in them spend their entire time trying to improve the economic, social and environmental conditions. That is what they are set up for. The partnership includes the district, the county, the health service, the FE colleges, local businesses and all sorts of other people. Therefore, saying that districts cannot influence these matters shows a lack of understanding of the real world on the part of whoever has produced the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000052"></a>The Government keep saying that there is no problem relating to all the petitions that will be restricted and will not be allowed to be valid petitions&#151;and then restricted if they are valid and not allowed to be active petitions&#151;because the council will be able to deal with them anyway or refer them to the appropriate authority. I ask again: what is the purpose of setting up this highly structured, highly detailed system for valid petitions and active petitions if you can just deal with those that are excluded from it in the way that you would have done anyway? The whole thing seems absolutely crazy.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000053"></a>The scheme is restrictive because it forces the principal local authority to set up a petition scheme for dealing with valid petitions and active petitions. That is what this legislation does. This part of the Bill means that, if a petition that does not refer to the functions of the authority does not qualify as relating to an improvement in the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area and is not in a top-tier authority in a top-tier area&#151;in other words, if it is in a district&#151;it cannot go into the system. The legislation sets up this great scheme and then says that the petitions that do not qualify cannot go into the system. I think that this issue should be thought through again.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000054"></a>With regard to the idea that districts do not take part in local area agreements, I accept and understand that the county council is responsible for co-ordinating the LAA.

In places such as Lancashire which have strong districts, the LSPs that really matter are at local district level. Some of the other bodies that really matter&#151;the new multi-area agreement and the housing market renewal programme in east Lancashire, which is far and away the biggest bringer-in of funds in the housing area&#151;are at multi-district level. They are not even at a county council level. So this needs thinking about again.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000056"></a>As the clause stands, a petition can be rejected as active&#151;I am not sure why it happens at the active not the valid stage, but that is the argument that I was having 10 minutes ago&#151;if it is,</p>

<p><a name="09012891000057"></a>We had this debate on the e-petitions on Monday&#151;or a similar debate&#151;but there is a need for standard wording and understanding in the Bill over the reasons why petitions can be rejected.

Clause 14 requires principal local authorities to take one or more steps in response to valid petitions which meet the criteria set out in subsections (1) and (2) and are therefore active petitions. Subsection (1)(b) provides that there is no duty to take any substantive step in relation to petitions which are vexatious, abusive or otherwise inappropriate to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000059"></a>Amendment 120 removes the exclusion for petitions which are &#147;otherwise inappropriate&#148; and replaces it with an exclusion for petitions which call for an action which is unlawful. This would give principal authorities less discretion over which petitions they were entitled to refuse to respond to. It is possible to think of numerous situations where what a petition calls for is not unlawful, but is nevertheless damaging to community relations or inappropriate for other reasons. For instance,  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consider the example of a petition calling for the council to purchase all its stationery from a local company which was in financial difficulties, signed by all the employees of that company. This petition would not be requesting anything unlawful, but authorities should not be obliged to take active steps in response to such petitions, which aim to publicise an organisation and promote its commercial interests.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000060"></a>I genuinely do not think that local authorities will abuse this provision and decline on spurious grounds to respond to petitions which are really innocuous. I therefore believe that the drafting in Clause 14(1)(b) is preferable to that of Amendment 120, as it gives principal authorities an appropriate level of discretion over which petitions they respond to. On this basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000061"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09012891000111"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am not clear why the Government think that whether a petition is legal or calls for anything unlawful should not be covered. The Bill refers to petitions which are vexatious and abusive, which is less clear, and the Government should consider again the lawfulness issue.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000062"></a>I was interested in the noble Lord&#146;s example. If I understood him correctly, he said that if a local company that employed 100 people was in danger of closing down, the employees of that company might petition the local council to intervene and do something about it. I do not understand why such a petition should not be considered. It may be that the council would say, &#147;There is nothing much we can do&#148;, but my experience of both county councils and district councils is that if there is a local company in difficulty and there is anything the council can do short of intervening in a commercial way, it will do it. For example, if the problems are not necessarily financial directly but are to do with access to the company&#151;it cannot get pantechnicons in and is therefore having to relocate to some foreign place such as Preston or Birmingham&#151;the council might well step in and provide a grant or work out ways in which access to the company can be improved. So I am not sure that the noble Lord&#146;s example was a very good one. Again, it comes from a lack of knowledge and understanding of what local authorities do nowadays&#151;how they get involved in their local economy, how they talk to local companies and how, within reason, they try to assist those local companies to thrive and survive in their areas.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000063"></a>This is not a major point and we probably will not come back to it, but nevertheless it requires a little thought. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The amendment seeks to remove everything from subsection (5) to the end of the clause. One reason for removing the wording is that it is muddled&#151;it includes a number of aspects which ought not to be muddled in the way they are&#151;but the main reason for doing it is to introduce the second part of what I was trying to do in the group that started with Amendment 104, and that is to help the Government to put their petition scheme into a reasonable format which people can understand and which sets out clearly what should happen.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000065"></a>To put the contents of subsection (6) in primary legislation is quite extraordinary. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012891000083"></a>&#147;A principal local authority&#146;s petition scheme must secure that the steps which may be taken by the authority pursuant to subsection (5) include the following&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012891000073"></a>A few meetings ago we had a debate about the word &#147;include&#148; that the noble Lord, Borrie, did not like. The steps include,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000090"></a>&#147;giving effect to the request in the petition&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000074"></a>but if my proposals are accepted the matter would have been dealt with way before it got to the stage of an active petition. If you are going to do it, you just do it; you do not go through the bureaucratic process of making an active petition.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09012891000066"></a>However, steps such as,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000091"></a>&#147;considering the petition at a meeting of the authority ... in the case of a principal local authority operating executive arrangements, referring the petition to an overview and scrutiny committee of the authority&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000075"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="09012891000092"></a>&#147;in the case of a principal local authority not operating executive arrangements, referring the petition to a committee of the authority with power ... to review or scrutinise decisions made&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012891000076"></a>are procedural matters within the authority. That is all right but they do not include what most councils will  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>do, which is to refer it to a committee which has got the power to do something about it. Therefore, in a principal local authority&#151;for example, a district council&#151;that does not operate executive arrangements, a petition about housing will not go to a scrutiny committee, it will go straight to the housing committee. In a council operating area committee arrangements the petition will go to the area committee. If it is within the purview of the area committee to do something about it, it will. If the council has an executive, and the matter clearly needs an executive decision, it will go to the executive. That is the real world. That is how it works. That is the sensible thing to do; not to divert the petition via an overview and scrutiny committee, with all the time that will take to put the thing on agendas, hold meetings and then refer it probably back to the council. The council will then refer it to a body, a committee or the executive that can do something about it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000003"></a>The Government have not set out in Clause 14(6) the most obvious and usual way that a council will deal with a petition. I can only say that that is because they do not understand how councils deal with petitions. By and large, petitions go to committees, executives, other bodies of the council, executive members, cabinet members or whoever has the authority to do something about them.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000004"></a>Clause 14(6) says that the scheme must include certain things. Then it includes a number of things that will happen in some cases as a result of consideration of the petition by the appropriate committee of the council or public body, such as,</p>
<ul><a name="09012892000064"></a>&#147;holding an inquiry...holding a public meeting&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09012892000051"></a>there is a radical idea&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09012892000065"></a>&#147;commissioning research&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09012892000052"></a>or,</p>
<ul><a name="09012892000066"></a>&#147;giving a written response to the petition organiser&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012892000053"></a>These are consequences of the decision-making process. They are all mixed up and muddled together in a totally unsatisfactory way. Therefore, what I suggest in my Amendment 123 is a logical step-by-step process by which a petition is dealt with. Once it has been decided that a petition is active, under the Government&#146;s scheme, it goes to the appropriate body in the authority that makes a decision on what to do about it.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000005"></a>That decision might include commissioning research. To put commissioning research into a petition scheme is quite extraordinary. Why commissioning research? Is this another consultant&#146;s charter? There are far too many consultants in local government. Of course, if a major issue is raised and the council does not have information about it and nobody knows what is going on, you might commission research, but it is not something you put in a petition scheme. What you put into a petition scheme is which bodies on the council shall deal with the petition and who they then tell what they are doing about it, and particularly how they will involve the petitioners and other members of the public in that decision.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000006"></a>The scheme I have put forward is clear, sensible and in the real world. The Government&#146;s scheme is a muddle, some things in it are odd, and I am not sure it is entirely in the real world. Of course, overview and  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scrutiny committees can be involved if people think the process should happen that way. My amendment says if the petition organiser wishes the petition to go to the overview and scrutiny committee, then that is his right. I am not removing that provision; I am saying that it is not automatic.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000007"></a>It is a bizarre idea that petitions should automatically go to overview and scrutiny committees, rather than to committees, which can do something about the petition much more quickly. The idea that a petition organiser should be able to require an overview and scrutiny committee to deal with it is on a par with what the Government calls the Community Call for Action, which is coming into practice fairly soon, and allows members of the public and councillors automatically to refer something to scrutiny. It is on a par with that; it is the same sort of thing. That is okay. However, it really should be voluntary from the point of view of the people organising a petition. Otherwise, people would be putting forward good petitions that just get tied up in overview and scrutiny and never go anywhere else.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000008"></a>I ask the Government to look at this very seriously and not just to react against it because I put it forward and they did not. Clause 14 is a muddle. I am not suggesting that my drafting is perfect&#151;I am not a parliamentary draftsman&#151;but I am suggesting that a clearly set out and understandable scheme ought to be put in here, rather than the Government&#146;s current muddle.</p>

When I read the Bill, I thought that the Government were trying to kick these petitions into touch because overview and scrutiny committees do not take decisions. They scrutinise the executive and what is going on, and sometimes they can take six months to produce a report. They normally set up a working group and things such as that. The Government set up the legislation under which we operate. My authority, which is a large authority, has an executive that takes all the decisions. The council deals only with the budget, and perhaps the waste plan, and everything else is decided, by the Government&#146;s orders, by the executive. If decisions are to be taken about these petitions or about something to be done, as we heard earlier, the cabinet or the portfolio holder does it. That is the only way to get things done. Referral to the overview and scrutiny committee is a way of kicking most petitions into touch. If we wanted to get rid of one for a while, we would refer it to that committee. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is right on this. I do not understand why the Government put that in.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000010"></a>I have tabled many amendments to legislation in this House, and many times I have been told that detail is not put in legislation but in regulations or guidance issued later. The detail in the Bill about petitions is ridiculous and I ask the Government to think again. They cannot really mean to prescribe all that detail&#151;that is a job for officials&#151;rather than give a clear duty and clear guidelines. I ask them to please think again.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000054"></a>and it then gives an indicative list of potential actions. It illustrates to the local community the range of things that the local authority can do in order to respond. The noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Hanningfield, focused on the fact that &#147;giving effect&#148; usually means a cabinet member taking an action, and that is what is encompassed in paragraph (a). The processes outlined in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment are about giving effect. We have not gone into the detail, as the noble Lord has done in his amendment. The actions listed in the amendment are about the internal processes that the councillors would go though. I respect and understand that, but they are all contained in the notion of giving effect.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000012"></a>The idea of the indicative list is to flag up to citizens and the local community that other things can happen, including commissioning research. We hope that there will be many instances where the local authority can immediately carry out the action and give effect to the request in the petition in some of the ways that the noble Lord refers to in his amendment. However, there are more complex issues. For example, if a petition puts the case for additional youth facilities, there may be a need to find out exactly how many young people are using the existing facilities and what their local ambitions and needs are in relation to the facilities that they might have. That can come under the heading of commissioning research from young people.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000013"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09012892000077"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Does the Minister honestly think that if an item about youth facilities goes on the agenda as a petition and the council is taking it seriously it would not refer it to the next meeting for a report on the situation, to get exactly the information that the Minister is talking about? That is how councils work. It may be that if that information is available it will be presented to the meeting&#151;if there is a decent chairman who says that it should&#151;at the same time as the petition. They are the committees that make the decisions, and they are not included in this at all.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000014"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09012892000078"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> No, because we did not actually want to write that detail into the Bill, for the many good reasons the noble Lord has given us on many instances. However, the instance that he gives is a very good one&#151;and, yes, I would expect it to be referred to the youth committee. But in my home town of Lewes there was a campaign for a very long time for somewhere special for young people to go. Nobody knew how many young people had that particular ambition or what they actually wanted. No committee in the world could simply invent something without asking young people what they wanted. That is what we mean by commissioning research. I cannot really see the objection to that or see how we are at odds on that matter.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000015"></a>The other things on that list are there simply to indicate the range of actions that the local authority may take in support of the work of councils in their respective responsibilities. I take the point about overview and scrutiny; it is only one example on that list. I take the point about detail; we are continually wrestling with the balance in what we think is important detail  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in an area of policy that we have not addressed in legislation before. There are disagreements in this Committee about whether we should try to do this, but having embarked on it we thought that it was important to give an indication of the sort of scope that the local authority should offer by way of illustration.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000016"></a>Sometimes it will be immediately clear that the elected members of the local authority and its committees can act and carry out the action, and inform the organiser immediately about that. I respect what the noble Lord has said and what he is trying to do in the amendment, but we have come at it slightly differently. What he has tried to do in this amendment is encompassed by the notion of giving effect. We could certainly put the kind of process that he outlined in guidance to make it clear, but his amendment imposes an administrate arrangement while our clause does not. It says that steps may be taken to secure the result that is of the greatest benefit to local people. On that basis, I cannot accept his amendment.</p>

I have just counted up and my proposals take up 28 lines while hers take up 35, so I think that it is not more detail although it may be different detail. The problem with what is in the Bill is that it is partly process stage 1 and it is not inclusive. It does not include what most councils will do most of the time.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000018"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09012892000080"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am sorry to go on, but giving effect, as I said to the noble Lord, encompasses the processes that he spoke of. Giving effect is what local councils do in their daily business, whether they are cabinet members or members of committees. That is what we aim to do by putting it in the Bill, to encompass exactly what he wants to see in his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000019"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09012892000081"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I have to say that I disagree.

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000020"></a>The Minister said that these are areas that we have not previously put in legislation. Do we have to legislate to tell councils that they can hold a public meeting, as the Bill does? All the councils with which I have been involved have held public meetings of various kinds fairly frequently. My own council holds an astonishing number of public meetings. Depending on how you define a public meeting, never a week goes by without two or three of them. Residents can turn up and take part in single-issue or community meetings&#151;they are not ordinary council meetings. In my experience, most public meetings do not arise from petitions; most of them are from deputations. Deputations go to committees of the council&#151;in particular, to area committees&#151;and they raise an issue. That area committee will then say, &#147;Let&#146;s have a public meeting&#148;. Alternatively, they are regular public meetings connected with ongoing investment projects. The idea that we need in legislation to tell councils that they can hold a public meeting, and to do so in legislation referring specifically to

The Government will make themselves look ridiculous, and I am trying to stop them doing so.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000021"></a>The Minister then said that the scope of the steps to be taken is by way of illustration, but it ought not to be in primary legislation. It is ridiculous that the Government are saying in primary legislation that:</p>

<p><a name="09012892000055"></a>Perhaps they can put in lots of other things as well if they have time to waste doing it. If the Government really want to prescribe how a council deals with petitions, they should set out the process. Much of what is in the Bill is halfway outcomes. Since we have just had Burns Night, I am tempted to quote Burns, although I am not sure that it is a good idea with a Yorkshire accent. He wrote:</p>

If members of the public said, &#147;We need to have X hung out to dry&#148;, in a method akin to a kangaroo court or a witch hunt, perhaps against a junior officer, that would be entirely wrong. It is for the members to summons the officers.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000024"></a>I asked CIPFA whether it had any comments on a later part of the Bill concerning auditing. Rather to my surprise, I received a copy of its response to the improving local accountability consultation, which concludes that,</p>

<p><a name="09012892000058"></a>I had not expected support to come from that area&#151;certainly not when what I thought that I was asking about was auditing local authority companies&#151;but CIPFA is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000025"></a>As I understand its briefing, the Local Government Association is also opposed to this measure. It made suggestions about enabling authorities to require the appearance of chief officers and others from, essentially, partner authorities. However, I think that that was in the spirit of, &#147;If you&#146;re going to do this, you should do that as well&#148;. I did not table those amendments because I did not agree with the underlying principle.</p>

<a name="90128-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09012892000026"></a>This is a very contentious clause. I think that, again, it has failed, as has the whole of Part 1 of the Bill, to understand what representative democracy is about. We oppose Clause 16.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000027"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09012892000083"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> I tried, inadvertently and wrongly, to raise the issue that I now want to raise briefly. It is on the same point and I raise it in a benign, rather than a malignant, manner. Before we get to Clause 16, Clause 14(5) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09012892000063"></a>&#147;A principal local authority&#146;s petition scheme must secure that, where an active petition is made to the authority, the authority must take one or more steps in response to the petition&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000059"></a>Clause 16(2) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012892000070"></a>&#147;the petition requests that an officer of the authority (whether identified by name or description) be called to account at a public meeting of the authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012892000060"></a>That is one sanction. Then, at the top of page 11 of the Bill, Clause 16(7)(a) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09012892000071"></a>&#147;the exercise by an overview and scrutiny committee of the authority of its power under subsection (13)(a) of section 21 of the Local Government Act ... to require the relevant person to attend before it to answer questions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09012892000061"></a>My question, which is shared with the trade union UNISON, is: can the Minister inform us of the kind of criteria that would guide a council in deciding whether to use a public meeting or a scrutiny committee, or both, in dealing with a petition of this kind? The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, quite rightly and fairly, raised this issue. I have in mind the Baby P petition. I recall, many years ago, attending very angry public meetings but they related to issues. Phrases such as &#147;witch hunt&#148; or &#147;hanging out to dry&#148; can be bandied about and may very well apply if someone is invited to a meeting. I am anxious only to ensure that the Minister and the Government are satisfied that, if a petition includes a demand that a person be brought to a public meeting, they know what they are doing.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000028"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09012892000084"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> I strongly support my noble friend in this matter. I have been a councillor for many years. There have been times, particularly recently, when things that the officers have done have been acutely embarrassing for us and which we would not have allowed to happen. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that we are a representative democracy. In all sincerity, I really think that, when we are talking about localism and devolving power, Ministers and civil servants need to think carefully about how we operate a representative  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>democracy. It is getting out of hand&#151;and this provision in particular is out of hand. If we took it to an extreme, perhaps the civil servants sitting behind the Minister today could be questioned by the people outside about what we are doing here today. That is what the clause really means. If you did it nationally, somebody could petition the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, to bring forward her civil servants to be questioned. I am sure that none of us would want that to happen, because we believe that this is a representative democracy despite the fact that, as I explain to people outside this Chamber, one of the most frustrating things about this job is that you come forward with your ideas and you know jolly well that the people sitting behind or somewhere near the Minister will send her notes telling her why she has to say no to what you want to do. It would be very nice to be able to question them, but we cannot do that. However, I say in all seriousness that the Government really need to think about what a representative democracy is.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000029"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09012892000085"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I support the proposal from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Officers are appointed to serve the whole council; they are not there to second-guess the political will of either the administration or anybody else. This is very dangerous territory. I have been in positions when officers have said the wrong things. I can remember that once one of our officers was actually in our council chamber trying to hang one of the other officers in effigy, so when we had a council meeting there was a scarecrow hanging from the roof who was supposed to be one of our officers. He had said things that he should not have done about the waste programme. I endorse what has been said: it is the members who take the decisions, obviously with officer guidance&#151;but it is exactly the same as in Parliament. We are getting into very dangerous territory here.</p>

<p><a name="09012892000030"></a><b><a name="90128-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09012892000086"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am very well aware from the debate that this is something that noble Lords opposite want us to think about. As I have said, we are happy to talk about this before Report. However, I should like very briefly to set out what we are trying to achieve. I take the point entirely, and I want to reassure noble Lords that this is not, as they suggest, any attempt to subvert the notion of representative democracy. It is not an attempt to place officers in the front line of debates which would be more properly matters for councillors, and it is not an invitation for public bullying or harassment. It is not a replacement of proper disciplinary procedures by a kangaroo court; there are protections built in.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09012860000060"></a>Benefits: Conditionality Review</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09012860000003"></a><b><a name="90128-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09012860000052"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Purnell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09012860000004"></a>In December 2008 Professor Paul Gregg published his review on the effectiveness of the balance of expectations and support for working-age benefit claimants. This was entitled <I>Realising Potential: A Vision for Personalised Conditionality and Support</I>. Copies are available in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09012860000005"></a>Today my department is publishing a discussion paper setting out further details about how it intends to take forward the recommendations of that review to help many more parents with younger children and employment and support allowance claimants to prepare for work.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09012860000006"></a>We believe that developing the progression to work approach proposed by the Gregg review will support families, promote employment and help eradicate child poverty. Therefore this discussion paper outlines our latest thinking on how this approach will be designed and tested out. The framework we plan to establish is one where more claimants:</p>
actively engage with their adviser on an ongoing basis;consider, discuss and agree an action plan comprising activities they think will improve their prospects of moving back into work; andundertake these agreed work preparation activities as part of their own journey towards employment.
<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09012860000007"></a>This means creating a model where advisers have the necessary skills and capabilities to encourage claimants to co-own, co-produce and take responsibility for their journey back to work.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09012860000008"></a>We want to test the full model proposed by Professor Gregg of higher support and expectations. Because we know that the availability of childcare is so central to enabling parents to realise their aspirations for paid work, we will pay for any additional childcare that claimants need to carry out their action plan. We will also test out whether offering an improved financial incentive for parents to try out work supports them to make the full transition from benefits to work.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09012860000009"></a>The current Welfare Reform Bill aims to create the necessary legislation for this approach, initially through a series of pathfinders, subject to parliamentary approval. These pathfinders will cover around a fifth of new and existing ESA claimants and a similar proportion of parents with younger children. Parents with a youngest child aged between one and two will be expected to engage with an adviser and agree an action plan, but undertaking work preparation activities will be voluntary.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09012860000012"></a><b><a name="90128-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09012860000053"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09012860000013"></a>I am today announcing the publication of a new, cross-government strategy document, <I>Next S</I><I>teps for </I><I>E</I><I>arly </I><I>Learning and C</I><I>hildcare: </I><I>Building on the 10-y</I><I>ear Strategy for England</I>.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09012860000014"></a>Five years into our 10-year strategy, it is the right time to take stock of, identify and address new and future challenges as we move progressively towards the establishment of early learning and childcare as a modern, universal public service for all families.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09012860000015"></a>We have come a long way in delivering on the agenda that we set ourselves in 2004. Thanks to hard work across the sector, parents now have access to more flexible, affordable and better quality early learning and childcare than ever before, and many more families are benefiting from new rights and services. It will take time for the children who have had these opportunities to demonstrate the long-term benefits, but there are already signs that changes could help promote the social mobility of future generations. The latest foundation stage profile results show that 21,000 more children achieved a good level of development at age five than in the previous year.  And the lowest achievers are starting to catch up; the gap between their achievement and their peers has narrowed for the first time.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09012860000016"></a>We are determined to keep improving early learning and childcare because these are crucial long-term investments. Good-quality early learning and childcare is vital for ensuring all children, but especially the most disadvantaged, reach their full potential. It supports parents into employment, which is the best way out of poverty. And it relieves the time and emotional pressures that families face in balancing work and home life. In a time of global economic downturn, where parents face increased financial and emotional pressures, these priorities are as important as ever.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09012860000017"></a>Alongside the recent <I>New Opportunities</I> White Paper, this document sets out some clear commitments and firm proposals. In other areas we have identified the case for action and need to develop plans through discussion and consultation. We want this to be the beginning of a wider conversation with parents, people who work in the sector, providers, agencies, children and local government about how we can meet these challenges. That is why the Government are also launching today a consultation on our plans to enshrine our historic goal of eradicating child poverty into law

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="09012860000019"></a><b><a name="90128-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09012860000054"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Yvette Cooper) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09012860000020"></a>The Treasury, the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Work and Pensions are today publishing a consultation document on proposals to legislate on the Government's commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09012860000021"></a>Every child deserves the best start in life. Where children grow up on low income, suffering either material deprivation or falling too far behind their peers, they can be disadvantaged throughout their lives. Child poverty doubled in the 20 years from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, leaving far too many British children deprived of important opportunities in life.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09012860000022"></a>That is why in 1999 the Government set an ambitious target to end child poverty in a generation. This commitment has already driven considerable progress across government. The number of children in absolute poverty has halved and 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty to date. Had the Government done nothing other than simply uprate the tax and benefit system, there would have been 2 million more children in relative poverty than there are today.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09012860000023"></a>All families have benefited from increases in support since 1997; households with children are on average &#163;2,100 better off in 2009-10 and families with children in the poorest fifth of the population are &#163;4,400 better off as a result of personal tax and benefit changes.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09012860000024"></a>But too many children still suffer from poverty or disadvantage. That is why we have committed to enshrine in legislation our historic pledge to eradicate child poverty by 2020. The consultation document outlines how the Government will use primary and secondary legislation to set a framework for achieving the Government's 2020 aims, including setting targets for the future. It will also set a requirement for the Government to report annually on progress. Improved accountability and a clear and comprehensive definition of progress will provide a platform for a renewed approach to break the cycle of poverty.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09012860000025"></a>We believe that tackling child poverty and confirming our commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is even more important during difficult economic times. Giving families real help now is important to help people deal with the challenges from the global credit crunch. But it is also about preventing the kind of long-term unemployment and worklessness caused by past recessions, which scarred communities and pushed up child poverty across the country.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09012860000027"></a>The consultation document sets out the four key elements of the child poverty strategy:</p>
more parents in work that pays and allows them to balance work and family life;financial support that is responsive to families' situations;improvements in children's life chances so that poverty in childhood does not translate into poor outcomes; and

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="09012860000043"></a><b><a name="90128-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="09012860000058"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> I have today published the Government&#146;s response to part 1 of the consultation on the draft Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Amendment) Order 2009 (including the addendum to the consultation). The consultation, which closed on 17 December 2008, sought views on provisions to slow down the rate at which the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) increases year on year as recommended by the Gallagher  


<notus-date day="28" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS24"></a><b>28 Jan 2009 : Column WS24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>review, adding two new renewable fuels to those eligible for RTFO certificates and revising the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09012860000044"></a>Having considered the responses received to the consultation, the Government continue to believe that there is a need to progress with caution with regard to obligation levels.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09012860000045"></a>The Government have now decided to introduce legislation setting an obligation level for 2009-10 of 3.25 per cent, which is 0.25 per cent higher than the Gallagher recommendation, and thereafter maintaining the planned increases in line with the Gallagher recommendations to reach 5 per cent in 2013-14. A draft order to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (2007/3072) will be laid in Parliament shortly and will be subject to the affirmative procedure. It is our intention that if the order completes the necessary stages it will be made in time to come into force at the start of the next obligation year in April 2009.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09012860000046"></a>Our decision on next year&#146;s obligation level takes into account the views expressed in response to the consultation. In particular, this decision reflects concerns about the effects of the discrepancy in the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil in the 2007 order. That definition excludes any fossil fuel which is blended with renewable fuel before the duty point. The result is that less fossil fuel than was intended is taken into account in calculating suppliers&#146; obligations, and therefore less renewable fuel is required to be supplied than was intended. My earlier Statement of 13 November explained the background behind this issue (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Lords, col. <I>67WS</I>).</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09012860000047"></a>We intend that the draft amendment order will contain provision to revise the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil for the next obligation period. To avoid problems with retrospective effect, we are not proposing that the amendment should purport to have effect for the current obligation period, which started in April last year. The full effect of the discrepancy issue on the volume of biofuel supplied in the first obligation year (2008-09) will not be known until after the end of this year. Our intention is that, by setting this level, the overall amounts of biofuel supplied in the first two years are still broadly consistent with the Gallagher recommendations&#151;ie, 5.5 per cent (2.5 per cent plus 3 per cent).</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09012860000048"></a>We also intend to add both biobutanol and renewable diesel to the renewable fuels eligible for certificates under the scheme, and these fuels will be defined as they are in the draft order included in the consultation document. We will continue to keep the fuels covered by the scheme under review in light of emerging new technologies.</p>

<a name="90128-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09012860000049"></a>In looking forward, under the renewable energy directive (RED) the UK will be required by 2020 to meet a target of 10 per cent renewable energy in transport. Our current mechanism for delivering renewable energy in this sector is the RTFO. The Government intend to consult later this year about the further amendment of the RTFO that will take these commitments into account, including the trajectories of the UK targets, and further work on the sustainability of biofuels. This will form part of government policy

Non-military risks and benefits have been identified, including the need to have close co-ordination with other government ministries to avoid overlaps. The community councils established under ASOP are designed to fill a hole in local governance left after the postponement of district council elections scheduled to take place in 2005. It is intended that community councils will cease to exist once democratically elected district councils are established in 2010. In insecure areas, ASOP forms a significant step toward improvements in local governance, by offering communities a means to present priorities and concerns to government. Rural development projects will not be adversely affected by ASOP councils, as these offer a single forum for prioritisation and co-ordination.</p>

<a name="90128w0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09012864000021"></a>The contract requires AEAs to provide a monthly management report to HMCS regional contractor managers on contractor performance. The report provides details on the execution rate of warrants, training undertaken by contractor staff and any complaints received by the contractor on action taken by their staff. Contractors must report any circumstances and situations where a complaint or issue is raised by defaulters who consider the enforcement of the warrant has been undertaken inappropriately or incorrectly. These will include any situations involving those in the vulnerable person categories. Any complaints or correspondence received by contractors must be investigated. In addition, Her Majesty's Court Service regional management will investigate the complaint to determine that the bailiff took the correct action or if the situation requires further investigation.</p>

This includes quarterly and six-month assurance reporting. There is also a requirement for each contractor to make an annual operation report reviewing their management of the contract. Combined, these reports form the basis for the HMCS director of enforcement to make an annual report covering the operation of all regional contracts.</p>

It is expected that the contractor will detail its procedures and processes and the agreed authorisation methods with each HMCS region and area within these reporting requirements.</p>

However, our discrimination law specifically prohibits unjustified discrimination in the performance of public functions and the provision of goods, facilities and services, and the principle that like cases should be treated alike is also recognised by our courts in the context of judicial review of administrative action. Combined with the prohibition on discrimination in the protection of the convention rights, most of which are civil and political rights, under the Human Rights Act, there are a broad range of means by which individuals may challenge discriminatory treatment in this country.</p>
