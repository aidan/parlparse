Bedside telephones are managed by three major service providers. Two providers charge 10 pence per minute for making an outgoing call and the other charges 26 pence per minute. Payphone charges vary at trust level according to local agreements with the chosen service provider.</p>

Will he confirm that the company that charges 26 pence per minute for patients to make calls covers 75 per cent of all calling opportunities for patients? Given those high costs and given that telephone calling is an important link for people who are going through a stressful time while they are ill in bed, why can they not use mobile phones in the same way that doctors can?</p>

I am sure that there has been general concern about the very large increase in call costs in relation to the company that he mentioned. He is right that it has a large proportion of the units in NHS hospitals, but these have brought a great deal of benefit to patients. New guidance issued by the department this month makes it clear that mobile phones can be used in certain areas but not in clinical areas. One must feel for patients who want peace and quiet if there is huge use of mobile phones on a ward. However, I agree with my noble friend&#146;s point about doctors.</p>

Interference had occurred previously only when phones had been used within one metre of equipment, but, with modern technology, that no longer applies.</p>

Some trusts may have gone further than they needed to, but they will be absolutely clear from the guidance issued this month by my department that there is no reason for a total prohibition. However, a balance has to be struck here. Patients on wards&#151;rather like passengers in railway carriages&#151;do not want to be bombarded with very noisy people using mobile phones. Mobile phones can also be used to take pictures and it is not appropriate for them to be used in clinical areas. It is better that mobiles are used in non-clinical areas, where their use is entirely appropriate.</p>

In hospitals, if a phone rings and one is ill, will there be an answering message saying, &#147;Press button 1; press button 2; if you are dying press button 3&#148;? Are we really getting into that mode in the health service?</p>

Of course, the whole point about these individual patient units is that relatives and friends can ring a patient directly. That is why, overall, this has been a very successful project. It has brought much benefit to patients. I understand the concern about the huge increase in price, but overall patients have very much enjoyed the new facility.</p>

It is money down the drain. For me, that does not matter, but for many others it would matter. Is that a convenience for patients?

I am sure we all express our deep concern to her. The phones have brought a great deal of advantage to many patients and patients do not have to use the system if they do not want to. Pay phones are still available in hospitals and in some cases the old trolley phones can be rolled out. There has to be a balance. The introduction of the system has come at no cost to the National Health Service and it has brought great advantages to many patients. Noble Lords are understandably concerned about the huge increase in prices. That is a matter for individual trusts to discuss with the company concerned. Overall, surely it is best that patients have much greater access and immediate access to phones and television and radio services.</p>

This approach involves promoting a range of practical measures to help people who might become homeless, particularly early intervention and the provision of housing advice.</p>

The Government have invested in an extensive information campaign in those countries to ensure that prospective migrants are aware of their rights and their obligations, particularly their rights to seek work and to access social benefits. We are trying to ensure that at the very beginning people know what the prospects are when they come and their rights. The message is essentially, &#147;Think before you leave&#148;.</p>

<a name="70509-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07050994000033"></a>It is important to point out that, when people come here, 97 per cent of the A8 nationals are in full-time employment. They contribute to the economy. We know that in areas such as Westminster, which is traditionally the part of the city that has the highest levels of rough sleeping, there are people who find themselves destitute. I visited the Passage recently, which is a place to which many A8 migrants go and where they are helped. It is under pressure, like many other places. We have recently made available over &#163;600,000 to central London local authorities to support intervention to work with those nationals who are rough sleepers. There is quite a lot of assistance and charitable help as well.</p>

We recently provided &#163;19 million for local authorities to look at ways of increasing accommodation for children living in overcrowding. We have five co-ordinators working on overcrowding in London, and we have another &#163;700,000 for the five London boroughs worst affected to develop better policies.</p>

If they have only a weekly tenancy, they have nothing to go to and no claim to remain where they are. As far as I know, there are no council facilities for homeless women.

Since 2003, all local authorities have had to develop a homelessness strategy. They should certainly be looking at people like that, identifying people who are vulnerable and providing the sort of housing advice services which can set out the housing options, pointing people in the direction of, for example, supported or key-worker housing. I will think about what the noble Baroness has said, in particular relation to that group.</p>

The housing advice provision now being made in prisons to give early advice on accommodation is absolutely vital. We are working in partnership with the Home Office on reducing reoffending by creating pathway programmes into housing. We have some extremely interesting pilots, working in Holloway with women offenders, for example, which I would be pleased to write to the noble Lord about.</p>

We listened to what the committee said in its report and, as I said, we were grateful that we could provide additional and broader evidence to support the case that we have been making all along. Bringing together essential information that consumers need up front at the first point of sale, to help them chose a home, will make the transaction more transparent, more predictable and less stressful. Bringing all that together with the energy performance certificate will make a great positive difference to buying and selling homes.</p>

Far from getting rid of the pack, we should move towards greater extension. It is popular with people. As the noble Baroness opposite said, it is not popular with some estate agents and others, but their popularity level is similar to that of politicians and journalists, so perhaps we should not put too much emphasis on that. The issue is this: it is good for the environment, it is good for home owners and the majority of the public seem to want it, so let us move towards it, please.</p>

Indeed, the polls suggest powerfully in favour of energy performance certificates: YouGov recently said that 71 per cent of people think that energy information is important and they want more information about how to make their homes warmer while at the same time reducing costs. This is popular with consumers and so it should be.</p>

One side wishes to have certitude as soon as possible and the other side wishes the matter to be in abeyance until there is an exchange of contracts. The scheme as now devised and considered by Parliament is in fact the worst of all worlds in that it does not require a home conditions report or, indeed, a record of local searches. It is expensive without being satisfying for either party. In the circumstances, should the matter not be prorogued until there is a sufficiency of home inspectors for the matter to be properly supervised?</p>

The average time taken between offer and exchange is longer than it was in 1998. We have the most opaque system in Europe for determining at what stage documents are being collected and where you are in that process. What is the argument against bringing together useful information that tells you what you are buying at the beginning of the process, so that buyers can have a much more certain account of the choice that they are making?</p>

It would have been very odd, however, if a major Statement of this sort had been delayed in the Commons until well into the proceedings; on Wednesdays the Commons start at 11.30 am, so the Statement would have come much later.

I am as much a guardian of the rights of Parliament as anyone, having been on the Back Benches myself for many years, but, with the greatest respect, it is not for Parliament to decide which Minister makes which Statement. There are all sorts of other opportunities open to Members of either House by way of Urgent Questions, Private Notice Questions, topical Questions or other means, but the Government are responsible for which Ministers make the Statements.

The creation of the Ministry of Justice offers a significant opportunity to build on this success, with the following three-part programme.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="07050994000094"></a>First, we will continue to protect the public by ensuring we provide prison places for those who the courts determine need custody. This Government have already built 20,000 new prison places over the past10 years&#151;an increase of 33 per cent&#151;built faster than ever before. Eight thousand further places will be built by 2012. We want to examine how to modernise the estate to provide more cost-effective facilities which are better equipped to reduce reoffending. We also want to identify whether the resources in our current estate can be used to finance new accommodation, be that new state-of-the-art prisons or smaller local provision for women and young offenders. I have asked my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles to provide an assessment of the plans for the 8,000 prison places and the longer-term issues affecting the estate, including the inter-relationship between prisons and the rest of the Ministry of Justice estate, to ensure that we have a coherent strategy.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07050994000095"></a>Our prison-building programme will therefore continue to ensure that we have capacity to lock the most dangerous prisoners away for as long as they are dangerous and enable sentencers to send people into custody wherever they think this is required. The new indeterminate sentence for public protection is now in place, ensuring that the most dangerous prisoners are released only when it is safe to do so. More than 2,200 of these sentences have been issued so far.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07050994000096"></a>The Government have always recognised that prison must be used for those who need it, and that sentences should be designed to reduce reoffending. However, over decades we have learnt that short custodial sentences are not effective in reducing reoffending. That is why we want to see greater use made of the best community sentences, where  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1452"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence shows that they reduce reoffending and offer more effective punishment than custodial sentences of less than 12 months.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07050994000097"></a>Sentencing policy must support the use of our resources in such a way as to best protect the public, punish offenders and reduce reoffending. Prison should be used to protect the public to the extent and for the purposes necessary to deliver on the statutory aims of sentencing and in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 2003, with alternatives to custody used when they are more effective in reducing reoffending and providing payback to the community. </p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07050994000098"></a>We will ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review whether its guidelines fully reflect the principles set out in the 2003 Act. We will also ask it to look at its processes to ensure that it can operate in the way that it considers best enables it effectively to produce such guidelines as are necessary.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07050994000099"></a>We will ensure that where serious and dangerous offenders breach their licence conditions, the punishment is a swift return to custody, for as long as is necessary. We will propose new arrangements for non-dangerous prisoners to be recalled to prison for 28 days. We will also propose that suspended sentence orders should apply to more serious offences, as we originally intended when they were created in 2003, not to summary ones.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07050994000100"></a>Secondly, we need to increase confidence in community sentences, to support their greater use where they are more effective in reducing reoffending. Offenders will be required to undertake programmes to stop them reoffending, training to equip them with the skills to get into work, and carry out unpaid work in their local community, organised by the best available providers, whether in the public, private or third sectors. They will be subject to packages to restrict their liberty and movements, make them face up to the consequences of their actions and pay back the communities they have harmed.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07050994000101"></a>The individual being punished, the community and the sentencer all have to understand that if the penalty is breached, punishment will follow, with custody if necessary. We will ensure that prison places are available for this purpose.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07050994000102"></a>Thirdly, we renew our commitment to delivering in line with the vision set out in the Carter report of December 2003, including end-to-end offender management and public service reform. There is excellence in the public, private and voluntary sectors in the delivery of prison and probation services, and we want to build on this to reduce reoffending further. In particular, this means commissioning the most effective interventions which will best support the management and rehabilitation of offenders and making use of the fullest range of providers.</p>

<a name="70509-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07050994000103"></a>We have put in place the framework, the people, the programmes and the knowledge to make a massive difference to the way in which we deal with crime and protect the public in this country. We must make sure that this investment pays off. Above all, that means the right punishment, for the right length of time, for as long as necessary, with the right interventions and the right level of supervision for each offence.</p>

<a name="07050994000104"></a><b><a name="70509-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07050994000390"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble and learned Lord on his new name. His acquisition of political titles is positively Gilbertian. He has accumulated&#151;not without incident&#151;first, the Lord Chancellorship, then the Secretary of Stateship for Constitutional Affairs and now the Ministry of Justice. How interesting it is that the title he initially inherited, and was so keen at one stage to relinquish, is the one of real merit.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07050994000105"></a>I must confess to not warming to the title, Ministry of Justice. Indeed, I find it rather forbidding. Are we soon to expect the Home Office to be renamed the Ministry of the Interior? That would lead to the true continentalisation of our justice system. But politics and justice do not sit together easily. That is what I thought the Constitutional Reform Act was about: to enshrine the principle of separation of powers in our constitution. Of course, we had that already but, to the Government, perception was everything. How typical&#151;dare I say it?</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07050994000106"></a>In this amalgamation, the independence of the judiciary is an issue. In fact, it has become quite a big issue. Not surprisingly, the judges are deeply concerned about their ability to retain their own independence as a consequence of the creation of the new ministry. The noble and learned Lord is familiar with the arguments. Among them, the most important concerns the integrity of the court budget. Already the court budget is under tremendous pressure. One has only to talk to the leading figures in the world of either magistrates or county courts. Some of those institutions are in a desperate situation; and now they have the added threat of having to compete with money for prisons&#151;and, heaven knows, more money is needed for those.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07050994000107"></a>Then there is the real&#151;or at the very least perceived&#151;danger that judges will come under increasing pressure to tailor their sentences to the availability of prison places. There is also the strong likelihood of the Minister, not as the guardian of the independence of the judiciary but as a politician in charge of criminal policy and prison policy, being repeatedly judicially reviewed in the courts by the judges with whom he is supposed to co-operate.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07050994000108"></a>As we all know, the process was rushed through with tremendous haste. There was no consultation with Parliament and no resolution of the concerns the judiciary expressed before today. This, of course, is redolent of a previous change in June 2003. Who was responsible for this change? It was the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. Having achieved this split, they have now both decided to resign. PerhapsMr Reid had second thoughts about the wisdom of the split. The broader issue is that the very individuals who have driven the split will not be around to take responsibility for the fact that it does not work.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07050994000109"></a>We hear much from the Government about joined-up policies. But the conduct of the Home Office over the past several years has been anything but joined up. I suggest to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that the split of the Home Office  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1454"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice aggravates the very problems that were the reasons for the split in the first place.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07050994000110"></a>The noble and learned Lord has hardly touched on any of these issues which I regard as absolutely fundamental to the change the Government have made. He has, rather, addressed an important new responsibility of the Ministry of Justice&#151;prisons and sentencing. But it must be plain to everybody that the fundamental problem the Government face is one entirely of their own making. They have continually failed to act to provide the necessary places in prison to fit their prison population projections; and we in Opposition have predicted that problem ever since 2003 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act and all the implications that that has and will have.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07050994000111"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor says that he will ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review its guidelines on sentencing. Why does he believe that necessary? Does the noble and learned Lord regard the current guidelines as too soft?</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07050994000112"></a>The noble and learned Lord concludes that short custodial sentences are of little use and predicts more relevant community sentences as a better answer. Which kind of offences does the noble and learned Lord have in mind? If short custodial sentences are of small value, what is the point of recalling those who offend on licence and incarcerating them for a mere 28 days?</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07050994000113"></a>The statistics deployed by the noble and learned Lord are impressive as far as they go, but highly selective. I was particularly struck by the point about increasing efficiency in the Crown Court service. As a supporter of jury service, I was extremely pleased to hear that. But what was lacking in those statistics was one about the problem that concerns the general public most&#151;violent crime. On his first day in office, what are his thoughts on that issue and how will he confront it during his time in office?</p>

I will not make any comment about his names. We welcome the creation of a Ministry of Justice and have long argued in favour of the desirability of having such a ministry to deal with all those justice issues involved in dealing with crime, the management of offenders, the prevention of reoffending and the protection of the public. There is clearly much still to be done in terms of fleshing out the details of the roles of both the new ministries. It is indeed a matter of regret that there has not been much more debate and consultation, both in the other place and in your Lordships' House, on such a vitally important matter as the division of a great department of state&#151;the Home Office.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07050994000115"></a>It goes without saying that the measure has huge implications over a wide range of issues central to the safety and well-being of our nation, and those have not been given the space and time that they need and deserve. Indeed, we would like to know how it was  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1455"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that only last June, the Prime Minister was assuring Menzies Campbell in the other place that there was no case whatever for the creation of a Ministry of Justice, yet by March it had become a fait accompli. What logic and thinking lie behind that change of heart? Why was that thinking not shared more fully? By the same token, we have heard nothing today about the details of how the Home Office, the other side of the same coin, will carry out its new role.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07050994000116"></a>We welcome the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor in his new role as head of the Ministry of Justice. Will it be short lived, or can we look forward to benefiting from his wisdom and expertise beyond the next few weeks, when we can expect a new incumbent in No. 10? In particular, as we look forward to the next stage of the Offender Management Bill, will we see new Ministers at the Dispatch Box or will we look forward to continuity? Which Ministers will be responsible for what in this place? Will it be the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, as we might expect?</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07050994000117"></a>The three-part programme outlined by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has much to commend it. While finding little to commend in the enormous &#163;1.5 billion outlay on new prison places at a time of such financial constraint in other and alternative parts of the system, the suggestion of smaller, local prison provision, particularly for women and young offenders, is greatly to be welcomed. We need to work towards far fewer people ending up in custody at all, but for those for whom it is necessary and appropriate, local and smaller provision is a significant step forward.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07050994000118"></a>The new indeterminate sentence for public protection, however, needs to be revisited. It has been used much more widely than anticipated and the case for eligibility, particularly for young prisoners under 21 and for certain offences, indicates clearly that a review is necessary. We will be pressing for one.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07050994000119"></a>The proposed review of the guidelines used by the Sentencing Guidelines Council is also desirable and should, with the right consultation, go some way to alleviating some of the concerns expressed by the judiciary. The proper application of suspended sentence orders is also necessary, so that they are used in appropriate cases, and the unintended widening of the net can be drawn in more tightly.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07050994000120"></a>We particularly welcome the greater emphasis on use of alternatives to custody, where outcomes in terms of reoffending are much better and could be greatly improved with more resources, particularly for the Probation Service. Indeed, I greatly welcomed the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#146;s unequivocal endorsement of the role of the Probation Service and its central part in the provision of these alternatives in his speech last week.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07050994000121"></a>Confidence in community sentences is a major challenge to us all. Knowledge and understanding by communities is the key to this, as is, above all, engagement in the process by which offenders can make good some of the damage done to our communities. We will do all we can to promote this aspect of the ministry&#146;s work.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1456"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07050994000122"></a>End-to-end management of offenders is something that we all agree with, I imagine. It requires a clear duty on those working both in the community and in prisons to work together as closely as possible. It is logical, realistic and has the greatest chance of the most positive outcomes for all concerned.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07050994000123"></a>There remains much to be discussed and clarified, both in the broad thrust of this Statement and, even more, in the detail. I hope the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor can reassure us that we will have this opportunity to look more closely at the detail, so that the concerns and different voices can be heard. These include many distinguished voices and different interests. Crucially, and as has already been mentioned, how and where will the financial needs of the various elements involved&#151;courts, sentences, prison, communities and others&#151;be met? One should not find itself benefiting disproportionately at the expense of the others. Prisons, for example, are a huge drain, where investment seems to have been agreed without a murmur. Community resources, on the other hand, have been relatively deprived. The independence of the judiciary is paramount as we all agree, but will the costs of the administration of justice be ring-fenced? We look forward to hearing much more. In the mean time we welcome all that is positive and constructive in today&#146;s Statement by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor.</p>

I also thank the noble Baroness for her support for the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07050994000125"></a>I completely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, says about the importance of preserving the independence of the judiciary. It is vital that the Ministry of Justice&#146;s arrangements do not affect that in any way. That is why there was discussion with the judiciary before the Ministry of Justice was brought into existence. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said that, provided proper safeguards were put in place, he had no objection to the principle of a Ministry of Justice. The safeguards that he had in mind were ensuring that: the budget of the courts should not be depraded by, for example, the prison budget; there should be no difficulties because of judicial reviews; and there should be no suggestion of the Minister doing anything in relation to the court service that undermined the independence of the judiciary.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07050994000126"></a>I agree with all three. As I made clear in answer to the Private Notice Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, last week, I do not believe that a ring-fenced budget is the way to deal with it. Statutory obligations remain on the Lord Chancellor to ensure a properly financed court budget. I stand by that. The problem with ring-fencing is that justice sometimes requires that some money be diverted from, for example, the maintenance of court buildings to legal aid to ensure proper access to justice. That must continue, subject to proper safeguards for the court budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07050994000127"></a>In relation to judicial review, although noble Lords will find this almost impossible to believe, I have been judicially reviewed as Lord Chancellor. Indeed, having checked the statistics, I see that last year I was judicially reviewed on 31 occasions. I am quite sure that they were all completely unsuccessful. It has been perfectly possible for me, as Lord Chancellor, to have a relationship with the judges that is not in any way affected by the fact that, from time to time, the Lord Chancellor finds himself as a defendant in court. Nobody in this country is outside the ambit of the law. The judicial review issue does not create a substantial difficulty.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07050994000128"></a>The history of the split is that during the autumn last year and the spring of this year, consideration was given to where the right split should be. Two considerations apply. First, in the changed world that we face since 9/11, it is right that there be a Home Office able to focus specifically on crime, security, immigration and counterterrorism. It is also right&#151;and one obvious lesson that we all accept&#151;thatthe more joined-up the criminal justice system and the justice system generally, the better the results. The effect of moving prison, probation, penal and sentencing policies into the department responsible for the administration of the courts is that, especially in relation to sentenced offenders, there is much more joining-up. It also provides the opportunity for there to be two more balanced departments in Whitehall, where there can be political drive not only for security and counterterrorism issues but also the penal policy issues.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07050994000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked what sort of offences I would expect the Sentencing Guidelines Council to look at. I shall give a wide range of offences, but they will primarily be acquisitive offences. He asked, too, what we were doing about violent crime; it is perfectly plain that, although the justice system has a significant role in relation to this, fighting violent crime is a much wider issue than simply the justice system. We need to ensure that communities themselves turn against violent crime in the most profound way. However, I completely accept the implication of the noble Lord&#146;s remarks on this extremely important issue.</p>

<a name="70509-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07050994000130"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, asked about the timing, which I think that I have indicated. She asked about the details of the split. If one looks at the background paper that I have put into the Printed Paper Office, one will find the details of precisely where the lines are to be drawn. I am grateful to her for supporting the remarks that I made about the importance of the Probation Service last week at a conference, and I am glad that I can repeat them here today in substance. I very much value the work done by the Probation Service. We must work in partnership with the service to achieve the results that we all want to achieve in relation to offender management.</p>

She remains in the Home Office, which is a source of great personal grief to me&#151;but there should be continuity there. I have the advantage of having the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, with me, who will as time goes on deal with a range of issues of the sort that the department has dealt with. However, I am very glad that my noble friend Lady Scotland will be able to deal with that Bill; she started it, so I think that she should finish it.</p>

The Home Secretary will be responsible for the police, who answer to local authorities, and for the security services. I would never underestimatethe significance of those services, but the nobleand learned Lord will know that they operate independently; they report to the Home Secretary but are not controlled by the Home Secretary. One virtue of the Home Office that disappears today is that it co-ordinated the criminal justice system, balancing the tensions between the conflicting interests of prisons, probation, immigration, sentencing and the police. That has now gone. We will now have two separate departments and it seems inevitable that there will be tension between them, not least in the battle for government resources and cash. The noble and learned Lord talks of having more co-ordination, but we are abandoning a co-ordinated regime for a bifurcated regime and we may well find that we lose more than we gain.</p>

I hope that I am not breaking any secrets here, but there were from time to time tensions between the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department. This is precisely the right place to put the division between the two. It means that there can be proper concentration on security, terrorism and reducing crime in the Home Office and proper political drive and co-ordination for the justice system. Both have their separate place in government and they will both be better served by the split.</p>

Is that not inconsistent with the necessary degree of independence from the Government? Of course he should be consulted by the committee, but he should not be a member of it.

I have argued for the reform for many years, so I am pleased about it. As someone who worked for years in courts as a probation officer, I can say that the courts often worked well for those of us who worked in them and for those charged with offences, but that they worked rather badly for the general public and, in particular, for victims of crime. Can we judge the performance on how that improves?</p>

Apparently, we are now within some 500 places of crashing through the ceiling of 81,000. Nothing that is studied or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines Council within its authority can change some of the fundamental problems, one of which is indeterminate sentences. The principle behind such sentences is very proper, but it may be fraught with considerable problems in the near future. Academics estimate that within five years no fewer than 25,000 people will be subject to such sentences. Would the noble and learned Lord consider extending the remit of the study to include the possibility of amending the 2003 Act to give judges much greater discretion than they now have under the trigger mechanism for indeterminate sentences?</p>

I do not necessarily accept the figure of 25,000, but the number is going up. It is not within the statutory remit of the Sentencing Guidelines Council to look at the issue of indeterminate sentences; my focus in referring matters to it is not the indeterminate sentence but the determinate sentence, as I made clear. Although I note the suggestion made by the noble Lord, I am not minded to extend the reference&#151;not just because it cannot be done as a statutory matter, but because we must be clear that dangerous offenders will be kept in prison until, according to an independent assessment, they cease to be dangerous.</p>

People who smoke contribute a considerable amount of tax to the nation&#146;s wealth, and I look forward to the day when the new Prime Minister bans smoking entirely and ceases the production of tobacco and cigarettes. Then we will be in the society where the puritans would have us go. We must protect our staff and those who clean rooms and so on, but those who wish to continue smoking should have the right to some sort of protection to smoke in an environment where they are doing no one any harm except, possibly, themselves.</p>

It is not a smoking lobby; the people who have spoken and I are concerned about individual freedom. It is not a question of a lobby; it is a question of providing alternatives to what the Government and Parliament have decided, alternatives that were available. That was the issue when we discussed the matter in Grand Committee. It was possible to provide for separation with decent ventilation. If lobbying for the retention of individual freedom is a smoking lobby, then I fear that I have to disagree completely and utterly with the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner. I hope he now understands that we are in favour of individual freedom and of protecting minorities as well as the majority.</p>

I shall make the point that the report is very brief and simple. It makes no points on the merits or otherwise of smoking; all it does is to bring this House into line with what will be the law of the land outside it on 1 July. As more than one noble Lord said, having made the law&#151;whether one agrees with it or not&#151;we really have no choice. If we make the law for the great public outside, it is hardly for us to make exceptions for ourselves in this House. There lies the answer to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Blackburn, about offices. Smoking in offices is specifically banned by the legislation, and, therefore, we cannot do anything else. The points made by noble Lords about the merits of the legislation should have been made, and probably were made, during the passage of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07050994000175"></a>As the report says, it is hoped that we will provide smoking areas outside in the three locations that I mentioned. It is hoped that the shelters will have roofs and ashtrays. I shall make inquiries of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about the specific type of ashtray he referred to because it sounded very good to me. There is a limit to what we can do outside because the legislation specifies the sort of shelters that we can put up. As far as I am aware, they can have either a roof and no walls or walls and no roof.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07050994000180"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, these amendments have been retabled from the previous stage, when they were not moved. I turn briefly to Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with criminal law. I am pleased that we are all in agreement on this part of the Bill, with the exception of one minor point that is the subject of these amendments. Government Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 would allow Schedule 3 to be amendedby affirmative order. As noble Lords will recall,Schedule 3 contains a list of offences that are statutory forms of incitement or other inchoate offences. They are offences that can only be encouraged or assisted with intent.</p>

<a name="70509-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07050994000181"></a>As I indicated, I originally tabled these amendments on Report. Following our discussions at that stage, and in particular following the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the morning of our discussions, I agreed not to move the amendments and to reflect on them. I have considered the issue carefully and have retabled the amendments as proposed on Report. The amendments are necessary and they are appropriate.</p>

<a name="70509-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07050994000182"></a>The ability for the order-making power to add an offence to the schedule is not contentious, so I will not repeat my arguments about why it is necessary. However, the ability to remove an offence from the schedule concerned a number of noble Lords and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. We have taken those concerns seriously, and we have considered whether it is truly necessary to have a power to remove an offence from this schedule. We think it conceivable that there might in the future be concerns about restricting liability for offences currently in that schedule; we also think it conceivable that we might all agree that a certain offence should be removed from the schedule. Where that is the case, we think it sensible to provide a power to amend the schedule by order.</p>

The affirmative resolution procedure is the most appropriate way of ensuring adequate parliamentary scrutiny while maintaining flexibility. As such, I have not made any changes to the amendments that I tabled on Report. I hope that the further time given for consideration of the amendments has been helpful. It is also right to reflect on how well we have been able to arrive at consensus on these issues, and I certainly hope that we would seek to follow this model in future. I beg to move.</p>

I think that they were actually being moved by her colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, but I suspect that she offered some advice to him that it might be politic not to move them then, after we had made our objection that they had come forward at excessively short notice. We had had&#151;for which we are grateful&#151;the report from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The comments that the committee made at the time still stand and are worth underlining; the committee said that this was not an appropriate way of amending the schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07050994000185"></a>Nevertheless, the noble Baroness has given the amendments further consideration and we have had further time to look at them. We have had an assurance from the Minister that the resolution will be affirmative. So, with some reservations, we are prepared on this occasion to accept the amendments. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that in future, first, the Government will try to give the House appropriate notice of such amendments and, secondly, that they will always take proper notice of anything that comes from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The House owes a great deal to the committee. We are very grateful for its advice, especially when it comes to us at such short notice, as it did on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07050994000186"></a>If I remember correctly&#151;I stand to be corrected&#151;the amendments were tabled on Monday; the committee considered them on Tuesday and produced a report that we received on Wednesday. I am grateful that on this occasion the Minister prevailed on her colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, not to press them and gave them further consideration. I should have been slightly more grateful if the amendments had not come back, but there it is; the Government have brought them back. With those misgivings, we will not oppose the amendments.</p>

We backed him last time, when he suggested that the amendments ought not to be moved on the basis of the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

We would certainly have preferred something in the Bill rather than the affirmative resolution proposed but, in the light of what the Minister said and the undertakings that she gave, we are prepared to let the provision go forward.</p>

I also thank noble Lords opposite for the way in which they have responded to the efforts that we have made to reach consensus. They will know that we wanted to take very seriously the various comments made on this part to see whether the Bill could be improved in this House before it goes to the other place.

</ul>
<p><a name="07050994000265"></a>What progress has been made on the matter? I note that in the period between Report and Third Reading today the Information Commissioner has given evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee of another place. In that submission, he recommended that all public sector bodies should follow a new code of practice on how they pool information. Mr Thomas also argued that his powers should be increased to inspect and audit organisations without their consent when they are suspected of breaching privacy laws. That exactly mirrors the intent behind my amendment today.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07050994000196"></a>In his evidence to the Select Committee, Mr Thomas stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07050994000277"></a>&#147;The Home Office have accepted in principle that we should have the power to go in and inspect&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050994000266"></a>That was a welcome announcement. It goes beyond the indication given by Mr Coaker that, in the Minister&#146;s words, he would take away the issue and look at it.

My noble friend has already alluded to the fact that the Information Commissioner has gone public on the matter. In that context, I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm one small point for me. I have it in mind that the Information Commissioner is the only regulator in the UK who does not have the statutory authority to intervene in the way that the amendment proposes. I may be wrong, but if not it seems ludicrous that he should be the only one so constrained. Perhaps the noble Baroness could clarify the matter.</p>

As she says, her amendment would grant the Information Commissioner the power on his own initiativeto assess any data processing conducted under Clauses 61 to 65 of the Bill. I must resist the amendment but, before I do, I would like to explain why and consider the substance of the amendment. In particular, I wish to look at whether the Information Commissioner already has powers to initiate such issues, which is another matter that has concerned us.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07050994000199"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and to the noble Earl that, as I understand it, the Information Commissioner&#146;s comments referred to the code of practice amendment and to his access, not to his access to inspect and audit. That was the issue to which he was referring.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07050994000200"></a>Let me explain why we take the position that we do. First, where the amendment refers to Clause 65, I understand that it is meant to apply to Clauses 63 to  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1470"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>67 of the Bill as amended on Report, and I will proceed on that basis. I start by reiterating that the Data Protection Act already provides the Information Commissioner with the power to assess data processing of his own volition. Under Section 43 of the Data Protection Act, the Information Commissioner can, on his own initiative, serve the data controller of a body or organisation with an information notice requiring the production of information for the purposes of determining whether the data controller has complied or is complying with data protection principles. Any body or organisation dealing with or processing personal information must be registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner. That includes all bodies using the powers under Clauses 63 to 67.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07050994000201"></a>In addition, Section 40 of the Data Protection Act provides the Information Commissioner with the power to serve enforcement notices of his own volition if he is satisfied that a data controller has contravened or is contravening the data protection principles. The issue of these notices enables him to rectify instances of non-compliance with any of the data protection principles. Failure to comply with an enforcement notice or an information notice is an offence under Section 47 of the Act. A person guilty of an offence on summary conviction is liable to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum and, on indictment, to an unlimited fine. In any event, it is not in the data controllers&#146; interests to refuse access if they wish to satisfy the commissioner that their activities comply with the Act. We therefore believe that adequate powers are already provided to the Information Commissioner in that regard without further provision.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07050994000202"></a>I understand that the Audit Commission has already made a standing offer to the Information Commissioner to assess the data processing that it undertakes in carrying out the national fraud initiative, particularly with regard to the security arrangements that are in place. I further understand that the Audit Commission and the Information Commissioner meet regularly to discuss good practice with regard to data matching and data processing generally. The practical reality is that the two bodies have a constructive relationship, which is likely to continue.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07050994000203"></a>With regard to the code of practice for all those using the data-sharing powers of the Bill, I stated on Report that the Government hoped to return to the House with a more definite indication of our plans. I can now give an assurance that the Government will introduce an amendment to that effect; that is, introducing a code of practice, the detail of which will be discussed in another place. That is the issue that the Information Commissioner was most exercised about.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07050994000204"></a>The Audit Commission&#146;s national fraud initiative code of data matching practice contains a provision that under Section 51(7) of the Data Protection Act specifically invites the Information Commissioner to assess the national fraud initiative&#146;s compliance with that Act. The provision also recommends that all bodies supplying the data for data-matching exercises  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1471"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1471</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should similarly consent to reasonable requests made by the Information Commissioner to assess their processing of personal data. It is envisaged that the code of practice for the disclosure of information to prevent fraud will contain a similar provision.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07050994000205"></a>In summary, we believe that the Information Commissioner has at his disposal all the necessary powers to ensure that the data sharing and data matching carried out using the powers in the Serious Crime Bill comply with the Data Protection Act. For those reasons, the Government believe that the amendment is unnecessary. I am grateful to the noble Baroness and the Information Commissioner, however, for giving us the opportunity to look again at the powers to initiate, just to clarify whether the Data Protection Act is in fact able to deliver what was required. We believe that the powers that are already there will satisfy on that account.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07050994000206"></a>As I have indicated, it gives me some pleasure to be able to say with regard to the issue of the code, a matter that was exercising more attention, that we will be able to satisfy this House in due course, but that this matter will be raised, and, I hope, dealt with well, in the other place when the Bill leaves this House&#151;if, of course, your Lordships agree that it should do so.</p>

She is right to point out the defect in the amendment; it should refer to Clauses 63 to 67, reflecting the Bill as amended on Report. There is always a danger in simply retabling an amendment from Report to give the Government the opportunity to respond when one knows that one is not going to press it and one perhaps is not quite as careful as one ought to be.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07050994000208"></a>The Minister is saying that, after further reflection, the Government consider that they do not have to do anything about this because the powers already exist. She is also saying that the Government maintain that the Information Commissioner&#146;s main concern was about the existence of a code of practice to be referred to in the Bill and the procedure that should follow from that. I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Northesk may have something to say on that when we come to Amendment No. 3.</p>

<a name="70509-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07050994000209"></a>The Minister is right to point out that this House will have the opportunity&#151;when and if the Bill returns from another place&#151;to consider any amendment tabled by the Government about the code of practice. However, we are narrowly bound by this House&#146;s rules on its consideration of Commons amendments.

That is welcome; it is the right way for a body such as the Audit Commission to operate. The Audit Commission has always been impressive in the way in which it carries out its work&#151;certainly in the past few years in which I have been observing it. However, that is not the same as giving a statutory

Indeed, I&#151;and I suspect my noble friend Lady Anelay&#151;welcomed the Minister&#146;s magnanimous assurances on Report. Your Lordships will recall that the Minister intimated that she might be able to give a more definite indication of the Government&#146;s intentions today; she repeated that earlier. Accordingly, as with the previous amendment, my purpose was to give an opportunity to the Minister to advise the House of progress being made. She has already dealt with that in the main while speaking to the previous amendment. Nevertheless, I would be grateful if she would give, if possible, a little more flesh on the bones of the Government&#146;s thinking.</p>

However, I also point out that the Minister said on Report that even if she could not bring forward an amendment, she would try to flesh out the Government&#146;s plans and hoped to return with a more definite indication of them. The indication has been that there will be an amendment about the code of practice. While understanding that that amendment will not have been drafted yet, my noble friend and I seek a little more guidance for the House, if available, on what that code of practice will involve.</p>

But we are not quite at that stage yet. The Government will bring forward the amendment in the other place which will introduce the duty to produce and have regard to a code of practice. The detail is being discussed widely; these are matters which we believe we need to consider further. However, I reassure your Lordships that we have been working very closely with the former Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;now the Ministry of Justice&#151;and will liaise with the Information Commissioner on the detail of the amendment, as the Minister in the other place, my honourable friend Vernon Coaker, undertook to do at the meeting with the Information Commissioner on 18 April.</p>

I alerted members of our Northern Ireland team in this House. They liaised with my honourable friend Mr Lidington. I am grateful to them for looking at this. Throughout, we have sought to ensure that our Commons and Lords team on Northern Ireland is involved where relevant. Its response was simply that, if the Government did no more than take account of the SFO&#146;s remit in Northern Ireland, we would not have any objection to that matter.

&#147;I do not think it is possible to over-estimate the significance of yesterday&#146;s events at Stormont.  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1478"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;In effect we witnessed the final resolution of what has been, for centuries, the most intractable source of political conflict in the whole of Europe. Its significance is not confined to relations within these islands, because what happened on 8 May 2007 showed the world how a shared future can emerge from even the most bitterly divided and blood stricken past, and we must never forget how much misery and suffering that caused.&#147;Many people, including Members from all sides of the House, have worked tirelessly to make yesterday possible. The foundations were set by the 1998 Good Friday agreement, with the principle of consent and power-sharing at its core. But, seeing the DUP and Sinn Fein going into government together on a fair and equitable basis, makes &#145;historic&#146; seem a clich&#233;. That they have done it without the DUP ceasing to be the DUP and without Sinn Fein ceasing to be Sinn Fein is all the more remarkable. When we witnessed that now iconic picture of the leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein together for the first time on 26 March, we knew that Northern Ireland and the wider world would never be the same. Since then, the DUP and Sinn Fein, by working together, have shown that the greater good can be served without sacrificing either principle or integrity. &#147;Indeed, I was delighted that the first joint letter signed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister was to ask me to leave my office in Stormont Castle to enable them to move in, in time for yesterday&#146;s first meeting of the Assembly and the formation of the Executive. Never has an eviction notice been so eagerly anticipated or so warmly received. Meeting the First and Deputy First Ministers together, I have been struck by their businesslike approach to preparing for government and, perhaps even more remarkably, their cordial and warm personal interaction. Above all, they have shown that age-old enmities can be overcome. That is truly inspirational, as we saw yesterday when they preached together at Stormont a common gospel of healing. &#147;I am convinced that devolution is here to stay. It would now be as unthinkable for Northern Ireland to ask for a return to direct rule in the future as it would be for Scotland or Wales. Indeed, who would have imagined that, as of today, of all the devolved Administrations, Northern Ireland would have the only settled Government in place?&#147;The key to the future peace and prosperity of everyone in Northern Ireland lies in the shared future epitomised by the new Assembly and Executive. That shared future must go beyond the &#147;big politics&#148; of Parliament Buildings. Astonishing as the political transformation over the past two years has been, there is much more to be done. We must find a way of dealing with the past and addressing the needs of victims and survivors. Although last summer&#146;s marching season went off more peacefully and with greater consultation than ever before, a global solution to parading still  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1479"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs to be negotiated. I hope that the review team headed by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, will help to achieve this.&#147;There are too many so-called peace walls that still divide communities in Northern Ireland and some parts of Northern Ireland which continue to feel isolated, marginalised, deprived and out of the mainstream. I am thinking especially of loyalism and its place in a shared future. We have always said that we will support and encourage those who want to work to a positive agenda, who wanted to bring about change and who had sustainable mechanisms for doing it.&#147;People have a right to have their identity, their culture and their traditions respected, but if loyalism does not get into the mainstream and catch the tide that is taking Northern Ireland forward there is a real danger that despite the best intentions, they will be left behind and further isolated because no one will understand why there are groups within loyalism that still cling to an armed past.&#147;Last week&#146;s declaration by the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando that they will end paramilitary activity was welcome. Guns, drugs and crime have no place within a community whose people want the best for their families and the best for their community core values. I want loyalism to play a full part in the new Northern Ireland and a full part in the shared future, as we should all want it to do, because loyalism, anchored to peace, the rule of law and democracy, has an honourable place in that future.&#147;Northern Ireland has changed immeasurably since direct rule was introduced in 1972, the year that, as a student, I first visited. Apart from anything else, Northern Ireland is fast becoming a multi-cultural, multi-faith and forward-looking community, evidenced by the election of Anna Lo as the first person of Chinese origin in Europe to become a member of a legislative body: for Northern Ireland a first, just like the first civil partnership ceremony anywhere in the UK. This is all part of the shared future.&#147;The whole process demonstrates what relentless attention by government and persistent negotiations, regardless of crises, collapses and depressing stalemates, can achieve. This must give hope to those trying to resolve conflicts the world over. For generations the politics of Northern Ireland has been sometimes a murderous zero-sum game of winners and losers. Yesterday saw an end to that. Whatever the challenges that lie ahead, they will be played out on the field of politics and democracy.&#147;The MLAs who came together in Parliament Buildings yesterday, amidst a joyous mood of reconciliation, carry the hopes and aspirations of a people who have yearned for peace, stability and prosperity and have waited so terribly long to see it. I know that the whole House will support all those as we enter this new and exciting era&#148;.My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

The fact that we are here we owe to a large number of people&#151;many politicians, perhaps starting with John Major; John Hume from the SDLP; Secretaries of State from various Governments, including my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew and my noble friend Lord Brooke, who are in their places; the Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has kept Northern Ireland problems at the top of his agenda for 10 years; his counterpart in the Republic, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern; and many others. Many others of similar ilk from other nations have also committed themselves to the problems of Northern Ireland well beyond the call of duty. However, the frontline has been held throughout by the RUC GC, the PSNI, our soldiers and the solid courage, determination and pragmatism of the population of Northern Ireland. I sincerely hope that the sacrifices that have been made by all those people in order that we may arrive at where we are today will not be wasted in future.</p>

<a name="70509-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="070509115000005"></a>As the Secretary of State&#146;s Statement indicated, the world must understand that there is still considerable unfinished business in Northern Ireland. Does the Minister not agree with me that a full decommissioning rather than a statement is required from all the loyalist paramilitaries? Serious crime and guns must be got under control. The Province must no longer be a home for that form of crime. Is the Minister aware that the Provisional IRA is still a proscribed organisation to which Her Majesty's Government are preparing to devolve the criminal system? I suggest that that is not in any way logical, and some thought needs to go into that.</p>

<a name="70509-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="070509115000006"></a>Now is the time to remember all those who have lost loved ones in the past 30 years and especially the families associated with the 2,000 unsolved murders. What is Her Majesty's Government&#146;s strategy in relation to the past? Does the noble Lord agree that in relation to all inquiries into the past a line must soon be drawn in the sand?</p>

<a name="70509-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="070509115000007"></a>The people of Northern Ireland will continue to require help and leadership for time to come in coming to terms with the past. The Secretary of State may have been fortunate enough to have closed a winning innings and carried his bat but he and Her Majesty's Government still have plenty of diligent and difficult work to do for the future of the Province.</p>

<a name="70509-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="070509115000008"></a>I and my party&#151;and I am sure all noble Lords&#151;wish all concerned in the government of Northern Ireland good luck and good fortune.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="070509115000010"></a>Of course, yesterday was a truly historic day, although the word historic will be overworked in describing it. There is not really a word &#147;superhistoric&#148;, but that is what it was. Restoring devolution was absolutely vital.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1481"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="070509115000011"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, there are many debts that we in this House should acknowledge to those who helped to bring this about. It is quite true that it began first with John Major&#146;s Administration and the role played by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, when he was Secretary of State. It continued apace, though with fits and starts.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="070509115000012"></a>When Stormont was suspended in 2002 it was, as I predicted at the time, a long suspension. The longer it went on the more difficult it was to see how it would be restored, but it has been. We should acknowledge, as I have said before, the importance of the &#147;ABC&#148; trio; Mr Ahern, Mr Blair and Mr Clinton. I was privileged to be working in Northern Ireland at the time and never in the world&#146;s history has so much head of government pressure been applied to such a relatively small place.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="070509115000013"></a>I have one quibble with the Statement. My former student the Secretary of State said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="070509115000256"></a>&#147;Indeed, who would have imagined that, as of today, of all the devolved Administrations, Northern Ireland would have the only settled Government in place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000249"></a>That is not the whole story; Northern Ireland has a plethora of government and a miniscule bit of opposition, which Ms Anna Lo will have to take on with her Alliance Party. In Scotland and Wales we have a plethora of opposition and not much government. That is a good exam question for the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, to ask his students to discuss in the summer.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="070509115000014"></a>More seriously we have the issue of the loyalist paramilitaries decommissioning, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said. It is vital that the Government press ahead with that. I am sure that the Minister will be able to reassure us on that point.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="070509115000015"></a>When plan A was touch and go, we were discussing plan B; that Northern Ireland business in this House would no longer be dealt briefly. With regard to reserve powers, I hope that the Government will stick to that commitment and that we will not have Northern Ireland legislation or reserve powers by way of Order in Council. We should be able to devise a system. The reserve powers will be important; they are not trivial. We must have a mechanism in this House for properly considering them. Other than that, it is a great day for Northern Ireland and we must wish it well.</p>
<a name="time_16"></a>

I do not disagree with anything that has been said but it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail. Clearly, we want decommissioning. There is no role for paramilitaries. There is no means of taking society forward and bringing about a normal civil society other than through the rule of law and allegiance to democracy. That applies to all paramilitaries who retain their weapons and are outside the agreements. Work will continue to attempt to bring about full decommissioning.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="070509115000017"></a>The Statement referred to the Good Friday agreement. Both noble Lords made the point that  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1482"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there is no one Government who can claim credit for this. The agreement came about because the land had been fertilised some years previously by other Ministers and Administrations. There is no question about that. There may have to be a line drawn in the sand at some time, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, but to the best of my knowledge the historical inquiries team is financed and is in place and will continue with its very important work.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="070509115000018"></a>As for Northern Ireland business in this House and the other place, I have been under the impression, perhaps falsely, that it will drop off. We will not get all the detailed legislation relating to Northern Ireland domestic issues wrapped up in an Order in Council with no ability properly to scrutinise. Frankly, that is what Assembly Members are paid to do and have been elected to do. I imagine that they will start legislating fairly soon. The reserved issues will be the normal flow that is reserved for the devolved Administrations. I cannot see any reason why Northern Ireland should be different from the others. There is the boast about having settled government in Northern Ireland but that is because of the clear power-sharing arrangements, which are set in statute&#151;that is not the case with Scotland and Wales. </p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="070509115000019"></a>This is the beginning of a new era and we must be positive and look to the future. All the parties at the negotiating table can walk away and say that they have gained something from the process; all the people of Northern Ireland can certainly claim that they have gained something from this. It is very important that that is the case; people have made sacrifices&#151;many made the ultimate sacrifice&#151;and no one wants that to have been in vain. This therefore has to work; we do not conceive of a return to direct rule.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="070509115000020"></a>This is a new era of hope, peace and stability for Northern Ireland&#151;it is the end of more than 30 years of direct rule and the start of genuine devolution. It will not all be easy; there will be lots of problems and it is very important that we in Westminster give what help we can. As both noble Lords said, other parties, in this country and abroad, assisted in bringing people to the table. It will not help those people who came to the table if everyone else now walks away and says, &#147;You are on your own&#148;.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="070509115000021"></a>The reserved matters are basically in the fields of policing and criminal justice&#151;the Secretary of State retains responsibility; those matters are not devolved. Section 85 of the 1999 Act contains a power to make Orders in Council for such matters and, where it is appropriate&#151;I emphasise that&#151;that is likely to be used. Unlike the procedure that operated during the suspension of the Assembly, Section 85 requires that the draft on which the Assembly is formally consulted is laid at Westminster. In other words, no more legislation will come here, even as Orders in Council, that has not been consulted on by the democratically elected Assembly in Northern Ireland. That is very important. Only once that consultation takes place will the final order be laid at Westminster.</p>

What happened this week is an important milestone in terms of legislation that was put through this House on the promise that those effects would follow once the Assembly was restored; that, of course, will happen.</p>

We all have our memories and recognise the time that this has taken. The Government rightly made it clear in the Statement that the principle of consent is at the core of the agreements that have been reached; that is, Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1985. Some of us will have some sadness that it has taken 23 years to achieve this position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="070509115000024"></a>In being conscious of the more violent times with which I was involved, one recognises that there were then fewer peace walls in Northern Ireland than there are now. The challenge that still remains is to get, from the goodwill and happiness that was apparent yesterday in Stormont among the people, a real understanding and a real change of attitude right through Northern Ireland; that can only be in the best interests of everyone there.</p>

<a name="70509-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="070509115000025"></a>If I had a criticism of the Statement, it is that a tribute is missing: we are here now because, above all, of the fortitude and courage of the people of Northern Ireland, of all communities, who were determined not to let violence win in the end. Although the security forces and many very brave people played a tremendous part, if the communities had not in the end been determined to make life go on, and to carry on in the face of some appalling outrages, there would not have been this settlement. I hope that this is a triumph for the people of Northern Ireland and I wish them every success in the future.</p>

The noble Lord is absolutely right: this is because of what has happened&#151;the vast majority of people of Northern Ireland carried on with as normal a life as they possibly could. Local government continued to function, with 580 councillors being elected and representing their communities. It was important that that infrastructure was kept in place to show people that there was a future and another way of living in a civil society. It is now for the people of Northern Ireland to take forward that success. I repeat, while all the help and assistance will be provided, trust must still be built and won, so that the peace walls can disappear&#151;because they will not disappear until there is that trust. That will be the real test of the success.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord King, is quite right: people took real opportunities then and a number of my friends were killed at that time, simply because they were doing what they thought was right. So a lot of foundations were laid for this. In one sense that is good, and it is good that we got to where we did yesterday. But we should not disguise the fact that we still have a very segregated community in Northern Ireland, both in housing and in education. The only area that is not segregated is the workforce, because that is against the law. There is a lot of hard work for us to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="070509115000028"></a>Part of the Statement was critical of the loyalist paramilitaries. I would press the Minister and the Secretary of State not to let that drop. The IRA was pursued because it was given a carrot to be in government. In that sense, there is nothing to be offered to the loyalist paramilitaries, and I hope to God that money will not be offered to them&#151;I would be seriously opposed to that. However, I hope that the pressure on them will be kept up. I live in a community that is run by paramilitaries; I know what goes on there and I know that we cannot afford to allow it to continue. I wish that everyone could have been as happy as the people in Stormont were yesterday, but many still live under the jackboot of people who know no better than to torture their own community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="070509115000029"></a>Looking at yesterday and all the things that have happened, we have come down a long road. I must be frank; I never thought that I would see what happened yesterday. I am grateful, but there is hard work ahead. If we thought that the past years of the peace process were tough, the next five to 10 years will be very tough for Northern Ireland. Over the past30 years we have been used to having money thrown at us by everyone, just to keep us quiet. We do not have that excuse anymore and we cannot come along and say, &#147;Please give us money, because of the Troubles&#148;. We are a normal society now, and that will mean tremendously hard work for everyone in Northern Ireland, not just for our politicians.</p>

I remind my noble friend, who was a Member of Parliament with me during the 1970s and 1980s, that it was regarded as virtually the end of one&#146;s political career in almost any party to be given Front-Bench responsibility for Northern Ireland. One of the people who had such responsibility, the noble Lord, Lord Prior&#151;then Jim Prior, MP&#151;took an action that was profoundly important, by signing the Anglo-Irish agreement. That was a recognition that only by the two Governments acting together could we solve this problem. It is absolutely right that we respect every person who fought against the violence in Northern Ireland, including our own troops, but the contributions made by politicians at that time, including the noble Lord, Lord Prior, were very important in taking matters forward. There is no way in which we can thank everyone involved, but there is a way in which we can learn from the problems and take that forward. What has happened over the past few years has been deeply encouraging and, at times, quite moving. Everyone has compromised and, perhaps most important, no one has lost. Ultimately, the people of Northern Ireland have won.</p>

In response, my noble friend made a point about drawing a line in the sand and not having more investigations such as the inquiry into&#151;although he did not actually refer to it&#151;Bloody Sunday. However, in responding, the Minister said that the investigation teams were all in place. I had a frisson of horror about that and thought, &#147;My goodness, how many more Bloody Sunday inquiries are we going to get?&#148;. Would it not be better if, over the next few years, we worked to get agreement on all sides that the past is the past and that today is the first day of the rest of our lives? I say, advisedly, that not doing so has been the problem of Ireland since the 17th century, and we really do not want to carry on like that. I just hope that there is no implied agreement that there will be a lot more of these inquiries.</p>

In no way was I implying that. We have just had debates in this House about some legislation that is currently in the other place and will come back here. We were discussing the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the issue of retrospectivity or going back. The whole point about wanting the people of Northern Ireland to look forward is so that they are not constantly living in the past. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is right that at some point a line will have to be drawn in the sand. That will come from the economic and social success of Northern Ireland, which will then rebuild the trust. Once the trust is there, demands for digging up the past will diminish.</p>

While there is a reprise of the history and a celebration of the present and the success that has been achieved&#151;and well achieved&#151;and while tributes are being appropriately paid, I hope that that does not mean that your Lordships&#146; House and the other place will simply heave a sigh of relief and feel that it is now possible to put Northern Ireland out of sight and out of mind. There is still work to be done, attention to be paid and encouragement to be given for betterment, without which there is always the possibility that untoward events will begin to unstitch the situation. Does the Minister agree with me that we must celebrate this, but that we must not feel that it is an opportunity&#151;even once devolution of justice and policing takes place&#151;to put Northern Ireland and its people out of sight and out of mind, as they are not yet out of trouble?</p>

Devolution of the 11 ministries has taken place and locally elected politicians will make the decisions, but more devolution will come at the appropriate time. As the noble Lord implied, in the50 years, the reluctance to interfere probably lasted too long. I remember representations to my former Member of Parliament, Chris Price, in the early 1960s&#151;1964 or 1965&#151;when people were unhappy about what was happening. Things were allowed and one would say that it was local democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="070509115000043"></a>However, Northern Ireland cannot be put out of sight, as all could be lost. It would not be right, for those who have made sacrifices, to turn a blind eye and to say, &#147;The situation is now settled so get on with it&#148;. That would be wholly unfair and inconsistent. There will be much crossing over of the boundaries in the kind of civic society that has been built in Northern Ireland. There is much that we, in Great Britain, can learn from the people of Northern Ireland, and vice versa. It is very important to get across the message that they are not on their own and that they are part of a whole. Whether it is the south or Westminster, it is important to provide help and sustenance to the democratic framework, within the rule of law and with principles of a shared future.</p>

From the very first dramatic moments of the fall of Stormont until now, and no doubt into the future, the civil servants have been the most wonderful, dedicated and courageous people in maintaining government, as the Minister has rightly said, through the very worst times and now, we hope, through the very best of times.</p>

Over the years, the direct-rule Ministers have encountered difficulties, but in the past decade, since the ceasefire, things have been fairly cushy. As people in the Chamber understand, it was far more difficult before. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, is quite right to say that, throughout all the Troubles, the government of Northern Irelandhas continued. There were six departments, or11 departments, and the 24,000 or so civil servants administered matters that in some ways were done partly by local government. Nevertheless, they undertook the normal, run-of-the-mill administration of the health service, the roads and so on. That was all done by the Civil Service under enormous pressures and sometimes without the guidance that they would wish to have had from training; they were not trained to take decisions. Direct-rule Ministers were not there every day of the week, so they had to rely on common sense and good governance arrangements. We should certainly pay tribute to the Northern Ireland Civil Service. I am very glad that the noble Lord has done that.</p>

When I was a Minister in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board conducted a market survey in the Republic to find out, first, how many people had visited Northern Ireland in the previous 25 years; secondly, how many people would be prepared to contemplate spending a night in Northern Ireland; and, finally, how many would not go to Northern Ireland under any circumstances. The answer to the first question was about 25 per cent; to the second about 25 per cent; and to the third about 50 per cent. Perhaps I may suggest that actions speak louder than words and Members of your Lordships&#146; House could contribute to their vote of confidence and interest in the Province by paying a private visit over the next12 months to see how everyone is getting on.</p>

Northern Ireland is hosting international conferences on a very regular basis now. The people who visit Northern Ireland see a skyline of cranes, building activity and investment. I have to say that not enough of it comes from the private sector, and therefore the economy must seriously be attended to, but the inflow of people&#151;who are coming not only to learn but also to understand the joy of Northern Ireland and its countryside&#151;is enormous compared to what it was. Yesterday can only add to that. I fully endorse what the noble Lord said.</p>

It is a beautiful place, and I have many friends there. It is in many ways a buoyant country, and has been buoyant for a number of years. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it does not need to take off now because it has taken off, but not, until now, in politics. In every other way, it is a buoyant community. I endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, suggested. It is a place where one should go not just because one should, but because it is a super place to go and one from which one would benefit from going. If anyone has not yet been there, do go!</p>

I have gone back voluntarily; I think I was the first direct-rule Minister ever to go on a weekend when I was not on duty. It caused consternation because the people who looked after me said that there was already someone on duty. I had gone over to support the game fair, privately in many ways. The noble Baroness is quite right that Northern Ireland is an enormously joyous place to visit. It can only succeed following yesterday. It is not all about money and investment, but the fact is that it has lower unemployment rates than most of Great Britain. Things have really changed during the past few years. If anyone had any doubts about that, yesterday should put the final seal on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="070509115000054"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, enlargement is one of the weightiest issues facing the European Union today. Developments since this report was published confirm and reinforce some important arguments and conclusions in it. Today&#151;Europe Day&#151;we can reflect on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January and on current disquieting developments in Turkey. Efforts to agree a road map for reform of EU institutions continue to be relevant to our conclusions on the pace and scope of future enlargements. I shall refer to these developments again.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="070509115000055"></a>I thank most sincerely all members of the committee at the time for the immense energy and expertise they dedicated to this long and comprehensive inquiry. We were aided admirably by our specialist adviser, Dr Katinka Barysch, an internationally recognised expert on this subject, and we are indebted also to Professor Anand Menon for his input. I also thank warmly Simon Burton, the Clerk, and Sarah Price, at that time the second Clerk to the Committee, who managed the inquiry with great skill and produced a draft of the typically high standard that we associate with our Clerks. I also take this opportunity to thank the Government for their comprehensive and thoughtful response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="070509115000056"></a>Enlargement has been an integral part of the EU&#146;s development over the past 50 years, and widening and deepening have always proceeded in parallel. The accession of Denmark, Ireland and the UK heralded the introduction of structural funding; that of Greece, Portugal and Spain, the building of the single market and the planning of monetary union; and that of Austria, Finland and Sweden, serious efforts towards a common foreign and security policy. Then in 2004, eight central and eastern European countries  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1490"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plus Cyprus and Malta came in. Was this the point at which public support for further widening and deepening began to weaken? Was that one of the messages that the French and Dutch voters sent when, 13 months later, they rejected the constitutional treaty, and, if so, why?</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="070509115000057"></a>Our inquiry aimed to establish whether, to quote the title of the report, further enlargement would thus pose greater threats than opportunities. To do that we first assessed past enlargements, especially of 2004, to illuminate current attitudes towards further enlargement. That in turn meant looking at what we call integration capacity and the debate concerning the future borders of the European Union. This involved a detailed look at candidates and potential candidates for membership, which then led us to consider the possible alternatives to enlargement and, crucially, the probable costs of not enlarging.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="070509115000058"></a>What evidence did we find? On balance, the Union has coped well with growing membership. The 2004 enlargement in particular&#151;the biggest in the EU&#146;s history&#151;has brought benefits to all members because the prospect and process of accession, exporting the EU&#146;s brand values of democracy, human rights, openness and accountability, helped to transform so many former communist states into pluralist democracies and liberal economies. As Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reminded us,</p>
<ul><a name="070509115000262"></a>&#147;the process of accession triggered a major democratic and economic transformation without a single bullet being fired&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70509-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="070509115000059"></a>Yet future enlargement faces a major obstacle: lack of public support in western Europe, combined with a hostile or ambiguous stance by many political leaders in member states. Why, for example, did France change its constitution to make any accession after Croatia subject to a national referendum, with all the chances of negative results? We found that attitudes towards enlargement remain fluid, influenced as they are by unrelated developments such as economic growth as well as lack of information. Little attempt has been made to explain the benefits that enlargement has brought. Misunderstandings about the impact of past enlargements, especially that of 2004, have stimulated public opposition to future enlargements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="070509115000060"></a>Member states&#146; Governments, parliamentarians and other opinion-formers, and the European Commission, must do much more to explain the impact of enlargement to Europe&#146;s citizens, including issues such as migration, the link between enlargement and globalisation, and the need to find a way of living harmoniously with different religious communities. They must recognise that economic insecurity and employment are uppermost in citizens&#146; minds when evaluating EU policies, and that a full 40 per cent feel that enlargement has been bad economically for their countries and for the EU as a whole.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="070509115000061"></a>Our expert evidence almost unequivocally states that enlargement, acting as a catalyst of economic dynamism and modernisation, has helped the economies of both old and new member states to better face the challenges of globalisation. Much of the economic impact had begun to be felt in the early 1990s as the  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1491"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aspirant states prepared for acceptance as official candidates through the gradual demolition of trade and investment barriers, and with the adoption of the acquis communautaire benefiting business. The economic change induced by enlargement has been absorbed smoothly, without disruptive impacts on either product or labour markets.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="070509115000062"></a>There is also little disagreement among the economists that higher immigration levels boost the aggregate performance of the economy, raisingthe supply of labour, filling jobs that are difficult to fill, lifting demand as migrants spend money and boosting output. More than half a million nationals from the latest new member states have registered for work in the United Kingdom. While this has of course put some strain on public services in some areas, there is no statistical evidence that migrant workers from new EU member states mean increased benefit applications.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="070509115000063"></a>Many of the post-enlargement flows have been temporary. More than half of those registering for work in the UK intend to stay for less than three months&#151;a proportion that has been climbing since the early days of enlargement. According to the Institute of Public Policy Research, there are signs that the early movers are starting to return home, having saved money and learnt new skills and languages. Meanwhile, arrivals from the three Baltic states&#151;together the second largest group of migrants after the Poles&#151;have fallen dramatically as economic conditions in their countries have steadily improved. This is the kind of message that member states&#146; Governments need to get out to citizens, to counteract lack of information and misinformation.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="070509115000064"></a>On the impact of the 2004 enlargement on the EU&#146;s institutions, the increased number of member states and the concomitant wider spread of interests and positions have made aspects of EU decision-making more laborious and time-consuming. That said, most witnesses felt that the EU was working rather smoothly. Earlier suggestions that enlargement could lead to institutional gridlock are not borne out by the evidence.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="070509115000065"></a>Yet it may be too early to come to any hard and fast conclusions about impact on the institutions. The larger states may see the institutions as working mainly in the interests of the smaller members and would thus prefer informal decision-making outside them. The larger members already co-ordinate their positions before Council meetings, especially on foreign policy. That inevitably reinforces the broader trend towards more variable geometry, towards the use of enhanced co-operation. Voting weight in the three institutions also clearly needs to be sorted out before any further enlargement to take in, for example, the western Balkan states after Croatia.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="070509115000066"></a>What further lessons did we draw for future enlargement? First, an official date for accession announced too early in the process does not sustain momentum for reform and the EU&#146;s leverage is diminished. A day should be set only when the negotiations are almost complete and the EU is satisfied that the candidate can assume the  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1492"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>obligations of membership. This year&#146;s enlargement makes that point very clearly.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="070509115000067"></a>A second lesson is that new members must not bring disputes into the EU. Countries with outstanding questions of border delineation, separatism or integration of ethnic minorities must settle them before membership. For example, the final status of Kosovo must be resolved before Serbia can expect to enter the EU, as do Bosnia and Herzegovina&#146;s statehood and governance.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="070509115000068"></a>In that respect, one is bound to ask whether it was wise that Cyprus, still a divided island, following the Government&#146;s rejection of the Annan plan for reunification, should have been admitted. I should mention that the high commission of Cyprus expressed to me its concern that what were intended as geographical references in our report had proved capable of interpretation in a more political sense. I replied that I regretted that.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="070509115000069"></a>A third lesson is that conditionality needs to be used in a consistent and credible way. The 2004 big bang enlargement rather undermined the credibility of conditionality because not all were at the same level of preparedness. A country must join only when the conditions have been met. The fourth lesson is that in monitoring accession preparations, the emphasis needs to be shifted from mere adoption of EU-conforming laws to implementation and enforcement. That lesson appears to have been learned with the recent introduction of benchmarking. In certain areas, Croatia has to provide evidence that it is applying EU law before negotiations on the relevant chapter can be opened or closed.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="070509115000070"></a>Our report addresses the difficult question of absorption capacity, which we now call integration capacity, and the question of whether a final boundary needs soon to be drawn around the Union. As the Maastricht treaty gives any European country the right to apply for membership, any attempt to draw a final boundary that excludes European countries would not be consistent with the treaty. Moreover, it will be politically undesirable for the EU to attempt to define its final boundaries, as that would weaken its ability to encourage positive change by potential candidates.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="070509115000071"></a>What of the political context for future enlargement? First, a larger EU will need institutional change and more efficient decision-making procedures, together with a rebalancing of the respective representation of large and small countries. Without those changes, the EU will not be able to grow and continue to function effectively. Sensible and functionally oriented improvements to the working practices of the Union, as set out in our report, could be dealt with in a new intergovernmental conference, as also recommended in our report, which we hope will now take place in time for changes to be made before the European Parliament elections and the formation of the new Commission in 2009.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="070509115000072"></a>We next looked at the options for achieving more flexible ways of making policy in a Union of 27 or more members. We rejected the idea of a &#147;core Europe&#148;, as proposed by Chirac, Sarkozy and Verhofstadt, and we are happy that Germany is  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1493"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against an idea which we concluded was unfeasible and undesirable. Of course, variable geometry in the form of enhanced co-operation as provided for in the Amsterdam and Nice treaties could, as we conclude in our report, be the method increasingly relied on in an expanding Union. That is no bad thing. Although variable geometry has not so far been formally employed, it exists de facto in, for example, opt-outs, Schengen and the eurozone. But any enhanced cooperation must be transparent, properly publicised, and open to all to participate. It must not endanger existing achievements such as the single market, and democratic accountability must be ensured.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="070509115000073"></a>The financial cost of future enlargement is not easy to forecast. The current 80 per cent of the budget for the common agricultural policy and structural funds will not change fundamentally during the 2007-13 financial perspective, but the budget review of 2008-09, intended to point the way to, inter alia, a radical restructuring of spending, must take into account the possible impact of future accessions. The western Balkan aspirant states are already receiving a great deal of EU aid, so the extra cost of accession should be modest, and there is reason to hope that Turkey&#146;s continuing rapid expansion of its economy will diminish any demand for regional aid if and when it accedes.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="070509115000074"></a>If the countries of the western Balkans are to be able to address their many challenges in terms of economic reform, statehood and the integration of minorities, they must be offered a credible EU perspective. We made commitments to their eventual accession at Thessaloniki and we must keep them, however long the road may be for some, if not all of them. I invite noble Lords to read the convincing evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, on that perspective. I add that in the western Balkans, the EU is dealing with more fragile and fractious countries than any that came in in 2004. The EU therefore needs a more proactive approach, devoting sufficient expertise and money and finding ways to maintain momentum for positive change over the extended accession process.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="070509115000075"></a>Since our report was published, the Commission has decreed that, as we had urged, negotiations with Croatia and Turkey no longer be linked. Croatia has made good progress but there are still areas needing more, such as public administration, the judicial system and some branches of industry, and more needs to be done to implement the anti-corruption programme. That said, the European Parliament has specified 2009 as the date by which it should give its assent to Croatia's accession, even though the Commission stands by the Council's decision not to set any target dates.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="070509115000076"></a>We examined objectively and extensively the pros and cons of Turkish membership. Our findings are in paragraphs 205 to 225. We concluded that it is in both Turkey's and the EU's best interests that the accession negotiations, whatever the hesitation and hostility hanging over them, be pursued in good faith and with a will to bring them to a successful conclusion.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1494"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="070509115000077"></a>Noble Lords will recall that last December's General Affairs and External Relations Council agreed that eight of the 35 chapters of the acquis will not be opened until Turkey implements the Ankara protocol extending its customs union to the 10 new members of the EU, including Cyprus. Our report also insists that the economic isolation of the Turkish community in Northern Cyprus be ended. Turkey's accession, we argue, is of such strategic importance to the long-term development of the wider Europe that the Cyprus question must not be allowed to derail the accession talks.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="070509115000078"></a>Turkey has made significant progress on reforms&#151;another good example of the power that the prospect of EU accession can have. But much remains to be done, not least on human rights and freedom of expression. The current crisis over the election of a new president, which we hope may soon be resolved, reminds us once again of the propensity of the army to intervene in politics, a practice wholly incompatible with EU membership. In Turkey, there has been a sharp fall in public support for EU membership, and the efforts of those who want membership are frustrated not just by Turkey&#146;s internal problems, but also by negative views from many European players. As one pro-EU Turkish commentator put it over the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="070509115000257"></a>&#147;Frankly, Sarkozy&#146;s election is the last nail in the coffin of Turkey&#146;s relationship with the EU&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000250"></a>Yet Commission President Barroso has just said that the Commission's position is that negotiations should continue. In my view, so they should.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="070509115000079"></a>Last, we looked at possible alternatives to enlargement and at the cost of not enlarging. The EU needs to work with countries that have no immediate or even medium-term prospect of membership, and its European neighbourhood policy is a promising start, although it has had little impact so far. For the purposes of bringing about positive change in participating countries, its incentives are not attractive enough, its conditionality is not tough enough, and its policies not tailor-made enough for the different countries.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="070509115000080"></a>The EU rightly aims to integrate non-members into its single market and let them take part in selected EU policies. The combination of variable geometry among members and growing association and integration with non-members could blur the boundaries of membership. That would be no bad thing. A &#147;fortress Europe&#148; would be.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="070509115000081"></a>Some European politicians advocate a &#147;privileged partnership&#148; for EU neighbours as an alternative to further enlargement. Turkey, for one, would never accept that. With its customs union, it already has a privileged partnership. In the western Balkans, a privileged partnership would be seen, according to the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, as,</p>
<ul><a name="070509115000263"></a>&#147;closing the door on them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000251"></a>We agree. EU Governments should stop talking about privileged partnerships. It can only demotivate candidate countries.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="070509115000082"></a>When thinking about the costs of not enlarging, we had to distinguish between countries that have been told that they qualify for membership and those that  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1495"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have not. The political costs would obviously be much larger in the former. Remember the commitments at Thessaloniki. We must recognise that the EU 27 are surrounded by an arc of instability ranging from Russia through Belarus, Ukraine, the potentially explosive Caucasus and Balkan regions, to the war zones of the Middle East. So the EU&#146;s toughest task in future years could well be dealing with the challenges in its own neighbourhood. Take away the prospect of EU membership, however distant, and the incentive to change and embrace the EU&#146;s brand values in neighbouring countries may disappear with it.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="070509115000083"></a>Our witnesses&#151;policy-makers present and past, economists, diplomats, commentators and many other experts&#151;almost unanimously agree that the 2004 enlargement was a success on which the EU now has to build to make it more manageable. Governments have to explain better to their citizens what the real benefits have been and can continue to be; to show, for example, that migration, if properly managed, has been a plus can remove many unfounded fears. In the interests of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe, we must keep the door open to further enlargement and welcome the candidacy of any European state that shows itself capable of meeting the conditions. That is the essential message of our report.</p>

<a name="70509-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="070509115000084"></a>The gains of enlargement have so far measurably outweighed the pains and we believe that they will continue to do so. I beg to move.</p>

He has spoken tonight in a way that, as all noble Lords will agree, showed great competence, thoroughness and looking at all the different angles involved in the question of how far membership of the European Union should go. It is a privilege to follow him on this subject.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="070509115000087"></a>The report is indeed competent and thoughtful. We noted with satisfaction the growth in the economies of the countries that have recently joined the EU. That is well catalogued in some of the appendices to our report. We appreciated the expectations of Bulgaria and Romania. When we were investigating they were still two or three months away from joining, but it was clear how much they were looking forward to and preparing for it. But, when we turn to further enlargement, that was the difficult part of the report. We considered countries that used to be members of the Soviet Union; for example, Ukraine. We considered Croatia and the other Western Balkan countries and of course we considered Turkey, the most difficult of all. Was the EU, already 


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1496"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>27 countries, biting off more than it could, in terms of administration and understanding by European people, reasonably chew? We came to the conclusion, as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, has just said, that the process for Croatia would certainly continue; accession talks were on the way. But if Croatia joined&#151;when Croatia joined, I should probably say&#151;it would not be possible then to exclude other western Balkan countries. In that we were helped and advised by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, who drew on his profound experience of the western Balkan countries. It was a great pleasure to listen to his advice on that subject.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="070509115000088"></a>For the Ukraine and the other ex-Soviet Union countries our conclusion was that that could wait; there was no one pressing at the door and therefore we did not have to hurry. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, has just said, Turkey was difficult. I make it covered in our report by three more paragraphs than the noble Lord; it is paragraph numbers 205 to 228 and it forms a large part of our report and of the appendices to it.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="070509115000089"></a>In summary, we believe that it is in both Turkey&#146;s and the EU&#146;s best interests that accession negotiations be progressed and should proceed. But six months have passed since our report was published and in that time Turkey has recently suffered difficulties about the future presidency. There is a rise of political Islam in Turkey and it is not clear how the Turkish people themselves intend at this stage to proceed to deal with that. Most of all, there has been the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, quoted one recent remark about him from a British newspaper; I should like to quote another. In its leader yesterday on the TV debate last week between Nicolas Sarkozy and S&#233;golène Royal the <I>Times</I> repeated comments that Sarkozy made in that debate. Sarzoky believes that Turkish membership of the European Union would spell,</p>
<ul><a name="070509115000264"></a>&#147;the death of political Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000252"></a>The <I>Times</I> added that it thought that that was mistaken judgment, but that that was Sarkozy&#146;s judgment. Equally, in the <I>Times</I> yesterday, a spokesman for Angela Merkel said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="070509115000258"></a>&#147;In what is one of the crucial phases for Europe, it is important to continue the close, trusting and intensive co-operation between Germany and France&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000253"></a>That surely means that we have to think carefully in Britain about what the next steps of our approach to the European Union should be. If there is to be a powerful alliance between France and Germany, between Chancellor Angela Merkel and the new president Nicolas Sarkozy, do we want to be part of that tripartite alliance or are we prepared to stand away from it, to be alone with some of the smaller countries but not in partnership with France and Germany? I suspect that this is a moment when Her Majesty&#146;s Government must pause and think carefully on what their next step should be.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="070509115000090"></a>The issues of reducing the number of areas subject to veto by a single country and of a modified but much simpler written constitution are ones that will be debated in the future whether we like it or not. I do not think that at this stage we are clear in our own

There is no harm in standing back and careful thinking at times. There is an old Latin tag: tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis&#151;times change and we have to change with them. Is that what our position should be at the moment? I hope that this is the moment when the Government will pause, take time and think out what the next movement is, and with an EU that I profoundly wish to see prospering, what the right steps should be.</p>

It is obviously useful that we should have a chance to celebrate what has been one of the real achievements of the European Union in this century, the fifth range of enlargement. I also want to say how much I welcomed the Government&#146;s response to our report because it picked up and in almost every respect agreed with the points made by the Select Committee. I regret, as the report does, that less was done in 2004 to reinforce not only in this country but throughout the whole of the European Union the remarkable achievement we had made in making sure that there was an enlargement first to the 10 countries and then to 12&#151;the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. To some extent, that enlargement in 2004, finalised by the addition of Bulgaria and Romania at the beginning of this year, marked the end of the 20th century. It was a significant point in the historical development of our continent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="070509115000092"></a>Despite its overall success I should like to say how much I agreed with two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, in his remarks about flaws in that enlargement. First, we may have made a mistake over Cyprus. Failing to ensure that it had solved its internal problems before entry may have been a mistake, but we have to remember that at the time the European Union was possibly faced with the risk of Greek action to prevent any enlargement unless Cyprus was allowed to come in. However, it was a very unsatisfactory solution, and, as we can see in the consequences for Turkish accession, we are suffering from the decisions we took at that time.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="070509115000093"></a>The second point made by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, with which I concur, concerned the mistake&#151;this applies particularly to the cases of enlargement to Bulgaria and Romania&#151;of fixing target dates. The announcement of target dates in advance removed the leverage the European Union would otherwise have had to ensure adequate judicial administrative reform before accession. Certainly, recent developments and instability in Romania&#146;s political structure since enlargement are worrying.</p>

We tend to think about the difficult countries, but there are four countries in Europe that would be very welcome if their people were prepared to look at membership. From time to time we hear from Norwegian and Icelandic politicians, occasionally even from a Swiss politician, who would argue that enlargement to them should be encouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="070509115000095"></a>Politically, the situation in the western Balkans has become probably more complex and more difficult than last year, when we were considering the countries en bloc in our report. I totally agree with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell: the Thessaloniki commitment of the European Union to the countries of the western Balkans must be maintained. We are pleased that Croatia is making such significant progress. The European Union Committee recently had an opportunity to hear the ambassador from Croatia, who was able to give us evidence of the progress being made. When we go beyond Croatia, however, we begin to find problems. I hope that the Minister will tell us why there has been a delay in opening negotiations with Macedonia, even though it was agreed that that country should have candidate status.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="070509115000096"></a>In two of the other smaller countries, things seem to be going somewhat better. The technical negotiations are complete on the stabilisation and association agreement with Montenegro, and Commissioner Rehn and the Prime Minister initialled it on 15 March 2007. It looks as if Montenegro is moving in the right direction. Similarly, although Albania has a long way to come and has a number of difficult internal political problems at the moment, there is slow but steady progress.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="070509115000097"></a>It is when we come to the remaining three countries in the western Balkans that we really have some difficulties. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the situation has probably slowed down since we considered the matter last year. A Government has still not been formed. There will be a replacement for Dr Schwarz-Schilling as High Representative, but there are still noises from Mr Dodic in Republika Srpska suggesting that he will want to see the knock-on effect of a Kosovo agreement. We should obviously continue to work with Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the progress will be slow. It is necessary that the option of membership is maintained.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="070509115000098"></a>Serbia, if anything, is more difficult. The domestic politics are depressing. The news yesterday that the parliament has elected a speaker from the Radical party suggested that the rather more democratic parties were not able to hang together even to choose a speaker for their parliament. It is a paradox: if there is a country in the western Balkans that, in terms of its administrative structure and economic readiness, could be a member and begin negotiations relatively quickly, it is Serbia. The stabilisation and association agreement is virtually negotiated. None the less, it is difficult to be optimistic, given the continued &#147;ambiguity&#148;, to be polite, of Serbian attitudes regarding General Mladic and the failure to deal seriously with those who are protecting him.</p>

I will not say too much about Kosovo because, even as we meet here, discussions are going on at the UN about a possible settlement. If agreement is not reached, however, that will again be a problem.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="070509115000100"></a>Turkey is much more difficult even than the western Balkans. I support the view in our report that we should look forward to the continuation and, we hope, the completion of negotiations with Turkey. Since we completed the report, however, I have become more aware of a need for us in this country to have a dialogue with our partners in other European countries trying to deal with the fears and misgivings that exist in other member states about Turkish membership. It is no use Britain just appearing as a country that is in favour of enlargement for enlargement&#146;s sake; we have to make the argument for why Turkish membership would be to the advantage of the European Union, and I am not sure we do that enough at the moment. We need to look at that.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="070509115000101"></a>I am less worried than some about the election of Nicolas Sarkozy. It is likely to be at least 10 years before Turkish negotiations are continued, and while some prime ministers remain for 10 years, many of them do not do so for much more than that. There may well be a different president of France in office when we come to the conclusion of the negotiations.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="070509115000102"></a>Here perhaps I am wrong, but I take a different view on the question of the current debate between the secularists and the political parties within Turkey. This is a dilemma in the development of Turkish democracy that is bound to occur, and needs to. The debate may be healthy for those in Turkey if they are able to work out a new and more appropriate balance&#151;at least, I would like to think so.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="070509115000103"></a>In our report we referred to the European neighbourhood policy, which is sometimes suggested as an alternative to membership of the European Union. It would be a mistake to see it in that way. In some countries&#151;those in North Africa, for example&#151;it is a sensible alternative, but for those who are European neighbours it should be seen as a situation where they can work, modernise, improve and perhaps adapt themselves so that they become valid candidates for membership. I believe that we could see, not necessarily in my lifetime but perhaps in the next 20 to 30 years, European Union membership for the Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. They should not be excluded, nor should they automatically be offered membership at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="070509115000104"></a>This is an important report. It points the way to a number of the areas of policy that we in this country have to take forward in the development of the Union in the years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="070509115000107"></a>The committee has undertaken a monumental and invaluable task. However, it is crucial that we should face up to the challenges and advantages which could accrue from the European Union&#146;s enlargement. Before saying anything else, I should declare an interest. I had the honour to be a European Commissioner from 1985 to 1989. In that respect, I owe a great deal to two Members of the House. The first being the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, who I met before taking office&#151;in 1984, I think&#151;when he had moved from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Cabinet Office. He later became a most successful Secretary-General of the European Commission. I also owe a great deal to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon. He displayed an unstinting interest in the Commission&#146;s activities, something which I could not say of all members of the then Conservative Government.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="070509115000108"></a>When the European Union was established, it was never intended to be a union of 12, still less of 27, or more, nations. However, it was designed&#151;and in this regard has succeeded&#151;to offer sound economic advice and, coupled with that, social progress. It stood for durable and strong values and ensured that Europe&#146;s voice was heard when and where it counted. </p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="070509115000109"></a>As I have said, the European Union has largely succeeded but it has inevitably also encountered failure. Its principal success has been to establish peace over a wide area, one in which war was, all too often, a debilitating factor. It has also played a vital part in bringing democracy to the lives of so many where dictatorship of the right or of the alleged left was often the order of the day.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="070509115000110"></a>Enlargement brings its own problems but it also has immense rewards, which are insufficiently voiced by those in power and, as a consequence, are not felt enough by the people living in the various countries of the European Union.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="070509115000111"></a>In contrast to Euro-sceptic views, the United Kingdom has enjoyed huge benefits in trade, exports and investment from other countries within and without the European Union, all of which have grown exponentially and that trend persists. The UK, together with Ireland and Sweden, has benefited enormously from large employment growth and has accrued immense advantages in the development of the single market. In that regard, I say, in passing, how much is owed to my then colleague, the late Lord Cockfield. In three months&#151;it took him only three months&#151;he went from being a Euro-sceptic of the highest, or, should I say, the lowest, order, to being a valued member of the Commission.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="070509115000112"></a>In tackling international crime, the UK has enjoyed co-operation from other countries, but this is especially marked between the UK and other EU members. The UK has fully participated in environmental schemes and has helped make Europe&#146;s contribution so much more meaningful. We face enormous challenges in that respect, especially regarding climate change. However, the leadership being shown by our country is of great value, not only to the European Union, but also more widely than that.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1501"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which we have heard a great deal in today&#146;s debate. Despite its abolition of the death penalty, improving the lot of women, the diminution of torture and many hard-won benefits, much more needs to be done. Turkey must guarantee the political and economic rights of Cyprus and, as far as I can judge, it has simply not done enough. My hope is that common sense will prevail, but in this important respect, we are entitled to expect that Turkey will exhibit its bona fides&#151;so far, alas, the auguries are not very benign. To this end, the report expresses the view, which I wholly endorse, that the UK should do whatever it can to ensure that Turkey plays its full part in bringing the negotiation to an honourable and successful conclusion. It can do no less. How will Turkey respond? We do not know the answer to that vital question. We can only hope.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="070509115000114"></a>Further enlargement is key to the EU&#146;s continued progress. However, I emphasise&#151;as does the report and the Government&#146;s response&#151;that this has to be a two-way process. It will never be easy to manage a union of 27&#151;perhaps more&#151;member states but the European Union&#146;s team, led by Mr. Barroso, is proving capable of achieving a great deal. As a country, we should actively participate in this endeavour and not simply snipe from the sidelines.</p>

Having sponsored a debate on Turkish membership of the Union in your Lordships&#146; House in December 2004, I wish to focus my brief remarks on that issue. As the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, stated, the report concludes in paragraph 293:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="070509115000259"></a>&#147;Whatever the hesitation and hostility hanging over Turkey&#146;s accession negotiations, we believe that it is in both Turkey&#146;s and the EU&#146;s best interests that the accession negotiations be pursued in good faith and with a will to bring them to a successful conclusion&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="070509115000116"></a>The report deals with all the pros and cons of Turkish membership and rejects the idea of a privileged partnership as an alternative to full membership. But let us suppose that the Cyprus issue is resolved, that Turkey manages to maintain its secular status and to meet the Copenhagen criteria, and that full membership is finally achieved at some moment in the future. The European Union will then be changed in three important respects.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="070509115000117"></a>With a population, by then, of around 100 million, Turkey will be the largest member of the Union, which will have all sorts of implications for management and voting strength. It will also have more Members of the European Parliament than Germany, France or the UK. Secondly, given free movement of labour, there will inevitably be a substantial migration from Turkey to the west, and thus a substantial increase in the Muslim population of existing member states. Thirdly, Turkey&#146;s geographical location takes the Union beyond the boundaries of Europe and links it more directly with the problems of the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="070509115000118"></a>These are major changes and involve huge uncertainties. It is easy to see why, for some, the risks outweigh the proposed benefits.

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="070509115000120"></a>In the early years of the EC and the EU, the approach to enlargement was appropriately cautious and gradual. Then came 2004 and the major addition, all in one go&#151;a grand slam, as some people called it&#151;of 10 new states. The increase in population, however, was relatively modest. But it was a tremendous breakthrough, particularly into countries of eastern Europe that had not long before been locked into the totalitarian regimes of the Soviet empire. That year was 15 years after the end of the Berlin Wall, giving those countries some limited exposure to democratic freedoms, the rule of law, economic liberalism and the enhancement of human rights.</p>

<a name="70509-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="070509115000121"></a>I am doubtful about some of the countries admitted in 2004, in terms of their adherence to the principles that I have just mentioned, and about the latest two countries to accede, in January 2007&#151;Bulgaria and Romania. I have graver doubts about further enlargement, particularly the enlargement covered by the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold. Somewhat contrary to the report, I believe that it is perhaps time for a pause&#151;a period of contemplation for the absorption process to demonstrate clearer adherence across the European Union as it exists to European values and more positive results from the enlargements of 2004 and 2007. One particular difficulty has been referred to by at least two speakers. It has even been suggested by those who very much favoured the 2004 enlargement that perhaps one aspect, affecting the island of Cyprus, may have been worsened by the accession to the European Union of Greek Cyprus only, so soon after the Greek rejection of the Annan plan for reunification of the island.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="070509115000122"></a>I should like to mention something which has not been specifically mentioned, although I recall references to the institutions of the EU needing some attention. Each of the new members, no matter how small, is entitled to an EU Commissioner. So the Baltic states have between them three Commissioners, while Britain and, for that matter, Germany and France, have only one each. If each of the Balkan states formerly comprising Yugoslavia were admitted to membership, they would have six or seven Commissioners between them. Even the greatest enthusiast for European Union enlargement would

Further enlargement of the European Union beyond the number we now have without institutional change regarding the number of Commissioners seems neither desirable nor credible.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="070509115000123"></a>Since about 2000, there has been a tremendous momentum favouring enlargement among those who wanted to join but were not members and among the existing members. However, there is a risk of it dissipating&#151;in other words, the enthusiasm of the original members of the EU may have lessened. To eastern Europe, it should be no surprise that accession has been seen as a desirable completion of the changes brought about by the end of the Berlin Wall. However, I am not sure&#151;and I think that some speakers would agree&#151;that the EU has been exacting enough in its conditions for membership. I would put it this way: assurances and promises from candidate countries seem to have been accepted as equivalents of actual change prior to the grant of membership of the EU. Basic freedoms and the rule of law are not adequately respected in some countries. As a small example, I am anxious that in Poland freedom of speech is somewhat at risk. Academics and journalists are being sent questionnaires about how far they co-operated with Poland&#146;s communist regime, which fell in 1990. Failure to complete those questionnaires results in the loss of their jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="070509115000124"></a>High-level corruption and organised crime in Romania and Bulgaria, our two latest adherents to the Union, continue to be a serious problem. A report in the <I>Financial Times</I> last month said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="070509115000260"></a>&#147;Several EU member states claim Commission officials have been told privately to not be too critical of the two countries, even though Bulgaria has a non-existent record for convictions for high-level corruption&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="070509115000125"></a>The report and my noble friend Lord Grenfell in opening the debate are surely right to say that the EU should not endorse target dates for EU entry in the future until it is fully satisfied that the candidate can assume the obligations of membership. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, referred to Turkey, which is on track to enter the EU by 2014. It could be 2017; it could be some later date. Aside from the particular problems of Cyprus, there are longer-term concerns about Turkish membership. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, referred to the anti-democratic threats of intervention by the army. That, of course, would not be the first intervention in recent years, but one of three or four. I am not sure whether that is the greatest worry or whether it is the other worry, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, which I would term influence on government of Islamist ideology despite the country&#146;s secularist constitution. It would not be a happy situation for the existing members of the EU if the new President of Turkey were to allow such ideology to influence the vital powers that he has to appoint judges, heads of universities and senior posts in the civil service.</p>

It is most important to stress the significance of those factors in establishing and retaining a common purpose, identity and culture for Europe that those who started it all off in 1957 would still recognise.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="070509115000127"></a>In my view, the European values set out in these documents should not be unduly stretched, like a piece of elastic, in the cause of pushing ahead and continuing almost relentlessly the momentum to enlargement of which I have spoken. Apart from other considerations, it is recognised by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and in the report that public opinion on these matters is problematic or, if the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, prefers, fluid. Too often the EU fails to carry public opinion with it on a number of matters and, as we all know, the institutional and policy changes necessary to accompany enlargement have not yet taken place. That is why I believe that a pause is desirable.</p>

I wish to comment on some aspects of the report. I had thought that I should be an odd man out today, but that has not proved to be the case.

Some people have taken the view that widening would lead to less deepening. I have always taken the view that widening is bound to lead to more deepening. That has been the case. The committee commented on current attitudes of the public to enlargement. The Government do not give the public enough credit for knowing what is going on. They feel that they need to explain the benefits of the EU and enlargement. When I have asked, &#147;What are the benefits?&#148; I have always been told by the Government that they are self-evident. Clearly, the Select Committee does not feel that that is the case. In this case, the Government agree with it and want to convince the people one way or another. One of the ways in which they could do so with regard to the policies of the EU is to produce a cost-benefit analysis.

Although the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, said that the general view is that immigration helps the economy to grow, and is beneficial to the economy, other people believe that that is simply not true; they believe that, when you take infrastructure costs, housing and what have you

There are different points of view among the public and they are aware of the difficulties.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="070509115000131"></a>The impact of previous enlargements has led to more centralisation&#151;an increase in powers. Already some 70 per cent of policy emanates from the European Union. I do not know how much more there will be. There are the present demands to bring back the EU constitution in one form or another to deal with the latest influx of new member states. These suggestions include a two-and-a-half-year presidency, a foreign minister, a legal personality and the relinquishment of most of the remaining vetoes. If those are brought about, that would be a serious deepening of the European Union and a huge increase in its powers and influence.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="070509115000132"></a>On costs, the committee points out that the budget review will have to take into account future enlargements. So it will. The committee refers to the fact that discussions will take place in 2008-09. What, I should like to know, will happen to our rebate during those discussions? That has been under attack for a very long time. The French in particular see 2009 as the date when Britain will lose its rebate, in part to finance future enlargements.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="070509115000133"></a>What about future enlargements? I have read the details in the report with some astonishment. Under the heading &#147;Candidates and potential candidates&#148;, the report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="070509115000261"></a>&#147;The Union could be faced with the stark choice between integrating ... or having to take responsibility for running them as protectorates&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000254"></a>Have you ever heard anything like that in modern times? It smacks of old-fashioned imperialism. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, gives me a look of disagreement, but we are talking about &#147;running them as protectorates&#148;. If that is not imperialism, I do not know what is.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="070509115000134"></a>We need to know the limits of enlargement. Are there any limits at all? The treaties referred to an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, but recent indications of government policy seem to envisage a much wider union embracing a geographical area beyond Europe. There are 13 possible entrants in Europe if Belarus and the former Soviet republics are included, but the present drive&#151;and we have heard about it in practically every speech tonight&#151;is to admit Turkey. Turkey is an Asian country. It has ancient roots and an ancient culture as well as an overwhelmingly Muslim population. By 2016, the target date for accession, the population of Turkey will be between 90 million and 100 million, as the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, pointed out. That would make it by far the largest country in the European Union&#151;far bigger than Germany, which is the largest country at present.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="070509115000135"></a>Turkey&#146;s accession would have enormous implications for the European Union and our own country would suffer from them. These profound implications are not being considered by Governments, let alone their populations. If Turkey is admitted, there will not be a

Make no mistake; you cannot get away from the geographical position of Turkey. It is an Asian country.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="070509115000136"></a>Furthermore, if we cross that Rubicon, once the precedent has been set, what is to stop further eastern expansion into Asia? How will the EU be able to refuse applications from countries such as Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan if Turkey is admitted? That would add a further population of 70 million to 80 million to the Union and bring additional problems, including the governance of such a diversity of peoples.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="070509115000137"></a>There is now talk of the EU&#146;s relationship with north Africa. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the newly elected French President, specifically mentioned north Africa in his speech following his election. Some people are arguing already that the colonial relationship of north Africa with many European countries gives it a superior claim to join the club than the likes of Turkey and other Asian countries.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="070509115000138"></a>We really ought to get down to defining the limits&#151;if there are any in the minds of Governments and others&#151;of EU expansion. If we do not, we will find ourselves facing unimaginable, insoluble problems and difficulties that could lead to a complete collapse of the whole edifice. The report is entitled, &#147;Enlargement of the EU: threat or opportunity?&#148;. I have made it clear that I believe it to be a threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="070509115000140"></a>When the 10 countries joined the EU, I felt quite emotional as I watched the ceremony in Dublin on television. It was an important occasion. Eight of the countries had been communist, living under a dictatorship, and had moved towards accepting the principles of freedom, democracy and market economies. That was an important and significant occasion. Joining the EU was one of the main aims of many countries under communism, because it was their chance to demonstrate their commitment to democracy, freedom and human rights. Some of the countries said, way back, that one benefit of wishing to join the EU was that changes that they wanted to make anyway had to be made a bit faster under persuasion from the EU. They thought that that was a good thing.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="070509115000141"></a>I welcome the British Government&#146;s positive attitude to enlargement and know that that stance has been much appreciated in the accession countries and others hoping to join the EU. I am aware that in many EU countries there is now less enthusiasm for enlargement; we see phrases such as absorption capacity, which has now been called integration capacity. We had a taste of that a minute ago from the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, whose remarks I will comment on as I go on.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1507"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="070509115000142"></a>One issue highlighted in the report is that public opinion in some countries in western Europe is not that enthusiastic about enlargement. However, I agree fully with the report&#146;s finding that the Governments of the EU have made far too little effort to bring their populations with them, to explain the arguments and the benefits of enlargement, and to try to win over public opinion. If there is no attempt by western Governments to persuade our voters and educate them about the benefits of EU membership and enlargement, of course the only voices that we will hear are those of the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart and Lord Pearson. That is to the detriment of the whole process, and I hope that EU Governments will be aware of what is happening.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="070509115000143"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that wider meant deeper. I am bound to say that that assertion has no argument to support it. Most of the people I have spoken to who do not want a deeper Europe welcome enlargement, because they see it as a way of widening the EU and of not going down the federal path, which I do not think any of us here particularly wants. But one cannot do that by arguing in terms of assertions; one has to prove a point.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="070509115000144"></a>One of the difficulties for the Turkish Government, who want to join the EU, is that the negative voices towards Turkey from many western European countries are having an adverse effect on public opinion in the country. It is hard for a Government to maintain enthusiasm for their policy of trying to join the EU in the fairly distant future, if their own public hear such negative expressions from here. I will say a little about economic benefits and some of the countries on the route to accession, and then turn to some of the arguments about how we might look ahead.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="070509115000145"></a>I am satisfied that there are massive economic benefits for this country in European enlargement. The ultimate test has to be: what is in the interests of this country? Clearly, however, there are also benefits to Europe as a whole, which I equally welcome. After all, 14,000 British firms export to central and eastern Europe. There has been a big increase in trade between Britain and the A10 countries. We have seen benefits in Britain in our economic growth, at least partly as a result of the movement of labour from some of the A8 countries. It is certainly clear that the three countries that opened their doors to labour movements from the A8 countries have seen larger economic growth than the other members of the EU. I know economists differ in their assessment of this, but I have seen estimates of up to 1 per cent of GDP growth being attributable to the beneficial effects of inward migration.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="070509115000146"></a>In turning to specific countries, I shall start with Poland, also referred to by my noble friend Lord Borrie. I was at a party at the Polish embassy to watch the referendum and, because it achieved more than 50 per cent, to celebrate its success and the fact that Poland would soon be a member of the EU. I was very enthusiastic. I say to Poland that, when her friends are dismayed by some of the things that are happening, we are dismayed as friends and people who have supported Polish entry for a long time.

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="070509115000147"></a>It is very sad that people who held out against the communist regime, people who were distinguished members of Solidarity, should now have to stand out against their Government because of what they are trying to do. I refer in particular to Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland&#146;s first non-communist Prime Minister, who has been dismissed from a particular committee; and Bronislaw Geremek, a former Foreign Minister, who has been threatened with losing his seat in the European Parliament. Why? Because they believe that the Polish Government are indulging in a witch hunt by making them sign statements when they have already been cleared. I am delighted that the European Parliament has come out in support of Mr Geremek. I am not clear whether the Polish Government are able to dismiss a member of the European Parliament, but the threat is there. It is not a happy policy to come from Poland. I hope that they will realise that it is against the spirit of human-rights-based policies that characterise the EU.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="070509115000148"></a>I turn now to Turkey. I was in Ankara a couple of months ago, where I was able to indulge in serious discussions with various people. I was, of course, critical of some of the things that are happening in Turkey. We should recognise the progress that Turkey has made. It is no good saying that we do not like what the army is doing and that it is not a good omen for the EU, if we do not, at the same time, realise that Turkey has made significant progress, is working very hard on this and wants to go on making progress. The people I spoke to were very keen on our understanding that they have made some progress, but they realise that they have some way to go.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="070509115000149"></a>It is clear that Turkey would not accept second-class status. They are a proud people and the idea, which some EU Governments might suggest, of having some sort of relationship with the EU is not acceptable; nor, indeed, would the countries of the western Balkans accept it.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="070509115000150"></a>Our report is clear about Cyprus, but it is important that this should not be allowed to halt the process of moving towards accession talks. We need to deal with Cyprus separately. The Turkish Government must take action on the commitments that they made some time ago. There also have to be moves on the part of the EU and the Cypriot Government. These difficulties can be overcome.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="070509115000151"></a>There are still difficulties over human rights and basic freedoms in Turkey. Article 301 of the constitution is a particular problem, but Ankara recognises that. We are all dismayed by the Turkish army&#146;s threat to the elected Government because of the discussion about the future presidency. Whatever the Turkish army has done in the past was before Turkey wanted to join the EU. The situation is different now and it is totally unacceptable for a military force to operate independently of, and in opposition to, a democratically elected Government. I hope very much that wiser spirits will prevail in Ankara. I give way.</p>

The French and Austrian people have been given binding referendums on whether Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union when the time comes. Does the noble Lord see opinion in France and Austria changing quickly enough to allow Turkey to enter the European Union, whatever the political negotiations may be in the mean time?</p>

That has never been the case before and it raises the possibility of some very unhealthy arguments taking place about the accession of Turkey. All I can say is that Turkey&#146;s accession is, at best, many years ahead. Opinions can change by then. We shall see how things develop. That does not mean that we should say no to Turkey because the previous French President said that there would be a referendum. That would be a most ill advised approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="070509115000154"></a>I turn to the situation in Moldova, which I had the chance to visit last year. Moldova, with its close economic, political and social ties to Romania, is now separated from Romania by the European Union border. This has posed enormous difficulties, particularly as the country is also having problems with the policies emanating from Moscow. For example, Moldova makes more wine than any other product. Until the Russians boycotted Moldovan wine, 65 per cent of it went to Russia, so the country is under economic pressure. There is also pressure in a small part of Moldova called Transnistria, where there are still some Russian troops. These are all serious problems, exacerbated by the fact that their easy relationship with Romania has now been severed by the EU border. I hope that the Government will look at Moldova as almost a special case in the support and help we can give them, given that their difficulties are greater than those experienced by any other country adjacent to an EU member.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="070509115000155"></a>It would be wrong to set a limit on EU expansion, to say today that Europe will go so far and no further. Equally, I am unhappy with the idea of a pause, as put forward by my noble friend Lord Borrie, because it would simply destabilise the applicant countries. It is not clear what would bring a pause to an end. There is, anyway, plenty of breathing space in the fairly long process of negotiating accession agreements. A pause would not be helpful; in the present decade only Croatia is likely to be able to join the EU.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="070509115000156"></a>The countries of the western Balkans should be offered a credible EU perspective for their way forward; otherwise they face enormous difficulties. The EU would look odd in the long term if some west Balkan countries were members but others were not. The lesson of Cyprus is that we should be very careful about existing border disputes in any country that seeks to join the EU, but we should not give third countries a veto over the process, as the report makes very clear. The EU treaty gives every European

It is better not to define Europe&#146;s boundaries, because at present the EU can encourage positive changes in potential members. If we say that they cannot join, we discourage that.</p>

<a name="70509-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="070509115000157"></a>I trust that the constitutional treaty is effectively dead, and the idea of a referendum with it. We need relatively small changes in EU governance to cope healthily with an enlarged EU membership. Those do not require a referendum and can be brought through fairly easily, without all the difficulties attributed to the constitutional treaty. It is important to bring the people of this country and the people of Europe with us. The process of enlargement is important; it will lead to a more democratic and healthier EU. I welcome the progress that we are making in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="070509115000159"></a>Enlargement has benefited not only those countries that have joined in recent years but also, in many cases, existing members. Although immigration into the UK appears to be uncontrolled, there is not doubt that the 0.5 to 1 million people who have come in since 2004 have stimulated the economy. The Government, we are reminded, forecast 26,000 over that period. However, with so much to agree with, I think that the Dutch would be disappointed to read that their GDP is only just greater than that of Malta, and it would have been informative to have included an analysis of population trends. The old EU has a rapidly ageing and declining population, as we all know, thus placing a huge burden on the working population. The new members tend to have younger and growing populations, particularly Turkey&#151;although it is not a member&#151;which will be absolutely essential if the EU is to grow and expand. I am sure that without the influx of foreign workers the UK inflation rate would have been immeasurably higher.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="070509115000160"></a>I was encouraged to read that new members have a preference for a Europe of nations, because they fear that in a federal Europe their voices would be lost. However, I was discouraged to read that there was no evidence that enlargement had led to gridlock in EU institutions. That might have forced a reform of them, which most agree is desirable.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="070509115000161"></a>The conflict between the deepeners and the wideners, as they are termed, reflects a disenchantment with the EU as it now is. To have the EU as a large and growing single market is surely better than having continued political integration. Let us hope that the desire to sort out the constitutional question is not speeded up at the impending June meetings, and is not shuffled through as minor changes not requiring a referendum in the desire to agree to further countries eligible for enlargement.</p>

I very much hope that Turkey will be offered full membership; to offer less would be insulting to a great nation and not in our best interests, although how that can be reconciled to President Sarkozy&#146;s views will be difficult.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="070509115000163"></a>In June, Europe&#146;s leaders meet to try to revive the European constitution. Their desire to do so is contrary to the desires of many of their electorates and, what is more, electors want a direct say in any decisions that are taken. Some 75 per cent of them in a recent poll said that they wanted a referendum. As I have said, our Prime Minister said that the earlier constitution was a tidying-up exercise. In the same breath, he said that he recommended it as a success and a major step forward in creating the kind of Europe that the British people want. It is strange that he did not have the courage to put it to the referendum that he had promised us. Now we are told that we should have a mini-constitution and that without it the EU would stop functioning. However, as the committee so ably points out, the EU has not ground to a halt since the no votes in 2005. Indeed, nearly 5,000 directives and/or regulations have been produced in the past two years.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="070509115000164"></a>Our leaders are now trying to bring in a mini-constitution by the back door, without referendums&#151;a single legal entity with a single foreign policy and full authority over home affairs. The word &#147;constitution&#148; is of course not being used, and the suggestion is that the contents of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be cross-referenced to give it the same legal value. If only some effort were made to roll back the EU&#146;s powers from the largely unaccountable Brussels bureaucracy, to repatriate employment and fishing and reform the common agricultural policy or even sign off the accounts, the electorate might be more interested.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="070509115000165"></a>In this age of globalisation, the EU needs to look outward, not inward, and adapt to the challenges of a fast-changing world, to recognise that restrictions and regulation will not meet the opportunities awaiting China, India and the developing world with a population of nearly 4 billion compared to the EU&#146;s 460 million. In the absence of this, a core Europe with the UK excluded or variable geometry, as it is called, may be the way forward. But the EU must go on taking new members for the many reasons so eloquently set out in the report. The more members there are, the more diverse will views become and, one hopes, in the absence of reform of Brussels from within, the larger EU will become ungovernable and will be forced to perform the rationalisation that most agree is now urgent. So my objective is the same as that of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, but I believe that it will be achieved by enlargement, creating so many problems that the EU as we know it today will cease to exist.</p>

The committee has a distinguished membership with a lot of experience and I believe that the House is fortunate to have people of that calibre following European affairs so closely on our behalf.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="070509115000167"></a>At the outset of my remarks I endorse what my noble friend Lord Dubs and others have underlined. I welcome the honesty of the committee in recognising that an obstacle to enlargement is the existing state of public opinion. I also welcome the candour of the committee in bringing home that one reason for this is the inadequacy of political leadership in explaining exactly what the community has achieved, what it means for the people of its members, what its potential is and in taking a positive approach to building it for the future, instead of that leadership wanting to come home from every meeting claiming how it has fought for our exclusive interests more successfully than anybody else.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="070509115000168"></a>The community is not, was never conceived as being and must not be allowed to become just an administrative top-down arrangement. The quality of its democracy is crucial to its success. Perhaps it is worth pondering what we mean when we say that democracy is crucial to its success. The words flow easily, but what do they really mean?</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="070509115000169"></a>First, democracy matters in terms of the values and culture of the society of which it is the political system, but it matters equally because it is a sound step towards stability by ensuring the accountability of government. Therefore, when we talk about the importance of the quality of democracy in the European Union, that is not just a light refrain; it is absolutely fundamental to its effectiveness and sustainability.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="070509115000170"></a>We all know&#151;and the committee has certainly recognised it&#151;that for most people in this country Brussels appears to be a remote, authoritarian body. We also know that if Brussels seems to be remote, the Parliament&#151;whether it is in Brussels or under this absurd arrangement in Strasbourg, commuting backwards and forwards at God knows what expense to the taxpayer&#151;is even more remote. The challenge is to bring democracy nearer to people. Here I want to take issue with Polly Toynbee. I do not often do that, but I read a recent article by her, and although I normally regard her as almost infallible as a political pundit I found myself very much in disagreement. She suggested that the recent elections in our country demonstrated not that people wanted localism, but that the voting system was unsound and what people wanted was proportional representation. I must not allow myself to be drawn into a long analysis. That is an unfortunate contrast; I think that they want both. I am certain that people want to feel that they have more influence and that decisions are made in a context which they can feel part of and understand.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="070509115000171"></a>Let me go further. In recent years I have become convinced that identity matters desperately to stability in national and world affairs. People need a meaningful sense of identity. In its absence there is a danger of alienation. Therefore, I, for one, am a positive enthusiast for what the Government have done in terms of devolution. They have acted ahead  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1513"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of time, rather than finding themselves with an increasingly impossible unstable situation in the United Kingdom. It was imaginative and essential to our future&#151;I sometimes wonder whether they realised just how imaginative it was.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="070509115000172"></a>Of course, identity and devolution are not enough in themselves. The other reality that we are faced with is the world&#146;s total interdependence, not least in the age of terrorism. We have a world in which international co-operation must be seen as not just a nice option but absolutely essential to the management of human affairs. Therefore, the challenge to political leadership is, having established a sense of identity, to lead people to support the international institutions and the co-operation which are essential if any of us are to have a future.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="070509115000173"></a>In the sense of what I have argued, enlargement is to be welcomed. If I am committed to enlargement, there must be no question but that undertakings which have been given must be honoured. The instability and dangers that could be provoked by rejecting people who have set out upon a particular course in good faith, and by taking the ground from under the imaginative leaders who are trying to work for what we all want, is incalculable.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="070509115000174"></a>I do not find myself in agreement with some of those who have spoken on Turkey. My thesis is that we, and certainly our children and grandchildren, need inclusive and not exclusive political institutions&#151;institutions which face diversity and turn it into a rich and positive dimension of society, as distinct from something to be feared and rejected. Therefore, an increasingly democratic Turkey&#151;of course there is a way to go yet&#151;with an Islamic culture is going to be a positive asset for the Community as a whole, not least for the stability of our multicultural society in the United Kingdom. The Turkish army has given grounds for concern. Surely our message to the army should be, &#147;Please understand: it is because your country is an increasingly democratic country in which the army must be servants of the political order, and because it has a strong Islamic tradition&#151;which we value&#151;that we want you within the Community&#148;. If the army does not recognise that then it had better be told in no uncertain language that the road that it is taking is the one thing that could wreck the progress of Turkey towards membership.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="070509115000175"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis spoke movingly about the values of the Community. It is good to hear that from someone who has been a Commissioner. There is one dimension to enlargement which we all have to take seriously; that there could be a tendency for the values to become aspirational rather than substantial. That is a possibility that we must not discount. For a number of years I have been on the delegation of the Council of Europe. I have no doubt that it has changed. Its culture now is more aspirational and rhetorical, rather than substantial in its commitment to the values about which we are speaking.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="070509115000176"></a>While I am making this observation and talking about the experience of the Council of Europe in this context, I will make another observation. There is a  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1514"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>temptation to see European Union institutions as preserving the human rights that we see as central. It would be a retrograde step to move away from the European Court of Human Rights as it is today. What might begin to happen is that members of the European Union would be seen as having a commitment to human rights and a court to underwrite them but that they did not apply equally to wider society in Europe, its fringes or beyond. The point of and strength of the court is that it has a wider application.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="070509115000177"></a>The logic of how I see it all is that we should be more relaxed about the principle of a confederal rather than federal European Community, as we used to call it, because I want it to be strong and effective&#151;a European Union of co-operating states with which ordinary people can feel a greater identity. Back in the 1970s when I was the Minister of State in the Foreign Office responsible for Europe I sometimes felt, with some sadness, that the European Parliament had gone down the wrong road&#151;that it was a mistake to have a directly elected institution. It would have been better to have an indirectly elected Parliament. The responsibility is not soundly based. That might have been a better arrangement, but so be it. Whatever the intention was, it is perceived&#151;if it is not all fear and reality&#151;that we have parliamentarians who are not engaged with the daily reality of substantial politics in their societies. Parliamentarians in the individual member countries can make a lot of fuss, get a high profile and news coverage by being hostile to Europe and its institutions.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="070509115000178"></a>I will finish by saying, with conviction, that I am certain that the way history will judge us all in this period of the 21st century is by how we build the European institutions&#151;the way that the European Union adds to the quality of accountable government and democracy as I described it earlier, and to the effective contribution that Europeans are making to the stability of the wider world&#151;and on recognising that the problems of our children and grandchildren, whether the environment, security or economic affairs, cannot be solved in a European context alone. They can only be solved in a global context. The test of the institutions, therefore, will be how they play in to the global institutions which have become so vital. </p>

I am tempted to follow him for half a minute. For me, the most glorious point in those elections was watching the newly elected Member of the Scottish Parliament, the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, saying, in an irritated fashion to a &#147;Newsnight&#148; presenter, &#147;But you have to understand: we have a four-party system&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="070509115000180"></a>This was an extremely valuable report. It showed us a number of important issues, which I hope the committee will continue to study. Enlargement, it  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1515"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>points out, has been a continuing process since the British application in 1961. I tell the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that I, as a young researcher, wrote an article in 1976 called &#147;Widening and Deepening&#148;. It argued that widening&#151;in those days, that meant taking Spain, Greece and Portugal on board&#151;would necessarily involve deepening rather than the reverse.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="070509115000181"></a>The issue of what the borders of Europe are has been with us since 1989. I then had the mildly painful experience of getting the LSE maps unit to draw some maps on European fault lines for a Chatham House paper and giving a presentation at Harvard. An elderly professor called Samuel Huntington got rather excited at one of those maps and reproduced it to demonstrate that Croatia is European but that Bosnia is on the other side in the clash of civilisations. That is one of the reasons why I very much hesitate to go along with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in suggesting that after Croatia we have a pause. That is the Catholic western Europe that some right-wing Americans and some in the Vatican wish us to hold to and which many of the rest of us wish to move away from as far and fast as we can.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="070509115000182"></a>I am not at all sure that Cyprus is really in Europe, as one defines Europe. I am not entirely sure, if you want to be deeply geographical, that Iceland&#151;or at least the western half of Iceland&#151;is in Europe; it is certainly the other side of the Atlantic divide. We need to be very careful when playing around with these geographical ideas.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="070509115000183"></a>We have had awkward states in the European Union for a long time. Many of us remember how difficult Greece was in its first 10 years of membership&#151;it looked after its own national interests and did not think that it had anything to give in return. Sadly, Cyprus has now clearly taken on that role. That is part of the reason why we have to take much greater care in assessing the criteria for future accession. The report clearly says that the most recent enlargement has been an enormous success. The transformation of central and eastern Europe since 1990 has been astonishing. The support for economic transformation and the conditionality imposed on political and administrative reform has worked remarkably well.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="070509115000184"></a>However, I think that we all accept that the transformation of Romania and Bulgaria still has some distance to go and that allowing those two countries to join the European Union, though necessary in order to maintain the pace of reform, strengthens the argument for much stronger mechanisms for scrutinising the implementation of EU legislation and the quality of courts and public administration post-joining in all member states. After all, this is not just a question of Romania and Bulgaria; the water standards in Brussels are in many ways lower than those in Warsaw because of the difficulty of the Flemish and French-speaking communities in sorting out problems of sanitation. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, looks surprised; I thought that that was a well known fact. Agricultural funds in southern Italy have not always been distributed entirely without corruption; nor, indeed, have structural funds in Spain or fisheries policy in

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="070509115000185"></a>We need stronger scrutiny. The European Parliament is beginning to address that; it could have a very useful role in that regard. We must also recognise that this involves not just the resistance among our publics to further enlargement but the resistance of many of our publics to eastern enlargement. That was a factor in the French and Dutch referendums&#151;people felt that they had not been consulted about Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic coming in and that that threatened their jobs and social welfare and would bring higher taxes. That was certainly part of the negative response to the constitutional treaty. There was a clear failure of political leadership and communication by all member Governments, including our own. But that is, of course, part of the greater failure of our Government to make any greater effort to carry their own public to understand the advantages of European integration. Further enlargement has some distance to run. The question is: how much further should it go?</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="070509115000186"></a>On the western Balkans, I argue, as do all of us on these Benches, that we have obligations that we must fulfil. I say in passing that my noble friend Lord Ashdown very much wanted to have been here tonight but, unfortunately, is attending a ceremony to unveil his own portrait in the National Liberal Club. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that we on these Benches used, jokingly, to refer to my noble friend as the viceroy when he was in charge of Bosnia; it was, after all, a protectorate&#151;and, so far, it has been a relatively successful protectorate. Does one prefer to allow parts of south-eastern Europe to deteriorate into disorder or do we recognise that it is in our shared interest to help to reconstruct conflict-ridden societies and rebuild broken states and weak economies? That would allow us to stop transnational crime, drug smuggling and people smuggling&#151;those are all things that south-eastern Europe and the western Balkans were exporting to the rest of Europe&#151;and, over the long haul, bring those weak and small states into full membership of the European Union.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="070509115000187"></a>We do not need to have deliberate pause after Croatia. There will be a natural pause, because the process will be long and hard&#151;more like 10 years than five. However, the cost of leaving those countries out might well be too high, even though the process of bringing them up to the standards required for membership will be long and painful.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="070509115000188"></a>We have all agreed that Turkey is a much more difficult issue. It is a far larger and much more diverse country. I remember at a conference in Istanbul two years ago that a professor from Ankara University said to us that we had to understand that there were four different societies in Turkey: there were half a million Turks who were fully part of the sophisticated cosmopolitan global society; there were 5 million Turks who were urbanised and educated, and would  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1517"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adapt very easily to European Union membership; there were 35 million Turks who were first generation in the cities; and there were a further 35 million Turks who were still in the villages and living in conditions, he said very brutally, that were not totally unlike those of Pakistan.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="070509115000189"></a>Turkey is a very diverse society, which is developing very rapidly and which now has the least corrupt Government since the Second World War; the current Government have many very attractive features. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, about the development of an Islamic democracy. I find deeply unattractive the army and those representatives of the deep state, who are nationalist, authoritarian and brutal in their attitude towards minorities and the Kurds in particular.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="070509115000190"></a>I wish that Her Majesty&#146;s Government had thought through more fully the implications of offering unconditional membership to Turkey at an earlier stage. As with so many other issues, this was an area in which Her Majesty&#146;s Government took our policy from the Americans, who wanted us to offer membership to Turkey without thinking through its implications for the European Union. We must maintain negotiations with the Turkish Government in good faith, because the reform process is well under way, which means that we have to bring increasing pressure on the Government of Cyprus to fulfil their obligations as a member of the European Union on opening their ports to trade with Northern Cyprus. However, it is quite possible that the long-term process of negotiations with Turkey will not end in full membership.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="070509115000191"></a>The question of the states beyond is more difficult. It is partly an issue of integration capacity and is certainly a question of relations with Russia. I very much hope that the committee will return to the issue of neighbourhood policy, into which it rightly states the European Union has not yet put much effort, nor has the committee defined what it wants neighbourhood policy to achieve. The report did not say, although I wish that it had, that the European Union needs a much more active approach towards the &#147;frozen conflicts&#148; in Moldova, Georgia and elsewhere, of which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, spoke. We need a much better accompaniment to enlargement to provide the sort of partnerships that the countries around the EU, if they ever approach membership, will need to offer&#151;and that will require 15 or 20 years or more.</p>

<a name="70509-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="070509115000192"></a>What about the institutional implications? Again, I welcome the report&#146;s argument that we need some further institutional reform&#151;not as an end in itself, but as a means of ensuring that a widening European Union retains the capability to take and implement decisions that represent the common interests of its members. The report makes the case, therefore, for an amending treaty and for some further extension to qualified majority voting. I note that; I trust that, when we in this House come in a few months to debate the proposals for an amending treaty, other Members of this House will take it fully on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="070509115000193"></a>There will be real problems for the workings of the Council when there are 27, 28 or more members, and for the patience of representatives of larger states, because they will have to listen to the representatives of smaller states. I sometimes wonder whether our next Prime Minister will have the patience to sit and listen for long hours as the heads of Governments of smaller states, of which he is dimly aware, go on at great length.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="070509115000194"></a>I wish that the committee had been a little more critical about the number of Commissioners, which is a taboo subject. We have to break that taboo. People in Brussels now say that no one will ever give up their Commissioner, but that is part of the treaty that we would wish to break. It is in Britain&#146;s interest for there to be a small and efficient Commission, even if that means that, from time to time, there is no British Commissioner. I wish that the British Government would say so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="070509115000195"></a>The consensus of the report, which I welcome and with which I agree, is that we must be committed to a long haul in the western Balkans that ends in full membership, that we should maintain continued negotiations with Turkey, which is also a long haul that may or may not end in full membership, that we should strengthen the neighbourhood policy both to the east and the south, and that the necessary institutional changes must follow, including the extension of scrutiny to implementation within the EU after states have joined.</p>

Although there has been a time lag before your Lordships&#146; House has been able to discuss it, the timing has turned out to be extremely apposite. This a good moment to look at the issues raised. I must confess that I am concerned about all such reports that tackle the issue of the future shape of Europe and what kind of Europe we want.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="070509115000197"></a>I shall put my concerns in the following way: of course there is a case for an integrated European bloc&#151;if not a superstate, which we are told is not on the cards, then at least a tight-knit grouping which is mainly western European and may be extended to the geographical areas of historic Europe, but with substantial features of political union. It would be a harmonising, gathering and integrated body. That is what Jean Monnet and many others wanted and what many leading Europeans still want today. They want an efficient, strong-centred, integrated entity that is capable of turning out fast decisions and of reaching a unified world view. We have heard that case put by some noble Lords in this debate. With that goes the idea with which not all people wish to be associated of a much better protected Europe, maybe even a fortress Europe, which in this age of global challenges has somehow to defend itself. That vision finds a clear echo in the pronouncements of Monsieur Sarkozy, who is to be the new French president. He has spoken explicitly about the need for more protection of Europe against outside forces. That is one view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="070509115000198"></a>By contrast, there is a different case for a wider and more open association that stretches far outside western Europe and far beyond the Europe of geographical definition, including not only the east and west Balkans, which are in our idea of Europe, but Turkey and, in due course, Ukraine, Belarus and even Armenia and Azerbaijan. All those countries have aspirations to join the EU, which would then reach deep into central Asia and be more Eurasian than European. Such an arrangement could certainly share the so-called brand value of the Union, as one witness to the committee described it. However, it would not be economically uniform in any way; indeed, it would be deeply divided, with vast contrasts in incomes and cultures. Realistically, it could never be the tight-knit body that the old federalist Europeans dreamt of. It would be bound to be more confederal than federal, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="070509115000199"></a>Whatever has happened regarding past enlargements, that prospect for the years ahead means that you can have one Europe or the other, but not in the end&#151;or even from now on&#151;both. Nor can the fundamental differences between those visions be papered over for much longer by calling it variable geometry. There comes a point when the variable geometry stretches so much that there is no geometric pattern left. The position to which we and Europe are now moving is a matter of careful choice. My noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry commented on that in a typically profound speech and I am not sure that we can continue to fudge the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="070509115000200"></a>My concern is that this excellent report only touches on that central, old dilemma between deepening and widening, but it does so in a new context. That is mentioned specifically in paragraph 157, which is probably the most significant section of the whole report. However, the report sails on past, without recognising that now is the time for that issue to be addressed and for strategic choices to be made on the kind of Europe that we want. The report simply states that there should be no boundaries to Europe or to the EU. That is okay and, in a way, it is realistic so long as one does not then argue in the same breath that the EU should, at the same time, become more integrated and more centralised with tighter rules, more efficient decision machinery and more political integration, as, I am afraid, the report is slightly inclined to do in the paragraphs that follow the crucial paragraph 157. We have reached the stage where it cannot; nor, anyway, is it so obvious that more efficient decision-making procedures are necessary or beneficial.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="070509115000201"></a>In practice&#151;here, the report is on very good ground and makes an interesting section&#151;the already enormous enlargement and widening, up to 27 members from the old 15, nine or six before that, has all gone rather smoothly with no real sign of slowing the Brussels speed or capacity for reaching new decisions and making new laws. On the contrary, as the <I>Economist</I> recently pointed out, more regulations and directives than ever are now flowing from the Commission and there is no slow-down there, as the committee rightly confirms in its report from the evidence it heard and as my noble friend Lord Stevens of Ludgate reminded  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1520"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>us. That is the choice that those who are serious about dealing with these issues now have to face. The report helps us to go that way but it does not quite face up to those issues.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="070509115000202"></a>I now come to the subject of Turkey, on which some fascinating comments have been made. In one sense, it is indeed a real and immediate problem. Turkey is huge, as noble Lords have said; it has the second biggest army in NATO; it has moments of deep turbulence, as now; and there appears to be a growing anti-European Union sentiment, which mirrors the strong antagonism from within the EU to Turkish membership that is growing more evident, especially in France. There is also the intractable Cyprus issue. I do not intend to go into that in detail now, partly for reasons of time but also because some thorough and illuminating comments have been made on it in the debate. However, as one commentator put it&#151;I am not sure whether it was in evidence to the committee or whether it was in the <I>Economist,</I> but it was an unfair and insulting comment&#151;Turkey is,</p>
<ul><a name="070509115000265"></a>&#147;too large, too poor and too Muslim&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070509115000255"></a>That is the sort of view that informs the very anti-Turkish feelings to be found in parts of continental Europe.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="070509115000203"></a>With wonderful irony, it seems that the present&#151;and successful&#151;non-secular, Islamic-inclined Government are more pro eventual accession to the EU and the so-called secular movements, which in some ways seem to be allied with the military organisations, are most opposed. As Turkey is a central player in the Middle East jigsaw and is inextricably involved in the Kurdish problem, which means being involved in the Iraqi and Iranian problems, there is no doubt that, if these things were to happen now, the EU would be brought into the centre of these tortuous issues even more than it is already, as the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, reminded us. In one sense, the situation is immediate, extremely worrying and complex but, in another, it is not such a problem for the simple reason that it is all years away&#151;at least a decade.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="070509115000204"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Roper, asked, in 10 years&#146; time, what kind of EU will we have? I predict that it will be quite different. I believe that a much looser, wider version of Europe, with less centralism and fewer ambitions to be a bloc, a superpower, a counterweight to the United States or whatever the phrase is, will by then have prevailed, and the integrators will have been finally defeated. I am not quite with my noble friend Lord Stevens in saying that the EU will have ceased to exist but it will certainly have changed and adapted. It will have to have done so in a very big way. This will prove to be a correct response to world events because, as, for example, Monsieur Vedrine, the former French Foreign Minister, pointed out the other day, Europe will by then no longer be setting the global agenda at all. The pacemaker&#146;s baton will have passed to Asia.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="070509115000205"></a>We need a good, friendly and co-operative European neighbourhood, and we must never tire of working for that. But it is the rising powers of Asia and elsewhere that will really count. That is where the wealth and the political power already increasingly lie. The world is no longer Euro-centric; it is not even  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1521"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Atlantic-centric. Globalisation and microchip power have changed everything, as they were bound to do. To survive and prosper, we in western Europe must each work with agility to build up our strengths, links and networks with the &#147;developing world&#148;&#151;it is rather patronisingly so called, but is now rapidly becoming the fastest advancing high-technology world&#151;and we must work to the utmost to provide good links and commerce with those nations.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="070509115000206"></a>I sum up my feelings on this subject by saying that a wider, enlarged, flexible and open Europe will be a great help and benefit to our neighbourhood, as&#151;in many, although not all, ways&#151;the European market, the European Community and the European Union have been of benefit so far. But it will never make the European Union a world power or a cohesive superbloc, and nor should wise politicians try to push and divert it that way. There is no bullet to bite, as one Euro-phile official misguidedly urged on Britain the other day.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="070509115000207"></a>Therefore, in 10 years&#146; time, it may be far easier for Turkey to join the European Union, as it will have changed. The choice for the type of Europe that we want will then, by default and by the power of global trends, have already been made. It will indeed turn out that there is no alternative, as one of your Lordships said, to progressive enlargement. Perhaps unintentionally, that seems to be the central and realistic message of this report, and that is why, like others, I strongly welcome it.</p>

In a remarkable overview, the noble Lord&#151;Julian Grenfell, if I may refer to him as such&#151;made a genuine, nuanced and sensitive analysis, which results from considerable expertise. I think that the House will thank him for it, and I shall try to address what he described as his lessons.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="070509115000209"></a>I also thank the European Union Committee for its report, which is a valuable contribution to the debate on enlargement and the future of Europe. I wholeheartedly endorse its findings. Enlargement remains one of the EU&#146;s most successful policies and it is one to which the United Kingdom has made a strong contribution. Full credit is due to this House for its support in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="070509115000210"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, with, as ever, a penetrating analysis, introduced the very real concept of strategic choice. We are not at the point of final choice; nor am I clear that some of the contradictions between the strategic directions can be resolved at this moment. However, it is absolutely clear to me that that debate will have to be had. It will be not just about the consequences of economic differentiation, important though those are, but also, in a cultural sense, about the essentials of a social Europe and how will they be understood across a terrain as large as the one that the noble Lord has painted.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1522"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="070509115000211"></a>As this debate has demonstrated, EU enlargement covers a wide range of topics. I shall focus on a few themes: the success of past enlargements, the challenges ahead and the need to ensure a flexible yet rigorous approach to accession. The Government and all the major parties have favoured enlargement&#151;a sensible, careful process&#151;for reasons that we need to discuss briefly. They are not, I know, the mischievous reasons entertainingly advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Ludgate; none the less, I hope that he will bear with me as I express ours.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="070509115000212"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roper, made the point that we do not celebrate enough what has been achieved. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, made the same point&#151;as did my noble friend Lord Dubs&#151;although he said that the contribution made by the United Kingdom to the outcome of the success was perhaps not the predicted one when people saw a much smaller Community but have had to adjust to a much larger one.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="070509115000213"></a>Enlargement has been at the core of the development of the EU. It enabled the peaceful reunification of Europe after the Second World War and across the Cold War divide. It continues to be the engine for security and prosperity. Of course, I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, least of all with the phantom that he raises of new imperialism. With the greatest courtesy, I say to him that we crossed the Rubicon long ago&#151;as I recall it was in Italy and certainly not on the route to Turkey.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="070509115000214"></a>The security issues, touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, require a special relationship with those places where wars and ethnic conflict have not yet been resolved. I would have thought that, since the Dayton accord, we have all understood exactly what was involved in that and what one had to do to secure peace. Each round of enlargement has helped. It has brought new jobs, new markets and new investment opportunities. With a population of 490 million, the EU now represents the largest internal market in the world. Together we are better able to respond to increasing global competition.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="070509115000215"></a>For the United Kingdom, the economic benefits of the 2004 accession are clear. Our exports to the A10 were worth almost &#163;8 billion in 2006, compared with &#163;4.6 billion in 2004. Exports to Poland alone rose by 67 per cent in 2006. UK firms such as Tesco, Unilever, Vodafone and BP are successful investors in new member and candidate countries. Our labour markets have benefited from increased output and jobs.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="070509115000216"></a>I know that some in the media will continue to peddle their fears of mass immigration to the United Kingdom, but I suggest that this House understands the reality in a rather different way. Migrants have contributed to our growth and tax revenues while gaining new skills. The noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Ludgate, may be right about the impact of the age structure as a factor. That is an extremely important and interesting point but, even without that, the preliminary economic analysis shows that this has been a positive development.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="070509115000217"></a>Enlargement, more than any other policy, has transformed poverty to prosperity and conflict to peace across Europe. While the path to accession  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1523"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provides incentives, it also involves challenging economic reforms for candidate countries. I commend Romania and Bulgaria, our two newest EU partners, for their progress. For example, until 2000, 36 per cent of Romania&#146;s population lived in poverty, inflation was running at 54 per cent and the budget deficit had spiralled out of control. In 2006, Romania&#146;s economic growth stood at 7.7 per cent, inflation was down to single digits and the budget deficit stood at 1.7 per cent. There is more to do, of course, but what a remarkable advance that has been.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="070509115000218"></a>It is right to focus on economic benefits, but the figures do not always tell the full story of EU membership. For centuries, Europe has been disfigured by conflict. Tens of millions of innocent Europeans died in two world wars. Again, in the 1990s, Europe witnessed ethnic genocide in the former Yugoslavia. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, summed it up throughout his speech, particularly by saying that it is the movement to democracy&#151;and the quality of Europe&#146;s democracy&#151;that is critical for success in overcoming these scars.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="070509115000219"></a>It is easy to take Europe&#146;s stability for granted. In the last half of the last century, we forged a different way so that today&#146;s young Europeans will be the first generation who do not listen to tales of what their grandparents did during the war, fearing that they, too, might have to make those terrible sacrifices in conflict. Over the past 50 years, more and more of us have decided to share mutual security arrangements and to build close trade links. Of course, national rivalries do not vanish easily, but they are now insignificant compared with international co-operation. President Clinton rightly described the new architecture of Europe as the greatest and most successful example of fixing in place peace and community.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="070509115000220"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, EU membership has fostered democracy, the rule of law, trade and deep commitment to human rights. My parents&#146; generation chose that path and succeeded. Indeed, some Members of your Lordships&#146; House were party directly to that success. In my view, all of them are to be congratulated. I hope that we have the ability to build on their vision, which is why I have no time for the scepticism that denies the achievement of that period. Of course, there are practical challenges ahead. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, was right to emphasise accountability in those challenges. I agree that the enlargement process needs to be robust and based on the Copenhagen criteria. As the committee notes, this should not prevent us from tailoring our approach in the light of experience.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="070509115000221"></a>We have learnt lessons from the fifth wave of enlargement; for example, in the administration of justice and the fight against crime and corruption. We recognise how difficult it can be to tackle those issues. That is why European leaders agreed last December to ensure that those issues are focused on early in the negotiation process. There are, for example, now defined benchmarks for justice and home affairs issues. These new requirements will help&#151;not hinder&#151;Turkey, Croatia and the western Balkans as they move towards EU membership. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, demanded stronger scrutiny, and those are the areas in which stronger scrutiny would be invaluable.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1524"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="070509115000222"></a>That brings me to Turkey. We should be more rigorous in pursuing the terms for enlargement here, but that does not mean that we should set impossible conditions. The accession process is a compact. It requires commitment from the candidate to be matched by a firm commitment from the European Union that, if the standards are met, accession will ensue. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, raised the issue of risk in all this. Although the boundaries of Europe are perhaps wisely not defined&#151;I am not sure that I understood the point entirely&#151;as prescriptively as he was suggesting, I strongly share his balanced judgment of the advantage. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, also made that point about borders. Incidentally, the borders are defined not only in geopolitical terms, but often through popular culture&#151;through competitions in things such as football or singing, or what passes for singing&#151;and they spread across into wider areas.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="070509115000223"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, called for a pause in this context. Like others, I fear that much progress will stop if we have the kind of pause that was advocated. I am quite certain that a decade of debate is quite a pause in its own right, as we work through those issues. So we welcome last December&#146;s European Council reaffirmation that it would honour existing commitments to Turkey and other countries in the enlargement process. A Turkey anchored in the EU will make all Europe more secure, stable and prosperous. The prospect of membership alone has already brought positive change.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="070509115000224"></a>In recent years, Turkey has abolished the death penalty and is working hard on a zero-tolerance policy toward torture and on improved rights for women and minority groups, although it is clear to me that there is much further to go in all those respects. Those reforms must continue and, unfortunately, we should acknowledge that the pace has slowed. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said, we have to continue to urge the Turkish Government to address those areas of concern.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="070509115000225"></a>Before accession, Turkey, like all prospective members, must fulfil its contractual obligations, specifically by opening its ports to Cypriot shipping under the Ankara agreement protocol. EU Foreign Ministers have been clear that failure here will affect the overall pace of negotiations. But it makes sense for Turkey to move ahead on technical chapters of the negotiations while it works towards meeting the political conditionality. All those factors, as my noble friend Lord Dubs said, have to be weighed in the balance as we move forward.</p>

<a name="70509-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="070509115000226"></a>A number of noble Lords spoke of the recent events in Turkey surrounding the election processes and the unhelpful&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, specifically reminded us&#151;intervention of the military. My noble friend Lord Dubs and the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, also mentioned the issues of political Islam and the difficulties in maintaining a secular state, as those pressures are expressed. The capacity to create and sustain a secular state with a people who are overwhelmingly Muslim is one of the things that, if we can get it right, will add specific political and historical value to Turkish accession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="070509115000227"></a>As to Mr Sarkozy, I am aware that his comments have been received with dismay in Turkey. He has made no secret of his opposition to its membership of the EU, and his position hardened during the recent campaign. He has spoken of launching an early debate in Europe to reconsider Turkey&#146;s accession negotiations. He has raised alternatives, such as privileged partnership and so on. We will have to have that argument. The reality is that the door is currently open to Turkey, Croatia and other countries in the western Balkans, and those countries have to show that they are ready to walk through that door and are capable of doing so. The process that I have just described is precisely what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, was calling for. It is a point at which careful thought about how to carry this forward is essential. I do not entirely think that, as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, suggested, in several years&#146; time, but within the decade, there may be another French president. There may or may not be, but there will not be another French people. Those arguments will have to be held, as the noble Lord recognises. As he suggested, in doing so, we must have a dialogue with other Europeans.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="070509115000228"></a>The crucial point is that staying on this path, focused on the objective of EU membership, will keep the Turkish Government committed to reform. That was true of Poland and Romania, and I believe it will be true of Turkey and Croatia. Like the noble Lords, Lord Roper and Lord Grenfell, I think issues have been thrown up by the accession of Cyprus and the way that Turkey now deals with these things, but I suspect that the resolution of borders in advance teaches a lesson for the future. On balance, the progress on the 10 accession countries was probably the greater gain.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="070509115000229"></a>Croatia is undertaking a series of political, economic and judicial reforms to meet accession standards. They are a fitting tribute to former Prime Minister Racan, who died last week, who paved the way for Croatia&#146;s eventual accession to the EU. I agree with the committee&#146;s assertion that Croatia should be able to accede as soon as it meets the necessary standards. The prospect of enlargement has set Croatia on the right path and while there is some way to go, it encapsulates the aspirations of its western Balkan neighbours.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="070509115000230"></a>I agree with the points made in the committee&#146;s report about not fixing dates. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, came to the same conclusion for slightly different reasons, but I agree with the point, which is still right. I agree with the committee that a credible EU perspective for the western Balkans is vital, not least given the challenges those countries face. As the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, noted, enlargement is the glue which keeps those countries from falling off the path of reform. That is why it is important to keep reaffirming the Thessaloniki commitment at the European Council in 2003 that,</p>
<ul><a name="070509115000266"></a>&#147;the future of the Western Balkans is within the European Union.&#146;</ul>
<a name="70509-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="070509115000231"></a>The committee is also correct to note that giving these countries candidate status would present the EU  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1526"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column 1526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with new challenges; it certainly will. The EU needs to provide financial and technical assistance to help the western Balkans meet the Copenhagen criteria. The EU&#146;s instrument for pre-accession funding provides that support. Between 2007 and 2013, just over half the &#8364;11 billion budget will be allocated to the western Balkans. That does not mean that those countries should immediately be given candidate status. There is a clear pre-accession process, the one which Croatia has followed, which is, in essence, a graduated process which demands step-by-step progress on, for example, co-operation with The Hague tribunal and on minority rights.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="070509115000232"></a>As a nation, we remain a strong supporter of EU and NATO integration for Macedonia, a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roper. We were pleased that the December 2005 European Council granted Macedonia candidate status. We want to see Macedonia in the EU, but the speed at which it can move towards EU membership will ultimately depend on the pace that it can sustain in its reform efforts. We should encourage it, and it is important that it does not take its foot off the gas.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="070509115000233"></a>I shall turn briefly to the European neighbourhood policy. As to the wider neighbourhood, I agree with the report&#146;s conclusion that the EU needs an effective policy to work with countries that do not at this stage have a prospect of EU membership. The European neighbourhood policy provides a framework to engage with southern and eastern neighbours on social, political and economic reform. I agree with the committee&#146;s view that the ENP should not be viewed as an alternative to the prospect of membership for the EU&#146;s eastern neighbours, such as the Ukraine and Moldova. I say to my noble friend Lord Dubs that in the case of Moldova, the 2007 enlargement prospects have brought the EU to the border of the Black Sea region. Moldova is one of the countries that benefits from special support under the European neighbourhood policy and will receive &#8364;13 billion over the financial prospective to 2013. That investment is already producing results. There is much better support for economic and political reform, including twinning and the secondment of civil servants from the UK and other member states to help in the process. However, there is scope for the ENP to offer better incentives to partner countries, and I thank noble Lords on the committee for all the suggestions they have made. Work is going forward with EU partners to develop ideas for stronger incentives for partner countries to reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="070509115000234"></a>I agree that the prospect of EU membership can and should remain a lever for reform across Europe. There is no sense in drawing up new dividing lines; Europe has long resisted any attempt to define itself in strict geographical, cultural or religious terms, and I think that that flexibility gives it strength. Our focus should instead be to build a strong, democratic, stable neighbourhood, rather than to determine at this stage the final frontiers of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="070509115000235"></a>I cannot accept the allegation of the noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Ludgate, that there is a secret plan to import a mini-constitution by stealth. We live in a very

Many people have questioned the impact of the enlargement on EU institutions; the spring European Council showed that an EU with 27 member states can function and deliver on the issues that matter to ordinary people: energy, climate change, security and better regulation. The EU is not in a crisis. However, there are some institutional questions that need to be addressed quickly. Existing treaty commitments require us to look again at the size of the Commission now that Bulgaria and Romania have joined the EU. The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, about the number of commissioners must be resolved because there is an obligation to do that as soon as we can. We are in discussion with the German presidency and other EU partners and will consider all proposals that meet the interests of the United Kingdom and help to deliver a more effective EU. This will be an issue for discussion by all EU partners in June. I shall not add to the comments the Prime Minister made on 16 April about the idea of a conventional amending treaty because I have addressed the House on that question in the recent past.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="070509115000236"></a>The committee said that debates on the institutional structure of the EU should not put a pause on enlargement, and it is right. Candidates will be judged on their merits; to do otherwise will send negative signals, as noble Lords said. For that reason, I fully endorse the committee&#146;s conclusion on the importance of honouring our clear commitments to Turkey, Croatia and the other western Balkans countries.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="070509115000237"></a>Challenges remain and the enlargement process is not perfect, but each successive round has led to improvements. It remains the EU&#146;s most effective soft power lever to reform. The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, said that we need a good co-operative Europe as we face the difficulties and challenges&#151;economic and others&#151;from the rest of the world. Indeed, he will be right in his prediction that we will need as much unity and consistency as possible as a weight in international negotiations and processes.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="070509115000238"></a>As the committee notes, the process of enlargement has been an integral part of the EU&#146;s development over the past 50 years. As history has shown, managed properly, it offers us all many more opportunities than risks. It does not remove our obligation to be careful or to explain more to the public about the achievements. That is a difficulty in a country where Euro-sceptic media, for example, generally have nothing good to say about Europe.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="070509115000239"></a>Not all the political methods that we have for engaging in the debate seem to have the same sort of effect. There may be things that could be said, and said more effectively. The EU could certainly use a more approachable lexicon in everything that it says. As somebody who tries to study these things closely, on occasion I find it extremely difficult to follow. More important, the powerful history of creating peace as the unifying theme of modern Europe may be the key. We should not underestimate it when we try to get people of all generations to understand the steps that have been taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="070509115000240"></a>This evening&#146;s debate has been about a vision for Europe&#151;a growing area of prosperity and democracy, and decency, too. That is absolutely true. It is a work in progress; it is serious work and work worth doing.</p>
<a name="time_31"></a>

<a name="070509115000241"></a><b><a name="70509-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070509115000340"></a>Lord Grenfell:</b> My Lords, this has been a satisfying debate and I sincerely thank every one of the noble Lords who has participated in it. It is a great privilege to bring before the House a report that stimulates this kind of interest. If the numbers were a little sparse this evening, the quality of the debate was as high as ever. I thank the Minister for his thoughtful response and I thank the two Front Benches for their comprehensive comments.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="070509115000242"></a>I have one quick comment on what was said about Turkey. The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, echoed the noble Lord, Lord Roper, when he asked what the European Union would look like in 10 years&#146; time. It is an excellent question, but we also have to ask what Turkey will look like in 10 years&#146; time. Yes, it will probably have between 85 million and 90 million people, but it is a mistake to conclude that it is somehow then going to dominate the agenda in the European Union. No single country, however large it is, can dominate the agenda unless it builds a coalition to do so. That is true of Germany, it is true of Poland and it will be true of Turkey, if Turkey comes in.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="070509115000243"></a>Let us not forget that Turkey has a young, hard-working, dynamic and increasingly well educated population. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Ludgate, spoke up for them. Clearly, they will bring huge benefits to the European Union if Turkey becomes a member because they are the kind of people who can make a real contribution.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="070509115000244"></a>Lastly on Turkey, we do not need any scare stories about its masses or about thousands and thousands of Turkish workers beating on the doors here. That is not realistic. If Turkey comes in, there will almost certainly be temporary restrictions and probably quite a long transition period. It may well be around 2025 before any Turk who wants to come in will be able to. I am sure that there will be long transition periods; I may be wrong, but that is my gut feeling. We should not entertain scare stories, which some people would like to put about, about invasions of foreign workers.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="070509115000245"></a>Finally, as many noble Lords have pointed out, there will only be one more accession in this decade, which we hope will be Croatia. It may be well into the middle of the following decade, or getting close to it, before we see any more. In effect, this is a kind of pause. Those who said that that pause should not be formally declared are quite right. As one noble Lord said, it is easy to declare a pause but extremely hard to know when to end it. Let us not forget that it has to be ended by unanimity. We could be caught in a trap.</p>

<a name="70509-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="070509115000246"></a>Enlargement remains on the agenda. The fact that there is only one more accession to come in this decade does not mean that it is off the agenda. I implore noble Lords to keep it on the agenda here, too. It needs to be watched carefully, with all the attention that it deserves. It is a huge issue, even though the next accession may be some way off. We also have to watch how the new members do and

<p><a name="070509106000007"></a>Clause 31 [<I>Mayor to determine certain applications for planning permission</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="070509106000008"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070509106000183"></a>Baroness Hamwee</b> moved Amendment No. 92:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509106000151"></a> Clause 31, page 34, line 43, at end insert &#147;other than for the purposes of section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 97 to 99 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. The group also refers to Clauses 32 to 35 standing part, making it particularly odd that we start with Amendment No. 92. It is a consequential amendment, if one can start with a consequence. It opens up the issue of Section 106 on planning applications under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000010"></a>Under Clause 32, Section 106 matters&#151;planning obligations&#151;become a matter for the Mayor if he takes over an application. My opposition to Clause 32 and the other clauses dealing with planning obligations follows in part from my opposition to Clause 31 and concerns about the order on issues with which the Mayor can concern himself, which we debatedyesterday. It also comes from my view that the value of Section 106 is to the local community, and not just in straight cash terms. A community saddled with a development which it may not particularly welcome will see benefits which should strictly be related directly to the development, but can usefully extend to the community by ensuring infrastructure. The nexus between the application, the local authority and the community is particularly important.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000011"></a>The Mayor argues that the local authoritywill remain the lead authority and negotiate theSection 106 agreement. I notice that his briefingdid not suggest that Clauses 32 or 33(2) should be amended. The benefit of the obligation can fall tothe Greater London Authority. I am sure that the Minister can reassure us about money not going into some general pot. I do not think that it would, although there is a fear that that might be the case and the Mayor would grant a planning application, take the cash and use it for purposes unconnected with the particular development. I look forward to what the Minister has to say on that.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000012"></a>Local authorities working in co-operation have shown that they can do so on Section 106 as well as other matters with a cross-boundary application. The most notable example is on the applications for the Olympics and Paralympics Games sites. It is unnecessary for the Mayor to step in if the argument is that local authorities cannot work together and that they need somebody above them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000013"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509106000184"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I have three amendments which follow on from Amendment No. 92 tabled by the noble Baroness. At the outset, I should say that the whole issue of planning obligations being negotiated by the Mayor is fraught and I very much support what the noble Baroness said. Amendments Nos. 97 and 98 relate to planning obligations and raise a drafting query. A planning obligation is an obligation created by an owner of land, either unilaterally or by entering into an agreement with the local planning authority.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000014"></a>Clause 32 refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="070509106000169"></a>&#147;the function of agreeing a planning obligation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000139"></a>Local planning authorities have no such function. They may agree to enter into a planning obligation. Alternatively, they may grant planning permission, having regard to a planning obligation whether or not they themselves have entered into it. Clause 32 is therefore misconceived in thinking that there is a particular power to agreeing a planning obligation. We have proposed removing these subsections for that reason.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000015"></a>Amendment No. 99 is more significant. It supports what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has said and seeks to prevent planning obligation payments being made to the Mayor in any event. It would delete the proposals that payments under a planning obligation can be made to the Mayor of London, which we would see as inappropriate, given that the Mayor should be playing only a strategic role. We do not believe that the Greater London Authority should be able to benefit in any way from planning obligations. Since I wish to move my amendments, I would like to say that the Mayor should not have any role in the planning obligations.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000016"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070509106000185"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> There is a good deal of anxiety on the part of the City planning authority about the potential misuse of sums of money that might become available under Section 106 agreements. City developments often are very large and, consequentially, very large sums are due to be allocated under Section 106. It is naturally apprehensive that these may be put to uses that benefit perhaps the Mayor&#146;s political ambitions rather than things that will directly benefit the area concerned. In the City, Section 106 payments have been used to provide local community facilities and environmental improvements, such as enhanced street furniture and things that will undoubtedly increase the attractiveness of the City for investment and the people who work there. If there was any thought that the money would be diverted to other uses&#151;</p>

My glasses, which are very sophisticated, occasionally make noises like that. If the City planning authority thought that the money would be diverted, I think that there would be considerable anxiety. So I very much endorse the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and my noble friend Lady Hanham. We need reassurance on this and I wait with interest to hear the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000019"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070509106000188"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I intervene briefly to oppose the view that is being taken on the other side of the Committee. My view is that the Mayor of London should have the maximum possible influence on these agreements, which are in the public interest. I am not satisfied that some local authorities in London are capable of understanding the possible benefits that are attainable if these agreements are properly drawn up.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000020"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070509106000189"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> I support what my noble friend has just said. According to the briefing that I received from the Mayor of London, there is considerable support for the planning changes. He says that a recent MORI poll shows that Londoners support the proposals for the Mayor to approve major planning applications. A huge 83 per cent supported the Mayor&#146;s target that 50 per cent of all new homes should be affordable for people on low and moderate incomes. I certainly support that view. We talked about this yesterday. The amendment tends to undermine the objective of the Bill, which is to give the Mayor the powers to conduct a London-wide strategy. That should be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000021"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="070509106000190"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I thank noble Lords for a useful debate, which enables me to explore a little about why planning obligations are important and why the clause is important.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000022"></a>Amendments Nos. 92, 97, 98 and 99 all relate to removing scope for mayoral involvement in planning obligations. I do not think it will surprise Members of the Committee to hear me say that I cannot accept any of those amendments. To do so would effectively leave the Mayor unable to grant planning permission for applications that he is responsible for deciding. That would not be in the interests of applicants or the proper planning of key development proposals in London. I will come to the drafting point that the noble Baroness raised in a little while.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000023"></a>Noble Lords are well aware that there is a close and direct relationship between planning applications and planning obligations. Planning obligations are crucial to mitigating the impacts of individual development proposals, and without the mitigation provided through the obligation, in certain cases, the development would not be granted planning permission in the first place. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out the great local benefits that can come from planning obligations. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, pointed to the environmental benefits. That is absolutely the case.  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC180"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is therefore right and necessary that where the Mayor becomes responsible for determining a planning application, he also becomes responsible for agreeing any obligation related to it. That is what Clause 32 provides and what Amendments Nos. 92 and 97 would undermine.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000024"></a>The noble Baroness raised a drafting question about Clause 32 and the word &#147;agree&#148;. As I understand it, where the authority requires the obligation as a condition of the permission, it can require agreement or giving a unilateral undertaking. The wording of Clause 32 achieves that. I will ask officials to write to the noble Baroness to unpack some of that language so that there is no confusion.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000025"></a>Amendment No. 98 would remove the requirement for the Mayor to consult the relevant London borough before agreeing any planning obligation. That is consequential to Amendment No. 97 and I cannot accept that amendment, and it would hardly stand in isolation anyway. That is for some very good reasons. Many of the impacts, even on very large schemes, are still local in nature, and there can be no doubt that boroughs are best placed to advise on those issues and how and whether they might be mitigated through planning obligations. Therefore, it is right and proper that the Mayor should consult the borough before agreeing any planning obligation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000026"></a>Clause 33 provides for the Greater London Authority to receive sums of money under the terms of aSection 106 agreement, and for the Mayor to enforce the terms of such an agreement and to recover costs associated with any such enforcement action. Concerns have been raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee and Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about what that will mean. The concern has been expressed that the Mayor will seek to divert all the Section 106 moneys for his own schemes, ignoring local issues. However, I can put noble Lords&#146; minds to rest that this is simply not true. Current policy on planning obligations in England, as set out in circular 05/2005, requires fair, open and reasonable negotiation of planning obligations so that the obligations allow developments to go ahead which might otherwise have been refused.</p>
<h5><a name="070509106000177"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000027"></a>The circular states, among other factors, that planning obligations are to be sought only where they meet all the following policy tests: they must be relevant to planning; necessary to make the proposed development acceptable in planning terms; directly related to the proposed development; fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development and reasonable in all other respects.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000028"></a>In approaching the negotiation of obligations and who should be the recipient of Section 106 moneys, the Mayor, in common with the boroughs, will need to comply with these requirements and the relevant policies set out in the development plan&#151;both his London Plan and the borough&#146;s UDP or local development framework. I believe that there is enough security in those conditions to convince the Committee that Section 106 moneys are safe in that respect.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000029"></a>It may be helpful if I explain the purpose and importance of the other clauses which deal withissues related to the Mayor and planning obligations. Clause 34 expressly requires the Mayor to consult the local planning authority before exercising any enforcement power in relation to a Section 106 agreement agreed by him. The clause also amends Section 106B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to provide that where the Mayor fails to give notice of his decision in response to an application to modify or discharge a planning obligation or refuses such an application, the applicant shall have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State. The clause also provides for the Mayor to be treated as the local planning authority in relation to appeals concerning planning obligations. These powers are necessary to ensure the effective operation of the planning obligations system where the Mayor is involved as a decision-maker.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000030"></a>Finally, Clause 35 contains technical provisions relating to planning contributions under Section 46 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Section 46 of this Act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations which will enable planning contributions to be made in relation to the development or use of land in the area of a local planning authority. The LPA could be required by such regulations to set out in a document which developments and uses it will seek contributions for, where it will not seek a contribution, the purposes to which receipts from contributions may be put, either in whole or in part, and the criteria for determining the value of the contribution.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000031"></a>This clause provides a technical amendment to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to allow those regulations to provide for the making of a planning contribution where the Mayor is the local planning authority in relation to a particular application.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000032"></a>I hope that I have convinced the Committee of the very practical importance of providing for the Mayor to be responsible for planning obligations relating to planning applications he decides. I cannot accept these amendments. I hope that, given the grounds I mentioned, Members of the Committee will feel able to withdraw them.</p>

Where does the final decision lie? I envisage plenty of situations in which a local planning authority does not like the application that has been put forward in any terms at all and would turn it down if it was given the opportunity. The application would need to make a very significant contribution to the local area for the local authority&#146;s purposes. It is not always a question of money only; plenty of conditions come about through Section 106 that directly ameliorate an application. If the local authority believes that it would probably get a great deal more out of the applicants than does the Mayor, where does a final decision lie? The Mayor could approve an application that absolutely does not carry sufficient weight in Section 106 terms. Would the local authority have a right to appeal to anybody about that before the application was approved by the Mayor?</p>

As we have said, this must so far as possible be a local issue and of local benefit. To some extent, this depends a little on what decision is being taken and what stage the decision is at. As I understand it, if there is disagreement, the Mayor is responsible at the end of the day if he is the decision-taker with regard to the application. I am not entirely sure that I can go further at this point without being able to explain the context in which that might be the case, and I would prefer to write to the noble Baroness about this and about the rights of appeal, and so on. I began to explain from my notes the process that the Mayor must go through and the conditions that surround and contain those decisions, but I will write to the noble Baroness.</p>

It is very important that there is a process. This should end up being about what the local authority thinks the Section 106 agreement should be, and this should be what the Mayor implements. Otherwise, one runs into the sort of problem described by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, whereby the Mayor has his own Section 106 agreement and there is concern that the money will go elsewhere.</p>

<ul><a name="070509106000170"></a>&#147;the function of agreeing a planning obligation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000140"></a>becomes,</p>

<p><a name="070509106000142"></a>The obligation to consult suggests that he has to do no more than consult. I do not suggest that he should not listen to the local planning authority or not be required to have proper regard to what the local planning authority has to say, but the decision is clearly the Mayor&#146;s. It is a little rough on the local planning authority that the new section ends with the obligation being,</p>
<ul><a name="070509106000173"></a>&#147;enforceable by the local planning authority&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000143"></a>as the local planning authority may be stuck with enforcing something that it has not wanted in the first place.</p>

Perhaps we could consider this on Report.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000042"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="070509106000200"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> That would be good consultation practice. We discussed consultation in a different context at an earlier stage of the Bill. We would certainly like the Mayor to have to do what the noble Lord suggests every time he consults. It struck me when listening to the Minister reading out the circular that it provides for the applicant and whichever planning authority is involved in a particular situation to disagree, and if the applicant wants to agree something different, it might be possible for the applicant to do so. I am not sure where that thought is taking me, but it is buzzing around in my head as a minor worry in a part of the forest somewhere here.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000043"></a>Before I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, perhaps I may comment on the remarks made by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness opposite; that, because some local authorities do not conduct their affairs and deal with planning matters in the way that they, and possibly I, would like to see, the Mayor should deal with such issues. It is often helpful in such situations for those considering the matter to reverse the political roles and to think of a Mayor of a political complexion which is not so attractive to them. In other words, I will put it very bluntly, say that one has a Conservative mayor and a Labour local authority. Does that still apply for those who are saying that the mayor&#151;any mayor&#151;should have the rights proposed? One has to stand back and think how this would work with everyone&#146;s worse fears as to who is holding that office.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000044"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="070509106000201"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> What the noble Baroness says is perfectly acceptable if we are arguing about the office and the authority, and not the named individual and the political complexion. If it is just the process, what she says is eminently right. Also, it is perfectly possible to envisage the scenario that has been mentioned. However, we have all been around the local government circuit for some time and in this place. We must recognise not just that you win some and you lose some but that sometimes you get into a bind and you cannot ever see yourself winning. But

So far as I am concerned, we are now looking at the powers of the Mayor. The provisions in the Bill are perfectly acceptable to me. They may not be acceptable to people in the current political divisions, but that is the way it is, and I am very pleased.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000045"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="070509106000202"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Does the noble Lord agree that decisions made by the Mayor under the Bill will not last merely for a four-year term and may then be overturned, but that they will last for generations? What is approved will be seen for 50 years. That is very different.</p>

The point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, fits this issue very well. If one simply takes away the personality aspect, which is there&#151;we do not enhance our perceptions of people&#146;s intelligence if we say that it does not play any part&#151;then, as far as I am concerned, the Mayor, and of course the Mayor&#146;s office, staff and structure, would need to think very carefully if he very quickly got into a situation where he always wanted his view ultimately to prevail. That would cause a grave reaction, not just in local government but in national government. If the Mayor always won in a dispute on what was right or wrong for Greater London, whatever the effect on a local borough, that would be a very bad political judgment.</p>

From the Liberal Democrat standpoint and the clear implications of the examples used so far in Committee of two other political parties, I am giving a pretty objective point of view. But it is inevitable that in arguing from a briefing from the current Mayor, there are implications in that as well. I shall mention an example used in this debate: that of housing and the MORI poll, the results of which surprise me not a jot. People are desperately concerned about housing in London; it is the major issue in the capital. If they are asked a question which suggests that there may be a way through the horror of the lack of affordable housing, they will say &#147;Yes&#148;. One has to be careful about the conclusions one draws from any given poll.</p>

</ul>(a) the applicant;(b) the local planning authority who received the application;(c) the member of the Assembly whose constituency covers the land subject to the application;(d) no fewer than one councillor of a London borough or the Common Council whose ward covers the land subject to the application;(e) no fewer than one representative of local, amenity or environmental interests as the Mayor of London considers appropriate;(f) Transport for London;(g) any other person, including public bodies or statutory undertakers, as the Mayor of London considers appropriate.&#148;
<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000053"></a>The noble Baroness said: While it is plain that we are not great believers in the Mayor playing this strategic role in planning, if it is to happen, he has got to know how to play it properly and in the same way as a local authority would have to; that is, in the open and at a hearing which can be attended by the public, thus providing the opportunity for representations to be made by all those required to come before him. In these amendments, we seek to give the planning process so far as the Mayor is concerned greater transparency so as to foster confidence among the public in mayoral decision-making.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000054"></a>Amendment No. 94 would enshrine the right of interested parties to a hearing by the Mayor before he makes a decision. The list includes in particular the applicant and the local authority, but also makes provision for local representatives at Assembly and council level, as well as TfL and resident representatives with strong views about the application. It is important that there is both a fair hearing and the perception of a fair hearing. It is hard to argue that it should not be an explicit right of the applicant and the local authority receiving the application to present their side of the story to the Mayor in public. Perhaps the Government may be tempted to do so for logistical reasons, but if the Mayor deems that a planning application is important enough for him to determine, it must be the case that that determination should be based on a proper evaluation of all the circumstances.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000055"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 96 is to protect the openness of planning meetings themselves. I refer to planning meetings because under these amendments, and I believe even under the draft order, the Mayor will have to hold open hearings in such a way that it is apparent to applicants, local authorities and members of the public that he is considering his decision in public. The amendment follows the principle behind an amendment put forward by my honourable friends in another place, but it fleshes out the detail in response to the debates that took place several months ago.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000056"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister promised that the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 on access to information would be applied, but the present draft of the Mayor of London order does not

This amendment would add the very important obligation that meetings should be held in public.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000057"></a>As I said, transparency in decision-making is essential. It simply must be a statutory requirement that the public have the right to a hearing, as well as for the procedure to be open. That is why we believe that the hearings, or meetings&#151;whatever we want to call them&#151;should be held in public, and further that the Mayor should be compelled to give public justification for his final decision.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000058"></a>Amendment No. 102 proposes a code of conduct for the Mayor to follow when exercising any of his planning functions. It, too, is motivated by the principles of transparency, scrutiny and consistency of decision-making. These are well known in local authorities and follow a procedure that is well understood. Public and residents have access to all that decision-making, so it is essential that applications for which the Mayor is responsible are similarly enshrined in legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000059"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509106000207"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> One of the problems with housing debates is that they bring out the sharp divisions that exist between us politically. I see the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, in his place, which makes me think of the occasions over the past 20-odd years on which I have agreed with him about many issues that have come before Parliament. But when it comes to a matter like this, we are divided in our understanding of what is important in particular communities. It is unfortunate, although perhaps in part I have myself provoked some of those divisions.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000060"></a>I want to comment on something that happened during the course of our debates yesterday. There is often a sense of, &#147;Should we be dealing with specific cases or applications when considering legislation of this nature?&#148;. Sometimes we used to have that in the Commons; people would frown on constituency speeches in the context of general legislation. I have always thought that the only way you can test whether legislation is going to work is by producing concrete examples. That is why the Westminster experience is absolutely critical to the whole debate. We would do well to reflect on what has happened in Westminster when considering this area of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000061"></a>I agree completely with Amendment No. 94, just moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. Indeed, I would say to my noble friend at the Dispatch Box that I hope we take it on board. My noble friend may say that this provision is effectively already in the legislation, but I like to see things laid down in cold print so that people understand clearly what is happening, who is to be consulted, and what will be the product of that consultation. I am even marginally sympathetic to Amendment No. 96, but perhaps that is something we could return to on Report. However, I can seeno possible reason why we should not acceptAmendment No. 94 which deals with what I regard to be the very legitimate concerns of those who may be wondering what we are doing here.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000062"></a>I should like to add something to the amendment, under subsection (c), which states,</p>

<p><a name="070509106000144"></a>Going back to the Bowater application, Members of the Committee may recall that yesterday I drew attention to the problem of affordable housing provision made available offsite, perhaps half a mile or a mile away, but where local authority Members are not even aware of what is happening. That is because a Section 106 agreement is too general. The detail is in the minds of the planning officers in the authority. They know exactly what is going to happen, but what happens if the councillors in the ward where the provision is to be made are not aware of it? It is not that I object in principle to social and affordable housing provision being made all over Westminster. As I said yesterday, I am in favour of a balance in every community, but local councillors should know what is happening. The reason is this: if we are going to drive more affordable housing onsite as against offsite, you need the pressure from within the communities that are being asked to receive offsite those applications to help the authority argue the case for the affordable housing to be onsite.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000063"></a>Perhaps I could correct something that I said yesterday. I referred to a flat costing &#163;87 million. Actually, I was wrong:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509106000154"></a>&#147;London flat goes for a record &#163;100 m&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000145"></a>I quote from an article:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509106000155"></a>&#147;If you&#146;re struggling to get your foot on the property ladder spare a thought for a poor soul who is so far up it he needs an oxygen tank just to breathe. The world&#146;s most expensive flat has just been sold in London for &#163;100 million according to reports. Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister of the Gulf State of Qatar, is behind the purchase of the penthouse home in the most exclusive block in the world&#151;One Hyde Park. The apartment is one of86 luxury flats being built on the edge of Hyde Park opposite Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000146"></a>The article goes on to tell the reader how wonderful the flats are.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000064"></a>My case is very simple. The people in areas that are receiving offsite provision should be part of the lobby on the authority to drive the authority into making sure that the affordable and social housing provision is onsite. It takes us back to where we were yesterday, when the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509106000156"></a>&#147;When I saw the overall recommendation of the director of Shelter about what the percentage of affordable housing should be in such planning applications&#148;&#151;</p>

If you want to stabilise those prices, you should more equitably distribute affordable and social housing throughout the whole of the community. That is what we should be doing.

<ul><a name="070509106000176"></a>&#147;the member of the Assembly whose constituency covers the land subject to the application&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000148"></a>there is consultation with members in areas where offsite affordable and social housing provision is to be made available. That way we will develop the argument for driving affordable and social housing onsite, where it should be and should have been in the Bowater application.</p>

As the leader of a local authority, this is something for the Local Government Bill that is coming up rather than for this legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has rather gone on about one particular planning application, and I do not think that one planning application makes the whole process for London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000070"></a>There is no doubt that although I am the leader of a large council, I do not always get all the information about what is happening in my area. I represent a large constituency in Essex, and I do not get informed about all the planning applications that are happening in that patch. We ought to put it into the Local Government Bill that local authority members ought to be informed. I am trying to find mechanisms for doing that in Essex, and it means having a team of officers looking at all the information to supply to members. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said yesterday that local members did not know much detail about the planning application. There ought to be some mechanism whereby local authority members are involved. If you are not involved in planning, and you are busy looking after elderly people, you sometimes do not know about the planning applications in your patch. The noble Lord has a valid point that local authority members, certainly those for large London boroughs and large counties, do not always know what is going on in their patch. It might be different for smaller authorities. There ought to be some statutory requirement to allow elected members for that patch to know what is going on in their area.</p>

My concern is about the practical implications and how these would work in practice. For now, I shall focus on slowing down the process. Perhaps I may suggest that, rather than substantial redrafting of Clauses 31 to 35, the Government undertake to review how they have

The danger of substantial redrafting is that one lays oneself open to legal challenge on some of the proposed wording.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000072"></a>I have a specific point which relates to Amendment No. 94 and the hearings. Clearly, one wants to take account of the views expressed on all sides, but I am extremely concerned about a two-tier planning system. If the boroughs are taking hearings, will the Mayor also take hearings? Is it absolutely necessary to take them as hearings? Can they be tackled as written representations or be heard by an officer rather than the Mayor? My concern with Amendment No. 94 is one of slowing processes down, which I do not think any of us wish to do under Clauses 31 to 35. We would be very concerned if this amendment had that by-product.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000073"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070509106000212"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> While supporting the general principle of Amendment No. 94, perhaps for any future amendments I may ask the noble Baroness to remember the London-wide members of the planning authority. Paragraph (c) refers only to constituency members, which is a detail on the principle. The noble Baroness made some very important points and makes the correct distinction between hearing representations and the process of arriving at the decision, which is behind much of what she said. The hearing of representations process should be open to the public. Webcasts, new technology and so on is not the same as articulating in public how one arrives at a decision. It is precisely because of the &#147;Here is what I decided in the shower this morning&#148; scenario that the processes are really important and need to be explicit.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000074"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the important matter of a code of conduct. There is a lot of interest in how the Mayor will deal with applications in particular from functional bodies, which, as it were, are his own creatures. Local authorities have processes for dealing with their own applications. I believe that the Government share the view that the Mayor should not take over applications on which he has made a public statement, which he might have done as chair of a functional body, or about any application. I hope that the Minister will confirm that and will explain what would happen not just if the mayor takes over the application, but also where he retains a power to direct refusal, because, although the issue might not be quite as sharp, it exists.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000075"></a>I have heard the comment that it will be interesting to see whether any mayor&#151;I am personalising this, but it could probably apply to any person&#151;or his or her advisers would be able to resist commenting on particularly interesting applications. I am not aware of a mechanism to prevent a mayor taking over an application when his or her office has commented and who would police this. Perhaps the Minister can assist us. As we are all aware, the difficulty is that the holder of the office of Mayor of London does not have another politician to whom to delegate a planning decision if the Deputy Mayor is caught up in a debate. We are in the odd situation in which the current Mayor delegates to the Chief Executive of the Greater London Authority decisions on applications for the Olympic Games sites. I would be interested to hear from the Government what ought to happen when a Mayor is &#147;conflicted out&#148;.</p>

I do not propose to detain the Committee for more than a moment, but if we are to have this ping-pong, it seems appropriate that it should be two-sided rather than one. The noble Lord was my constituent&#151;indeed, an excellent one&#151;and I am delighted to say that he continues to take an interest in the affairs of Westminster.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000077"></a>I declare retrospectively an interest of long ago. I made myself extremely unpopular with my constituents in the summer of 1978 when I was serving on the Finance Bill. An amendment was tabled proposing that Arabs should not be allowed to buy houses in London; and, notably, that they should not be allowed to buy them in the centre of London. As a Back-Bench Member of the Committee, I argued that that was wholly wrong; that we had always run a maritime and open society and that we were in danger of being retaliated against if we did not allow others to trade in this country&#151;or, indeed, to live here&#151;though they had the right to do so. I am conscious that in not supporting that Back-Bench amendment in 1978 I may be in some small part responsible for the upsurge in London house prices 30 years later.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000078"></a>The point has been made, rightly, that we should not in this Bill legislate for a particular man or for a particular council. We should be producing legislation that can be understood and interpreted, and followed and used, by all the councils in the land. I am in no sense being defensive about the issue. As I said yesterday, I have no brief from Westminster City Council and I hold no brief for it. It must resolve the dilemmas of running its planning policy in a central London area where Russians and Arabs appear to wish to live in significant quantities, and it has to cope with that as best it can.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000079"></a>Perhaps I may say in defence of the Government that they have seen fit to knight the leader of Westminster City Council, which an unusual decision by any Government in the context of a local government leader of a party other than their own. Westminster has consistently been among the 24 best administered local authorities in the country under the Audit Commission.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000080"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="070509106000214"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This has been an important debate on an important set of issues. I entirely share the intention behind many of these amendments. We are all agreed that there must be openness and transparency in the way that the Mayor makes decisions on planning applications. While I cannot accept all these amendments, I hope that I can demonstrate that there is not a large gap between us.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000081"></a>I agree that it is crucial that the manner in which the Mayor makes decisions on planning applications is robust and transparent and is seen to be so by the public. It is good for him, it is good for the process and it is certainly good for London. That is the case, not least so that the Mayor, as a democratically elected decision maker, can be held accountable for his decisions. I turn first therefore to subsections (1)  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and (2) of Amendment No. 96. They would require the Mayor to exercise his powers to direct refusal, or to determine planning applications, in public meetings. While, as I have said, openness and transparency are important, the manner in which decisions are made is equally important because who is making the decision makes a difference.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000082"></a>These decisions will be made by a single person rather than a committee, as is the case with the local planning authority. That is were some elements of the provision become surreal because a single decision-maker making a decision may simply sit in silence reading the papers and reports and considering the issues. There will not be a debate, other than perhaps an internal one, such as that which takes place in planning committees. To put it simply, there is nothing for an audience to see. That is why we consider that it would be wholly artificial to require the Mayor to take his or her decisions in public. However, we share common ground on some aspects of the amendment. We have previously agreed that any meetings at which the Mayor hears from the applicant, the relevant borough or other parties will be open to the public.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000083"></a>The amendment also seeks to apply to the Mayor the provisions of Part 5A of the Local Government Act 1972 on openness and access to information that apply to local planning authority decision-making. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, rightly said, I did say on Second Reading that we are committed to applying the relevant principles of the 1972 Act, and will do so through the Mayor of London order. I cannot give the precise details at the moment, as they are currently being drafted, but I will be in a position to say more on Report.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000084"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, asked what constitutes a hearing. When we talk about hearings, we do not mean court hearings or planning inquiries; we are saying simply that the Mayor must hear the representations from the applicants, the local authorities, and so on, which he chooses to allow. They do not imply cross-examination.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000085"></a>Amendment No. 94 proposes a list of individuals and organisations, to be set out in the Bill, which must be given an opportunity to be heard by the Mayor before he determines a planning application. Again, there is no substantive difference between us on the principle of the amendment, which I hope assures my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours; we differ on how best to achieve this. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, spoke about delays in procedure and the need to be flexible. Let me be clear that we think it more appropriate to set out any detail in this area in secondary legislation rather than in the Bill. In doing so, noble Lords might recognise that we have gone further than the requirements that we place on local planning authorities, which are not required to hear representations from parties at planning committee meetings.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000086"></a>We also agree that it is necessary to be clear about who could be involved in decisions on applications decided by the Mayor. However, other than setting  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC192"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some basic minima, which might include hearing from the applicant and the relevant London borough, should they so wish, we do not think that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to dictate to the Mayor lists of people from whom he must hear. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, have already given us various candidates to be added to those lists. We must remember that the Mayor is not some unelected quango; he is directly elected and directly accountable for his own actions. He will therefore be well aware of the high level of scrutiny given to his exercise of his powers. It is not in his interests to follow secretive practices. Subject to setting the basic minima, it is right that the issue should be left to him. However, to ensure that there is clarity, we will require the Mayor to publish a document setting out those persons whom he will permit to appear before him and to be heard, and we have provided for this in Article 10 of the draft Mayor of London order. I suspect that there will be agreement in the Committee on this, which is why, in common with our proposal, the amendment provides discretion for the Mayor to choose to allow other parties to speak as he thinks is relevant and necessary.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70509-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000087"></a>For the same reasons, we do not think that it is necessary to set out detailed requirements for how the Mayor will exercise his powers through a code of conduct, as sought by Amendment No. 102. However, under Article 10 of the draft mayoral order, we require the Mayor to prepare a document setting out the procedures to be followed for considering oral representations. We also propose to require the Mayor to give at least 14 days&#146; notice of any hearing and to publish agendas and relevant reports and other documents at least seven days ahead of that meeting. In addition, we will publish a revision of Circular 1/2000, which deals with strategic planning in London and which will give clear guidance that reinforces many of the messages that I have set out today and previously. These are sensible safeguards.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000088"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, made the general point about potential conflicts of interest, where there is some difference between parties. We do not expect a mayor who has a conflict of interest, or who has expressed his public support or, indeed, opposition for an application, to decide that application. That is the bottom line and fundamental to the clear principle of natural justice, which underpins the law of planning. However, I will read carefully what she said. In any case, many technical questions were raised.</p>

She said &#147;we&#148;. I presume that &#147;we&#148; means my noble friend. The brief probably says &#147;Resist&#148; and the civil servants will have made a recommendation that we should not proceed on this list of persons and/or organisations. Who is consulted as to whether we should resist this amendment? Were the boroughs or the Mayor of London consulted? Who is actually objecting to a list of that nature being drawn up? The list is very clear  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC193"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and sets out precisely those who at least would know they have a statutory right to have their case heard over any discretion or guide. My noble friend referred to a &#147;note&#148; or &#147;guidelines&#148; that the Mayor might be required to produce. Who actually is resisting this? Would my noble friend perhaps take the matter back to the department to consider whether it is possible to go down that route?</p>

<p><a name="070509106000090"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509106000216"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> In my experience of dealing with legislation in this House, there is nearly always an argument about putting any list in a Bill. Lists can be exclusive, and there is constant pressure to add or subtract people, institutions or organisations. Having something in the Bill makes it, by definition, difficult to amend and more rigid. That is one reason why we specify in secondary legislation that there is a better opportunity to be more responsive and flexible.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000091"></a>I will repeat what we said because it deals with what the noble Lord wants to improve on. We will require the Mayor to publish a document setting out those persons he would permit to appear before him and be heard. We have provided for that in the draft order. That achieves a balance between us not dictating to the Mayor and ensuring that he is under genuine discipline to determine to whom he will listen. I think that that is the proper balance.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000092"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070509106000217"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> On the issue of decisions being made in public, perhaps I may put something into the Minister&#146;s mind. Traditionally, applications are heard by local planning authorities, which have public agendas containing recommendations from planning officers. Those are known by everyone who attends the meeting&#151;the applicant, members of the public and members of the committee. They can listen to a debate between members who may or may not accept the recommendations made by planning officers. One hopes&#151;although it is not always the case&#151;that their reasons, particularly for rejection, are clear in that debate; that the debate will be minuted; and, indeed, that the committee clerk will insist on the clear reason being part of the minute.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000093"></a>We have a very different situation here. Of course it is difficult to provide for an individual to take a decision at a particular point and not to have thought about the thing before. That is nonsense. Members of the planning committee going to a meeting will have considered the issue. I know that the Secretary of State will take a decision if he calls in an application. However, in the very unusual situation of an individual taking the decision, it seems to me that we must try to be imaginative about making the whole of the decision process as accessible as possible. That is the thought. I come to my question because I realise that I am not clear about the matter from the draft order or from what the Minister said. What will be the extent of the decision to be published by the Mayor? It is one thing when he refuses an application now; I think that it is qualitatively different when he may approve an application. Will he be required to issue a decision letter or decision notice setting out the reasoning in the same way as the Secretary of State normally does?</p>

The Minister referred to the matter when she said that the Mayor is a single decision-maker. I do not refer to his being a single decision-maker as regards somebody putting up a chicken shed in their back garden but rather on an application to build something which may comprise an enormous tower block of considerable proportions that will affect an enormous number of people. In order to make that decision, he must be seen to have taken into account everything that anybody wants to say to him that might affect the ultimate decision.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000095"></a>I shall deal first with Amendment No. 94. I hear what the Minister says about not creating lists but that has been done in much legislation. The Government may have resisted that but a lot of legislation contains lists. I like my list and I like it better than the draft order, which simply states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509106000157"></a>&#147;The Mayor must prepare and publish a document setting out a list of any persons whom he will permit to appear before him&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509106000149"></a>The Mayor cannot be placed in the position of permitting somebody to come before him. He should not be allowed to make the decision on that basis. There must be a cohort of people who are entitled to come and give their views on an application. They are contained in the list in Amendment No. 94. I would prefer to see that list in the legislation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000096"></a>The Minister says that the provision will appear in secondary legislation. Presumably, it will be affirmative secondary legislation so that we shall have the chance to discuss it. However, as the Minister is very well aware&#151;as are we&#151;the number of changes that ever get made to secondary legislation is absolutely miniscule. Therefore, we must get this right in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000097"></a>As I say, I am attracted to my amendment, which will appear again at a later stage. I hope that we shall have the opportunity to consider further how we can get it included in the legislation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000098"></a>I also hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, said about not holding things up. However, if this process is just to be seen as a developer&#146;s &#147;quick-me-up&#148;, the whole thing ought to be stopped at this stage. I know that there is pressure from developers to quicken the planning process and that they face difficulties when they have to make applications to more than one borough. However, the process works perfectly well. Boroughs have to say what their views are on an application on many occasions. The process must not be seen as one which aims simply and solely to get developers&#146; plans up and running more quickly. It must be seen as so important that it is above and beyond the local boroughs dealing with it. If that is what the Government believe should happen, the process should be at that level&#151;absolutely at the height of importance. It must not be just a case of a developer believing that something is important and wanting to get it moving. The process will have to ensure that people have the right to give their views. Those views should be seen to be taken into account extremely seriously. The question I have not asked the Minister, which is not yet clear in this  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC195"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clause, is whether there is, presumably, a right of appeal to the Secretary of State over the Mayor&#146;s decision. If not, there will be by the time we have finished the Bill. There must be a right of appeal, as is currently in legislation on any planning application.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000099"></a>This is very important. It takes local authorities&#146; current powers to determine applications out of their hands and puts them into those of one person. Whether that person is advised by a whole host of town planning advisers or not, the decision ultimately rests on his shoulders. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, the trouble is that any planning permission will not melt away like the snows of winter: we are stuck with it for ever more. As the applications are likely to be of considerable size, decisions must be seen to be taken against a background of best possible practice. We are trying to ensure that we get a requirement in the Bill that the Mayor conform to best possible practice, that he is seen to be the one taking the decision and does not delegate it to an officer of the Greater London Authority. I am sure that he will have to talk to an officer, but he should have to make that decision himself in public, before those who wish to come and hear it. Again, I would expect that decision not to be issued by letter but in person. The Mayor must be up front with this, and be the person seen to be taking it&#151;he is the only elected person, as the Minister has said&#151;so that when the trial date comes, people know who is there and who has made the decision.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000100"></a>I have spelt out as clearly as I can the points behind these amendments. I have no doubt that that we will come back to them at the next stage.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000101"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070509106000219"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I will reply quickly to two points. On the other constraints around the Mayor and the requirement upon him to be open, he must publish all relevant information seven days ahead of any meeting so that there is good notice of the content and purpose of the meeting. He must also publish sufficiently detailed reasons for his decision under the general development procedure order. There is already a requirement upon him to do that.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000102"></a>On the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, there is a right of appeal against any refusal he should make, governed by planning laws as all local planning authorities are. On the order and the notion of who will speak, we have in general gone further than local planning authorities. Local planning authorities can choose who they allow to speak; some do not allow anyone to come and speak at their planning committees. By doing what we are, we are going beyond that. As the noble Baroness concluded in her speech, however, the Mayor is directly elected. That is one reason why things are done slightly differently. I look forward to having this debate again on Report.</p>

We have had other debates on this over the other strategies. I am sure that the Minister&#146;s answer will be similar to those, but it is

It is important, in going through the Bill, that each of these strategies should be carefully considered.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000120"></a>Amendment No. 100 would alter the thrust of the relevant provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. It would give the boroughs vital and highly desirable freedom to deviate from the London Plan where appropriate. It would retain the requirement to have regard to the overall strategy, which would therefore rightly remain a factor in development plans, but would ensure that there was no over-arching strategy which could override any special or regional considerations for the borough.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000121"></a>While Amendment No. 100 relates to the old unitary development plans, the new clause in Amendment No. 101 would remove the obligation for new development plan documents under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 to be in general conformity with the spatial development plan or London Plan. There is already an existing duty for these documents to have regard to the strategy under Section 19 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. This position, deemed appropriate by the Government only three years ago, is more suitable and flexible. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070509106000122"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="070509106000226"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> As the noble Baroness has said, Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 principally relate to the requirement, for borough unitary development plans and local development documents respectively, to be in general conformity with the spatial development strategy. Simply put, they would amend the Town and Country Planning Acts in a manner that does not have much to do with the provisions of the Bill we have brought forward.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000123"></a>Amendment No. 100 was tabled in the other place but not discussed. The practical outcome of these amendments would be to diminish the requirement for boroughs to look beyond their borders and do their part in helping to meet the wider challenges faced by London for housing and other development. We had a major debate on that yesterday, covering both planning and housing. The noble Baroness will not be amazed that I cannot accept her changes.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000124"></a>I will explain why the principle of general conformity is so important. As I said earlier in Committee, we have a plan-led system in England and Wales with a hierarchy of development plans setting the framework of policies against which individual development proposals are considered. At the national level, the Government publish planning statements setting out key policies that must be taken into account at the regional and local level in preparing development plans.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000125"></a>The London Plan is the strategic plan for London, creating an overarching framework for development in the capital. The London boroughs are closely involved in its preparation and the requirement for general conformity is intended to ensure that unitary development plans and now local development frameworks at the local level take proper account of wider regional and national priorities. Again, I am going to repeat myself: general conformity does not mean that there must be slavish adherence to the  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>London Plan. Planning Policy Statement 12, which sets out the Government&#146;s policy on preparing local development frameworks, makes it absolutely clear that the test is of general conformity and not one of conformity. By that we mean that only where an inconsistency or omission in a borough plan would cause significant harm to the implementation of the London Plan would it be considered not to be in general conformity. The fact that a borough plan is inconsistent with one or more policies in the London Plan, either directly through the omission of a policy or proposal, does not mean that the plan itself is not in general conformity. The test is how significant is the inconsistency from the point of view of the delivery of the plan.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000126"></a>I want to make an important point here: it is not the Mayor who is the final arbiter of general conformity, it is the independent inspector who examines the borough&#146;s draft plan. The Mayor can give his formal opinion to the examination of whether he considers the plan to be in general conformity, but it is the inspector who determines the issue. Outside this Bill, as an administrative change, we intend that the Mayor&#146;s opinion on general conformity should be the starting point for the inspector&#146;s consideration of local development frameworks, but again that does not affect the fact that general conformity, while it is an important principle, allows for local distinctiveness and difference.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000127"></a>I turn now to subsection (8) of proposed new clause set out in Amendment No. 100, which certainly does relate to the provisions of this Bill. It would remove the existing power of the Mayor to direct a borough to refuse a planning application that was contrary to the London Plan. Not surprisingly, I cannot accept this either. The Mayor is responsible for ensuring that the strategic planning interests of London are taken into account in the policies and decisions of the London boroughs. The success or otherwise of many London Plan policies will depend on the decisions made on individual planning applications. The Mayor&#146;s power to direct a borough to refuse a planning application if it is contrary to the London Plan has proved in the past to be an appropriate and useful tool, preventing development that goes against sound strategic planning in London. Again, as I said previously, it is to the credit of the Mayor that he has exercised this power with great care and restraint. Over six years, there have been 18 directions across London, an average of three a year. That is hardly a heavy-handed use of the power.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000128"></a>We are convinced that this power has proved itself and we propose to maintain it under the new arrangements in the Bill. Where the Mayor exercises his new power to take jurisdiction of an application, he will need to approach it with an open mind and subsequently could either approve or refuse it. However, as now, there will be occasions when, having followed the progress of an application and considered all the relevant issues, there is no doubt in the Mayor&#146;s mind that the application in its current form should not be given planning permission. Maintaining the power to direct refusal without having to go through the process of taking over

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000129"></a>Subsection (9) is consequential on subsection (8). It would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to award costs against the Mayor or other parties for unreasonable behaviour on a planning appeal arising out of a mayoral direction to a borough to refuse an application. Following on the fact that I cannot accept subsection (8), I cannot accept this subsection either. The ability to award costs is undoubtedly a powerful disincentive against unreasonable behaviour, whether on the part of the Mayor or any other party, and we need to retain it.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000130"></a>With that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will be persuaded that she can safely withdraw her amendment.</p>

It demonstrates the gulf between us over what the Mayor should be able to do with regard to overriding local boroughs, particularly in the controversial area of planning, an area about which most boroughs can feel very wound-up, to put it that way.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070509106000132"></a>I hear what the Minister says. I am very conscious that we will probably break quite soon for a Statement in the House, but I shall just draw attention again to what I said when I spoke to Amendment No. 101. Amendment No. 100 would amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and all the documents and development plans that come out of it will gradually be phased out, although not very quickly. As I said earlier in our proceedings, I understand that only two local development frameworks have been fulfilled within the timescale. Many, many more will dance up the line at some stage, but the unitary development plans will be in place for a very considerable time. There is an existing duty for documents to have regard to the strategy, which seems merely to conform to my amendment.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000005"></a>The noble Baroness said: It is nice to be facing the Minister again; it is like old times. AmendmentNo. 103 proposes that the Mayor should prepare a water and sewerage strategy for London. It is in some senses surprising that the Bill, which gives the Mayor so many new powers and influence in almost every other field, does not give him any say in utilities, and particularly in water.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000006"></a>It is well known that there is an unusually high level of water usage in London compared to other parts of the country. London&#151;particularly last year&#151;frequently faces water shortages which do not always follow the national weather pattern. Therefore, it seems that this is one area that would benefit greatly from having a genuinely strategic overview.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000007"></a>There are many ways in which a strategy could benefit the city. It could impact particularly on future developments. We have previously had discussions about whether there was proper water planning for the new developments down in Thames Gateway and on down into Essex, and have said that all new developments should be required to be water neutral if possible. It would be possible, with the help of a strategy, to ensure that new homes are fitted with highly water-efficient appliances, and it would oblige developers to offset the water their developments use by paying for water-saving equipment to be installed in existing houses. I think that means meters. Equally, more funding could be made available to mend leaking pipes. That is a terrible problem in London. Also much emphasis could be put on behavioural change by prioritising water reduction.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000008"></a>It would also appear that a water and sewerage strategy would complement well the Mayor&#146;s new climate change and energy strategy. We appreciate the force of the argument that such a strategy could impact on residents outside the area of control in London, but we do not believe that that would be a negative impact. The same must be true of a number of the other strategies being put forward, not least on climate change and energy, where it is hard to see how the Mayor will be able to construct a plan that is truly related to London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000009"></a>Most of the benefits of the proposed water and sewerage strategy would derive from heightened awareness and changes to future developments. Therefore, it will affect only the residents and developers of London, rather than all bill-paying customers of Thames Water, as was suggested by the Government in another place. This is one area where we believe a strategy for the Mayor would be welcome. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000010"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509116000190"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I support Amendment No. 103 and speak to Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 in the name of my noble friends. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, gave very good reasons why the Mayor should have a water strategy. I want to endorse that and to add another I think very good reason. Support for the Mayor to have a water strategy comes not only from all five parties represented on the London Assembly, but from the Mayor and, perhaps even more remarkably, in a joint letter written two weeks ago to the Secretary of State, signed by both the Mayor and the then chairman of the London Assembly. That is an almost unique event.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000011"></a>I will read that letter to the Secretary of State, as it is fairly brief:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509116000159"></a>&#147;There is a strong case for the Mayor to have statutory strategic powers in relation to water issues in the capital, particularly in terms of London&#146;s sustainability and the city&#146;s response to the challenges of climate change. It is vitally important that links are made between water, waste, energy and buildings. Placing the water strategy on the same statutory basis as the London Plan and the Mayor&#146;s environmental strategies would go some way to achieving this. We therefore ask you to re-think the Government&#146;s position on this issue so that the GLA Bill includes provision for a statutory Mayoral water strategy by the time it completes its passage through the House of Lords&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000012"></a>That letter was written and signed by both the Mayor and the chairman of the Assembly with the agreement of all the parties in the Assembly. That is nearly as powerful an argument in support of it as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. I hope therefore that the Government will give serious consideration to it and if they are not able to accept the amendment today that they will at least not close the door&#151;I was going to say turn the tap off&#151;to it and will give further thought to how such a unified position can be recognised as the Bill pursues its passage through the House.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000013"></a>Amendment No. 119 would give the London Assembly power to require the water and energy regulators to appear before it to be questioned and to give evidence. In fact, Ofwat has appeared before the Assembly and its committees, and it has given welcome and helpful written evidence as well, which is good. I hope that always, as is usually the case, people will appear voluntarily without the need for a

For the reasons that the noble Baroness gave in moving her amendment, this is now such an important issue to Londoners and to London that it must be right that the representatives of London on the scrutiny body, the London Assembly, have the right to question and to take evidence from the regulators. This amendment would give the Assembly that statutory right, rather than having to rely, as we have thus far, on voluntary agreement to do so. Indeed, should there ever be such difficulties&#151;I hope that will never happen&#151;it might be quite important to be able to require the regulator to appear if he were unwilling to do so.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000014"></a>Amendment No. 120 requires the Mayor to include in his environment report the efficiency of suppliers of water and energy. We had some discussion earlier of lists, but Section 351(3) of the GLA Act lists11 things which the Mayor is already required to include in his environment report, all of which are important. They include such things as noise and litter. The efficiency of suppliers of water in particular, but also energy, is now at least on a par in importance to Londoners and for London as litter and noise. They are important, and I am not suggesting that they should be taken out, but that this should be put in. The latter part of the amendment would require the Mayor to consult those suppliers before producing the environment report.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000015"></a>The three amendments in this group stand on their own merits and are not dependent one on the other. I hope that the Minister will be able to give at least a favourable response to all three amendments.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000016"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070509116000191"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I support Amendment No. 103 but not Amendment No. 119. I declare an interest as a member of the board of the Environment Agency and as a former member of the board of Ofwat. Amendment No. 103 seems very sensible, and apparently it has, uniquely in this debate, the support of all institutions in London and all political parties in London. From the interface between water strategy and environmental duties, particularly the new climate change duties, it seems obvious that water should form a part of the Mayor&#146;s strategic responsibilities. It is of course true that the Thames Water region and the Thames Water company stretch beyond London. The final version of any such amendment would have to pay some recognition to the fact that a strategy which related to the supply of water would also have to liaise with bodies outside the GLA area. Nevertheless, it is an important part of the Mayor&#146;s environmental duties.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000017"></a>I oppose Amendment No. 119, but not because I do not think that Ofwat and Ofgem should appear before the committee. They should, but on a voluntary basis as has always been the case in the past. To make an independent regulator clearly subject to a requirement to appear before a scrutiny body of a local authority&#151;perhaps a big local authority or a regional authority&#151;distorts the role of the regulator. I do not therefore support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Tope.</p>

I have to say that they are very seductive. The letter of 26 April was brief and to the point. As the noble Lord said, it was signed by two important people. A reply, which is somewhat lengthier than the original letter, has been sent. I suspect that the gist of what I will say is in the reply. It does not completely close the door, but we certainly do not feel that we can accept the amendments.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000019"></a>As the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 103 would give the Mayor a duty to produce and keep under review a water and sewerage strategy that includes proposals and policies for making sure that the water and sewerage infrastructure is able to cope with the &#147;actual and planned&#148; developments. I fully note what the noble Baroness said about planned developments. This would, in effect, purport to make the Mayor another water regulator in an already fully-regulated area. The water sector in England has three core regulators: namely, Ofwat in relation to economic regulation; the Drinking Water Inspectorate looks after water quality; and the Environment Agency is responsible for water resources and the environment in its widest sense.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000020"></a>In terms of development, the Environment Agency is already a statutory consultee on sewerage infrastructure, and water and sewerage companies are consulted at local level when new developments are being considered. Water companies also have a fairly new statutory duty to produce 25-year water resource management plans that make provision for future developments. Development issues relating to water and sewerage are already very much under consideration by the regulators and the companies themselves. Having been in the ODPM and partly responsible at one time for the four growth areas and then the three, I well understand the reasons for that. I understand the approach of the fairly large-scale construction in the wider south-east where the infrastructure is more than the roads; it is also the social infrastructure. The utility infrastructure is crucial and to keep water as neutral as possible is very important. These developments do not take place without the planning and knowledge of water resources, but we are looking at the four major growth areas of the south-east over a 25-year period with the water resource management plans produced by the companies. This is an important, ongoing issue, which has not been parked away and forgotten about.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000021"></a>The regulation of water is far more complicated than the other utilities. As has been indicated, it is based on water areas which are based on the river catchment boundaries rather than political or administrative boundaries. It is a constant reminder of my former constituency and the people of Wales where most of the water is in the Severn Trent area and is not relevant to the Assembly. That is the way it has to be because of the geography. Any policies or proposals that meant an increase in expenditure in London by the four regional monopolies operating in the area would have an impact on water bills outside the London area, right across the south-east of England. So it is well beyond the Mayor&#146;s jurisdiction. I am not saying that that is the sole reason, but it is an important factor which has to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000022"></a>We understand that the Mayor intends to produce a non-statutory water action framework for London, which could usefully add to the debate on water resources and efficiency. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said in opening, that could be useful in opening the debate on the activities&#151;I am putting this as politely as I can&#151;of Thames Water. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already reaffirmed in his reply to the letter that he will take the Mayor&#146;s water action framework into account in the run-up to the next price review for the water sector.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000023"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 119. The case has been made for me by my noble friend Lord Whitty. This amendment would give the Assembly new powers to require the water regulators to appear. For water this would include Ofwat, the Environment Agency, the Secretary of State because of his responsibility for drinking water quality through the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and Ofgem to cover the energy aspects. Currently the Assembly has powers to summon certain categories of people to give evidence at its meetings, but they are persons with whom the Assembly has direct relationships such as contractors and those in receipt of financial grants. The new proposal is very wide-ranging and would set a precedent that significantly widens the power of the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000024"></a>The Assembly does not have a direct relationship with the regulators, and while I fully accept that it is an important body, the regulators are accountable to Parliament, not to local or regional government. That is the way it ought to remain. Because of the monopoly positions brought about by various privatisations, the regulators have been set up through careful legislation under both Administrations, and they are answerable to Parliament on a broad and regular basis. Indeed, this House recently established an ad hoc Select Committee on regulators. Ofwat, Ofgem and some of the water and energy representatives have submitted evidence and appeared before that committee to inform its inquiry into economic regulation. We think that Ofgem and Ofwat&#146;s parliamentary accountability is sufficient and that it would not serve any useful purpose to replicate that on a statutory basis.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000025"></a>Amendment No. 120 would require the Mayor to report in his State of the Environment Report on the efficiency of the supplies of water and energy services in the Greater London area. At this point we are unclear about what value the new reporting requirement would add. The Mayor is already required to report on water quality, emissions into water, ground-water levels, energy consumption, emissions of greenhouse gases and any other matters related to Greater London which he considers appropriate. This requirement ensures that the Mayor will report on fundamental energy and water issues relating to London. It is a crucial factor because it gives him the opportunity to comment, for example, on the leakage record of Thames Water, a matter of ongoing concern over quite a period of time. The amendment would in effect duplicate the work carried  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC205"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out by the economic regulators for these sectors. Extensive reports on the efficiency of water companies and the operation of the energy wholesale and supply markets are already produced by Ofwat and Ofgem respectively. We believe that the interests of London water and energy consumers are already defended by Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water, Ofgem and, pending the creation of a new consumer body to replace it, EnergyWatch. The Secretary of State has also directed the Consumer Council for Water to maintain a statutory regional committee in the Thames area. We believe that this amendment would simply create additional bureaucracy and waste public funds without bringing any clear benefit for water and energy customers in London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000026"></a>I do not want it to be thought that these amendments are being dismissed without proper consideration; these are important issues. I want to repeat that the cornerstone of utility regulation since privatisation has been the principle of independent economic regulation to provide the stability necessary to create investment.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000027"></a>There have been huge investments in the utilities infrastructure since privatisation, running to billions of pounds. While input from the Mayor and the Assembly is useful as part of a wider debate, political interventions have to be kept to the absolute minimum. That is why Parliament is the right place to monitor the independent regulators and to scrutinise the policy of decisions relating to energy and water. I am sorry to arrive in the Committee and provide what will be a damp squib, but it is no good trying to sugar coat it.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000028"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070509116000193"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply. With reference to Amendment No. 119, the requirement to appear before the Assembly, it was an expected reply, but the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in his slip of the tongue when speaking against that amendment, illustrated part of the problem. He described the GLA as local government; then he recognised that in fact it is not local government. That is reminiscent of when he had to take the original Bill through the House eight years ago and was careful to point out to us time and again that the GLA was not going to be local government, certainly not as we know it. It could not be regional government, because we do not have that in England. I seem to remember that he settled for &#147;a unique form of government&#148;, so we have unique government in London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000029"></a>The GLA is the best or the nearest we have to devolved government in England, for the time being at least. I recognise that the amendment breaches a principle to which the Government held firm for the past seven or eight years, and I expected no answer other than the one that I got. Sooner or later, a central government or even Parliament will have to recognise that if we are truly to have devolved government in England&#151;in this case in London Assembly&#151;and if devolution is to mean anything, the devolved body will have to have the ability to require people to appear before it other than those who are part of what we now call the GLA family, in other words those for whom it has a legal responsibility. The issue has to be grasped sooner or later. I would  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have thought that a Bill giving at least limited greater powers to the devolved authority, as I shall call it, was a good opportunity to do that. Whether this is the amendment on which to base that may well be a subject for further debate, but the issue of principle has to be faced.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000030"></a>I leave a thought with the Minister and with all noble Lords. None of us question accountability to Parliament, but there is a difference between accountability, which is right, and answerability. If London&#146;s government are to fulfil their function effectively, many of these bodies, including in this case the regulators, need at least to be answerable if not accountable to the devolved body.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000031"></a>I will not pursue the argument much longer on Amendment No. 120. I accepted that the phrase, &#147;may contain information about any other matters&#148; is a catch-all, and it could well include the efficiency or otherwise of the water suppliers, but in the eight years since we passed the original Act, issues of water supply and water leakage have become even more prominent. Listing it as the 12th item and thereby making it a requirement rather than something that the Mayor can include if he wishes would give it the importance the issue deserves and occupies in the minds of Londoners, especially if we have another summer like the one last year.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000032"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070509116000194"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for his reply, which was not totally unexpected. However, in terms of the Bill, it was quite surprising because practically every other major area of development is now governed by strategies from the Mayor. He is dabbling his fingers in everywhere, from housing to planning to climate change&#151;why not water, which is probably one of the most important issues for people in London? It is only by the grace of God that it rained so much&#151;I really mean that&#151;in the autumn and we got all the reservoirs full, so London does not have a hosepipe ban. I did not notice any very great amount of commentary at the time about where the extra water was going to come from, if the situation had remained as it was last summer, to deal with all the new developments on the edges around London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000033"></a>A major reason why it would be useful to have the Mayor involved in the strategy would be to put pressure on him to be open and honest with Londoners about the situation. We all know about pipes floating in their own water underground; we often seen them cascading and bursting through the road. We know that it is a huge problem. The water companies say that they will invest, but also that nobody really wants it and people are afraid of having their roads dug up. The Mayor having a strategy to ensure that parts of London must be put right under his watch would be enormously helpful. We are looking at London and the south-east of England as the main recipients of the necessary development of a million houses over the next decade or so. Plans must be in place, in conjunction with the Mayor of London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000034"></a>I hear what the Minister says. We will probably be facing each other again on this. For today, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000035"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000037"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 120C. The Public Bill Office has pointed out that these amendments would be better drafted as amendments to the Greater London Authority Act 1999. I give notice that that is what we will do next time, rather than re-tabling them as they are.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000038"></a>When the Government announced their final proposals for additional powers for the Mayor and Assembly in July 2006, they decided against creating a single waste authority&#151;we have no disagreement with that&#151;but also that there should be a London-wide waste and recycling forum. The Government policy statement said that this was,</p>
<ul><a name="070509116000180"></a>&#147;to bring stakeholders together to deliver improved performance on waste minimisation and recycling, promote collaborative action and link waste with other London priorities around climate change, transport and employment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070509116000144"></a>There is not a lot of punctuation in that and it is all in inverted commas; somebody must have written it somewhere. The forum would also administer a fund of &#163;25 million from April 2008. The fund would consist of &#163;19 million diverted from local authority waste funding, currently provided through the waste performance and efficiency grant, and &#163;6 million from the Greater London Authority.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000039"></a>Much of the debate in the other place on waste in this Bill focused on amendments which sought to create a single waste authority&#151;we will come to that in a minute&#151;in the form of a functional body of the Greater London Authority controlled by the Mayor.  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Today, we have a slightly different proposal from the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, which will nevertheless create a single waste authority for London. However, all this debate on a single waste authority has obscured the fact that it is now almost 10 months since the Government announced that the London waste and recycling forum would be created. Thereis no sign of this new body or any indication of how it is to be set up, nor has there been any word on what is happening about the new fund which the forum would administer.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000040"></a>When taken with Amendment No. 120C, the amendment would ensure that the fund and forum actually happen. London Councils, the representative body of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London, has briefed us on this. It is keen to see the forum. There is great frustration at London Councils that nothing has happened, and great concern that as time ticks away, it will become difficult to start spending the fund when the money becomes available in April 2008.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000041"></a>There are four reasons why I propose a specific statutory provision. First, if there is to be a forum and fund, it makes sense to have an incorporated body of some sort which is publicly accountable. The Government have not made clear how they will do this. By creating a clear legal status for the forum, they avoid having an unincorporated body taking decisions on grant funding of projects. Secondly, the amendments would ensure that boroughs have a majority of members on the body which determines the allocation of the fund. This money would largely have otherwise gone directly to the boroughs, so they should have the major say in the operation of the forum and fund. Thirdly, they would ensure the creation and continuity of a London-wide body to consider strategic issues related to waste and to administer a London waste and recycling fund, but would do so in a way which keeps the waste collection and disposal functions in borough-led bodies. Fourthly, they would ensure that there are explicit powers to enable operation of the fund and for the Government to support the fund. This means there is no doubt about the status of the money.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000042"></a>The Government have made it clear that they think there should be some kind of strategic overview body in London but that this should not have actual disposal functions. My amendments seek to place this on a statutory footing. I beg to move.</p>

The sooner such a forum&#151;which I know is in the Government&#146;s mind&#151;is in operation, the better. The Mayor says in his briefing to noble Lords that the concept of a forum is neither new nor ambitious. That may be the case, but let us have an organisation which the parties are committed to, both personally and through the legislation, that requires them to make it work. When we debate the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, I shall comment on what I think the Mayor&#146;s role can be. The London Recycling Fund, which operated

It supported new infrastructure. As we all know, seed money can often make things happen. Relatively small amounts of money can have an effect.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000044"></a>These amendments are intended to be positive and helpful. They seek to include in the legislation a body that I know has been discussed. In the absence of the parties across London and the Government agreeing a more ambitious&#151;to use the Mayor&#146;s term&#151;move, and as that agreement seems not to be on the agenda, this would be a helpful move forward, whatever we end up with in the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000045"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509116000197"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I always try to get the good news in first; I am happy to take this amendment away and consider it before the next stage. I shall have a look at it with the interested parties to see whether we can reach a solution to meet the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns, but not necessarily through the statutory route. I fully appreciate the delay that has occurred but we shall not be dismissive about the matter.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000046"></a>This fund was announced last July as part of the Government&#146;s package on the review of London&#146;s waste governance. As the noble Baroness said, the aim of the forum is to bring stakeholders together to deliver improved performance on waste minimisation and recycling, promote collaborative action and link waste with other London priorities around climate change, transport and employment. We also announced a London Waste and Recycling Fund to be administered by the forum in support of its work. The size of the contribution to the fund is subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review, but based on current figures, it is expected to be about &#163;19 million in 2008-09. Nobody will be surprised at that figure. The two linked amendments would create a corporate body called the London waste and recycling forum and fund. Its functions would be similar to those proposed by the Government. The main difference is that it would have a statutory basis setting out its functions.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000047"></a>This brief debate is important. We are not convinced of the benefits that a statutory footing for the forum and fund would bring and we have some particular concerns about parts of the amendment. However, I shall not go into that as it would be nitpicking. We agree with the principle. We believe that a non-statutory forum would comprise a lighter touch and be more flexible. When I was on the Back Benches I never believed Ministers who said that if you put a measure in primary legislation it is much less flexible, but it is actually true. In this case, it is important that the interested parties of the London boroughs, the GLA and the Mayor get to discussing things in detail. Hopefully, they can do that quite quickly, and if we can bring something back at the next stage of the Bill, we will seek to do so.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000048"></a>I am not giving a commitment to place the forum and fund on a statutory basis, but the issue needs to be pushed forward a bit faster than it has been hitherto. Maybe the amendment and the Government&#146;s response can facilitate discussions in the very near future. I do not know when the next stage of the Bill will be, but these things have to be

If we miss the deadline, we miss the opportunity. I understand that there is some good will and the initial approaches have already been made. If discussions can be opened up, that will be to the good. So, on that basis, the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

On the basis that I know the Minister does what he says he will do, I will withdraw the amendment.

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000055"></a>The noble Lord said: When I first learnt that the Government were going to review the powers of the Mayor, it seemed to me desirable so to do, as I explained at Second Reading. It also seemed to me that in the area of waste disposal and strategic waste management more powers for the centre in London was a bit of a no-brainer. There are two reasons for that; first, previous policy, and secondly, the performance of London in this area. In terms of recycling, London is the worst region, and in relative terms it is getting worse. It has a huge amount of waste per capita, and it unloads a large amount of that waste to landfill outside the capital. It has a higgledy-piggledy structure of waste disposal authorities in which half of London is covered by a two-tier system and half by a single-tier system. The position of many of the individual London boroughs has been appalling; many are among the bottom performers in the whole of the country. Moreover, London&#146;s performance in this area relative to other north European cities and some well-performing cities in North America is also fairly appalling. Most noble Lords will know those facts.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000056"></a>When the Mayor ran for election last time, on that occasion as a Labour candidate, it was part of his commitment that he would look at establishing a single strategy authority. I may be betraying party processes rather than governmental, but that position was reached in a manifesto that was agreed with the key Ministers in the department of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in what was then the ODPM. What has changed? If anything, London&#146;s waste performance has got worse. Recycling was 4.4 per cent behind the average in England in 2004; it is now 6 per cent behind. Yes, in absolute terms there has been some improvement and there has been a welcome reduction in the past full year in relation to the amount going to landfill. But it is still substantially higher than it was three years ago, and some of the performances by individual London boroughs are still pretty bad. Some boroughs are in the bottom 10 per cent, and some have missed their most recent targets by over10 per cent&#151;including boroughs which were and are controlled by all political parties.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000057"></a>The performance of London overall indicates the need for a new impetus and a new structure. Further, the infrastructure and logistical planning for the transportation of waste across London that is required indicate that a more strategic view is necessary. Indeed, in moving the last amendment, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, recognised that if the forum&#151;the Government&#146;s preferred way forward at the moment&#151;is to work, a more strategic approach is needed and there has to be greater prioritisation of the funding that goes to waste disposal within the capital.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000058"></a>What has changed since the Mayor first proposed this? To be frank, not a lot. If anything, the performance has got worse, and while politically there has been a change of control in a number of Labour boroughs, frankly that will not really make much difference in any call for a reorganisation of the structure of local government. That call tends to be non-partisan, because the current incumbents will defend the existing structure. I do not think that it is any different here.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000059"></a>The other thing that the Minister may argue has changed is that we have had a consultation which, as he puts it, has revealed a range of opinions. But since showing an interest in this area, I have received substantial support from the waste disposal industry and from the environmental bodies&#151;both pressure groups and the industrial environmental bodies. I have already declared an interest in the Environment Agency, which sees great benefit in this area being centralised in London. Further, there is considerable support in the general range of businesses in London for taking a more centralised approach. In the letter distributed by my noble friend, he states that the reason for not going down this road is that London is doing well in relation to landfill. Perhaps, but it is certainly not doing nearly as well as the rest of the country in meeting recycling targets.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000060"></a>A further argument against this proposal is that at three years off, we are fairly close to the first legally binding European target. If we were to change the structure, it would be disruptive and there would be significant transitional costs. I find that a strange argument, because it is essentially about timing. As Sir Nicholas Stern and others have pointed out, it is much better to act sooner rather than later in relation to environmental problems, all of which are linked to the wider problem of climate change. If the structure is wrong, we should change it as early as possible. There may be some disruption costs, but the real targets that we should be worrying about are the second and third targets under the European legislation. In any case, we are going to miss the first. It is important to have in place a structure and delivery mechanism in a central strategic authority that can help to deliver the investment and planning required in order to meet those subsequent targets.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000061"></a>A third argument is hinted at in the Minister&#146;s letter, indicating that there is a bit of an argument between central government and the Mayor over the situation of energy from waste. The Mayor tends to argue that energy from waste could squeeze out recycling. That is an argument about strategy, not  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about delivery. The question of whether we build a significant number of energy-from-waste plants&#151;the pejorative term is &#147;incinerators&#148;&#151;rather than go for recycling away from landfill is one of the second order and can better be approached on a strategic, cross-London basis than individually, borough by borough. The result of leaving this to individual boroughs and the few areas where there are two-tier authorities&#151;there is a multiplicity of organisations, some 16 in all within Greater London&#151;is that inevitably we will end up with sub-optimal investment and logistical movements and confusion over who is actually responsible.</p>
<h5><a name="070509116000184"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000062"></a>In the debate on the last amendment, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said that one of the things that would follow her amendment, which the Minister has agreed to look at again, is public accountability. At the moment, there is no clear public accountability in London for the strategic disposal of waste and the development of waste disposal plans. A single waste disposal authority would solve most of these problems. If the issue is one of timing, perhaps the Minister will consider putting this on to a contingency basis, with the timing to be decided, rather than providing the Mayor with full authority as my amendment proposes. If the issue is one of principle, the Government have the wrong principle here. I am surprised at the opposition among the London boroughs and some in the GLA, because one of the biggest environmental problems facing London is its waste disposal problem&#151;a problem that can be resolved only if we establish a structure, a delivery mechanism, a funding mechanism and an accountability mechanism at the London level. That is what my amendment seeks to achieve. The Minister may argue that there are better ways of achieving that, but unless we give clear, statutory authority for such a development, we will end up missing all the targets, not just the immediate target for recycling and moving away from landfill in London. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000063"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070509116000200"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> As I said on Second Reading, we do not support the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will have been briefed by London Councils, as I have, but sadly my own council&#146;s point of view is that London boroughs should handle the whole question of waste disposal in the way in which they are handling it at the moment. They all work in joint consortia anyway, which seems to work perfectly adequately. The noble Lord mentioned the recycling percentages, but London is an extremely difficult city, and I am not sure that the Mayor would make a better go of increasing the recycling percentages than the London boroughs, which are sitting on top of the situation all the time and are having to make policies and plans to persuade residents to split their rubbish and put it out for recycling. The local emphasis is the one that really matters.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000064"></a>Secondly, unless the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, can produce it, no one has seen any business plan for this. We have no idea what it would cost to bring waste disposal under one management, and we do not know  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether it would be any more business-effective in financial terms than it is with the boroughs doing it themselves. Although recycling is one aspect, cost is certainly another. Unless a plan has been worked out and fully costed, everyone will be extremely sceptical about what is involved. I touched on the fact that local boroughs have an eye on local issues, which is where their eye should be and where the responsibility should lie to ensure that waste disposal policies are carried out.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000065"></a>In broad terms, we will not support the amendment. Even if the Government suddenly agree to it, we will still oppose it. I am sure that others will wish to contribute to the debate but, for the moment, I put on record that we will not support it.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000066"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070509116000201"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I was wondering whether the noble Lord, Lord Harris, whose name has been added to the amendment, wanted to intervene before I spoke.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000067"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070509116000202"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> No.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000068"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070509116000203"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I wanted to hear what the noble Lord had to say. We have just agreed Clause 36 without any debate. Clause 36 is hugely significant in that it changes the way in which waste is to be dealt with by substituting &#147;have regard to&#148; with,</p>
<ul><a name="070509116000181"></a>&#147;act in general conformity with&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070509116000145"></a>the Mayor&#146;s waste management strategy. If used properly, that could lead to a considerable change in the way in which various parties work together. I do not think that this has been taken fully on board in the debate so far. The current Mayor&#146;s briefing dismisses this, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509116000177"></a>&#147;The general conformity clause is a legal minefield and a recipe for deadlock&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509116000146"></a>We have just managed to avoid deadlock in the areas where general conformity has been required until now. The briefing continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509116000178"></a>&#147;It could mean local authorities and the Mayor being continuously locked in judicial reviews, with London council tax payers footing both sides of the legal bill and critical delays in the delivery of sorely needed waste infrastructure and service improvements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509116000147"></a>So says the current Mayor; I not sure whether that is a threat or a promise. The letter circulated by the Minister points this out. Indeed, he refers to the costs and risks of a single waste authority, and I very much agree with what he has said in that letter.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000069"></a>We on these Benches do not say that all is well. Indeed, when the issue first became so very live, I felt that it was particularly important that the boroughs and the Mayor did not behave in a knee-jerk fashion and treat this as a matter of competing powers. The issue is much too important for it to be about who has what power; it should be about what the solutions might be and how one might reach them.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000070"></a>I do believe that the boroughs are addressing the issue. My noble friend Lord Tope, from Sutton, may speak about the new consortium that Sutton, Kingston, Merton and Croydon have just entered into&#151;I do not know; we have not discussed it. I talked to the London borough of Southwark and was  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>struck by the difficulties and uncertainties encountered by potential contractors during the borough&#146;s project for considerable investment and new facilities when the review of the Mayor&#146;s powers started. Its project is now back on track. It has been in communication with both the Mayor and Defra, and has asked the Mayor what would happen to this major new project if a single waste authority were to be set up. The Mayor could say only that he would ask Defra to put fair and equitable arrangements in place. Defra could give no assurance that the borough would not lose out if the site was transferred to the single waste authority. I mention this because so much is going on in different parts of London in this area that if boroughs have to go back to the drawing board an awful lot will be thrown into confusion. There are some very big contracts in the pipeline.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70509-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000071"></a>A couple of months ago, I asked the Mayor how, if there were to be a single waste authority, he would deal with existing long-term contracts. I did not receive a satisfactory answer. He referred to Transport for London having taken over a considerable number of organisations. That is interesting, but I am not sure that it translates to this situation. As I understand it, Mr Livingstone would wish to leave collection to the local authorities and, although they want it, that seems to be the difficult bit. There has been a lot of recent discussion about whether the public will accept fortnightly collections. It is almost a poisoned chalice to leave with the boroughs. It begs the question of what they would do, not just about reduction but about recycling. In parenthesis, I realise that there is a danger in talking about recycling in this debate as if it was a panacea, when we should be talking about reduction in the first instance.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000072"></a>There has been some lobbying for a single waste authority. I have had a handful of letters. They used strangely similar terminology: three or four lines of exactly the same words. Somebody has suggested precisely what they might say.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000073"></a>The Mayor could and should do some things whether or not there is a single waste authority. The main thing he can do is raise capital. A single waste authority would not change the profile of London&#146;s housing stock&#151;a particular difficulty when one is talking about recycling or collections from flats. A single waste authority without recycling would not immediately mean achieving targets.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000074"></a>The Mayor may not have much power to deal with attitudes to waste, but he is in a good position to influence them. Waste minimisation is largely a cultural issue, as is recycling. The Mayor can provide facilities which help the boroughs without having a single waste authority. I have mentioned the recycling fund; there is also London Remade. The Mayor should be building on these. He must counter stories about materials being shipped around the world, which deter people from recycling. He must say that he is providing an alternative way for the boroughs to join in with dealing with materials, and focus on providing materials reclamation facilities so that materials become raw materials for new products.

<p><a name="070509116000075"></a>Although I started by saying that we should see this as an important issue which needs addressing in itself and not as a power struggle, it has come to be seen as one.

That must be a substantial understatement. London&#146;s performance on waste disposal is pretty appalling. It is the only major metropolitan region in England where waste disposal is not managed and co-ordinated at city level. I wonder whether that is why the performance is so poor. Instead, London has 16 waste disposal authorities.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that one of the difficulties about the proposal is that the authorities have a number of big contracts in the pipeline and negotiations pending. That is precisely why I am extremely concerned about the current situation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000078"></a>I am sure that I am not telling tales out of school, but I recall that when I was a borough leader&#151;and I discussed this with my contemporaries in borough leadership positions at the time and have done so since with borough leaders&#151;joint waste disposal authorities were used as a convenient depositing ground for the members of the local authority who one most wanted to find things to do outside the town hall or the civic centre. They were very happy there. They paid themselves substantial allowances and went off and did things which nobody else was interested in; nobody knew what they were up to, and periodically a very large bill arrived for the local authorities concerned.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000079"></a>I discovered that that was not confined to the particular parts of north London that I was involved with and which I knew about, but it seemed to be something which was not uncommon. I am assured that the situation has changed. I am assured by members of joint waste disposal authorities that they are of the highest calibre and are not the people whom their borough leaders and other colleagues want to get off the premises. Of course I take that at face value.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000080"></a>I wonder about the capacity of 16 different waste disposal authorities to enter into long-term, detailed and complex contracts. Past history has not been good. I just wonder where this major change in capacity has occurred to ensure that the negotiations will be of the best possible arrangements. I find it difficult to see how the proposals in the Bill will be able to deliver sustainable and co-ordinated waste management in London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000081"></a>Actually, the Government propose very little indeed. There is the change in the arrangements referred to by the noble Baroness regarding general conformity, and there will be very important voluntary arrangements and talking shops. I am not sure what they amount to. Yet, we are told a step change is needed to ensure that London meets the European landfill directive targets. The Government are concerned that short-term landfill directive targets will not be met unless something substantial happens. </p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000082"></a>The real risks are in failing to deliver in the longer term. London faces cumulative fines of &#163;1.7 billion. In 2010, fines will be &#163;35 million; in 2013, they will be &#163;139 million; and in 2020, they will be &#163;232 million. I want to know&#151;and I will listen with great interest to the response the Minister gives at the end of this discussion&#151;where the Government think this step change will come from. I do not see that the proposals in the Bill are anything like sufficient to deliver that step change.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000083"></a>While on the subject of step change, it would be interesting to know, again from the Minister, what has caused the step change in Defra&#146;s position? Not that long ago Defra thought that a single waste disposal authority for London was a good idea. I do not think the arguments have changed, but something has. It would be interesting to hear what my noble friend thinks has changed to convince the department that the fairly modest proposals in the Bill will be sufficient to deliver the major change in waste disposal that London needs.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000084"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said that London was a very different city, or maybe it was a difficult city&#151;I cannot remember her phraseology.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000085"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070509116000205"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Different.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000086"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070509116000206"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I agree with the noble Baroness that London is a very different city. It is the greatest city in the world, and that is fine. But I wonder why it is therefore assumed that some of the recycling targets are going to be so impossible to meet. I note that in Europe, Hamburg recycles 57 per cent of its waste; Copenhagen 54 per cent; Munich42 per cent, and Milan 39 per cent. In the United States, San Francisco&#151;a very different city&#151;recycles 50 per cent, and Seattle 58 per cent. The figures are possible. It can and should be done. Again, I wonder why we are being so modest in our proposals.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000087"></a>The present arrangements are not accountable to Londoners. Because there are so many different waste authorities and the arrangements in some cases are baroque and complicated, they are not transparent bodies. Not only is there administrative incoherence and perhaps a limited capacity so far as the 16 waste disposal authorities are concerned, but there is also a gap in democratic accountability. The implementation of any waste strategy will require a major effort across a number of levels of activity in London, and that is where a single authority under the control of the Mayor and working with his functional bodies will play a critical role. The necessary skills and experience have to be brought together, along with the power to ensure that the necessary changes are made.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC218"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000088"></a>I am conscious that one of the implications will be to look at how freight movements are dealt with in the city. Indeed, I spent a couple of hours this morning talking about the city&#146;s freight policy with representatives at Transport for London. There is enormous potential for energy saving strategies in this area. But I wonder whether those changes will happen if we continue with a system of 16 waste disposal authorities and do not take up the opportunity provided by this amendment.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000089"></a>I have mentioned the problems of capacity. Partnerships UK, a body formed in 2000 by the Treasury, is all about supporting the delivery of high-quality public services and the efficient use of public assets. It has responded to a consultation by highlighting the issues related to the fragmented nature of management and disposal responsibilities and saying that that results in relatively small package and contract sizes that reduce access to economies of scale in plant, equipment and financing structures, produces multiple public sector counterparties to contracts, thus increasing their complexity and perceived risk, with a corresponding impact on market appetite and the price offered. There is also a lack of central expertise or critical mass of skills and experience. Those are the challenges we face if we do not support the amendment of my noble friend.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000090"></a>I want to make a final point about hazardous waste. At the moment, some 10,500 tonnes of hazardous waste are produced by London householders, but only 200 tonnes are collected by the Hazardous Household Waste Collection and Disposal Service administered by the Corporation of London on behalf of the London boroughs. That is the extent to which waste disposal collaboration between 16 waste disposal authorities works at the moment, so I put it again to my noble friend who will be replying: where is the step change going to be made in order to ensure that we see the improvement in performance that is necessary?</p>

<p><a name="070509116000091"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070509116000207"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Could I ask the noble Lord to comment on something said in the other place by Nick Raynsford, the person who brought in the Mayor and the Greater London Authority? He made a remark that noble Lords on this side of the Committee certainly agree with&#151;that the whole architecture of the Greater London Authority was to be strategic. There is nothing strategic in what is being proposed here. This is practical, hands-on work that ought to be carried out by the local boroughs. This is not a strategic overview, but the Mayor negotiating contracts and getting involved in the day-to-day work of the London boroughs. It would be an enormous change in terms of what the Greater London Authority was set up to do. If we are not careful we will be in danger of drifting into a position where the Mayor of London and the authority no longer play a strategic role but remorselessly move on towards becoming an authority very similar to the Greater London Council. The noble Lord may think that would be a really good idea, but I think the rest of us would say that it is a really rotten idea. We need the Mayor to remain strategic and leave the boroughs to do what they are meant to do. Perhaps the noble Lord might like to comment.</p>

My right honourable friend Nick Raynsford is an admirable man. He is right to say that the architecture of the original GLA Bill was designed to create a strategic authority. One of the biggest strategic challenges facing London at the moment is what to do about its waste. The fact that London&#146;s waste is rising faster than that in many other parts of the country and that our performance on disposal is the worst in the country comprise major strategic challenges.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000093"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, became excited and appalled at the idea that the Mayor of London might be engaged in all sorts of contract negotiations, which brought back memories of the Greater London Council. I am no fan of the old days of the Greater London Council and I am certainly not suggesting that we should go back to them, but my noble friend&#146;s amendment is concerned with creating an additional functional body. That is the same as a functional body which currently delivers transport. The major element of the work of Transport for London comprises negotiating contracts with bus companies. Those contracts may be long term and complicated. In the past they were not well handled but now they are much better handled. Except in the subject of the contracts, what is proposed is no different from the situation where the Mayor has responsibility for an agency which delivers transport for London. As I say, waste disposal is one of the greatest strategic challenges facing London at present, which is why I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000094"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070509116000209"></a>Lord Warner:</b> I want to speak briefly in support of this amendment. I say &#147;briefly&#148; because, as the Committee will be pleased to hear, I suspect that my voice will not hold up for too long.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000095"></a>My noble friends Lord Whitty and Lord Harris of Haringey put the case clearly and fairly, and the international comparisons are very telling. We must hold on to the fact that London is going in the wrong direction in this area. It is not yet going in the right direction. It is certainly not going in the right direction at the pace that is needed to deal with the problems that it faces today, tomorrow and the day after.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000096"></a>At Second Reading I raised my concerns about the performance of the London boroughs on waste management. Fairly predictably, this irritated a number of the London boroughs, including Southwark where I live. I am not altogether sure whether my bins will still be collected. Predictably, Southwark sent a great deal of material explaining what it is doing and describing the new facilities that it is putting in place. That is all very admirable and I have no quarrel whatever with it. However, much of the material which has been sent to me does not look very strategic but, rather, a late-in-the-day response to an impending set of deadlines and targets triggered by the 2010 target and deadline. Like my noble friend Lord Whitty, I suggest that target is likely to be missed anyway. We have to keep our eye on the longer-term targets and on whether we will attain them if we carry on with the present arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000097"></a>I received a letter from my noble friend Lady Andrews following my intervention at Second Reading arguing against the Mayor&#146;s proposals for a London-wide body. Although my noble friend&#146;s letter was, as usual, extremely eloquent, it did not really provide the figures or the cost-benefit analysis which I sought at Second Reading in order to assess whether the Mayor&#146;s proposal was right or wrong. This is not about a power struggle. Rather, I seek an analysis of the options against risk, which we do not have. We have costings on a particular set of assumptions about a particular proposal but we do not have a cost-benefit risk analysis which shows that a pan-London body would be wrong given what has to be achieved in London in the longer term.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000098"></a>Strangely, I also received a letter from London Councils on 3 May, which argued for leaving things with the borough. It had a rather strange concluding paragraph, including:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070509116000179"></a>&#147;We see the Government&#146;s proposal for a London Waste and Recycling Fund as the opportunity to address the need for a new waste disposal infrastructure in London on a strategic basis&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070509116000148"></a>I suggest that this is hardly a vote of confidence in the present arrangements, and rather a strange way of trying to justify them. It suggests, if they mean what they say, that there is some degree of doubt among the London boroughs over the strategic capability to cope with the present waste disposal. What they see as a sound strategic infrastructure to cope with the challenges of waste management in London is not clear to me. They seem to come quite close to supporting the Mayor&#146;s analysis. The difference seems to be one of scale and timing.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000099"></a>Like my noble friends, I am quite unpersuaded that the current mish-mash of 16 separate bodies and consortia is the right strategic approach for London. That is an average of two boroughs joining together to let quite complex contracts. We have been through this in other parts of the public services, where bodies too small to drive big, powerful contracts with powerful suppliers of services simply cannot do the best, most strategic deals. We must look at whether that is a sound way for us to proceed.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000100"></a>I wish to correct the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. As I heard her, she said that all the boroughs are in consortia. That is simply untrue: some of them are acting on a single-borough basis. I agree with her that the single body should be costed, but so also should the present mish-mash of bodies. They should be compared against the challenge London faces, and a risk analysis should be done. We need some assurance that there is a costed set of proposals to ensure that the current mish-mash will deliver the bacon on the challenges facing London. I have not seen those figures or analysis, so I remain unconvinced that we are heading in the right direction on this.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000101"></a>The amendment of my noble friend Lord Whitty, supported by other noble Lords, hardly seems rash. In moving the amendment, my noble friend has already said that one can look at some of the detail, which I support. One understands that one does not wish to  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC221"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disrupt the current patterns of work. Clearly, there must be proper transitional arrangements in moving from what we have now to a new body, but that is what good public management is about when moving from one system to another. If that is the right approach to meet the challenges that London faces, as it seems to be, it is not an argument against moving in the direction that the amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000102"></a>To sum up: given all the risks attached&#151;which have been well set out&#151;we have not seen the kind of analysis which supports carrying on with the present consortia. It looks like people slightly deluding themselves about the challenges that London faces and hoping that it will all be all right on the night as we bumble along with what can be described only as a mish-mash of bodies and consortia. They are really are a bit of a disgrace for a major capital city.</p>

<p><a name="070509116000103"></a><b><a name="70509-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070509116000210"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I cannot resist the temptation to respond. At the beginning of the Committee, I declared that I am a London borough councillor. I suppose now that I should confess, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, already well knows, that I was leader of a London borough council for 13 years. For all of the past 20 years, my council has been in the top two or three London borough councils for the rate of recycling, and it remains in that position. Perhaps I should also say to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, that I have never been a member of a joint waste authority. I have never consigned anyone to the outer darkness of a joint waste authority. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, my authority is shortly to enter into such an arrangement, so perhaps we will then have the opportunity.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000104"></a>This issue has been the subject of intense debate in London for many months. Unlike most of my borough colleagues, I started the debate with a genuinely open mind. As is often the case, there are good, sound arguments both ways and I was certainly willing to be persuaded. As I have listened to and taken part in the arguments over those months, I have become less and less convinced that a single waste authority is the answer to the problem which we all acknowledge exists.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000105"></a>Noble Lords supporting the amendment have quoted extensively from the Mayor&#146;s briefing, which, understandably, supplies figures that are no doubt accurate, but are there for the sole purpose of supporting the argument. Let me quote from the London Councils briefing which counters the arguments, but is, nevertheless, no less valid. I take issue with what several noble Lords have said, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Warner, about what is nowadays termed the direction of travel.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000106"></a>London&#146;s recycling rate has more than doubled since 2001. London is expecting to achieve a combined recycling rate of 24 per cent for 2006, which is a 15 per cent increase on the previous year. We have had comparisons with regions. I do not think that Greater London compares properly with any other region in this country, all of which contain significant rural areas and are of a quite different composition. Nevertheless, London is the second best region in the country for diverting waste from landfill  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC222"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and so on. We can all continue to quote figures that support our arguments. I can make international comparisons, not with much smaller cities than London, but with, for example, New York, which has a recycling rate that is considerably less. Tokyo&#146;s recycling rate is only equal to London. Paris is the only broadly comparable European city and, again, it is worse than London.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000107"></a>We can use figures. We can prove our cases with all the figures we want, but we need to try, as dispassionately as possible, to look for the solutions. In finding solutions, we have to understand the problem exactly. Part of the problem is the nature of the boroughs, the demography, the number of flat dwellers and so on, but I have always believed that the fundamental difference is one of political will and political priority. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was right that it is not a party issue. It is about the political priorities that that local authority has had, which is why some boroughs have been very much better and other boroughs with different priorities have been very much worse.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000108"></a>That is one of the reasons why the situation is now changing. London borough councils have considerable financial incentives and penalties to have the political will and give it the political priority, which is why there is and will continue to be a step change&#151;an expression which has been used&#151;in London. The issue of waste minimisation has gone considerably up the political agenda right across London. I believe that, contrary to what some noble Lords have said, the direction of travel is getting significantly better and will continue to do so. If we look to solutions, if we are to challenge that direction of travel, we must have very good reasons for doing so.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000109"></a>I have come to the conclusion that establishing a single waste authority, where the debate has been very much about control, is not the solution. I still do not understand exactly what a single waste authority will do to increase waste minimisation&#151;if that is the right expression&#151;in the London boroughs, particularly as they will retain responsibility for recycling and, quite rightly, responsibility for waste collection. One of the advantages in London is that we have combined collection and disposal. Separating them would be a retrograde step that would considerably erode it.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000110"></a>The Mayor does not want waste collection&#151;very sensibly, in my view&#151;and no London borough would let him have it. They would fight to the death for that. Anyone involved in local politics knows that if you mess up refuse collection you are out at the next election, and that will always remain the case. The argument for a single waste authority is at best unproven and to impose substantial costs and disruption on boroughs that do not want it would be a retrograde move. We should welcome the step change that is happening in London and encourage it to progress. The boroughs and the Mayor should work together on the implementation of the Mayor&#146;s waste strategy in order to tackle an issue that we all acknowledge is a very real and important one in London. I cannot support the amendment.</p>

It is on a London issue as well, so it is a bit tricky because I have always kept away from those. I have a wonderfully long response here which I intend to make because it is important to put the Government&#146;s view on the record. First, however, I shall use my notes before I move on to the speech.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000112"></a>I want to make one or two points in response to what has been said by my noble friends Lord Harris and Lord Whitty. The Government have never supported a single waste disposal authority for London. I came to this some weeks ago with a neutral view, but soon came to realise that it is Defra&#146;s baby and something of a problem. We undertook a public consultation on a range of options without stating a preference. It was clear from that consultation that no single option emerged as a clear preference. We also commissioned research into a number of the options. A single waste disposal authority came out as one of the worst choices for managing London&#146;s waste.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000113"></a>That brings me to the first point I want to answer. My noble friend Lord Warner asked about the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. The Government commissioned KPMG to look at the cost benefits and risks in a number of options for London&#146;s waste. The report is available on Defra&#146;s website. It found that the Mayor&#146;s proposal was one of the worst options. The report formed part of the input into the Government&#146;s decision. Work has been done on this issue and it is all there in the public domain.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000114"></a>Many boroughs work together on a sub-regional basis. A quick count shows that around two-thirds of the London boroughs are in consortia, and only one operates completely on its own. The others undertake joint work in the area of waste disposal. Indeed, some London boroughs are among the largest authorities in the country, so it is not as if we are dealing with minnows. I was curious about how the local authority deals with my own rubbish&#151;that is, the rubbish I do not take to its very well run recycling site. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, pointed out, there is no question that there have been major changes in recent years, and that big improvements have been made. A London Councils briefing shows that the city is doing well in comparison with some cities. It is fair to look at London with comparable cities such as Paris, Tokyo and New York, but it is not fair to compare it with others that are not comparable.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000115"></a>While major improvements are needed, performance is going up&#151;it is moving in the right direction. A single authority would not be likely to improve recycling rates because that responsibility would remain with the boroughs. We therefore have some serious problems with the amendment.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000116"></a>We are committed to all the targets of the landfill directive, but the earlier targets for 2010 and 2013 are likely to be harder to achieve because of the large improvement needed over a short timeframe. It is not a question of focusing on one to the exclusive ignorance of the other. We do not accept that poor performance. I am very careful about trying to

Waste disposal and recycling are politically sexy today; they were not 10 years ago. There has been a major change. It is tied in with the agenda of environment and climate change; these things come together. I suspect that there are much more senior councillors taking an interest in these authorities than was the case in the past. I have no doubt that that will also change in the future as the penny drops; there is no question about that.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000117"></a>I hope that I will not repeat some of the points that have already been made. The new clause introduces a requirement on London waste collection and disposal authorities to act in general conformity with the Mayor&#146;s municipal waste strategy, in Clause 36. Under Section 353 of the Greater London Authority Act, the Mayor of London is required to prepare and publish a document known as the municipal waste management strategy, which sets the strategic direction for London&#146;s waste activities. Section 355 requires waste collection authorities and waste disposal authorities in London to have regard to the Mayor&#146;s strategy. Clause 36, in amending that, as has been referred to, requires the authorities to act in general conformity with the Mayor&#146;s municipal waste management strategy when exercising any of their waste functions. That duty has an effect, to the extent that it does not impose additional excessive costs or require an authority to breach or terminate a contract, which would not be good value for money. The clause includes a power for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the definition of general conformity and excessive additional costs. The announcement of the Mayor&#146;s powers to require waste authorities to deliver services in general conformity with the strategy, along with his existing power of direction, will help to ensure that the strategic vision that the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the ground. That is very important.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000118"></a>Clause 37 strengthens the requirements for authorities to inform the Mayor before putting new waste contracts out to tender and updates the Act following changes to the public procurement legislation. Under existing legislation, it is not always necessary for London waste authorities to inform the Mayor before putting waste contracts out to tender. Clause 37 introduces a new duty on authorities so that where they are not obliged either to send the European Commission a first information notice of their intention to tender a waste contract, or publish on the authorities&#146; buyers profile, but are obliged to send a second information notice, they must inform the Mayor of their intention to tender. They are required to notify the Mayor 108 days before issuing the second information notice. The amendments will ensure that the Mayor is informed of all important waste tenders in advance.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000119"></a>Strengthening the requirement for the boroughs to inform the Mayor if they are going to tender a contract will ensure that the Mayor has a role in procurement decisions and will ensure that the vision  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC225"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and policy set out by the Mayor are implemented locally in the way in which waste authorities deliver certain functions. That is part of the background. In other words, this new clause must not be seen in isolation as a new idea for an extra power or function for the Mayor. It has to be looked at in the context of the changes that are being made in the Bill, which have been approved.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000120"></a>On the amendment, after decades of relying on burying waste in large holes in the ground we are in the process of a fundamental shift in how we manage waste in the UK. To reduce the environmental impact of our waste and especially to take account of climate change impacts, we have got to reduce the amount that we sent to landfill, increase recycling and invest in new facilities to deal with our waste in more sustainable ways. We are at a critical stage in delivering this step change in how we manage waste in the UK.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000121"></a>We face our first EU target to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste we send to landfill in just three years&#146; time, which poses a real challenge for local authorities. I am pleased to say that early indications show that London is responding positively to this challenge. Figures for 2005-06 show that as a region it is second to only the West Midlands in terms of reducing the amount of waste going to landfill.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000122"></a>Recycling is also very important in reducing environmental impacts, especially its role in reducing the &#147;carbon footprint&#148;. London&#146;s recycling has doubled since 2001, but performance is mixed within the capital. While two London boroughs, Sutton and Bexley, have been awarded beacon status on waste and recycling, Tower Hamlets is at the bottom of the national recycling league table. Many London boroughs need to make major and substantial improvements. The Government are working with them to make sure that this happens and are prepared to use formal intervention if necessary.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000123"></a>At Second Reading, a number of concerns about London&#146;s waste performance were raised. A number of noble Lords expressed the view that a single waste disposal authority would provide a more effective and efficient means of addressing the problems. We now have before us an amendment that, while it differs slightly in substance from the amendment tabled in the Commons, is aimed at a similar outcome. I suspect that the amendment we will get on Report will be slightly different because one adjusts as we go through the scrutiny of legislation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000124"></a>The arguments put forward in favour of a single waste disposal authority are based on the premise that London will fail to make the necessary step change towards sustainable waste management, including achieving the landfill diversion targets and that a single waste disposal authority would improve performance across the capital and deliver efficiencies.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000125"></a>However, the evidence does not support this view. London, like every region of England, needs to boost recycling and reduce waste to landfill, but recent data on landfill diversion indicates that London is making progress&#151;for example, a new mechanical biological treatment plant recently opened in Newham. In only three years we face the first of the EU landfill targets  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC226"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and significant fines if they are missed. The creation of a single waste disposal authority for London at this important stage would be incredibly disruptive to the efforts that are going on. The efforts and resources need to be focused, not on the establishment of a new authority and issues such as the transfer of staff and assets, but, more importantly, on working to ensure that the necessary waste infrastructure is in place.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000126"></a>Proponents of the single waste disposal authority have also argued that it is needed to improve London&#146;s recycling rate. We agree that some London authorities need to do much better on recycling. However, it is important to make clear that a single waste disposal authority would not have responsibility for recycling. That point has to be answered by the proponents of a single authority. Under the amendments tabled, waste collection would remain a borough responsibility, so the single waste disposal authority would have little impact on recycling rates in the capital. Furthermore, the proposed amendments would split control over collection, recycling and disposal responsibilities between two different political bodies, which could make it more difficult to manage waste in an integrated manner. For example, if the Mayor wanted to introduce anaerobic digestion for the disposal of London&#146;s waste he would need specific collection arrangements&#151;that is, separate collection of food waste&#151;but he would not have control over collection arrangements.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000127"></a>The economies of scale that could be gained from managing London&#146;s waste disposal contracts at a larger scale are minimal. The Government and the GLA are agreed that it would not be desirable or practical to have a single waste disposal contractfor all of London&#151;the city is too big&#151;and most authorities in London are already working together in sub-regional groups. We have four statutory joint waste disposal authorities encompassing 21 boroughs&#151;two-thirds of boroughs. Many of the remaining boroughs are already working together to identify and procure joint waste disposal solutions. The South London Waste Partnership is a good example of this, bringing together the boroughs of Merton, Croydon, Kingston and Sutton.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000128"></a>Our analysis suggests that any further efficiency gains from a single waste disposal authority would be small, and could be outweighed by higher administrative costs. Waste and recycling are a priority, as I have said, and we welcome the opportunity to debate how we can improve arrangements in London. However, having examined the detailed evidence following a consultation, the Government have come to the view that a single waste disposal authority would not deliver improvements in waste management or cost efficiencies. A single waste disposal authority could result in extra costs to the Government and to the boroughs, and could put our landfill diversion targets at risk. If the UK failed to meet its targets, the resulting fines would be likely to be passed to London&#146;s council tax bills.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000129"></a>This is a crucial time for waste management in London, as it is for the rest of the UK. The fundamental change that the amendment would make  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC227"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the governance structures for the capital&#146;s waste would threaten the good progress which the latest figures show London is making, and would divert attention and resources, putting at risk our performance and our achievement of our EU targets. We do not want to be complacent about the scale of the challenge ahead and the further progress needed on landfill diversion. Significantly changing the governance structures of London&#146;s waste at this important time would undermine and delay the urgent work that we need to do. Waste services are best operated at local level. Efforts and resources should be focused on improving diversion and recycling performances within the current structures, which can fully reflect local needs and circumstances. </p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000130"></a>One size does not fit all; that is the essence of local government in many ways. Waste collection is, as the noble Lord said, fundamentally a local government issue. Some areas are already beating their targets for household waste recycling and composting. As has been said, the London borough of Bexley has reached 37.7 per cent. Its revised target was 30 per cent. I shall give a few plugs to other boroughs that have succeeded. Hillingdon, which is a member of a consortium, has reached 27.7 per cent. Its target was 21 per cent. Bromley, which had a target of 21 per cent, achieved 27.3 per cent. These targets are all low compared with the recycling targets of 50 per cent that have been quoted, but the fact is that these boroughs are exceeding their current targets. The North London Waste Authority had a target of18 per cent, but reached 20.9 per cent. Haringey had a target of 18 per cent, and achieved 19.2 per cent. There is movement, although we know that some boroughs have far to go.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000131"></a>Time is short, and I am coming to the end of my remarks. The Government&#146;s proposals to enhance the Mayor&#146;s powers, along with his existing power of direction, will help to ensure that the strategic vision which the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the ground. Taken in the round, the changes made by the Bill mean that local authorities will have to pay greater regard to the Mayor&#146;s strategic plans, and we think that they are the way forward. The massive disruption that would be caused by accepting the amendment would be counterproductive. As I said in response to the first intervention from one of my noble friends, the cost-benefits and risks for a number of options for London&#146;s waste were considered in a report by KPMG, which is on the website. The report found that the proposal that is implicit in the amendment was one of the worst options. One cannot say better than that. It is a bad option in terms of money, collection and recycling, and a very bad option if we are to meet our targets within three years. I ask my noble friend to think again about pushing this amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>announced policy, was two years ago, or even more recently. I could argue with him that the basis of the KPMG report, which I have at least glanced at, seems to differ substantially from earlier analyses that were made to Defra and the GLA on the possibility of efficiencies in waste disposal through contracting and through more efficient regulation, and for the driver that it would produce in relation to better collection and recycling methods in the boroughs. I could certainly argue with him on some of the statistics, and probably will.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000133"></a>Everyone has assumed and stated that we need a step change. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, has sort of implied that we already have one. I do not think that the figures bear that out. We have doubled recycling, but still 64 per cent of waste goes to landfill. It is way off target. We have improved recycling levels in a number of boroughs. I tried to obtain the latest information on what actually happened in 2006-07. I could not get it for all the boroughs, but six out of the seven boroughs for which it was available showed a very small improvement, a slow down in improvement, and one borough showed a significant retrogressive move. So I do not think that we have achieved the step change.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000134"></a>The question is how do we achieve the step change to meet the 2010 and 2013 targets or get anywhere near them, let alone the longer-term ones. Most Members of the Committee who have participated in the debate suggest that some improvement is needed in the structure. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in moving an earlier amendment, indicated that we need a better strategy, a better allocation of funds and a better approach to how we pay for infrastructure and innovation in this area.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000135"></a>I am surprised that KPMG reached the conclusions that it did. When you have 16&#151;shortly to be reduced to 12, as I understand the south-west London arrangement&#151;different waste authorities, there must be some economies of scale in going larger than that, and at least approaching the contracting arrangements in a more coherent and systematic way. That is, indeed, what earlier studies concluded.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000136"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, I think was commending the new south-west arrangements, as the Minister appeared to be. That contradicts the rest of his opposition to having a two-tier authority in London and separating out disposal and collection. If memory serves, about 20 years ago we were talking about a new authority within south-west London, which has now been achieved. I am very pleased that it has been. Would it not be much better if we could achieve that across the whole of London?</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000137"></a>The argument for a two-tier authority seems to apply quite effectively in the areas where the Government are not proposing to do anything about it; namely, in the county and district areas. It is an entirely different issue where waste is not dealt with within an individual borough area; people are driving their own waste. The waste disposal companies and the waste disposal authorities are moving waste across borough boundaries the whole time. The new facilities being developed have to be developed and justified on the basis that they serve more than one  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>borough and more than one waste disposal area. There is a huge outflow of waste from London into its neighbouring counties, which has to be dealt with by those counties on an authority by authority basis. All of that leads to inefficiency. That does not, I admit, prove that if you put a new, publicly accountable, statutorily based authority in there that that would, de facto, improve the situation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000138"></a>Something needs to be done. The cost of establishing that seems likely to be less than the efficiencies gained by so doing. Nevertheless, I agree with my noble friend Lord Warner that these things need to be looked at. I do not think that KPMG goes far enough. However, I make the point that if, as we go further down this road, those step changes have not been achieved by 2010 and 2013, and we are maintaining the present structure of delivery and the present rather nebulous arrangements for the forum proposed by the Government, hopefully enhanced slightly by the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, we will have no statutory base for actually rectifying the situation.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000139"></a>I said just now that we only got around to creating a south-west London authority in the past few months, whereas it had been discussed&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Tope, will agree with me&#151;for the past 20 years. If we have no statutory authority, no ability to use this legislation&#151;which is the most important legislation since we established the GLA&#151;and we do not use this to at least provide on a contingency basis the ability to establish an  


<notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC230"></a><b>9 May 2007 : Column GC230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>alternative structure, our ability to meet the later targets will be severely damaged.</p>

<a name="70509-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070509116000140"></a>So if the Minister is prepared to accept neither the amendment in this form nor the arguments that the Mayor should be able to trigger a single London authority, in conjunction and co-operation with the boroughs&#151;we do not have a statutory base for creating such an authority&#151;we will have missed the boat. The proposal includes a majority of representatives of the boroughs, which, as the Minister has said, will no longer be those on which the noble Lord, Lord Harris, used to dump environmental and waste management concerns, but those who are interested in them. I therefore argue that if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, he needs a plan B. Plan A&#151;leaving it to the boroughs and the present structure&#151;is frankly not working. I, for one, have no faith in its ability to continue to work. This legislation should have at least the possibility of a plan B, and I ask the Minister to consider that. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07050991000014"></a>For major evaluations, members of the independent committee will chair the relevant steering group and will have full responsibility for approving and releasing final reports for publication. This will provide a built-in challenge function and an assurance that evaluation standards have been met.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07050991000015"></a>The chair of the IACDI will write annually, through a published letter to me, providing an overview of lessons learned and advice on how evaluation can be further improved. I will then set out the action that we propose to take in response.</p>

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07050991000016"></a>To ensure full independence and transparency, the chair and the six members of the committee will be appointed under Nolan procedures. The selection process will look for respected experts on international development and evaluation, both from the UK and developing countries. Members will be chosen by the chair of the IACDI to avoid any conflicts of interest. The minutes of all IACDI meetings will be published.</p>

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07050991000017"></a>I have discussed with the National Audit Office how it can assist, given its role in providing an independent assurance of our work. I am pleased to say that it has agreed to carry out a review of DfID&#146;s performance on evaluation and to repeat that every three to four years.</p>

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07050991000018"></a>The NAO review will complement the work of the IACDI and will focus more broadly on performance management systems across DfID. IACDI, on the other hand, will get directly involved in the strategy and work plans for evaluation and in ensuring that the recommendations from evaluation work are followed up. I will also invite the National Audit Office to participate in the work of IACDI so that it can draw on this in its own auditing programme.</p>

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07050991000019"></a>The creation of IACDI will be an important step forward in assuring all of us that UK development assistance is making a difference. But I also intend to continue to seek improvements in the accountability and scrutiny of development assistance internationally. DfID is actively exploring opportunities for international collaboration with partner Governments and other donors. In the longer term I hope that we can work towards an international approach that can enhance

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07050991000022"></a>Following the successful restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland, I am pleased to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with Ireland.</p>

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07050991000023"></a>This treaty reaffirms both Governments' commitment to protect, support and, where appropriate, implement the provisions of the Belfast agreement, subject to the alterations to the operation of the institutions agreed at St Andrews.

<a name="70509-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07050991000024"></a>This agreement was laid before Parliament as a Command Paper (Cm 7078) on Wednesday, 18 April. The tenets of the agreement have been considered by Parliament during the passage of the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 and, following the successful restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland on 8 May, the Government consider it appropriate to truncate the standard 21-day laying period under the Ponsonby rule to ensure that the agreement can be brought into force as soon as possible. This will provide swift formal clarity to the agreed alterations to the arrangements and institutions established by the Belfast agreement of 1998.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07050991000025"></a>Copies of the agreement and its associated Explanatory Memorandum have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and distributed to members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.</p>

By virtue of Section 1 of the CourtsAct 2003, he is obliged to ensure that there is an effective and efficient courts system and that appropriate services are provided. The Government believe that, as a matter of general policy, prison should be reserved for serious and dangerous offenders and that others are better punished in the community. But they do not seek to influence individual sentences, and nor will they under the new machinery of government arrangements.</p>

From the views expressed, it became clear that the cause of this lack of clarity was the existing automatic right of prisoners to 50 per cent remission, rather than any mitigating factors taken into account by the judiciary in considering individual cases.</p>

Dangerous violent and sexual offenders could, if necessary, be detained indefinitely, while those committing other specified offences could be detained until the end of their prison sentence. For all other offenders, the court would set a clearly defined custodial part of the sentence, which the offender

On the first occasion, in June 2001, FSNI voluntarily suspended accreditation for the physical methods section in the laboratory. Physical methods do glass and paint comparisons. The suspension was as a result of non-adherence to the documented quality system within that area. No other areas were suspended at that time, and UKAS accreditation for physical methods was reinstated in March 2002.</p>

<a name="70509w0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_154"></a><a name="070509105000232"></a>As accreditation is not a pre-requisite to practice as a forensic science provider, there was no effect on the work done by that section during suspension.</p>

<a name="70509w0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_155"></a><a name="070509105000233"></a>In May 2002, FSNI had the testing aspect of accreditation suspended following a UKAS inspection. Accreditation for calibration was not suspended. This was as a result of a number of quality management related issues, including using the UKAS logo on reports for physical methods cases during the time that accreditation was suspended. The process of re-accreditation began in December 2004, when those sections put forward for accreditation were successful. Full accreditation was completed in April 2006.</p>

<a name="70509w0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_235"></a><a name="070509105000329"></a>The department is supporting the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. We are, jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members, funding two NCRI prostate cancer research collaborative; the department is funding half the total &#163;7.4 million cost. Following a review of progress by an international expert panel, the department, Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council have agreed to provide a further three years&#146; funding of &#163;3.9 million.</p>

<a name="70509w0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_236"></a><a name="070509105000330"></a>The research undertaken by the collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer and has already generated the groundbreaking discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. This discovery not only provides the potential to identify those at risk of developing the disease but for the first time allows prediction of how aggressive the cancer will be. Research is under way to turn this into a diagnostic test so that we can identify patients whose prostate cancers are aggressive and urgently need treatment.</p>

<a name="70509w0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_237"></a><a name="070509105000331"></a>It is important to note that, for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives, effective treatments for the disease detected are essential. That is why the department is funding a &#163;20 million trial of treatments for prostate-specific antigen screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial).</p>

It is too soon to assess the impact and success of the THET project; the first annual report is due later this year.

All non-salary support to key Palestinian Authority ministries is run by the World Bank under window 1 of the TIM, following World Bank procurement guidelines. The UK monitors the procurement process on a monthly basis and has provided a procurement expert to the office of the president to ensure transparency. Humanitarian payments under window 2 of the TIM are contracted and paid for directly by the European Commission (EC) and meet UK agreed EC guidelines. The UK was closely involved in the design of the social allowance element under window 3 of the TIM, ensuring it had satisfactory checks and balances in place. This includes tracking each and every payment and conducting terrorist checks on individuals receiving payment. UK officials also conduct regular meetings with the EC to ensure its guidelines are being followed. A review of the TIM will take place this month that will include an assessment on the transparency of the TIM.</p>

Economic hardship and unemployment contribute to the Palestinians&#146; frustration and make a comprehensive settlement more difficult to achieve.
